### [1] [DrivingScene: A Multi-Task Online Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting Method for Dynamic Driving Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24734)
*Qirui Hou,Wenzhang Sun,Chang Zeng,Chunfeng Wang,Hao Li,Jianxun Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DrivingScene提出了一种仅需两帧环绕视图即可在线重建4D动态场景的框架，通过残差流网络和分阶段训练，在质量和效率上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在动态驾驶场景的实时高保真重建中难以平衡质量和效率，尤其是面对复杂动态和稀疏视图时。

Method: 采用轻量级残差流网络预测动态物体的非刚性运动，并结合静态场景先验知识，通过场景流显式建模动态。引入粗到精的训练范式避免端到端方法的不稳定性。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够在线生成高质量的深度、场景流和3D高斯点云，在动态重建和新视角合成方面显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: DrivingScene框架通过轻量级残差流网络和分阶段训练范式，成功实现了仅需两帧环绕视图即可在线重建高质量4D动态场景，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes is
challenged by complex dynamics and sparse views, with prior methods struggling
to balance quality and efficiency. We propose DrivingScene, an online,
feed-forward framework that reconstructs 4D dynamic scenes from only two
consecutive surround-view images. Our key innovation is a lightweight residual
flow network that predicts the non-rigid motion of dynamic objects per camera
on top of a learned static scene prior, explicitly modeling dynamics via scene
flow. We also introduce a coarse-to-fine training paradigm that circumvents the
instabilities common to end-to-end approaches. Experiments on nuScenes dataset
show our image-only method simultaneously generates high-quality depth, scene
flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in both dynamic reconstruction and novel view
synthesis.

*Guorui Song,Guocun Wang,Zhe Huang,Jing Lin,Xuefei Zhe,Jian Li,Haoqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M-ACM 是一种新型生成框架，通过运动感知解码提升视频字幕质量，并在新数据集 HMI 上验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉细粒度运动细节，导致生成的描述模糊或语义不一致。

Method: M-ACM 利用从人体网格恢复中获得的运动表示，通过运动感知解码增强字幕生成。

Result: M-ACM 在准确描述复杂人类动作和细微时间变化方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: M-ACM 通过结合运动感知解码显著提升了视频字幕的质量，为以运动为中心的视频字幕设定了新标准。

Abstract: Generating accurate descriptions of human actions in videos remains a
challenging task for video captioning models. Existing approaches often
struggle to capture fine-grained motion details, resulting in vague or
semantically inconsistent captions. In this work, we introduce the
Motion-Augmented Caption Model (M-ACM), a novel generative framework that
enhances caption quality by incorporating motion-aware decoding. At its core,
M-ACM leverages motion representations derived from human mesh recovery to
explicitly highlight human body dynamics, thereby reducing hallucinations and
improving both semantic fidelity and spatial alignment in the generated
captions. To support research in this area, we present the Human Motion Insight
(HMI) Dataset, comprising 115K video-description pairs focused on human
movement, along with HMI-Bench, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating
motion-focused video captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that M-ACM
significantly outperforms previous methods in accurately describing complex
human motions and subtle temporal variations, setting a new standard for
motion-centric video captioning.

### [3] [Combining SAR Simulators to Train ATR Models with Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24768)
*Benjamin Camus,Julien Houssay,Corentin Le Barbu,Eric Monteux,Cédric Saleun,Christian Cochin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过结合两种SAR模拟器生成合成数据训练ATR模型，显著提升了在真实数据上的泛化性能，准确率达88%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏真实标记数据，依赖合成数据训练ATR模型，但合成数据因简化假设无法完全代表真实场景，导致模型泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出ADASCA深度学习方法，结合MOCEM（基于散射中心模型）和Salsa（基于光线追踪策略）两种SAR模拟器生成合成数据集，用于训练ATR模型。

Result: 在MSTAR实测数据上达到接近88%的准确率。

Conclusion: 结合两种不同的SAR模拟器（MOCEM和Salsa）生成合成数据集，可以有效提升ATR模型的泛化能力，在MSTAR实测数据上达到接近88%的准确率。

Abstract: This work aims to train Deep Learning models to perform Automatic Target
Recognition (ATR) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. To circumvent the
lack of real labelled measurements, we resort to synthetic data produced by SAR
simulators. Simulation offers full control over the virtual environment, which
enables us to generate large and diversified datasets at will. However,
simulations are intrinsically grounded on simplifying assumptions of the real
world (i.e. physical models). Thus, synthetic datasets are not as
representative as real measurements. Consequently, ATR models trained on
synthetic images cannot generalize well on real measurements. Our contributions
to this problem are twofold: on one hand, we demonstrate and quantify the
impact of the simulation paradigm on the ATR. On the other hand, we propose a
new approach to tackle the ATR problem: combine two SAR simulators that are
grounded on different (but complementary) paradigms to produce synthetic
datasets. To this end, we use two simulators: MOCEM, which is based on a
scattering centers model approach, and Salsa, which resorts on a ray tracing
strategy. We train ATR models using synthetic dataset generated both by MOCEM
and Salsa and our Deep Learning approach called ADASCA. We reach an accuracy of
almost 88 % on the MSTAR measurements.

### [4] [Point-level Uncertainty Evaluation of Mobile Laser Scanning Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24773)
*Ziyang Xu,Olaf Wysocki,Christoph Holst*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于机器学习的点级不确定性评估框架，利用几何特征预测误差，无需依赖高成本参考数据，实验证明效果良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后向不确定性建模依赖高精度参考数据，这些数据在大规模应用中成本高昂或难以获取。

Method: 使用两种集成学习模型（Random Forest和XGBoost），通过空间分区的真实世界数据集进行训练和验证，以避免数据泄露。

Result: 实验结果表明，两种模型均能有效捕捉几何特征与不确定性之间的非线性关系，平均ROC-AUC值超过0.87。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的机器学习框架为点云不确定性评估提供了数据驱动的视角，为大规模点云的质量控制和误差分析奠定了可扩展和适应性强的基础。

Abstract: Reliable quantification of uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point
clouds is essential for ensuring the accuracy and credibility of downstream
applications such as 3D mapping, modeling, and change analysis. Traditional
backward uncertainty modeling heavily rely on high-precision reference data,
which are often costly or infeasible to obtain at large scales. To address this
issue, this study proposes a machine learning-based framework for point-level
uncertainty evaluation that learns the relationship between local geometric
features and point-level errors. The framework is implemented using two
ensemble learning models, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, which are trained and
validated on a spatially partitioned real-world dataset to avoid data leakage.
Experimental results demonstrate that both models can effectively capture the
nonlinear relationships between geometric characteristics and uncertainty,
achieving mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87. The analysis further reveals that
geometric features describing elevation variation, point density, and local
structural complexity play a dominant role in predicting uncertainty. The
proposed framework offers a data-driven perspective of uncertainty evaluation,
providing a scalable and adaptable foundation for future quality control and
error analysis of large-scale point clouds.

### [5] [Cross-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion of Eye-Tracking and Facial Features for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24777)
*Yujie Nie,Jianzhang Ni,Yonglong Ye,Yuan-Ting Zhang,Yun Kwok Wing,Xiangqing Xu,Xin Ma,Lizhou Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种结合眼动追踪与面部特征的多模态融合框架，用于阿尔茨海默病诊断，准确率高达95.11%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究很少联合利用眼动追踪和面部特征进行阿尔茨海默病诊断，而多模态方法能整合互补信息，有望提高诊断准确性。

Method: 框架包含交叉增强融合注意力模块（CEFAM）和方向感知卷积模块（DACM），通过跨模态注意力与全局增强建模模态间交互，并捕获细粒度面部特征。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在区分AD与健康对照组时准确率达95.11%，显著优于传统融合方法。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的多模态交叉增强融合框架在阿尔茨海默病辅助诊断中表现出色，分类准确率达95.11%，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for enabling
timely intervention and slowing disease progression. Multimodal diagnostic
approaches offer considerable promise by integrating complementary information
across behavioral and perceptual domains. Eye-tracking and facial features, in
particular, are important indicators of cognitive function, reflecting
attentional distribution and neurocognitive state. However, few studies have
explored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we
propose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically
leverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection. The framework
incorporates two key modules: (a) a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module
(CEFAM), which models inter-modal interactions through cross-attention and
global enhancement, and (b) a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), which
captures fine-grained directional facial features via horizontal-vertical
receptive fields. Together, these modules enable adaptive and discriminative
multimodal representation learning. To support this work, we constructed a
synchronized multimodal dataset, including 25 patients with AD and 25 healthy
controls (HC), by recording aligned facial video and eye-tracking sequences
during a visual memory-search paradigm, providing an ecologically valid
resource for evaluating integration strategies. Extensive experiments on this
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional late fusion and
feature concatenation methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.11% in
distinguishing AD from HC, highlighting superior robustness and diagnostic
performance by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and
modality-specific contributions.

### [6] [Learning Disentangled Speech- and Expression-Driven Blendshapes for 3D Talking Face Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25234)
*Yuxiang Mao,Zhijie Zhang,Zhiheng Zhang,Jiawei Liu,Chen Zeng,Shihong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过联合学习语音和情感驱动的混合形状，该方法生成了情感丰富且唇部同步的3D面部动画，优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实情感3D说话面部数据集的稀缺性，现有方法在生成情感表达丰富的说话面部方面仍有不足。

Method: 将语音和情感驱动的面部动画建模为线性加法问题，利用中性表情的3D说话面部数据集（VOCAset）和3D表情序列数据集（Florence4D），联合学习一组混合形状，并引入稀疏约束损失以促进解耦。

Result: 定性和定量实验表明，该方法能自然地生成具有指定表情的说话面部，同时保持准确的唇部同步。感知研究进一步显示其在情感表达上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合学习语音和情感驱动的混合形状，成功生成了具有指定表情且保持精确唇部同步的3D面部动画，并在情感表达上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Expressions are fundamental to conveying human emotions. With the rapid
advancement of AI-generated content (AIGC), realistic and expressive 3D facial
animation has become increasingly crucial. Despite recent progress in
speech-driven lip-sync for talking-face animation, generating emotionally
expressive talking faces remains underexplored. A major obstacle is the
scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to the high cost of
data capture. To address this, we model facial animation driven by both speech
and emotion as a linear additive problem. Leveraging a 3D talking-face dataset
with neutral expressions (VOCAset) and a dataset of 3D expression sequences
(Florence4D), we jointly learn a set of blendshapes driven by speech and
emotion. We introduce a sparsity constraint loss to encourage disentanglement
between the two types of blendshapes while allowing the model to capture
inherent secondary cross-domain deformations present in the training data. The
learned blendshapes can be further mapped to the expression and jaw pose
parameters of the FLAME model, enabling the animation of 3D Gaussian avatars.
Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method naturally
generates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate
lip synchronization. Perceptual studies further show that our approach achieves
superior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods, without
compromising lip-sync quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能车辆自动化是当前趋势，车道检测是其关键应用之一，尤其在复杂环境中的适应性需求推动了这一研究。

Abstract: Intelligent vehicles are one of the most important outcomes gained from the
world tendency toward automation. Applications of IVs, whether in urban roads
or robot tracks, do prioritize lane path detection. This paper proposes an
FPGA-based Lane Detector Vehicle LDV architecture that relies on the Sobel
algorithm for edge detection. Operating on 416 x 416 images and 150 MHz, the
system can generate a valid output every 1.17 ms. The valid output consists of
the number of present lanes, the current lane index, as well as its right and
left boundaries. Additionally, the automated light and temperature control
units in the proposed system enhance its adaptability to the surrounding
environmental conditions.

### [8] [FreeArt3D: Training-Free Articulated Object Generation using 3D Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25765)
*Chuhao Chen,Isabella Liu,Xinyue Wei,Hao Su,Minghua Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeArt3D通过利用预训练模型和扩展SDS，无需训练即可高效生成高质量3D关节物体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D关节物体生成中存在局限性，如需要密集视图监督或忽略表面纹理，而FreeArt3D旨在克服这些挑战。

Method: 利用预训练的静态3D扩散模型（如Trellis）作为形状先验，将Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)扩展到3D-to-4D领域，联合优化几何、纹理和关节参数。

Result: 生成高保真几何和纹理，准确预测运动结构，泛化能力强，且速度快。

Conclusion: FreeArt3D是一个无需训练的框架，能够高效生成高质量的3D关节物体，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR,
and animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on
optimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision
or on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric
approximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D
generation of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with
the advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending
these methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models
poses significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a
training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of
training a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a
pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape
prior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by
treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images
captured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the
object's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring
task-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our
method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts
underlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object
categories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D
completes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art
approaches in both quality and versatility.

### [9] [ESCA: Enabling Seamless Codec Avatar Execution through Algorithm and Hardware Co-Optimization for Virtual Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24787)
*Mingzhi Zhu,Ding Shang,Sai Qian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ESCA框架通过PTQ和硬件加速器优化，在VR设备上高效运行高保真Codec Avatar模型，提升质量并降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Photorealistic Codec Avatars在资源受限的VR设备上实时推理的高计算需求和延迟问题。

Method: 提出了一种针对Codec Avatar模型的高效后训练量化（PTQ）方法，并设计了一个自定义硬件加速器，集成到VR设备的系统芯片中。

Result: ESCA将FovVideoVDP质量分数提升至最高+0.39，延迟降低3.36倍，并维持100帧/秒的渲染速率，满足实时VR需求。

Conclusion: ESCA框架成功实现了在资源受限的VR设备上高效运行高保真Codec Avatar模型，为更沉浸式和便携的VR体验铺平了道路。

Abstract: Photorealistic Codec Avatars (PCA), which generate high-fidelity human face
renderings, are increasingly being used in Virtual Reality (VR) environments to
enable immersive communication and interaction through deep learning-based
generative models. However, these models impose significant computational
demands, making real-time inference challenging on resource-constrained VR
devices such as head-mounted displays, where latency and power efficiency are
critical. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient post-training
quantization (PTQ) method tailored for Codec Avatar models, enabling
low-precision execution without compromising output quality. In addition, we
design a custom hardware accelerator that can be integrated into the
system-on-chip of VR devices to further enhance processing efficiency. Building
on these components, we introduce ESCA, a full-stack optimization framework
that accelerates PCA inference on edge VR platforms. Experimental results
demonstrate that ESCA boosts FovVideoVDP quality scores by up to $+0.39$ over
the best 4-bit baseline, delivers up to $3.36\times$ latency reduction, and
sustains a rendering rate of 100 frames per second in end-to-end tests,
satisfying real-time VR requirements. These results demonstrate the feasibility
of deploying high-fidelity codec avatars on resource-constrained devices,
opening the door to more immersive and portable VR experiences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 视觉模型在图理解任务中表现优于GNNs，尤其是在全局结构感知和尺度不变性方面，为图基础模型开发提供了新思路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络（GNNs）的基准测试将领域特征与拓扑理解混为一谈，且GNNs在全局模式抽象和尺度变化时表现不佳，因此探索视觉模型在图理解中的潜力。

Method: 通过引入GraphAbstract基准来评估模型对全局图属性的感知能力，包括识别组织原型、检测对称性、感知连接强度和识别关键元素。

Result: 视觉模型在需要整体结构理解的任务上显著优于GNNs，并在不同图规模下保持泛化能力，而GNNs在全局模式抽象和随图规模增大时表现下降。

Conclusion: 视觉模型在图结构理解中展现出显著但未充分利用的潜力，特别是在需要全局拓扑意识和尺度不变推理的问题上。这些发现为开发更有效的图基础模型开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks operate through bottom-up message-passing,
fundamentally differing from human visual perception, which intuitively
captures global structures first. We investigate the underappreciated potential
of vision models for graph understanding, finding they achieve performance
comparable to GNNs on established benchmarks while exhibiting distinctly
different learning patterns. These divergent behaviors, combined with
limitations of existing benchmarks that conflate domain features with
topological understanding, motivate our introduction of GraphAbstract. This
benchmark evaluates models' ability to perceive global graph properties as
humans do: recognizing organizational archetypes, detecting symmetry, sensing
connectivity strength, and identifying critical elements. Our results reveal
that vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic
structural understanding and maintain generalizability across varying graph
scales, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with
increasing graph size. This work demonstrates that vision models possess
remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding,
particularly for problems requiring global topological awareness and
scale-invariant reasoning. These findings open new avenues to leverage this
underappreciated potential for developing more effective graph foundation
models for tasks dominated by holistic pattern recognition.

*Jingjun Bi,Fadi Dornaika*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSGSLM 是一种结合图卷积网络、伪标签和拓扑调整的半监督学习方法，显著提升了多视图数据的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的图基半监督学习和伪标签方法在多视图数据中效率有限，主要由于缺乏清晰的图结构和对多视图数据的整合挑战。

Method: RSGSLM 结合了线性特征变换和多视图图融合于图卷积网络（GCN）框架中，动态整合伪标签到损失函数中，并通过调整类边界附近的标记样本权重来纠正拓扑不平衡，还引入了适用于所有样本的无监督平滑损失。

Result: 实验结果表明，RSGSLM 在多视图基准图像数据集上的表现优于现有的半监督学习方法。

Conclusion: RSGSLM 在多项基准测试中超越了现有的半监督学习方法，特别是在多视图数据场景下，展示了其优越性和计算效率。

Abstract: Recently, graph-based semi-supervised learning and pseudo-labeling have
gained attention due to their effectiveness in reducing the need for extensive
data annotations. Pseudo-labeling uses predictions from unlabeled data to
improve model training, while graph-based methods are characterized by
processing data represented as graphs. However, the lack of clear graph
structures in images combined with the complexity of multi-view data limits the
efficiency of traditional and existing techniques. Moreover, the integration of
graph structures in multi-view data is still a challenge. In this paper, we
propose Re-node Self-taught Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning for Multi-view
Data (RSGSLM). Our method addresses these challenges by (i) combining linear
feature transformation and multi-view graph fusion within a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) framework, (ii) dynamically incorporating pseudo-labels into the
GCN loss function to improve classification in multi-view data, and (iii)
correcting topological imbalances by adjusting the weights of labeled samples
near class boundaries. Additionally, (iv) we introduce an unsupervised
smoothing loss applicable to all samples. This combination optimizes
performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results on
multi-view benchmark image datasets demonstrate that RSGSLM surpasses existing
semi-supervised learning approaches in multi-view contexts.

TL;DR: PISA-Bench是一个多语言多模态推理基准，基于PISA测试构建，评估发现小型模型和非英语分支表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在高质量和人工验证示例方面存在不足，且多数数据集仅限于英语。

Method: 引入PISA-Bench，一个基于专家创建的PISA测试的多语言基准，包含六种语言的平行语料库，并对现有视觉语言模型进行评估。

Result: 发现小型模型（<20B参数）表现不佳，非英语分支性能显著下降，且在空间和几何推理任务中错误率高。

Conclusion: 通过发布PISA-Bench数据集和评估框架，为多语言多模态推理研究提供了资源。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in terms of
high-quality, human-verified examples. Many current datasets rely on
synthetically generated content by large language models (LLMs). Furthermore,
most datasets are limited to English, as manual quality assurance of translated
samples is time-consuming and costly. To fill this gap, we introduce
PISA-Bench, a multilingual benchmark derived from English examples of the
expert-created PISA tests, a unified framework for the assessment of student
competencies in over eighty countries. Each example consists of human-extracted
instructions, questions, answer options, and images, enriched with question
type categories, and has been translated from English into five additional
languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, and Italian), resulting in a fully
parallel corpus covering six languages. We evaluate state-of-the-art
vision-language models on PISA-Bench and find that especially small models
(<20B parameters) fail to achieve high test scores. We further find substantial
performance degradation on non-English splits as well as high error-rates when
models are tasked with spatial and geometric reasoning. By releasing the
dataset and evaluation framework, we provide a resource for advancing research
on multilingual multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: 本综述为高效视觉-语言-动作模型（Efficient VLAs）领域提供了首个全面回顾，并提出了未来研究的路线图。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) represent a significant frontier in
embodied intelligence, aiming to bridge digital knowledge with physical-world
interaction. While these models have demonstrated remarkable generalist
capabilities, their deployment is severely hampered by the substantial
computational and data requirements inherent to their underlying large-scale
foundation models. Motivated by the urgent need to address these challenges,
this survey presents the first comprehensive review of Efficient
Vision-Language-Action models (Efficient VLAs) across the entire
data-model-training process. Specifically, we introduce a unified taxonomy to
systematically organize the disparate efforts in this domain, categorizing
current techniques into three core pillars: (1) Efficient Model Design,
focusing on efficient architectures and model compression; (2) Efficient
Training, which reduces computational burdens during model learning; and (3)
Efficient Data Collection, which addresses the bottlenecks in acquiring and
utilizing robotic data. Through a critical review of state-of-the-art methods
within this framework, this survey not only establishes a foundational
reference for the community but also summarizes representative applications,
delineates key challenges, and charts a roadmap for future research. We
maintain a continuously updated project page to track our latest developments:

### [14] [Conflict Adaptation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24804)
*Xiaoyang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 大多数视觉语言模型在Stroop任务中表现出冲突适应行为，稀疏自编码器分析揭示了其表征基础与人类认知控制相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型是否能模拟人类认知控制中的冲突适应现象，并理解其表征基础。

Method: 采用序列Stroop任务测试13个视觉语言模型（VLMs），并使用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）分析模型InternVL 3.5 4B中的任务相关超节点。

Result: 12个VLMs表现出冲突适应行为，稀疏自编码器识别出任务相关的超节点结构，部分与人类自动性不对称现象一致。

Conclusion: 研究发现，12个视觉语言模型（VLMs）中的大部分表现出与人类类似的冲突适应行为，表明这些模型能够模拟人类认知控制的部分机制。通过稀疏自编码器（SAEs）分析，揭示了任务相关的超节点结构，进一步验证了模型行为的可解释性。

Abstract: A signature of human cognitive control is conflict adaptation: improved
performance on a high-conflict trial following another high-conflict trial.
This phenomenon offers an account for how cognitive control, a scarce resource,
is recruited. Using a sequential Stroop task, we find that 12 of 13
vision-language models (VLMs) tested exhibit behavior consistent with conflict
adaptation, with the lone exception likely reflecting a ceiling effect. To
understand the representational basis of this behavior, we use sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant supernodes in InternVL 3.5 4B.
Partially overlapping supernodes emerge for text and color in both early and
late layers, and their relative sizes mirror the automaticity asymmetry between
reading and color naming in humans. We further isolate a conflict-modulated
supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation significantly increases Stroop errors
while minimally affecting congruent trials.

*Binbin Li,Guimiao Yang,Zisen Qi,Haiping Wang,Yu Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualCap通过双检索机制和视觉提示生成，解决了现有模型在物体细节和复杂场景描述上的不足，性能优越且参数高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轻量级检索增强图像描述模型仅将检索数据用作文本提示，导致原始视觉特征未被增强，尤其在物体细节或复杂场景描述上存在语义鸿沟。

Method: 提出DualCap模型，采用双检索机制：标准图像到文本检索用于文本提示，新颖的图像到图像检索用于获取视觉类似场景。通过从视觉类似场景的标题中提取关键词和短语，编码后与原始图像特征融合。

Result: 实验表明，DualCap在性能上具有竞争力，且相比之前的视觉提示描述方法，需要更少的可训练参数。

Conclusion: DualCap方法通过双检索机制和视觉提示生成，显著提升了轻量级检索增强图像描述模型的性能，尤其在物体细节和复杂场景的描述上表现优异。

Abstract: Recent lightweight retrieval-augmented image caption models often utilize
retrieved data solely as text prompts, thereby creating a semantic gap by
leaving the original visual features unenhanced, particularly for object
details or complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose $DualCap$, a
novel approach that enriches the visual representation by generating a visual
prompt from retrieved similar images. Our model employs a dual retrieval
mechanism, using standard image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and a novel
image-to-image retrieval to source visually analogous scenes. Specifically,
salient keywords and phrases are derived from the captions of visually similar
scenes to capture key objects and similar details. These textual features are
then encoded and integrated with the original image features through a
lightweight, trainable feature fusion network. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while requiring
fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning
approaches.

Motivation: 传统感官评估鱼类新鲜度存在主观性、耗时和不一致的问题，深度学习虽然自动化了视觉预测，但仍面临准确性和特征透明度的挑战。

Method: 研究采用了一个统一的三阶段框架：1. 微调五种先进的视觉架构（ResNet-50、DenseNet-121等）；2. 使用多级深度特征训练七种经典机器学习分类器；3. 通过LGBM、随机森林和Lasso进行特征选择。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的三阶段框架在鱼类新鲜度视觉评估任务中表现出高效性和通用性，最佳配置达到了85.99%的准确率，显著优于现有研究。

Abstract: Assessing fish freshness is vital for ensuring food safety and minimizing
economic losses in the seafood industry. However, traditional sensory
evaluation remains subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent. Although
recent advances in deep learning have automated visual freshness prediction,
challenges related to accuracy and feature transparency persist. This study
introduces a unified three-stage framework that refines and leverages deep
visual representations for reliable fish freshness assessment. First, five
state-of-the-art vision architectures - ResNet-50, DenseNet-121,
EfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Base, and Swin-Tiny - are fine-tuned to establish a
strong baseline. Next, multi-level deep features extracted from these backbones
are used to train seven classical machine learning classifiers, integrating
deep and traditional decision mechanisms. Finally, feature selection methods
based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Random Forest, and Lasso
identify a compact and informative subset of features. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate that the best
configuration combining Swin-Tiny features, an Extra Trees classifier, and
LGBM-based feature selection achieves an accuracy of 85.99%, outperforming
recent studies on the same dataset by 8.69-22.78%. These findings confirm the
effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed framework for visual quality
evaluation tasks.

TL;DR: MVFNDB基准和MVFND-CoT框架为多模态大语言模型在视频假新闻检测领域提供了细粒度评估和推理能力测试，推动了该领域的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频假新闻检测基准往往仅关注最终决策的准确性，缺乏对检测过程的细粒度评估，导致检测过程成为黑箱。

Method: 提出了MVFNDB基准，包含10个任务和9730个人工标注的视频相关问题，并设计了MVFND-CoT框架，结合创作者添加内容和原始拍摄素材进行推理。

Result: MVFNDB基准和MVFND-CoT框架通过深入分析视频处理策略及视频特征与模型能力的对齐，验证了多特征组合对最终结果的影响。

Conclusion: MVFNDB为多模态大语言模型在视频假新闻检测领域的评估和进步奠定了坚实基础，未来有望推动该领域的深入研究。

Abstract: The advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has greatly advanced
research into applications for Video fake news detection (VFND) tasks.
Traditional video-based FND benchmarks typically focus on the accuracy of the
final decision, often failing to provide fine-grained assessments for the
entire detection process, making the detection process a black box. Therefore,
we introduce the MVFNDB (Multi-modal Video Fake News Detection Benchmark) based
on the empirical analysis, which provides foundation for tasks definition. The
benchmark comprises 10 tasks and is meticulously crafted to probe MLLMs'
perception, understanding, and reasoning capacities during detection, featuring
9730 human-annotated video-related questions based on a carefully constructed
taxonomy ability of VFND. To validate the impact of combining multiple features
on the final results, we design a novel framework named MVFND-CoT, which
incorporates both creator-added content and original shooting footage
reasoning. Building upon the benchmark, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the
deeper factors influencing accuracy, including video processing strategies and
the alignment between video features and model capabilities. We believe this
benchmark will lay a solid foundation for future evaluations and advancements
of MLLMs in the domain of video fake news detection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多轮安全编辑框架SafeEditor，解决了现有T2I模型安全方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理时方法存在过度拒绝和安全性-实用性不平衡的问题，需要一种更高效的安全对齐方法。

Method: 提出了一个多轮安全编辑框架MR-SafeEdit，并开发了SafeEditor，一个能够对生成图像进行多轮安全编辑的统一MLLM。

Result: 实验结果表明，SafeEditor在减少过度拒绝和平衡安全性与实用性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SafeEditor通过减少过度拒绝并在安全性和实用性之间取得更好的平衡，超越了之前的安全方法。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, ensuring their
safety has become increasingly critical. Existing safety approaches can be
categorized into training-time and inference-time methods. While inference-time
methods are widely adopted due to their cost-effectiveness, they often suffer
from limitations such as over-refusal and imbalance between safety and utility.
To address these challenges, we propose a multi-round safety editing framework
that functions as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, enabling efficient
safety alignment for any text-to-image model. Central to this framework is
MR-SafeEdit, a multi-round image-text interleaved dataset specifically
constructed for safety editing in text-to-image generation. We introduce a
post-hoc safety editing paradigm that mirrors the human cognitive process of
identifying and refining unsafe content. To instantiate this paradigm, we
develop SafeEditor, a unified MLLM capable of multi-round safety editing on
generated images. Experimental results show that SafeEditor surpasses prior
safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving a more favorable
safety-utility balance.

in contextual ASR and highly competitive results in dialect-aware ASR. In image
generation, Ming-Flash-Omni introduces high-fidelity text rendering and
demonstrates marked gains in scene consistency and identity preservation during

Motivation: 多模态情感识别在人机交互中至关重要，但由于模态差异和单模态情感信息表征困难，准确识别仍面临挑战。

Method: 提出了一种基于多路径跨模态交互的混合网络模型（MCIHN），包括对抗自编码器（AAE）提取单模态情感特征，跨模态门控机制（CGMM）减少模态差异并生成交互特征，以及特征融合模块（FFM）进行多模态融合。

Result: 在公开数据集SIMS和MOSI上的实验表明，MCIHN模型性能优于其他方法。

Conclusion: MCIHN模型通过多路径跨模态交互和特征融合，显著提升了多模态情感识别的性能，在公开数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition is crucial for future human-computer
interaction. However, accurate emotion recognition still faces significant
challenges due to differences between different modalities and the difficulty
of characterizing unimodal emotional information. To solve these problems, a
hybrid network model based on multipath cross-modal interaction (MCIHN) is
proposed. First, adversarial autoencoders (AAE) are constructed separately for
each modality. The AAE learns discriminative emotion features and reconstructs
the features through a decoder to obtain more discriminative information about
the emotion classes. Then, the latent codes from the AAE of different
modalities are fed into a predefined Cross-modal Gate Mechanism model (CGMM) to
reduce the discrepancy between modalities, establish the emotional relationship
between interacting modalities, and generate the interaction features between
different modalities. Multimodal fusion using the Feature Fusion module (FFM)
for better emotion recognition. Experiments were conducted on publicly
available SIMS and MOSI datasets, demonstrating that MCIHN achieves superior
performance.

Motivation: 尽管流匹配取得了显著成功，但影响其生成过程质量的因素仍未被充分理解。

Method: 采用去噪视角，设计了一个框架来实证探究生成过程，通过噪声和漂移等扰动来影响样本生成。

Conclusion: 通过将流匹配模型与去噪器联系起来，本研究揭示了生成过程中的不同动态阶段，并精确描述了去噪器在生成过程中的成功与失败阶段及其原因。

Abstract: Flow matching has achieved remarkable success, yet the factors influencing
the quality of its generation process remain poorly understood. In this work,
we adopt a denoising perspective and design a framework to empirically probe
the generation process. Laying down the formal connections between flow
matching models and denoisers, we provide a common ground to compare their
performances on generation and denoising. This enables the design of principled
and controlled perturbations to influence sample generation: noise and drift.
This leads to new insights on the distinct dynamical phases of the generative
process, enabling us to precisely characterize at which stage of the generative
process denoisers succeed or fail and why this matters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习方法将成熟度视为离散分类问题，与生物成熟过程的连续性质存在根本冲突，导致信息丢失和类别边界模糊。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的架构修改，即在最先进的实时目标检测器RT-DETRv2中引入专用的概率头部，使模型能够预测每个检测对象的成熟度谱上的连续分布。

Result: 模型在具有挑战性的大规模水果数据集上达到了85.6%的平均精度（mAP），并通过广泛实验证明其概率方法比基于分类的方法提供了更细粒度和准确的成熟度评估。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种将成熟度估计重构为连续概率学习任务的新方法，通过引入概率头部改进了RT-DETRv2模型，不仅提供了更丰富的生物合理性成熟度表示，还保持了卓越的检测性能。

Abstract: Maturity estimation of fruits and vegetables is a critical task for
agricultural automation, directly impacting yield prediction and robotic
harvesting. Current deep learning approaches predominantly treat maturity as a
discrete classification problem (e.g., unripe, ripe, overripe). This rigid
formulation, however, fundamentally conflicts with the continuous nature of the
biological ripening process, leading to information loss and ambiguous class
boundaries. In this paper, we challenge this paradigm by reframing maturity
estimation as a continuous, probabilistic learning task. We propose a novel
architectural modification to the state-of-the-art, real-time object detector,
RT-DETRv2, by introducing a dedicated probabilistic head. This head enables the
model to predict a continuous distribution over the maturity spectrum for each
detected object, simultaneously learning the mean maturity state and its
associated uncertainty. This uncertainty measure is crucial for downstream
decision-making in robotics, providing a confidence score for tasks like
selective harvesting. Our model not only provides a far richer and more
biologically plausible representation of plant maturity but also maintains
exceptional detection performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of
85.6\% on a challenging, large-scale fruit dataset. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that our probabilistic approach offers more granular and
accurate maturity assessments than its classification-based counterparts,
paving the way for more intelligent, uncertainty-aware automated systems in
modern agriculture

Motivation: 尽管Alves等人（2024）的骨架方法提高了识别性能，但使用OpenPose提取地标影响了时间性能。初步调查显示，用轻量级MediaPipe替换OpenPose虽提高了处理速度，但显著降低了准确性。

Method: 探索了地标子集选择策略，并采用样条插值技术处理缺失地标问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，适当的地标子集选择可以达到或优于现有方法，同时处理时间比Alves等人（2024）减少超过5倍。样条插值有效缓解了缺失地标问题，显著提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 研究发现，通过精心选择地标子集并结合简单的插值技术，可以实现高效且准确的手语识别，为可扩展的手语识别系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of using lightweight body landmark
detection for the recognition of isolated signs in Brazilian Sign Language
(LIBRAS). Although the skeleton-based approach by Alves et al. (2024) enabled
substantial improvements in recognition performance, the use of OpenPose for
landmark extraction hindered time performance. In a preliminary investigation,
we observed that simply replacing OpenPose with the lightweight MediaPipe,
while improving processing speed, significantly reduced accuracy. To overcome
this limitation, we explored landmark subset selection strategies aimed at
optimizing recognition performance. Experimental results showed that a proper
landmark subset achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing processing time by more than 5X compared to Alves et al.
(2024). As an additional contribution, we demonstrated that spline-based
imputation effectively mitigates missing landmark issues, leading to
substantial accuracy gains. These findings highlight that careful landmark
selection, combined with simple imputation techniques, enables efficient and
accurate isolated sign recognition, paving the way for scalable Sign Language
Recognition systems.

Abstract: Traffic congestion is becoming a challenge in the rapidly growing urban
cities, resulting in increasing delays and inefficiencies within urban
transportation systems. To address this issue a comprehensive methodology is
designed to optimize traffic flow and minimize delays. The framework is
structured with three primary components: (a) vehicle detection, (b) traffic
prediction, and (c) traffic signal optimization. This paper presents the first
component, vehicle detection. The methodology involves analyzing multiple
sequential frames from a camera feed to compute the background, i.e. the
underlying roadway, by averaging pixel values over time. The computed
background is then utilized to extract the foreground, where the Density-Based
Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is applied to
detect vehicles. With its computational efficiency and minimal infrastructure
modification requirements, the proposed methodology offers a practical and
scalable solution for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 当前文本到视频生成模型难以泛化到非传统相机运动，主要因缺乏足够训练视频。VividCam旨在通过合成数据解决这一挑战。

Method: VividCam采用多解耦策略，从合成视频中分离相机运动学习与外观伪影，确保运动表示的鲁棒性，并通过Unity等引擎高效渲染低多边形3D场景。

Result: VividCam能够合成广泛且精确控制的复杂相机运动，仅需简单的合成数据（如低多边形3D场景）。

Conclusion: VividCam通过合成视频训练扩散模型，成功解决了传统文本到视频生成模型在非传统相机运动上的泛化问题，提供了一种高效且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-video generative models are getting more capable of
following external camera controls, imposed by either text descriptions or
camera trajectories, they still struggle to generalize to unconventional camera
motions, which is crucial in creating truly original and artistic videos. The
challenge lies in the difficulty of finding sufficient training videos with the
intended uncommon camera motions. To address this challenge, we propose
VividCam, a training paradigm that enables diffusion models to learn complex
camera motions from synthetic videos, releasing the reliance on collecting
realistic training videos. VividCam incorporates multiple disentanglement
strategies that isolates camera motion learning from synthetic appearance
artifacts, ensuring more robust motion representation and mitigating domain
shift. We demonstrate that our design synthesizes a wide range of precisely
controlled and complex camera motions using surprisingly simple synthetic data.
Notably, this synthetic data often consists of basic geometries within a
low-poly 3D scene and can be efficiently rendered by engines like Unity. Our
video results can be found in https://wuqiuche.github.io/VividCamDemoPage/ .

Abstract: Multi-view transformers such as DUSt3R are revolutionizing 3D vision by
solving 3D tasks in a feed-forward manner. However, contrary to previous
optimization-based pipelines, the inner mechanisms of multi-view transformers
are unclear. Their black-box nature makes further improvements beyond data
scaling challenging and complicates usage in safety- and reliability-critical
applications. Here, we present an approach for probing and visualizing 3D
representations from the residual connections of the multi-view transformers'
layers. In this manner, we investigate a variant of the DUSt3R model, shedding
light on the development of its latent state across blocks, the role of the
individual layers, and suggest how it differs from methods with stronger
inductive biases of explicit global pose. Finally, we show that the
investigated variant of DUSt3R estimates correspondences that are refined with
reconstructed geometry. The code used for the analysis is available at

Motivation: 多模态学习中，主导模态常压制其他模态，限制了模型的泛化能力。M-SAM旨在平衡各模态贡献，提升整体性能。

Method: M-SAM采用三步优化：1. 基于Shapley值识别主导模态；2. 分解损失景观以优先考虑主导模态的鲁棒性；3. 通过反向传播更新权重。

Result: 在四个多样数据集上，M-SAM表现优于最新优化和梯度处理方法，显著提升多模态学习效果。

Conclusion: M-SAM通过识别主导模态、调整损失景观和更新权重，显著提升了多模态学习的平衡性和性能。

Abstract: In multimodal learning, dominant modalities often overshadow others, limiting
generalization. We propose Modality-Aware Sharpness-Aware Minimization (M-SAM),
a model-agnostic framework that applies to many modalities and supports early
and late fusion scenarios. In every iteration, M-SAM in three steps optimizes
learning. \textbf{First, it identifies the dominant modality} based on
modalities' contribution in the accuracy using Shapley. \textbf{Second, it
decomposes the loss landscape}, or in another language, it modulates the loss
to prioritize the robustness of the model in favor of the dominant modality,
and \textbf{third, M-SAM updates the weights} by backpropagation of modulated
gradients. This ensures robust learning for the dominant modality while
enhancing contributions from others, allowing the model to explore and exploit
complementary features that strengthen overall performance. Extensive
experiments on four diverse datasets show that M-SAM outperforms the latest
state-of-the-art optimization and gradient manipulation methods and
significantly balances and improves multimodal learning.

Conclusion: IBIS架构通过整合Inception-BiLSTM与SVM，显著提升了Wi-Fi传感模型的泛化能力，并在多普勒数据上实现了99%的运动识别准确率。

Abstract: The increasing interest in Wi-Fi sensing stems from its potential to capture
environmental data in a low-cost, non-intrusive way, making it ideal for
applications like healthcare, space occupancy analysis, and gesture-based IoT
control. However, a major limitation in this field is the common problem of
overfitting, where models perform well on training data but fail to generalize
to new data. To overcome this, we introduce a novel hybrid architecture that
integrates Inception-BiLSTM with a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which we refer
to as IBIS. Our IBIS approach is uniquely engineered to improve model
generalization and create more robust classification boundaries. By applying
this method to Doppler-derived data, we achieve a movement recognition accuracy
of nearly 99%. Comprehensive performance metrics and confusion matrices confirm
the significant effectiveness of our proposed solution.

AI-based approaches using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision
Transformers (ViTs) achieved promising accuracy but offered limited
interpretability. We present FT-ARM (Fine-Tuned Agentic Reflection Multimodal
model), a fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM) with an agentic
self-reflection mechanism for pressure ulcer severity classification. Inspired
by clinician-style diagnostic reassessment, FT-ARM iteratively refines its
predictions by reasoning over visual features and encoded clinical knowledge
from text, enhancing both accuracy and consistency. On the publicly available
Pressure Injury Image Dataset (PIID), FT-ARM, fine-tuned from LLaMA 3.2 90B,
achieved 85% accuracy in classifying PU stages I-IV, surpassing prior CNN-based
models by +4%. Unlike earlier CNN/ViT studies that relied solely on offline
evaluations, FT-ARM is designed and tested for live inference, reflecting
real-time deployment conditions. Furthermore, it produces clinically grounded
natural-language explanations, improving interpretability and trust. By
integrating fine-tuning and reflective reasoning across multimodal inputs,
FT-ARM advances the reliability, transparency, and clinical applicability of
automated wound assessment systems, addressing the critical need for consistent
and explainable PU staging to support improved patient care.

Abstract: Developing a highly accurate automatic license plate recognition system
(ALPR) is challenging due to environmental factors such as lighting, rain, and
dust. Additional difficulties include high vehicle speeds, varying camera
angles, and low-quality or low-resolution images. ALPR is vital in traffic
control, parking, vehicle tracking, toll collection, and law enforcement
applications. This paper proposes a deep learning strategy using YOLOv8 for
license plate detection and recognition tasks. This method seeks to enhance the
performance of the model using datasets from Ontario, Quebec, California, and
New York State. It achieved an impressive recall rate of 94% on the dataset
from the Center for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI) and
91% on the UFPR-ALPR dataset. In addition, our method follows a semi-supervised
learning framework, combining a small set of manually labeled data with
pseudo-labels generated by Grounding DINO to train our detection model.
Grounding DINO, a powerful vision-language model, automatically annotates many
images with bounding boxes for license plates, thereby minimizing the reliance
on labor-intensive manual labeling. By integrating human-verified and
model-generated annotations, we can scale our dataset efficiently while
maintaining label quality, which significantly enhances the training process
and overall model performance. Furthermore, it reports character error rates
for both datasets, providing additional insight into system performance.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种新型框架，通过结合视觉特征和结构化文本描述，开发出临床可行的VLM-based CAD系统，有效融合影像数据和上下文患者信息。

Abstract: Breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among women in
the developed world. Early detection through mammography screening plays a
pivotal role in reducing mortality rates. While computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
systems have shown promise in assisting radiologists, existing approaches face
critical limitations in clinical deployment - particularly in handling the
nuanced interpretation of multi-modal data and feasibility due to the
requirement of prior clinical history. This study introduces a novel framework
that synergistically combines visual features from 2D mammograms with
structured textual descriptors derived from easily accessible clinical metadata
and synthesized radiological reports through innovative tokenization modules.
Our proposed methods in this study demonstrate that strategic integration of
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with language representations achieves
superior performance to vision transformer-based models while handling
high-resolution images and enabling practical deployment across diverse
populations. By evaluating it on multi-national cohort screening mammograms,
our multi-modal approach achieves superior performance in cancer detection and
calcification identification compared to unimodal baselines, with particular
improvements. The proposed method establishes a new paradigm for developing
clinically viable VLM-based CAD systems that effectively leverage imaging data
and contextual patient information through effective fusion mechanisms.

Conclusion: DRIP方法通过动态合并视觉编码器深层令牌，显著减少了GFLOPs，同时保持了分类/零样本性能的可比性，证明了其在科学领域的扩展潜力。

Abstract: Recently, the advances in vision-language models, including contrastive
pretraining and instruction tuning, have greatly pushed the frontier of
multimodal AI. However, owing to the large-scale and hence expensive
pretraining, the efficiency concern has discouraged researchers from attempting
to pretrain a vision language model from scratch. In this work, we propose
Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP), which adapts to the
input images and dynamically merges tokens in the deeper layers of a visual
encoder. Our results on both ImageNet training from scratch and CLIP
contrastive pretraining demonstrate a significant GFLOP reduction while
maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance. To further
validate our proposed method, we conduct continual pretraining on a large
biology dataset, extending its impact into scientific domains.

Abstract: Zero-shot scene understanding in real-world settings presents major
challenges due to the complexity and variability of natural scenes, where
models must recognize new objects, actions, and contexts without prior labeled
examples. This work proposes a vision-language integration framework that
unifies pre-trained visual encoders (e.g., CLIP, ViT) and large language models

categories and contexts. Our approach develops a unified model that embeds
visual inputs and textual prompts into a shared space, followed by multimodal
fusion and reasoning layers for contextual interpretation. Experiments on

Abstract: Recent advancements in personalized image generation have significantly
improved facial identity preservation, particularly in fields such as
entertainment and social media. However, existing methods still struggle to
achieve precise control over facial attributes in a per-subject-tuning-free
(PSTF) way. Tuning-based techniques like PreciseControl have shown promise by
providing fine-grained control over facial features, but they often require
extensive technical expertise and additional training data, limiting their
accessibility. In contrast, PSTF approaches simplify the process by enabling
image generation from a single facial input, but they lack precise control over
facial attributes. In this paper, we introduce a novel, PSTF method that
enables both precise control over facial attributes and high-fidelity
preservation of facial identity. Our approach utilizes a face recognition model
to extract facial identity features, which are then mapped into the $W^+$
latent space of StyleGAN2 using the e4e encoder. We further enhance the model
with a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module, which integrates facial
identity, attribute features, and text embeddings into the UNet architecture,
ensuring clean separation of identity and attribute information. Trained on the
FFHQ dataset, our method allows for the generation of personalized images with
fine-grained control over facial attributes, while without requiring additional
fine-tuning or training data for individual identities. We demonstrate that our
approach successfully balances personalization with precise facial attribute
control, offering a more efficient and user-friendly solution for high-quality,
adaptable facial image synthesis. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合生物启发全球面光学和联合重建算法的BMI框架，用于高性能紧凑型RGBD成像，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现高保真、紧凑型RGBD成像面临双重挑战：传统的紧凑光学器件难以在整个景深范围内保持RGB锐度，而仅依赖软件的Monocular Depth Estimation（MDE）是一个依赖不可靠语义先验的病态问题。虽然具有DOEs等元件的深度光学可以编码深度，但它们在制造复杂性和色差方面引入了权衡，牺牲了简单性。

Method: 首先引入了一种新型生物启发的全球面单中心透镜，并围绕其构建了Bionic Monocentric Imaging（BMI）框架，这是一种整体协同设计。光学设计自然地通过其深度变化的点扩散函数（PSFs）编码深度，无需复杂的衍射或自由曲面元件。建立了严格的基于物理的前向模型，通过精确模拟光学退化过程生成合成数据集。此仿真流程与一个双头、多尺度重建网络协同设计，该网络采用共享编码器从单次编码捕获中联合恢复高清晰度的全聚焦（AiF）图像和精确的深度图。

Result: 在深度估计方面，该方法实现了Abs Rel为0.026和RMSE为0.130，显著优于领先的纯软件方法和其他深度光学系统。在图像恢复方面，系统实现了SSIM为0.960和感知LPIPS分数为0.082，从而确认了图像保真度和深度准确性之间的优越平衡。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了将生物启发的全球面光学器件与联合重建算法相结合，是解决高性能紧凑型RGBD成像固有挑战的有效策略。

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity, compact RGBD imaging presents a dual challenge:
conventional compact optics struggle with RGB sharpness across the entire
depth-of-field, while software-only Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is an
ill-posed problem reliant on unreliable semantic priors. While deep optics with
elements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication
complexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this,
we first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around
which we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic
co-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying
Point Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform
elements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a
synthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This
simulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction
network that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity
All-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture.
Extensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed
framework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an
RMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and
other deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM
of 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior
balance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that
the integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint
reconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the
intrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging. Source code will
be publicly available at https://github.com/ZongxiYu-ZJU/BMI.

Abstract: Zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection aims to localize humans and
objects in an image and recognize their interaction, even when specific
verb-object pairs are unseen during training. Recent works have shown promising
results using prompt learning with pretrained vision-language models such as
CLIP, which align natural language prompts with visual features in a shared
embedding space. However, existing approaches still fail to handle the visual
complexity of interaction, including (1) intra-class visual diversity, where
instances of the same verb appear in diverse poses and contexts, and (2)
inter-class visual entanglement, where distinct verbs yield visually similar
patterns. To address these challenges, we propose VDRP, a framework for Visual
Diversity and Region-aware Prompt learning. First, we introduce a visual
diversity-aware prompt learning strategy that injects group-wise visual
variance into the context embedding. We further apply Gaussian perturbation to
encourage the prompts to capture diverse visual variations of a verb. Second,
we retrieve region-specific concepts from the human, object, and union regions.
These are used to augment the diversity-aware prompt embeddings, yielding
region-aware prompts that enhance verb-level discrimination. Experiments on the
HICO-DET benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing
both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement. Code is

Abstract: Underwater infrastructure requires frequent inspection and maintenance due to
harsh marine conditions. Current reliance on human divers or remotely operated
vehicles is limited by perceptual and operational challenges, especially around
complex structures or in turbid water. Enhancing the spatial awareness of
underwater vehicles is key to reducing piloting risks and enabling greater
autonomy. To address these challenges, we present SPADE: SParsity Adaptive
Depth Estimator, a monocular depth estimation pipeline that combines
pre-trained relative depth estimator with sparse depth priors to produce dense,
metric scale depth maps. Our two-stage approach first scales the relative depth
map with the sparse depth points, then refines the final metric prediction with
our proposed Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks. Our approach achieves
improved accuracy and generalisation over state-of-the-art baselines and runs
efficiently at over 15 FPS on embedded hardware, promising to support practical
underwater inspection and intervention. This work has been submitted to IEEE

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of indoor and urban environments is a prominent research
topic with various downstream applications. However, existing geometric priors
for addressing low-texture regions in indoor and urban settings often lack
global consistency. Moreover, Gaussian Splatting and implicit SDF fields often
suffer from discontinuities or exhibit computational inefficiencies, resulting
in a loss of detail. To address these issues, we propose an Atlanta-world
guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting that achieves smooth indoor and
urban scene reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and
rendering efficiency. By leveraging the Atlanta-world model, we ensure the
accurate surface reconstruction for low-texture regions, while the proposed
novel implicit-structured GS representations provide smoothness without
sacrificing efficiency and high-frequency details. Specifically, we propose a
semantic GS representation to predict the probability of all semantic regions
and deploy a structure plane regularization with learnable plane indicators for
global accurate surface reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both indoor and urban
scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.

TL;DR: Region-CAM通过语义信息传播改进CAM，显著提升弱监督任务中的激活映射覆盖率和边界精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAM方法仅突出最具区分性的区域，导致激活映射覆盖不全且边界不精确，限制了弱监督学习任务的性能。

Method: 通过提取语义信息图（SIMs）并结合梯度与特征的语义信息传播（SIP），生成更全面的激活映射。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC训练和验证集上，mIoU分别提升13.61%和13.13%；在MS COCO验证集上提升16.23%；目标定位任务中Top-1准确率优于LayerCAM 4.5%。

Conclusion: Region-CAM显著提升了弱监督学习任务中的激活映射质量，尤其在弱监督语义分割（WSSS）中表现优异，不仅在PASCAL VOC和MS COCO数据集上取得了显著的mIoU提升，还在目标定位任务中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods are widely applied in weakly
supervised learning tasks due to their ability to highlight object regions.
However, conventional CAM methods highlight only the most discriminative
regions of the target. These highlighted regions often fail to cover the entire
object and are frequently misaligned with object boundaries, thereby limiting
the performance of downstream weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which demands pixel-wise
accurate activation maps to get the best results. To alleviate the above
problems, we propose a novel activation method, Region-CAM. Distinct from
network feature weighting approaches, Region-CAM generates activation maps by
extracting semantic information maps (SIMs) and performing semantic information
propagation (SIP) by considering both gradients and features in each of the
stages of the baseline classification model. Our approach highlights a greater
proportion of object regions while ensuring activation maps to have precise
boundaries that align closely with object edges. Region-CAM achieves 60.12% and
58.43% mean intersection over union (mIoU) using the baseline model on the
PASCAL VOC training and validation datasets, respectively, which are
improvements of 13.61% and 13.13% over the original CAM (46.51% and 45.30%). On
the MS COCO validation set, Region-CAM achieves 36.38%, a 16.23% improvement
over the original CAM (20.15%). We also demonstrate the superiority of
Region-CAM in object localization tasks, using the ILSVRC2012 validation set.
Region-CAM achieves 51.7% in Top-1 Localization accuracy Loc1. Compared with
LayerCAM, an activation method designed for weakly supervised object
localization, Region-CAM achieves 4.5% better performance in Loc1.

for data-efficient detection. DINOv3 features are strategically integrated at

images) gains 13.7%, and KITTI (7K images) shows 88.6% improvement, while
maintaining real-time inference (30-47 FPS). Systematic ablation across five

Abstract: The rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made detecting
AI-generated images a critical challenge for ensuring authenticity. Existing
reconstruction-based methods lack theoretical foundations and on empirical
heuristics, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this paper, we
introduce the Jacobian-Spectral Lower Bound for reconstruction error from a
geometric perspective, showing that real images off the reconstruction manifold
exhibit a non-trivial error lower bound, while generated images on the manifold
have near-zero error. Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of existing
methods that rely on static reconstruction error from a single pass. These
methods often fail when some real images exhibit lower error than generated
ones. This counterintuitive behavior reduces detection accuracy and requires
data-specific threshold tuning, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReGap, a training-free
method that computes dynamic reconstruction error by leveraging structured
editing operations to introduce controlled perturbations. This enables
measuring error changes before and after editing, improving detection accuracy
by enhancing error separation. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing baselines, exhibits robustness to common post-processing
operations and generalizes effectively across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Current 3D scene understanding methods are limited by offline-collected
multi-view data or pre-constructed 3D geometry. In this paper, we present
ExtractAnything3D (EA3D), a unified online framework for open-world 3D object
extraction that enables simultaneous geometric reconstruction and holistic
scene understanding. Given a streaming video, EA3D dynamically interprets each
frame using vision-language and 2D vision foundation encoders to extract
object-level knowledge. This knowledge is integrated and embedded into a
Gaussian feature map via a feed-forward online update strategy. We then
iteratively estimate visual odometry from historical frames and incrementally
update online Gaussian features with new observations. A recurrent joint
optimization module directs the model's attention to regions of interest,
simultaneously enhancing both geometric reconstruction and semantic
understanding. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and tasks,
including photo-realistic rendering, semantic and instance segmentation, 3D
bounding box and semantic occupancy estimation, and 3D mesh generation,
demonstrate the effectiveness of EA3D. Our method establishes a unified and
efficient framework for joint online 3D reconstruction and holistic scene
understanding, enabling a broad range of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Thin film interferometry is a powerful technique for non-invasively measuring
liquid film thickness with applications in ophthalmology, but its clinical
translation is hindered by the challenges in reconstructing thickness profiles
from interference patterns - an ill-posed inverse problem complicated by phase
periodicity, imaging noise and ambient artifacts. Traditional reconstruction
methods are either computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, or require
manual expert analysis, which is impractical for real-time diagnostics. To
address this challenge, here we present a vision transformer-based approach for
real-time inference of thin liquid film thickness profiles directly from
isolated interferograms. Trained on a hybrid dataset combining
physiologically-relevant synthetic and experimental tear film data, our model
leverages long-range spatial correlations to resolve phase ambiguities and
reconstruct temporally coherent thickness profiles in a single forward pass
from dynamic interferograms acquired in vivo and ex vivo. The network
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on noisy, rapidly-evolving films with
motion artifacts, overcoming limitations of conventional phase-unwrapping and
iterative fitting methods. Our data-driven approach enables automated,
consistent thickness reconstruction at real-time speeds on consumer hardware,
opening new possibilities for continuous monitoring of pre-lens ocular tear
films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions such as the dry eye disease.

Abstract: Deep generative models, such as diffusion models, have shown promising
progress in image generation and audio generation via simplified continuity
assumptions. However, the development of generative modeling techniques for
generating multi-modal data, such as parametric CAD sequences, still lags
behind due to the challenges in addressing long-range constraints and parameter
sensitivity. In this work, we propose a novel framework for quantitatively
constrained CAD generation, termed Target-Guided Bayesian Flow Network (TGBFN).
For the first time, TGBFN handles the multi-modality of CAD sequences (i.e.,
discrete commands and continuous parameters) in a unified continuous and
differentiable parameter space rather than in the discrete data space. In
addition, TGBFN penetrates the parameter update kernel and introduces a guided
Bayesian flow to control the CAD properties. To evaluate TGBFN, we construct a
new dataset for quantitatively constrained CAD generation. Extensive
comparisons across single-condition and multi-condition constrained generation
tasks demonstrate that TGBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in
generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences. The code is available

Conclusion: 该方法在Waymo数据集上表现优异，甚至优于使用真实LiDAR数据的方法，证明了其几何重建的准确性。

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown great potential for urban scene
reconstruction in the field of autonomous driving. However, current urban scene
reconstruction methods often depend on multimodal sensors as inputs,
\textit{i.e.} LiDAR and images. Though the geometry prior provided by LiDAR
point clouds can largely mitigate ill-posedness in reconstruction, acquiring
such accurate LiDAR data is still challenging in practice: i) precise
spatiotemporal calibration between LiDAR and other sensors is required, as they
may not capture data simultaneously; ii) reprojection errors arise from spatial
misalignment when LiDAR and cameras are mounted at different locations. To
avoid the difficulty of acquiring accurate LiDAR depth, we propose $D^2GS$, a
LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework. In this work, we obtain
geometry priors that are as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more
accurate. $\textbf{First}$, we initialize a dense point cloud by
back-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions. This point cloud is then
optimized by a Progressive Pruning strategy to improve the global consistency.
$\textbf{Second}$, we jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted dense
metric depth via a Depth Enhancer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion priors
from a depth foundation model to enhance the depth maps rendered by Gaussians.
In turn, the enhanced depths provide stronger geometric constraints during
Gaussian training. $\textbf{Finally}$, we improve the accuracy of ground
geometry by constraining the shape and normal attributes of Gaussians within
road regions. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more
accurate geometry even when compared with those using ground-truth LiDAR data.

Conclusion: 论文提出的ECAC方法通过动态调整分类器，结合全局和局部上下文信息，显著提升了语义分割的性能，尤其在少数类别上表现优异。

Abstract: Prevalent semantic segmentation methods generally adopt a vanilla classifier
to categorize each pixel into specific classes.
  Although such a classifier learns global information from the training data,
this information is represented by a set of fixed parameters (weights and
biases).
  However, each image has a different class distribution, which prevents the
classifier from addressing the unique characteristics of individual images.
  At the dataset level, class imbalance leads to segmentation results being
biased towards majority classes, limiting the model's effectiveness in
identifying and segmenting minority class regions.
  In this paper, we propose an Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) that
dynamically adjusts the classifier using global (dataset-level) and local
(image-level) contextual information.
  Specifically, we leverage a memory bank to learn dataset-level contextual
information of each class, incorporating the class-specific contextual
information from the current image to improve the classifier for precise pixel
labeling.
  Additionally, a teacher-student network paradigm is adopted, where the domain
expert (teacher network) dynamically adjusts contextual information with ground
truth and transfers knowledge to the student network.
  Comprehensive experiments illustrate that the proposed ECAC can achieve
state-of-the-art performance across several datasets, including ADE20K,
COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context.

Abstract: In recent years, test-time adaptive object detection has attracted increasing
attention due to its unique advantages in online domain adaptation, which
aligns more closely with real-world application scenarios. However, existing
approaches heavily rely on source-derived statistical characteristics while
making the strong assumption that the source and target domains share an
identical category space. In this paper, we propose the first foundation
model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates the
need for source data entirely and overcomes traditional closed-set limitations.
Specifically, we design a Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework for
vision-language detector-driven test-time adaptation, which incorporates text
and visual prompt tuning to adapt both language and vision representation
spaces on the test data in a parameter-efficient manner. Correspondingly, we
propose a Test-time Warm-start strategy tailored for the visual prompts to
effectively preserve the representation capability of the vision branch.
Furthermore, to guarantee high-quality pseudo-labels in every test batch, we
maintain an Instance Dynamic Memory (IDM) module that stores high-quality
pseudo-labels from previous test samples, and propose two novel
strategies-Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination-to leverage IDM's
high-quality instances for enhancing original predictions and hallucinating
images without available pseudo-labels, respectively. Extensive experiments on
cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, and can adapt to
arbitrary cross-domain and cross-category target data. Code is available at

Conclusion: U-CAN在点云去噪、上采样和图像去噪方面显著优于现有的无监督方法，甚至与有监督方法结果相当。

Abstract: Point clouds captured by scanning sensors are often perturbed by noise, which
have a highly negative impact on downstream tasks (e.g. surface reconstruction
and shape understanding). Previous works mostly focus on training neural
networks with noisy-clean point cloud pairs for learning denoising priors,
which requires extensively manual efforts. In this work, we introduce U-CAN, an
Unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising with Consistency-Aware
Noise2Noise matching. Specifically, we leverage a neural network to infer a
multi-step denoising path for each point of a shape or scene with a noise to
noise matching scheme. We achieve this by a novel loss which enables
statistical reasoning on multiple noisy point cloud observations. We further
introduce a novel constraint on the denoised geometry consistency for learning
consistency-aware denoising patterns. We justify that the proposed constraint
is a general term which is not limited to 3D domain and can also contribute to
the area of 2D image denoising. Our evaluations under the widely used
benchmarks in point cloud denoising, upsampling and image denoising show
significant improvement over the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, where
U-CAN also produces comparable results with the supervised methods.

Conclusion: MSF-Net通过多阶段特征提取和选择性更新策略，显著提高了表面法线估计的准确性，尤其在处理复杂细节时表现优异。

Abstract: Photometric stereo is a technique aimed at determining surface normals
through the utilization of shading cues derived from images taken under
different lighting conditions. However, existing learning-based approaches
often fail to accurately capture features at multiple stages and do not
adequately promote interaction between these features. Consequently, these
models tend to extract redundant features, especially in areas with intricate
details such as wrinkles and edges. To tackle these issues, we propose MSF-Net,
a novel framework for extracting information at multiple stages, paired with
selective update strategy, aiming to extract high-quality feature information,
which is critical for accurate normal construction. Additionally, we have
developed a feature fusion module to improve the interplay among different
features. Experimental results on the DiLiGenT benchmark show that our proposed
MSF-Net significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in the
accuracy of surface normal estimation.

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is emerging as a compelling solution for
medical image segmentation under privacy constraints, yet current approaches
often ignore sample difficulty and struggle with noisy supervision under domain
shift. We present a new SFDA framework that leverages Hard Sample Selection and
Denoised Patch Mixing to progressively align target distributions. First,
unlabeled images are partitioned into reliable and unreliable subsets through
entropy-similarity analysis, allowing adaptation to start from easy samples and
gradually incorporate harder ones. Next, pseudo-labels are refined via Monte
Carlo-based denoising masks, which suppress unreliable pixels and stabilize
training. Finally, intra- and inter-domain objectives mix patches between
subsets, transferring reliable semantics while mitigating noise. Experiments on
benchmark datasets show consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods,
delivering more accurate boundary delineation and achieving state-of-the-art
Dice and ASSD scores. Our study highlights the importance of progressive
adaptation and denoised supervision for robust segmentation under domain shift.

Motivation: 原始Rectified Flow模型依赖大量生成数据且偏向生成数据，导致计算成本高且性能受限。

Method: 提出了一种结合真实图像的新训练方法，通过保留真实图像的ODE路径来减少对生成数据的依赖，并使用更小的生成和真实图像集高效进行reflow过程。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，新方法不仅在一步生成中表现更优，在全步模拟中也显著提升了FID分数，同时减少了生成数据的使用量。

Conclusion: 通过将真实图像融入训练过程，新方法有效减少了对大量生成数据的依赖，同时在CIFAR-10上取得了更好的FID分数，并生成了更直的ODE路径。

Abstract: Rectified flow is a generative model that learns smooth transport mappings
between two distributions through an ordinary differential equation (ODE).
Unlike diffusion-based generative models, which require costly numerical
integration of a generative ODE to sample images with state-of-the-art quality,
rectified flow uses an iterative process called reflow to learn smooth and
straight ODE paths. This allows for relatively simple and efficient generation
of high-quality images. However, rectified flow still faces several challenges.
1) The reflow process requires a large number of generative pairs to preserve
the target distribution, leading to significant computational costs. 2) Since
the model is typically trained using only generated image pairs, its
performance heavily depends on the 1-rectified flow model, causing it to become
biased towards the generated data.
  In this work, we experimentally expose the limitations of the original
rectified flow and propose a novel approach that incorporates real images into
the training process. By preserving the ODE paths for real images, our method
effectively reduces reliance on large amounts of generated data. Instead, we
demonstrate that the reflow process can be conducted efficiently using a much
smaller set of generated and real images. In CIFAR-10, we achieved
significantly better FID scores, not only in one-step generation but also in
full-step simulations, while using only of the generative pairs compared to the
original method. Furthermore, our approach induces straighter paths and avoids
saturation on generated images during reflow, leading to more robust ODE

Abstract: Real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices is
essential for applications such as autonomous driving, human-computer
interaction, and mobile health. However, prior work often overlooks the tight
coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex
inter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device
multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.
Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire
inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,
allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also
introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that
captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain
accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for
fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during
inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and
input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration
optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for
each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping
mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early
predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public
multimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly
reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various
system and data dynamics.

Motivation: 深度生成模型的进步使得人脸视频操纵更加容易，引发了欺诈和虚假信息的担忧。现有检测器依赖伪造特定伪影，难以泛化至多样操纵技术。

Method: DeepShield框架通过局部补丁引导（LPG）和全局伪造多样化（GFD）增强CLIP-ViT编码器。LPG通过时空伪影建模和补丁级监督捕捉细粒度不一致性；GFD通过域特征增强合成多样化伪造，减少过拟合并提升跨域适应性。

Conclusion: DeepShield通过结合局部和全局分析，显著提升了深度伪造检测的鲁棒性，尤其在跨数据集和跨操作评估中表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have made it easier to manipulate
face videos, raising significant concerns about their potential misuse for
fraud and misinformation. Existing detectors often perform well in in-domain
scenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to
their reliance on forgery-specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce
DeepShield, a novel deepfake detection framework that balances local
sensitivity and global generalization to improve robustness across unseen
forgeries. DeepShield enhances the CLIP-ViT encoder through two key components:
Local Patch Guidance (LPG) and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD). LPG
applies spatiotemporal artifact modeling and patch-wise supervision to capture
fine-grained inconsistencies often overlooked by global models. GFD introduces
domain feature augmentation, leveraging domain-bridging and boundary-expanding
feature generation to synthesize diverse forgeries, mitigating overfitting and
enhancing cross-domain adaptability. Through the integration of novel local and
global analysis for deepfake detection, DeepShield outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, achieving superior
robustness against unseen deepfake attacks.

TL;DR: 研究评估了深度学习在TOF分类中的应用，FT-UNetFormer表现最佳，但复杂结构分类仍有挑战，需多样化训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业景观中的非森林树木（TOF）对生物多样性、碳封存和微气候调节具有重要作用，但现有研究多将其视为单一类别或依赖刚性规则阈值，限制了生态解释和跨区域适应性。

Method: 比较了卷积神经网络（CNNs）、视觉变换器和混合CNN-变换器模型，共六种语义分割架构（ABCNet、LSKNet、FT-UNetFormer、DC-Swin、BANet和U-Net），用于映射四种木质植被类别。

Result: 模型在四个景观中均取得良好分类准确度，FT-UNetFormer表现最佳（平均IoU 0.74；平均F1分数0.84），但在复杂结构（如Patch和Tree类）分类中仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: 深度学习模型，特别是FT-UNetFormer，在TOF分类中表现出色，强调了空间上下文理解的重要性。研究还指出需要区域多样化的训练数据以确保大规模映射的可靠性。

Abstract: Trees Outside Forests (TOF) play an important role in agricultural landscapes
by supporting biodiversity, sequestering carbon, and regulating microclimates.
Yet, most studies have treated TOF as a single class or relied on rigid
rule-based thresholds, limiting ecological interpretation and adaptability
across regions. To address this, we evaluate deep learning for TOF
classification using a newly generated dataset and high-resolution aerial
imagery from four agricultural landscapes in Germany. Specifically, we compare
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers, and hybrid
CNN-transformer models across six semantic segmentation architectures (ABCNet,
LSKNet, FT-UNetFormer, DC-Swin, BANet, and U-Net) to map four categories of
woody vegetation: Forest, Patch, Linear, and Tree, derived from previous
studies and governmental products. Overall, the models achieved good
classification accuracy across the four landscapes, with the FT-UNetFormer
performing best (mean Intersection-over-Union 0.74; mean F1 score 0.84),
underscoring the importance of spatial context understanding in TOF mapping and
classification. Our results show good results for Forest and Linear class and
reveal challenges particularly in classifying complex structures with high edge
density, notably the Patch and Tree class. Our generalization experiments
highlight the need for regionally diverse training data to ensure reliable
large-scale mapping. The dataset and code are openly available at

TL;DR: ResNetUNet3+结合CBAM在多期CT肝脏肿瘤分割中表现最优，超越Transformer和Mamba架构，展现了经典架构与现代注意力结合的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多期对比增强CT（CECT）中肝脏结构的准确分割对计算机辅助诊断和治疗规划（如肿瘤检测）至关重要，需评估不同架构的性能。

Method: 研究了基于UNet的架构（从原始UNet扩展到UNet3+）及不同主干网络（ResNet、Transformer、Mamba），并引入注意力机制（如CBAM模块）以提升分割质量。

Result: ResNetUNet3+结合CBAM模块表现最佳，Dice分数0.755、IoU 0.662，边界描绘最精确（HD95距离77.911），整体准确率0.925，特异性0.926。

Conclusion: 经典ResNet架构与现代注意力模块结合在医学图像分割任务中仍具高度竞争力，为临床实践中的肝脏肿瘤检测提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Segmentation of liver structures in multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed
tomography (CECT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis and
treatment planning for liver diseases, including tumor detection. In this
study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver
tumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+
with various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and
State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights.
Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models
consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across
multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we
introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating
the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance.
ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a
Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise
boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The
model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of
0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately
identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance
interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the
region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its
decision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet
architecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly
competitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising
direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.

Conclusion: RT-DETRv4模型家族在COCO数据集上取得了最先进的结果，展示了其在实时检测中的实用性和高效性。

Abstract: Real-time object detection has achieved substantial progress through
meticulously designed architectures and optimization strategies. However, the
pursuit of high-speed inference via lightweight network designs often leads to
degraded feature representation, which hinders further performance improvements
and practical on-device deployment. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective
and highly adaptable distillation framework that harnesses the rapidly evolving
capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance lightweight object
detectors. Given the significant architectural and learning objective
disparities between VFMs and resource-constrained detectors, achieving stable
and task-aligned semantic transfer is challenging. To address this, on one
hand, we introduce a Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) module that facilitates the
integration of high-level representations from VFMs into the deep layers of the
detector. On the other hand, we devise a Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation
(GAM) strategy, which dynamically adjusts the intensity of semantic transfer
based on gradient norm ratios. Without increasing deployment and inference
overhead, our approach painlessly delivers striking and consistent performance
gains across diverse DETR-based models, underscoring its practical utility for
real-time detection. Our new model family, RT-DETRv4, achieves state-of-the-art
results on COCO, attaining AP scores of 49.7/53.5/55.4/57.0 at corresponding
speeds of 273/169/124/78 FPS.

Method: RegionE框架包含三个主要组件：自适应区域划分、区域感知生成和自适应速度衰减缓存。通过区分编辑和未编辑区域，采用不同的生成策略，优化计算效率。

Result: 在多个先进的IIE基础模型上测试，RegionE实现了2.06至2.57倍的加速，且语义和感知保真度得到保持。

Conclusion: RegionE通过区域感知的生成框架显著加速了指令引导的图像编辑任务，同时保持了语义和感知的保真度。

Abstract: Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread
attention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,
while the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of
regions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational
redundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead
applying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates
us to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that
accelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE
framework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We
observed that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for
multi-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in
the early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited
regions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the
reference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,
we replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.
For edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative
denoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,
we propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost
while incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.
Observing that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity
similarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate
the local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base
models, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE
achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06. Evaluations by GPT-4o
confirmed that semantic and perceptual fidelity were well preserved.

Method: 提出LangHOPS框架，利用MLLM的多模态能力，将对象-部分层次结构建立在语言空间中，并通过MLLM驱动的部分查询细化策略进行优化。

Result: 在PartImageNet数据集上，LangHOPS比之前的方法提高了5.5%（领域内）和4.8%（跨数据集）的AP，在ADE20K的零样本分割中提升了2.5%的mIOU。

Conclusion: LangHOPS通过语言空间中的对象-部分层次结构，结合MLLM的知识和推理能力，实现了开放词汇对象-部分实例分割的最先进性能。

Abstract: We propose LangHOPS, the first Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based
framework for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation. Given an
image, LangHOPS can jointly detect and segment hierarchical object and part
instances from open-vocabulary candidate categories. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping, our approach grounds
object-part hierarchies in language space. It integrates the MLLM into the
object-part parsing pipeline to leverage its rich knowledge and reasoning
capabilities, and link multi-granularity concepts within the hierarchies. We
evaluate LangHOPS across multiple challenging scenarios, including in-domain
and cross-dataset object-part instance segmentation, and zero-shot semantic
segmentation. LangHOPS achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous
methods by 5.5% Average Precision (AP) (in-domain) and 4.8% (cross-dataset) on
the PartImageNet dataset and by 2.5% mIOU on unseen object parts in ADE20K
(zero-shot). Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the
language-grounded hierarchy and MLLM driven part query refinement strategy. The
code will be released here.

Motivation: 现有的源自由领域自适应方法在面对源-目标领域差异大的挑战性场景时，存在伪标签不可靠或生成伪源数据时领域差异扩大的问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为Diffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation (DPTM)的新框架，该框架基于伪标签的可靠性将目标样本分为信任集和非信任集，并通过潜在扩散模型对非信任集样本进行语义转换，同时保持其在目标分布中。此外，设计了逐步优化机制，通过迭代细化减少伪目标域与真实目标域之间的领域差异。

Conclusion: DPTM框架通过利用未标记目标数据作为参考，可靠地生成并逐步优化伪目标域，显著提升了在源自由领域自适应任务中的性能，尤其在源-目标差距大的场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is a challenging task that tackles
domain shifts using only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data.
Existing SFDA methods are restricted by the fundamental limitation of
source-target domain discrepancy. Non-generation SFDA methods suffer from
unreliable pseudo-labels in challenging scenarios with large domain
discrepancies, while generation-based SFDA methods are evidently degraded due
to enlarged domain discrepancies in creating pseudo-source data. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel generation-based framework named
Diffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation (DPTM) that leverages
unlabeled target data as references to reliably generate and progressively
refine a pseudo-target domain for SFDA. Specifically, we divide the target
samples into a trust set and a non-trust set based on the reliability of
pseudo-labels to sufficiently and reliably exploit their information. For
samples from the non-trust set, we develop a manipulation strategy to
semantically transform them into the newly assigned categories, while
simultaneously maintaining them in the target distribution via a latent
diffusion model. Furthermore, we design a progressive refinement mechanism that
progressively reduces the domain discrepancy between the pseudo-target domain
and the real target domain via iterative refinement. Experimental results
demonstrate that DPTM outperforms existing methods by a large margin and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four prevailing SFDA benchmark
datasets with different scales. Remarkably, DPTM can significantly enhance the
performance by up to 18.6% in scenarios with large source-target gaps.

Motivation: 现有方法通常将视线物体检测和视线跟随分开解决，且依赖于头部相关先验知识，限制了系统的联合优化和实际应用。因此，需要一种不依赖头部先验的统一框架。

Method: GaTector+ 采用扩展的特定-通用-特定特征提取器，利用共享骨干网络提取通用特征，同时在共享骨干网络前后使用特定模块以适应子任务特性。此外，引入头部检测分支和基于头部的注意力机制，提出注意力监督机制加速视线热图学习，并设计了新的评估指标 mSoC。

Conclusion: GaTector+ 是一个统一的框架，用于视线物体检测和视线跟随，消除了推理阶段对头部相关先验的依赖，实验结果表明其在多个基准数据集上均表现优异。

Abstract: Gaze object detection and gaze following are fundamental tasks for
interpreting human gaze behavior or intent. However, most previous methods
usually solve these two tasks separately, and their prediction of gaze objects
and gaze following typically depend on head-related prior knowledge during both
the training phase and real-world deployment. This dependency necessitates an
auxiliary network to extract head location, thus precluding joint optimization
across the entire system and constraining the practical applicability. To this
end, we propose GaTector+, a unified framework for gaze object detection and
gaze following, which eliminates the dependence on the head-related priors
during inference. Specifically, GaTector+ uses an expanded
specific-general-specific feature extractor that leverages a shared backbone,
which extracts general features for gaze following and object detection using
the shared backbone while using specific blocks before and after the shared
backbone to better consider the specificity of each sub-task. To obtain
head-related knowledge without prior information, we first embed a head
detection branch to predict the head of each person. Then, before regressing
the gaze point, a head-based attention mechanism is proposed to fuse the sense
feature and gaze feature with the help of head location. Since the
suboptimization of the gaze point heatmap leads to the performance bottleneck,
we propose an attention supervision mechanism to accelerate the learning of the
gaze heatmap. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation metric, mean Similarity
over Candidates (mSoC), for gaze object detection, which is more sensitive to
variations between bounding boxes. The experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both gaze
object detection and gaze following tasks.

Conclusion: PDA（Prototype-Driven Alignment）作为一种轻量级的插件式度量头，有效缓解了少样本目标检测中的基类偏见和不稳定校准问题，显著提升了新类别的性能，同时对基类影响极小且计算开销可忽略。

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) often suffers from base-class bias and
unstable calibration when only a few novel samples are available. We propose
Prototype-Driven Alignment (PDA), a lightweight, plug-in metric head for DeFRCN
that provides a prototype-based "second opinion" complementary to the linear
classifier. PDA maintains support-only prototypes in a learnable
identity-initialized projection space and optionally applies
prototype-conditioned RoI alignment to reduce geometric mismatch. During
fine-tuning, prototypes can be adapted via exponential moving average(EMA)
updates on labeled foreground RoIs-without introducing class-specific
parameters-and are frozen at inference to ensure strict protocol compliance.
PDA employs a best-of-K matching scheme to capture intra-class multi-modality
and temperature-scaled fusion to combine metric similarities with detector
logits. Experiments on VOC FSOD and GFSOD benchmarks show that PDA consistently
improves novel-class performance with minimal impact on base classes and
negligible computational overhead.

Abstract: The rapid growth of streaming video applications demands multimodal models
with enhanced capabilities for temporal dynamics understanding and complex
reasoning. However, current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) datasets suffer
from two critical limitations: 1) Static annotation mechanisms fail to capture
the evolving nature of answers in temporal video streams, and 2) The absence of
explicit reasoning process annotations restricts model interpretability and
logical deduction capabilities. To address these challenges, We introduce
StreamingCoT, the first dataset explicitly designed for temporally evolving
reasoning in streaming VideoQA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks. Our
framework first establishes a dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture that
generates per-second dense descriptions and constructs temporally-dependent
semantic segments through similarity fusion, paired with question-answer sets
constrained by temporal evolution patterns. We further propose an explicit
reasoning chain generation paradigm that extracts spatiotemporal objects via
keyframe semantic alignment, derives object state transition-based reasoning
paths using large language models, and ensures logical coherence through
human-verified validation. This dataset establishes a foundation for advancing
research in streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and
multimodal inference. Our StreamingCoT and its construction toolkit can be

to proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation,
has been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample
selection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to
embed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information,
combined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism,
is utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for
annotation. However, the most representative skeleton sequences may not
necessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model may
have already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples.
To solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active
learning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process
(MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train an
informative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection of
skeleton sequences for annotation. To enhance the representational capacity of
the factors in the state-action pairs within our method, we project them from
Euclidean space to hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we introduce a meta tuning
strategy to accelerate the deployment of our method in real-world scenarios.
Extensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: 研究提出无需专家标注的放射组学方法，用于CAC评分，效果优于深度学习模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决冠状动脉钙化评分（CAC）在早期检测和风险分层中标注数据有限的问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于放射组学的流程，利用伪标签生成训练标签，无需专家定义的分割。同时探索了预训练基础模型（CT-FM和RadImageNet）提取图像特征，并与传统分类器结合使用。

Result: 在182名患者的临床CCTA数据集上评估，放射组学模型表现优于深度学习特征。

Conclusion: 基于放射组学的模型在缺乏专家标注的情况下，显著优于基于基础模型的CNN嵌入方法（准确率达84%，p<0.05）。

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring plays a crucial role in the early
detection and risk stratification of coronary artery disease (CAD). In this
study, we focus on non-contrast coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)
scans, which are commonly used for early calcification detection in clinical
settings. To address the challenge of limited annotated data, we propose a
radiomics-based pipeline that leverages pseudo-labeling to generate training
labels, thereby eliminating the need for expert-defined segmentations.
Additionally, we explore the use of pretrained foundation models, specifically
CT-FM and RadImageNet, to extract image features, which are then used with
traditional classifiers. We compare the performance of these deep learning
features with that of radiomics features. Evaluation is conducted on a clinical
CCTA dataset comprising 182 patients, where individuals are classified into two
groups: zero versus non-zero calcium scores. We further investigate the impact
of training on non-contrast datasets versus combined contrast and non-contrast
datasets, with testing performed only on non contrast scans. Results show that
radiomics-based models significantly outperform CNN-derived embeddings from
foundation models (achieving 84% accuracy and p<0.05), despite the
unavailability of expert annotations.

TL;DR: PEP-FedPT通过结合全局与类特定提示，实现了联邦学习中视觉Transformer的高效个性化调优，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全局提示调优在异构客户端上泛化能力不足，而个性化调优易过拟合本地数据的问题。

Method: 提出了PEP-FedPT框架，引入Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP)，基于类特定提示和全局共享提示的自适应组合，通过联邦平均技术协同优化。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、TinyImageNet、DomainNet和iNaturalist数据集上，PEP-FedPT均优于现有基线方法，展现了高效和泛化的联邦提示调优能力。

Conclusion: PEP-FedPT 框架通过结合全局和类特定提示，成功实现了在联邦学习中既保持泛化能力又实现个性化的目标，为视觉Transformer的高效调优提供了新方向。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) has
proven highly effective as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for
adapting large models to downstream tasks with limited data. Its parameter
efficiency makes it particularly suitable for Federated Learning (FL), where
both communication and computation budgets are often constrained. However,
global prompt tuning struggles to generalize across heterogeneous clients,
while personalized tuning overfits to local data and lacks generalization. We
propose PEP-FedPT (Prompt Estimation from Prototypes for Federated Prompt
Tuning), a unified framework designed to achieve both generalization and
personalization in federated prompt tuning of ViTs. Within this framework, we
introduce the novel Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) - based on
class-specific prompts maintained alongside a globally shared prompt. For each
input, CCMP adaptively combines class-specific prompts using weights derived
from global class prototypes and client class priors. This approach enables
per-sample prompt personalization without storing client-dependent trainable
parameters. The prompts are collaboratively optimized via traditional federated
averaging technique on the same. Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100,
TinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist datasets demonstrate that PEP-FedPT
consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines under diverse data
heterogeneity scenarios, establishing a strong foundation for efficient and
generalizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers.

TL;DR: i-CIR数据集和BASIC方法解决了组合图像检索中数据缺乏的问题，通过实例级类定义和预训练模型的无训练方法实现了显著进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合图像检索（CIR）的研究进展受到高质量训练和评估数据缺乏的限制，因此需要一个新的评估数据集和方法来推动该领域的发展。

Method: BASIC方法利用预训练的视觉语言模型（VLMs），通过分别估计查询图像到图像和查询文本到图像的相似性，进行后期融合，同时通过一系列简单直观的组件进一步改进个体相似性。

Result: i-CIR数据集在保持紧凑性的同时提供了挑战性，BASIC方法在i-CIR和现有CIR数据集上均达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: i-CIR数据集和BASIC方法在组合图像检索（CIR）领域取得了显著进展，特别是在实例级类定义和训练数据缺乏的挑战下。

Abstract: The progress of composed image retrieval (CIR), a popular research direction
in image retrieval, where a combined visual and textual query is used, is held
back by the absence of high-quality training and evaluation data. We introduce
a new evaluation dataset, i-CIR, which, unlike existing datasets, focuses on an
instance-level class definition. The goal is to retrieve images that contain
the same particular object as the visual query, presented under a variety of
modifications defined by textual queries. Its design and curation process keep
the dataset compact to facilitate future research, while maintaining its
challenge-comparable to retrieval among more than 40M random
distractors-through a semi-automated selection of hard negatives.
  To overcome the challenge of obtaining clean, diverse, and suitable training
data, we leverage pre-trained vision-and-language models (VLMs) in a
training-free approach called BASIC. The method separately estimates
query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities, performing late
fusion to upweight images that satisfy both queries, while down-weighting those
that exhibit high similarity with only one of the two. Each individual
similarity is further improved by a set of components that are simple and
intuitive. BASIC sets a new state of the art on i-CIR but also on existing CIR
datasets that follow a semantic-level class definition. Project page:

TL;DR: CoherentAD 是一种无需训练的方法，通过自回归选择生成连贯的音频描述序列，解决了现有独立生成方法的重复和不连贯问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动音频描述方法多为独立生成，导致描述重复且不连贯，无法有效帮助视障观众理解视频内容。

Method: 提出了一种无需训练的方法 CoherentAD，首先生成每个时间间隔的多个候选描述，然后通过自回归选择构建连贯的叙事序列。

Result: CoherentAD 生成的音频描述序列在叙事连贯性和信息量上优于现有方法，并通过新提出的 StoryRecall 指标验证了其效果。

Conclusion: CoherentAD 方法通过自回归选择生成连贯的音频描述序列，显著提升了叙事连贯性，优于现有的独立生成方法。

Abstract: Audio Descriptions (ADs) convey essential on-screen information, allowing
visually impaired audiences to follow videos. To be effective, ADs must form a
coherent sequence that helps listeners to visualise the unfolding scene, rather
than describing isolated moments. However, most automatic methods generate each
AD independently, often resulting in repetitive, incoherent descriptions. To
address this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first
generates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then
performs auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and
informative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a
sequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs
convey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture
the redundancy across consecutive AD outputs. Our method produces coherent AD
sequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches
that rely on independent generations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归图像生成模型推理速度慢，推测解码在文本生成中有效但图像生成领域应用不足，主要由于采样空间大和二维空间结构利用不足。

Method: 引入Hawk方法，利用图像的空间结构指导推测模型进行更准确和高效的预测。

Result: 在多个文本到图像基准测试中，Hawk实现了1.71倍的加速，同时保持了图像保真度和多样性。

Conclusion: Hawk方法通过利用图像的空间结构，显著提升了自回归图像生成模型的推理速度，同时保持了图像质量和多样性。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image generation models are capable of producing
high-fidelity images but often suffer from slow inference due to their
inherently sequential, token-by-token decoding process. Speculative decoding,
which employs a lightweight draft model to approximate the output of a larger
AR model, has shown promise in accelerating text generation without
compromising quality. However, its application to image generation remains
largely underexplored. The challenges stem from a significantly larger sampling
space, which complicates the alignment between the draft and target model
outputs, coupled with the inadequate use of the two-dimensional spatial
structure inherent in images, thereby limiting the modeling of local
dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hawk, a new approach
that harnesses the spatial structure of images to guide the speculative model
toward more accurate and efficient predictions. Experimental results on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate a 1.71x speedup over standard AR
models, while preserving both image fidelity and diversity.

Abstract: Humans possess spatial reasoning abilities that enable them to understand
spaces through multimodal observations, such as vision and sound. Large
multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and
reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However,
systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain
limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal
spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for
evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on
post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D
tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout
understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space.
We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation
and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio
and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through
new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers
insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning. Updated

Motivation: 解决现有生成式AI在VFX创建中资源密集且无法泛化到未见效果的局限性。

Method: 设计了基于上下文的学习策略和注意力掩码，以精确解耦和注入关键效果属性，并提出一次性效果适应机制以提高泛化能力。

Result: 实验证明VFXMaster能有效模仿多种效果信息，并在域外效果上表现出色。

Conclusion: VFXMaster作为一个统一的、基于参考的框架，在VFX视频生成中表现出色，不仅能模仿多种动态效果，还能显著泛化到未见过的效果类别。

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are crucial to the expressive power of digital media,
yet their creation remains a major challenge for generative AI. Prevailing
methods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is
resource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen
effects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we
introduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video
generation. It recasts effect generation as an in-context learning task,
enabling it to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from a reference video onto
target content. In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to
unseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning
strategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context
attention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential
effect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect
imitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient
one-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on
tough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories
of effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain
effects. To foster future research, we will release our code, models, and a
comprehensive dataset to the community.

*Mehrshad Eskandarpour,Hossein Soleimani*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: PPO框架在5G负载均衡中表现优异，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高效的移动性管理和负载均衡对于维持密集、高度动态的5G无线接入网络中的服务质量（QoS）至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种基于近端策略优化（PPO）的深度强化学习框架，用于在轻量级纯Python仿真环境中实现自主、QoS感知的负载均衡。控制问题被建模为马尔可夫决策过程，智能体定期调整Cell Individual Offset（CIO）值以引导用户-小区关联。

Result: 经过500多次训练和用户密度增加的应力测试，PPO策略持续改善了KPI趋势（更高的吞吐量和公平性，更低的延迟、抖动、丢包和切换），并表现出快速、稳定的收敛。对比评估显示，PPO在所有KPI上均优于基于规则的ReBuHa和A3以及基于学习的CDQL基线，同时在负载增加时保持更平滑的学习动态和更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: PPO的剪裁策略更新和基于优势的训练为下一代RAN负载均衡提供了稳健、可部署的控制，并完全基于Python工具链实现。

Abstract: Efficient mobility management and load balancing are critical to sustaining
Quality of Service (QoS) in dense, highly dynamic 5G radio access networks. We
present a deep reinforcement learning framework based on Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) for autonomous, QoS-aware load balancing implemented
end-to-end in a lightweight, pure-Python simulation environment. The control
problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process in which the agent
periodically adjusts Cell Individual Offset (CIO) values to steer user-cell
associations. A multi-objective reward captures key performance indicators
(aggregate throughput, latency, jitter, packet loss rate, Jain's fairness
index, and handover count), so the learned policy explicitly balances
efficiency and stability under user mobility and noisy observations. The PPO
agent uses an actor-critic neural network trained from trajectories generated
by the Python simulator with configurable mobility (e.g., Gauss-Markov) and
stochastic measurement noise. Across 500+ training episodes and stress tests
with increasing user density, the PPO policy consistently improves KPI trends
(higher throughput and fairness, lower delay, jitter, packet loss, and
handovers) and exhibits rapid, stable convergence. Comparative evaluations show
that PPO outperforms rule-based ReBuHa and A3 as well as the learning-based
CDQL baseline across all KPIs while maintaining smoother learning dynamics and
stronger generalization as load increases. These results indicate that PPO's
clipped policy updates and advantage-based training yield robust, deployable
control for next-generation RAN load balancing using an entirely Python-based
toolchain.

Motivation: 评估Dropbox、Google Drive和OneDrive在Wi-Fi和LTE网络条件下上传多媒体文件的性能。

Method: 使用Wireshark捕获流量，并分析关键指标（包括延迟、抖动、带宽和数据包丢失）。

Result: Google Drive在两种网络条件下表现最稳定，延迟低且抖动小；Dropbox带宽利用率高但LTE延迟较长；OneDrive行为多变，对移动网络波动敏感。Wi-Fi连接更稳定，LTE性能因平台实现而异。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于更好地理解基于云的存储应用中的流量行为，并建议在更大数据集和异构接入网络下进行进一步分析。

Abstract: The performance of Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive cloud storage services
was evaluated under Wi-Fi and LTE network conditions during multimedia file
uploads. Traffic was captured using Wireshark, and key metrics (including
delay, jitter, bandwidth, and packet loss) were analyzed. Google Drive
maintained the most consistent performance across both types of networks,
showing low latency and reduced jitter. Dropbox showed efficient bandwidth
utilization, but experienced a longer delay over LTE, attributed to a greater
number of intermediate hops. OneDrive presented variable behavior, with
elevated packet rates and increased sensitivity to fluctuations in the mobile
network. A bimodal distribution of packet sizes was observed and modeled using
a dual Poisson function. In general, Wi-Fi connections provided greater
stability for multimedia transfers, while LTE performance varied depending on
platform-specific implementations. The results contribute to a better
understanding of traffic behavior in cloud-based storage applications and
suggest further analysis with larger datasets and heterogeneous access

Motivation: 面对快速变化的通信技术、应用和流量负载，人类设计的静态CC算法难以应对，学习型CC（如强化学习）提供了高效解决方案，但仍需深入研究其局限性和挑战。

Method: 通过可重复和系统化的研究，对比学习型CC与TCP Cubic和BBR（版本3）等人类设计的CC算法，建立评估方法论并进行大规模实验。

Result: 研究表明，将公平性直接嵌入奖励函数有效，但公平性无法泛化至未见条件；现有RL学习型CC方法能获取全部可用带宽并保持低延迟；最新学习型CC在带宽和延迟动态变化时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 学习型拥塞控制（CC）在动态变化的网络环境中展现出潜力，但在带宽和延迟动态变化条件下表现不佳，且对非拥塞性丢包抵抗能力有限。

Abstract: Learning-based congestion control (CC), including Reinforcement-Learning,
promises efficient CC in a fast-changing networking landscape, where evolving
communication technologies, applications and traffic workloads pose severe
challenges to human-derived, static CC algorithms. Learning-based CC is in its
early days and substantial research is required to understand existing
limitations, identify research challenges and, eventually, yield deployable
solutions for real-world networks. In this paper, we extend our prior work and
present a reproducible and systematic study of learning-based CC with the aim
to highlight strengths and uncover fundamental limitations of the
state-of-the-art. We directly contrast said approaches with widely deployed,
human-derived CC algorithms, namely TCP Cubic and BBR (version 3). We identify
challenges in evaluating learning-based CC, establish a methodology for
studying said approaches and perform large-scale experimentation with
learning-based CC approaches that are publicly available. We show that
embedding fairness directly into reward functions is effective; however, the
fairness properties do not generalise into unseen conditions. We then show that
RL learning-based approaches existing approaches can acquire all available
bandwidth while largely maintaining low latency. Finally, we highlight that
existing the latest learning-based CC approaches under-perform when the
available bandwidth and end-to-end latency dynamically change while remaining
resistant to non-congestive loss. As with our initial study, our
experimentation codebase and datasets are publicly available with the aim to
galvanise the research community towards transparency and reproducibility,
which have been recognised as crucial for researching and evaluating
machine-generated policies.

Abstract: Preamble collision in the random access channel (RACH) is a major bottleneck
in massive machine-type communication (mMTC) scenarios, typical of cellular IoT
(CIoT) deployments. This work proposes a machine learning-based mechanism for
early collision detection during the random access (RA) procedure. A labeled
dataset was generated using the RA procedure messages exchanged between the
users and the base station under realistic channel conditions, simulated in
MATLAB. We evaluate nine classic classifiers -- including tree ensembles,
support vector machines, and neural networks -- across four communication
scenarios, varying both channel characteristics (e.g., Doppler spread,
multipath) and the cell coverage radius, to emulate realistic propagation,
mobility, and spatial conditions. The neural network outperformed all other
models, achieving over 98\% balanced accuracy in the in-distribution evaluation
(train and test drawn from the same dataset) and sustaining 95\% under
out-of-distribution evaluation (train/test from different datasets). To enable
deployment on typical base station hardware, we apply post-training
quantization. Full integer quantization reduced inference time from 2500 ms to
as low as 0.3 ms with negligible accuracy loss. The proposed solution combines
high detection accuracy with low-latency inference, making it suitable for
scalable, real-time CIoT applications found in real networks.

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法平均用户连接率比静态专家配置提高了10.8%。

Conclusion: 该论文通过结合专家知识与强化学习，提出了一种自适应SSB码本设计方法，显著提升了5G毫米波网络中的用户连接性能。

Abstract: Initial access (IA) is the process by which user equipment (UE) establishes
its first connection with a base station. In 5G systems, particularly at
millimeter-wave frequencies, IA integrates beam management to support highly
directional transmissions. The base station employs a codebook of beams for the
transmission of Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSBs), which are periodically
swept to detect and connect users. The design of this SSB codebook is critical
for ensuring reliable, wide-area coverage. In current networks, SSB codebooks
are meticulously engineered by domain experts. While these expert-defined
codebooks provide a robust baseline, they lack flexibility in dynamic or
heterogeneous environments where user distributions vary, limiting their
overall effectiveness. This paper proposes a hybrid Reinforcement Learning (RL)
framework for adaptive SSB codebook design. Building on top of expert
knowledge, the RL agent leverages a pool of expert-designed SSB beams and
learns to adaptively select or combine them based on real-time feedback. This
enables the agent to dynamically tailor codebooks to the actual environment,
without requiring explicit user location information, while always respecting
practical beam constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that, on average,
the proposed approach improves user connectivity by 10.8$\%$ compared to static
expert configurations. These findings highlight the potential of combining
expert knowledge with data-driven optimization to achieve more intelligent,
flexible, and resilient beam management in next-generation wireless networks.

TL;DR: TCP ROCCET 是 CUBIC 的延迟扩展，在 5G 网络中减少延迟和缓冲膨胀，性能优于 CUBIC 并与 BBRv3 相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代蜂窝网络中，基于丢失的 TCP 拥塞控制算法（如 TCP CUBIC）因大 RLC 层缓冲和缓冲膨胀问题表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: 通过分析 TCP CUBIC 的问题，提出了 TCP ROCCET，这是一种基于延迟的扩展，除了包丢失外还基于往返时间响应网络拥塞。

Result: 在真实 5G 网络（包括静止和移动场景）中评估，TCP ROCCET 在变化条件下对网络拥塞的响应表现更佳。

Conclusion: TCP ROCCET 在减少延迟和缓冲膨胀方面表现优于标准 CUBIC 实现，且无需特定网络架构，同时在吞吐量上与 TCP BBRv3 相当但保持更低延迟。

Abstract: The behavior of loss-based TCP congestion control algorithms like TCP CUBIC
continues to be a challenge in modern cellular networks. Due to the large RLC
layer buffers required to deal with short-term changes in channel capacity, the
behavior of both the Slow Start and congestion avoidance phases may be heavily
impacted by the lack of packet losses and the resulting bufferbloat. While
existing congestion control algorithms like TCP BBR do tend to perform better
even in the presence of large bottleneck buffers, they still tend to fill the
buffer more than necessary and can have fairness issues when compared to
loss-based algorithms.
  In this paper, we analyze the issues with the use of loss-based congestion
control algorithms by analyzing TCP CUBIC, which is currently the most popular
variant. To mitigate the issues experienced by TCP CUBIC in cellular networks,
we introduce TCP ROCCET, a latency-based extension of TCP CUBIC that responds
to network congestion based on round-trip time in addition to packet loss.
  Our findings show that TCP ROCCET can reduce latency and bufferbloat compared

architecture. Compared to TCP BBRv3, ROCCET offers similar throughput while
maintaining lower overall latency. The evaluation was conducted in real 5G
networks, including both stationary and mobile scenarios, confirming ROCCET's
improved response to network congestion under varying conditions.

Motivation: 远程渲染使轻量设备能通过将计算密集型任务卸载到远程服务器来访问高性能图形内容，但引发了跨网络组件（如远程计算节点、5G核心、RAN和UE）的能源消耗问题。

Method: 提出并评估了两种能源监测解决方案（硬件和软件），使用基于MoQ协议的CNF部署的VR远程渲染器作为测试案例，分析不同多媒体和网络配置下的能源消耗。

Result: 研究结果揭示了5G环境中真实VR应用在能源消耗与性能之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 本研究通过硬件和软件两种互补的能源监测解决方案，评估了5G环境中远程渲染VR应用的能源消耗与性能之间的权衡，为实际应用提供了关键见解。

Abstract: This paper investigates the energy implications of remote rendering for
Virtual Reality (VR) applications within a real 5G testbed. Remote rendering
enables lightweight devices to access high-performance graphical content by
offloading computationally intensive tasks to Cloud-native Network Functions
(CNFs) running on remote servers. However, this approach raises concerns
regarding energy consumption across the various network components involved,
including the remote computing node, the 5G Core, the Radio Access Network
(RAN), and the User Equipment (UE). This work proposes and evaluates two
complementary energy monitoring solutions, one hardware-based and one
software-based, to measure energy consumption at different system levels. A VR
remote renderer, deployed as CNF and leveraging the Media over QUIC (MoQ)
protocol, is used as test case for assessing its energy footprint under
different multimedia and network configurations. The results provide critical
insights into the trade-off between energy consumption and performance of a
real-world VR application running in a 5G environment.

TL;DR: 论文通过仿真评估了LEO卫星网络中多种拥塞控制方案的表现，揭示了当前方案的局限性，并提出了设计LEO专用协议的见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LEO卫星网络因频繁切换、快速变化的往返时间（RTT）和非拥塞性丢包，带来了独特的拥塞控制挑战。

Method: 结合LeoEM框架的轨道动力学与Mininet微基准测试，评估了损失型（Cubic, SaTCP）、模型型（BBRv3）和学习型（Vivace, Sage, Astraea）三类拥塞控制算法，并考察了与主动队列管理（AQM）的交互。

Result: 研究发现：(1) 感知切换的损失型方案能回收带宽但增加延迟；(2) BBRv3保持高吞吐但延迟变化反应慢；(3) 学习型方案在动态条件下表现不佳但对非拥塞性丢包有抵抗力；(4) RTT不对称和多瓶颈导致公平性显著下降；(5) AQM可恢复公平性并提升效率。

Conclusion: 当前拥塞控制方案在LEO卫星网络中存在关键限制，研究结果为设计特定于LEO的数据传输协议提供了见解。

Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks introduce unique congestion control
(CC) challenges due to frequent handovers, rapidly changing round-trip times
(RTTs), and non-congestive loss. This paper presents the first comprehensive,
emulation-driven evaluation of CC schemes in LEO networks, combining realistic
orbital dynamics via the LeoEM framework with targeted Mininet
micro-benchmarks. We evaluated representative CC algorithms from three classes,
loss-based (Cubic, SaTCP), model-based (BBRv3), and learning-based (Vivace,
Sage, Astraea), across diverse single-flow and multi-flow scenarios, including
interactions with active queue management (AQM). Our findings reveal that: (1)
handover-aware loss-based schemes can reclaim bandwidth but at the cost of
increased latency; (2) BBRv3 sustains high throughput with modest delay
penalties, yet reacts slowly to abrupt RTT changes; (3) RL-based schemes
severely underperform under dynamic conditions, despite being notably resistant
to non-congestive loss; (4) fairness degrades significantly with RTT asymmetry
and multiple bottlenecks, especially in human-designed CC schemes; and (5) AQM
at bottlenecks can restore fairness and boost efficiency. These results expose
critical limitations in current CC schemes and provide insight for designing
LEO-specific data transport protocols.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着用户对高速、低延迟通信需求的增长，传统蜂窝系统无法满足未来海量异构设备连接的需求，D2D通信成为提升网络容量和灵活性的关键解决方案。

Method: 使用K-means聚类方法根据距离对用户设备（UEs）和蜂窝用户（CUs）进行分片。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于距离的K-means聚类方法，实现了不通过eNB的设备间直接通信（D2D），以应对未来高数据速率需求的网络挑战。

Abstract: In the conventional cellular system, devices are not allowed to communicate
directly with each other in the licensed cellular bandwidth and all
communications take place through the base stations. The users requirements has
led the technology to become fast and faster. Multimedia rich data exchange,
fast service, high quality voice calls, newer and more demanding applications,
information at fingertips, everything requires technology and communication
between devices. A constant need to increase network capacity for meeting the
users growing demands has led to the growth of cellular communication networks
from the first generation(1G) to the fifth generation(5G). There will be crores
of connected devices in the coming future . A large number of connections are
going to be heterogeneous, demanding lesser delays, higher data rates, superior
throughput and enhanced system capacity. The available spectrum resources are
limited and has to be flexibly used by mobile network operators to cope with
the rising demands. An emerging facilitator of the upcoming high data rate
demanding next-generation networks are device-to-device(D2D) communication.
This paper has developed a model that establishes Device-to-Device (D2D)
communication between two end-users without involving the eNB (evolved Node B).
We have sharded the UEs and CUs based on the criteria of DISTANCE. To do so, we
used the K-means clustering method.

Motivation: 地下环境中信号严重衰减和空气-土壤界面折射导致卫星到地下网络的可靠下行通信困难。

Method: 采用基于近端策略优化(PPO)算法的深度强化学习解决方案框架，结合分布感知动作建模和多分支演员网络，解决了高维非凸优化问题。

Result: 在真实地下管道监测场景下的仿真结果显示，该方法相比传统基准策略，在不同UD数量和地下条件下平均最大最小速率增益超过167%。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种基于协作速率分割(CRS)的新型传输框架，通过联合优化功率分配、消息分割和时间调度，显著提升了地下设备(UDs)的最小可达速率，验证了其在不确定信道条件下的优越性能。

Abstract: Reliable downlink communication in satellite-to-underground networks remains
challenging due to severe signal attenuation caused by underground soil and
refraction in the air-soil interface. To address this, we propose a novel
cooperative rate-splitting (CRS)-aided transmission framework, where an
aboveground relay decodes and forwards the common stream to underground devices
(UDs). Based on this framework, we formulate a max-min fairness optimization
problem that jointly optimizes power allocation, message splitting, and time
slot scheduling to maximize the minimum achievable rate across UDs. To solve
this high-dimensional non-convex problem under uncertain channels, we develop a
deep reinforcement learning solution framework based on the proximal policy
optimization (PPO) algorithm that integrates distribution-aware action modeling
and a multi-branch actor network. Simulation results under a realistic
underground pipeline monitoring scenario demonstrate that the proposed approach
achieves average max-min rate gains exceeding $167\%$ over conventional
benchmark strategies across various numbers of UDs and underground conditions.

Motivation: 解决增强现实和虚拟现实中物理与数字世界无缝同步的挑战，尤其是在实时应用中延迟对用户体验的影响。

Method: 采用深度强化学习（DRL）框架MetaLore，动态共享传感器和移动设备间的通信带宽与计算资源，优化同步性能，同时确保高吞吐量和端到端延迟保证。

Result: MetaLore通过小规模任务导向的观察空间（网络侧的两个队列长度）实现了与暴力枚举解决方案相当的性能，并能灵活自主地适应动态流量条件。

Conclusion: MetaLore框架通过深度强化学习（DRL）优化了元宇宙或数字孪生环境中的通信和计算资源分配，显著提升了同步性能，并通过新颖的AoI指标（AoRI和AoSI）增强了同步质量。

Abstract: As augmented and virtual reality evolve, achieving seamless synchronization
between physical and digital realms remains a critical challenge, especially
for real-time applications where delays affect the user experience. This paper
presents MetaLore, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based framework for
joint communication and computational resource allocation in Metaverse or
digital twin environments. MetaLore dynamically shares the communication
bandwidth and computational resources among sensors and mobile devices to
optimize synchronization, while offering high throughput performance. Special
treatment is given in satisfying end-to-end delay guarantees. A key
contribution is the introduction of two novel Age of Information (AoI) metrics:
Age of Request Information (AoRI) and Age of Sensor Information (AoSI),
integrated into the reward function to enhance synchronization quality. An open
source simulator has been extended to incorporate and evaluate the approach.
The DRL solution is shown to achieve the performance of full-enumeration
brute-force solutions by making use of a small, task-oriented observation space
of two queue lengths at the network side. This allows the DRL approach the
flexibility to effectively and autonomously adapt to dynamic traffic
conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代代码库的复杂性增加，需要能够理解跨组件变更意图的检索系统，而现有函数级搜索范式缺乏这一能力。

Method: 提出了ReflectCode，一种基于对抗反射增强的双塔架构，包含解耦的code_encoder和doc_encoder组件，通过大语言模型引导的反射动态整合多种信息。

Result: ReflectCode在Top-5准确率和召回率上分别比现有最优方法提高了12.2%和7.1%。

Conclusion: ReflectCode通过动态整合语法模式、函数依赖和语义扩展意图，显著提升了代码检索的性能，为上下文感知的代码检索开辟了新方向。

Abstract: The escalating complexity of modern codebases has intensified the need for
retrieval systems capable of interpreting cross-component change intents, a
capability fundamentally absent in conventional function-level search
paradigms. While recent studies have improved the alignment between natural
language queries and code snippets, retrieving contextually relevant code for
specific change requests remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we
introduce RepoAlign-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed to
evaluate repository-level code retrieval under change request driven scenarios,
encompassing 52k annotated instances. This benchmark shifts the retrieval
paradigm from function-centric matching to holistic repository-level reasoning.
Furthermore, we propose ReflectCode, an adversarial reflection augmented
dual-tower architecture featuring disentangled code_encoder and doc_encoder
components. ReflectCode dynamically integrates syntactic patterns, function
dependencies, and semantic expansion intents through large language model
guided reflection. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ReflectCode
achieves 12.2% improvement in Top-5 Accuracy and 7.1% in Recall over
state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new direction for context-aware code
retrieval.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-assisted software engineering has brought
transformative potential to the field of software engineering, but existing
tools and paradigms remain limited by cognitive overload, inefficient tool
integration, and the narrow capabilities of AI copilots. In response, we
propose Compiler.next, a novel search-based compiler designed to enable the
seamless evolution of AI-native software systems as part of the emerging
Software Engineering 3.0 era. Unlike traditional static compilers,
Compiler.next takes human-written intents and automatically generates working
software by searching for an optimal solution. This process involves dynamic
optimization of cognitive architectures and their constituents (e.g., prompts,
foundation model configurations, and system parameters) while finding the
optimal trade-off between several objectives, such as accuracy, cost, and
latency. This paper outlines the architecture of Compiler.next and positions it
as a cornerstone in democratizing software development by lowering the
technical barrier for non-experts, enabling scalable, adaptable, and reliable
AI-powered software. We present a roadmap to address the core challenges in
intent compilation, including developing quality programming constructs,
effective search heuristics, reproducibility, and interoperability between
compilers. Our vision lays the groundwork for fully automated, search-driven
software development, fostering faster innovation and more efficient AI-driven
systems.

Motivation: LLM的不可靠性阻碍了其广泛应用，当前工具和框架存在碎片化问题，导致LLM及基于LLM的软件缺乏可靠性、鲁棒性和可信度。

Method: 提出LLM脚本语言（LSL）的愿景，探索控制LLM输出、强制交互结构化的方法，并将其与验证、验证和可解释性相结合。

Result: 提出LSL作为解决方案，旨在通过可编程和与训练或实现解耦的方式改进LLM交互。

Conclusion: 开发一种用于脚本化与大型语言模型（LLM）交互的领域特定语言（LSL）可能是提升基于AI应用的关键。

Abstract: We are witnessing a bloom of AI-powered software driven by Large Language
Models (LLMs). Although the applications of these LLMs are impressive and
seemingly countless, their unreliability hinders adoption. In fact, the
tendency of LLMs to produce faulty or hallucinated content makes them
unsuitable for automating workflows and pipelines. In this regard, Software
Engineering (SE) provides valuable support, offering a wide range of formal
tools to specify, verify, and validate software behaviour. Such SE tools can be
applied to define constraints over LLM outputs and, consequently, offer
stronger guarantees on the generated content. In this paper, we argue that the
development of a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for scripting interactions with
LLMs using an LLM Scripting Language (LSL) may be key to improve AI-based
applications. Currently, LLMs and LLM-based software still lack reliability,
robustness, and trustworthiness, and the tools or frameworks to cope with these
issues suffer from fragmentation. In this paper, we present our vision of LSL.
With LSL, we aim to address the limitations above by exploring ways to control
LLM outputs, enforce structure in interactions, and integrate these aspects
with verification, validation, and explainability. Our goal is to make LLM
interaction programmable and decoupled from training or implementation.

Abstract: We introduce VeriStruct, a novel framework that extends AI-assisted automated
verification from single functions to more complex data structure modules in
Verus. VeriStruct employs a planner module to orchestrate the systematic
generation of abstractions, type invariants, specifications, and proof code. To
address the challenge that LLMs often misunderstand Verus' annotation syntax

In an evaluation on eleven Rust data structure modules, VeriStruct succeeds on
ten of the eleven, successfully verifying 128 out of 129 functions (99.2%) in
total. These results represent an important step toward the goal of automatic
AI-assisted formal verification.

Abstract: The future of Requirements Engineering (RE) is increasingly driven by
artificial intelligence (AI), reshaping how we elicit, analyze, and validate
requirements. Traditional RE is based on labor-intensive manual processes prone
to errors and complexity. AI-powered approaches, specifically large language
models (LLMs), natural language processing (NLP), and generative AI, offer
transformative solutions and reduce inefficiencies. However, the use of AI in
RE also brings challenges like algorithmic bias, lack of explainability, and
ethical concerns related to automation. To address these issues, this study
introduces the Human-AI RE Synergy Model (HARE-SM), a conceptual framework that
integrates AI-driven analysis with human oversight to improve requirements
elicitation, analysis, and validation. The model emphasizes ethical AI use
through transparency, explainability, and bias mitigation. We outline a
multi-phase research methodology focused on preparing RE datasets, fine-tuning
AI models, and designing collaborative human-AI workflows. This preliminary
study presents the conceptual framework and early-stage prototype
implementation, establishing a research agenda and practical design direction
for applying intelligent data science techniques to semi-structured and

Motivation: 现有静态基准测试快速饱和，动态基准虽能适应模型发展但成本高昂，因此需开发自动化动态基准设计框架。

Method: BeTaL利用环境设计原则，通过参数化基准模板的关键设计选择，并借助LLM推理参数空间，以高效成本实现目标属性（如难度和真实性）。

Result: BeTaL创建的基准测试在目标难度上平均偏差为5.3%至13.2%，比基线方法显著提升。

Conclusion: BeTaL框架通过自动化动态基准设计，显著提升了基准测试的难度控制精确度，比基线方法提高了2-4倍。

Abstract: The rapid progress and widespread deployment of LLMs and LLM-powered agents
has outpaced our ability to evaluate them. Hand-crafted, static benchmarks are
the primary tool for assessing model capabilities, but these quickly become
saturated. In contrast, dynamic benchmarks evolve alongside the models they
evaluate, but are expensive to create and continuously update. To address these
challenges, we develop BeTaL (Benchmark Tuning with an LLM-in-the-loop), a
framework that leverages environment design principles to automate the process
of dynamic benchmark design. BeTaL works by parameterizing key design choices
in base benchmark templates and uses LLMs to reason through the resulting
parameter space to obtain target properties (such as difficulty and realism) in
a cost-efficient manner. We validate this approach on its ability to create
benchmarks with desired difficulty levels. Using BeTaL, we create two new
benchmarks and extend a popular agentic benchmark $\tau$-bench. Extensive
evaluation on these three tasks and multiple target difficulty levels shows
that BeTaL produces benchmarks much closer to the desired difficulty, with
average deviations ranging from 5.3% to 13.2% -- a 2-4x improvement over the
baselines.

Abstract: Plagiarism detection in programming education faces growing challenges due to
increasingly sophisticated obfuscation techniques, particularly automated
refactoring-based attacks. While code plagiarism detection systems used in
education practice are resilient against basic obfuscation, they struggle
against structural modifications that preserve program behavior, especially
caused by refactoring-based obfuscation. This paper presents a novel and
extensible framework that enhances state-of-the-art detectors by leveraging
code property graphs and graph transformations to counteract refactoring-based
obfuscation. Our comprehensive evaluation of real-world student submissions,
obfuscated using both algorithmic and AI-based obfuscation attacks,

Result: 在两项基准测试中，Adapt比最佳基线方法多证明了16.63%和18.58%的定理，且在五种不同LLM上表现良好。

Conclusion: Adapt框架通过动态选择验证策略，显著提升了定理证明的成功率，并展示了良好的通用性和组件贡献度。

Abstract: Formal verification via theorem proving enables the expressive specification
and rigorous proof of software correctness, but it is difficult to scale due to
the significant manual effort and expertise required. While Large Language
Models (LLMs) show potential in proof generation, they frequently produce
incorrect proofs on the first attempt and require additional strategies for
iterative refinement. However, existing approaches employ fixed refinement
strategies and cannot dynamically choose an effective strategy based on the
particular issues in a generated proof, which limits their performance. To
overcome this limitation, we introduce Adapt, a novel proof refinement
framework that leverages an LLM-guided decision-maker to dynamically select a
suitable refinement strategy according to the state of the proof assistant and
available context of an incorrect proof. We evaluate Adapt on two benchmarks
against four existing methods and find that it significantly outperforms the
best baseline on both by proving 16.63% and 18.58% more theorems, respectively.
Furthermore, we demonstrate Adapt's generalizability by evaluating it across
five different LLMs. We also conduct ablation studies to measure the
contribution of each component and compare the trade-offs of alternative
decision-maker designs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发者在测试阶段才能发现 REST API 的规范违反，且错误信息通常缺乏详细诊断信息，导致调试过程繁琐。

Method: dcFix 通过识别不符合规范的代码片段，将其与相关 API 规范整合到提示中，并利用大型语言模型（LLM）生成修正后的代码。

Result: 评估显示，dcFix 能够准确检测误用，并优于忽略代码片段与 API 规范不符的基线方法。

Conclusion: dcFix 是一种有效的方法，能够准确检测并自动修复 REST API 的误用，优于基线方法。

Abstract: Many cloud services provide REST API accessible to client applications.
However, developers often identify specification violations only during
testing, as error messages typically lack the detail necessary for effective
diagnosis. Consequently, debugging requires trial and error. This study
proposes dcFix, a method for detecting and automatically repairing REST API
misuses in client programs. In particular, dcFix identifies non-conforming code
fragments, integrates them with the relevant API specifications into prompts,
and leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce the corrected code. Our
evaluation demonstrates that dcFix accurately detects misuse and outperforms
the baseline approach, in which prompts to the LLM omit any indication of code
fragments non conforming to REST API specifications.

Motivation: 现有的通用代码注释生成方法无法满足开发者对实现细节和用户对使用说明的多样化需求，因此需要多意图注释生成。尽管LLMs在该领域取得进展，但在少量示例中构建意图、代码和注释的正确关系仍具挑战性。

Method: KUMIC框架基于上下文学习，设计了检索机制获取高代码-注释一致性的示例，并利用Chain-of-Thought引导LLMs生成与特定意图对齐的注释。

Result: KUMIC在BLEU、METEOR、ROUGE-L和SBERT指标上分别比现有最优方法提升了14.49%、22.41%、20.72%和12.94%。

Conclusion: KUMIC框架通过结合检索机制和Chain-of-Thought策略，显著提升了多意图代码注释生成的性能，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Code comment generation aims to produce a generic overview of a code snippet,
helping developers understand and maintain code. However, generic summaries
alone are insufficient to meet the diverse needs of practitioners; for example,
developers expect the implementation insights to be presented in an untangled
manner, while users seek clear usage instructions. This highlights the
necessity of multi-intent comment generation. With the widespread adoption of
Large Language Models (LLMs) for code-related tasks, these models have been
leveraged to tackle the challenge of multi-intent comment generation. Despite
their successes, state-of-the-art LLM-based approaches often struggle to
construct correct relationships among intents, code, and comments within a
smaller number of demonstration examples. To mitigate this issue, we propose a
framework named KUMIC for multi-intent comment generation. Built upon
in-context learning, KUMIC leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to optimize
knowledge utilization for LLMs to generate intent-specific comments.
Specifically, KUMIC first designs a retrieval mechanism to obtain similar
demonstration examples, which exhibit high code-comment consistency. Then,
KUMIC leverages CoT to guide LLMs to focus on statements facilitating the
derivation of code comments aligned with specific intents. In this context,
KUMIC constructs a mapping knowledge chain, linking code to intent-specific
statements to comments, which enables LLMs to follow similar reasoning steps
when generating the desired comments. We conduct extensive experiments to
evaluate KUMIC, and the results demonstrate that KUMIC outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by 14.49\%, 22.41\%, 20.72\%, and 12.94\% in terms
of BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and SBERT, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着嵌入式系统规模和复杂度的增加，确保系统可靠性（尤其是安全性）需要选择合适的编程语言。TECS/Rust框架因过度独占控制导致性能下降，需改进。

Method: 提出TECS/Rust-OE框架，利用调用流优化独占控制，通过自动生成Rust代码实现高性能和可重用性。

Result: 评估显示，优化后的独占控制减少了开销，生成的代码具有高可重用性。

Conclusion: TECS/Rust-OE通过利用实时操作系统的独占控制机制优化性能，同时保持内存安全和组件可重用性，解决了TECS/Rust框架中的性能瓶颈问题。

Abstract: The diversification of functionalities and the development of the IoT are
making embedded systems larger and more complex in structure. Ensuring system
reliability, especially in terms of security, necessitates selecting an
appropriate programming language. As part of existing research, TECS/Rust has
been proposed as a framework that combines Rust and component-based development
(CBD) to enable scalable system design and enhanced reliability. This framework
represents system structures using static mutable variables, but excessive
exclusive controls applied to ensure thread safety have led to performance
degradation. This paper proposes TECS/Rust-OE, a memory-safe CBD framework
utilizing call flows to address these limitations. The proposed Rust code
leverages real-time OS exclusive control mechanisms, optimizing performance
without compromising reusability. Rust code is automatically generated based on
component descriptions. Evaluations demonstrate reduced overhead due to
optimized exclusion control and high reusability of the generated code.

TL;DR: TECS/Rust是一个基于Rust的嵌入式系统组件框架，解决了C语言的内存安全问题，同时保持高效和灵活。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着嵌入式系统的复杂性和规模增加，组件化开发（CBD）成为解决方案，但C语言的内存问题限制了其安全性。

Method: 提出了一种基于Rust的TECS框架（TECS/Rust），利用Rust的编译时内存安全特性（如生命周期和借用）来自动生成组件代码，并支持与实时操作系统的集成。

Result: 生成的代码占实际代码的很大比例，且执行时间差异极小，框架引入的开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: TECS/Rust框架通过Rust的内存安全特性有效解决了C语言在嵌入式系统组件开发中的内存问题，同时保持了组件开发的灵活性和高效性。

Abstract: As embedded systems grow in complexity and scale due to increased functional
diversity, component-based development (CBD) emerges as a solution to
streamline their architecture and enhance functionality reuse. CBD typically
utilizes the C programming language for its direct hardware access and
low-level operations, despite its susceptibility to memory-related issues. To
address these concerns, this paper proposes TECS/Rust, a Rust-based framework
specifically designed for TECS, which is a component framework for embedded
systems. It leverages Rust's compile-time memory-safe features, such as
lifetime and borrowing, to mitigate memory vulnerabilities common with C. The
proposed framework not only ensures memory safety but also maintains the
flexibility of CBD, automates Rust code generation for CBD components, and
supports efficient integration with real-time operating systems. An evaluation
of the amount of generated code indicates that the code generated by this paper
framework accounts for a large percentage of the actual code. Compared to code
developed without the proposed framework, the difference in execution time is
minimal, indicating that the overhead introduced by the proposed framework is
negligible.

TL;DR: 研究发现，结合PBT和EBT的混合测试方法能更有效地检测LLM生成代码的边缘案例，提升代码可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）在软件开发中生成代码的增多，确保其代码质量变得重要。传统EBT方法常遗漏边缘案例，本研究探讨LLM生成的PBT与EBT在边缘案例检测中的特性。

Method: 分析了16个HumanEval问题，使用Claude-4-sonnet生成PBT和EBT测试代码，比较了两种方法在边缘案例检测中的表现。

Result: 单独使用PBT或EBT的缺陷检测率为68.75%，结合使用后提升至81.25%。PBT擅长检测性能问题和边缘案例，EBT擅长检测特定边界条件和特殊模式。

Conclusion: 结合基于属性的测试（PBT）和基于示例的测试（EBT）的混合方法可以提高LLM生成代码的可靠性，为LLM代码生成的测试策略提供指导。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly generate code in software
development, ensuring the quality of LLM-generated code has become important.
Traditional testing approaches using Example-based Testing (EBT) often miss
edge cases -- defects that occur at boundary values, special input patterns, or
extreme conditions. This research investigates the characteristics of
LLM-generated Property-based Testing (PBT) compared to EBT for exploring edge
cases. We analyze 16 HumanEval problems where standard solutions failed on
extended test cases, generating both PBT and EBT test codes using
Claude-4-sonnet. Our experimental results reveal that while each method
individually achieved a 68.75\% bug detection rate, combining both approaches
improved detection to 81.25\%. The analysis demonstrates complementary
characteristics: PBT effectively detects performance issues and edge cases
through extensive input space exploration, while EBT effectively detects
specific boundary conditions and special patterns. These findings suggest that
a hybrid approach leveraging both testing methods can improve the reliability
of LLM-generated code, providing guidance for test generation strategies in
LLM-based code generation.

TL;DR: Prometheus是一种AI辅助系统，通过模块化分解和重组提高代码验证效率，验证成功率显著高于基线，尤其在复杂场景下表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管形式验证对构建可靠软件至关重要，但其高昂的专业要求和复杂性限制了广泛应用。现代AI虽能识别数学证明模式，但如何有效整合到验证过程中仍是挑战。

Method: Prometheus采用分解-重组的工作流程，将复杂逻辑分解为可验证的小组件，并在验证后重新组合。系统还允许用户通过自然语言指导来辅助验证过程。

Result: Prometheus在精选数据集中验证了86%的任务，基线为68%。在规范复杂度增加时，验证率从30%提升至69%；整合复杂程序的证明大纲后，从25%提升至87%。

Conclusion: Prometheus通过结合AI能力和模块化软件工程原则，显著提高了代码验证的效率，特别是在处理复杂规范时表现更佳。

Abstract: Formal verification is increasingly recognized as a critical foundation for
building reliable software systems. However, the need for specialized expertise
to write precise specifications, navigate complex proof obligations, and learn
annotations often makes verification an order of magnitude more expensive than
implementation. While modern AI systems can recognize patterns in mathematical
proofs and interpret natural language, effectively integrating them into the
formal verification process remains an open challenge. We present Prometheus, a
novel AI-assisted system that facilitates automated code verification with
current AI capabilities in conjunction with modular software engineering
principles (e.g., modular refactoring). Our approach begins by decomposing
complex program logic, such as nested loops, into smaller, verifiable
components. Once verified, these components are recomposed to construct a proof
of the original program. This decomposition-recomposition workflow is
non-trivial. Prometheus addresses this by guiding the proof search through
structured decomposition of complex lemmas into smaller, verifiable sub-lemmas.
When automated tools are insufficient, users can provide lightweight natural
language guidance to steer the proof process effectively. Our evaluation
demonstrates that transiently applying modular restructuring to the code
substantially improves the AI's effectiveness in verifying individual
components. This approach successfully verifies 86% of tasks in our curated
dataset, compared to 68% for the baseline. Gains are more pronounced with
increasing specification complexity, improving from 30% to 69%, and when
integrating proof outlines for complex programs, from 25% to 87%.

Abstract: AI agents have rapidly gained popularity across research and industry as
systems that extend large language models with additional capabilities to plan,
use tools, remember, and act toward specific goals. Yet despite their promise,
developers face persistent and often underexplored challenges when building,
deploying, and maintaining these emerging systems. To identify these
challenges, we study developer discussions on Stack Overflow, the world's
largest developer-focused Q and A platform with about 60 million questions and
answers and 30 million users. We construct a taxonomy of developer challenges
through tag expansion and filtering, apply LDA-MALLET for topic modeling, and
manually validate and label the resulting themes. Our analysis reveals seven
major areas of recurring issues encompassing 77 distinct technical challenges
related to runtime integration, dependency management, orchestration
complexity, and evaluation reliability. We further quantify topic popularity
and difficulty to identify which issues are most common and hardest to resolve,
map the tools and programming languages used in agent development, and track
their evolution from 2021 to 2025 in relation to major AI model and framework
releases. Finally, we present the implications of our results, offering
concrete guidance for practitioners, researchers, and educators on agent
reliability and developer support.

Conclusion: 研究得出结论，并对未来研究或应用提出建议。

Abstract: Large Language Models have gained remarkable interest in industry and
academia. The increasing interest in LLMs in academia is also reflected in the
number of publications on this topic over the last years. For instance, alone
78 of the around 425 publications at ICSE 2024 performed experiments with LLMs.
Conducting empirical studies with LLMs remains challenging and raises questions
on how to achieve reproducible results, for both other researchers and
practitioners. One important step towards excelling in empirical research on
LLMs and their application is to first understand to what extent current
research results are eventually reproducible and what factors may impede
reproducibility. This investigation is within the scope of our work. We
contribute an analysis of the reproducibility of LLM-centric studies, provide
insights into the factors impeding reproducibility, and discuss suggestions on
how to improve the current state. In particular, we studied the 86 articles
describing LLM-centric studies, published at ICSE 2024 and ASE 2024. Of the 86
articles, 18 provided research artefacts and used OpenAI models. We attempted
to replicate those 18 studies. Of the 18 studies, only five were fit for
reproduction. For none of the five studies, we were able to fully reproduce the
results. Two studies seemed to be partially reproducible, and three studies did
not seem to be reproducible. Our results highlight not only the need for
stricter research artefact evaluations but also for more robust study designs
to ensure the reproducible value of future publications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模糊测试方法如AFL++主要关注覆盖率最大化，忽视了能源消耗问题，导致大量碳排放和资源浪费。

Method: GreenAFL引入了两项关键改进：能量感知的语料库最小化和能量引导的启发式算法，以优化模糊测试的能源效率。

Result: 实验表明，GreenAFL在保持高覆盖率的同时，显著降低了能源消耗，尤其是在使用至少一项改进措施时效果最佳。

Conclusion: GreenAFL通过结合能量消耗的动态调整策略，在保持高覆盖率的同时显著降低了模糊测试的环境影响。

Abstract: Fuzzing has become a key search-based technique for software testing, but
continuous fuzzing campaigns consume substantial computational resources and
generate significant carbon footprints. Existing grey-box fuzzing approaches
like AFL++ focus primarily on coverage maximisation, without considering the
energy costs of exploring different execution paths. This paper presents
GreenAFL, an energy-aware framework that incorporates power consumption into
the fuzzing heuristics to reduce the environmental impact of automated testing
whilst maintaining coverage. GreenAFL introduces two key modifications to
traditional fuzzing workflows: energy-aware corpus minimisation considering
power consumption when reducing initial corpora, and energy-guided heuristics
that direct mutation towards high-coverage, low-energy inputs. We conduct an
ablation study comparing vanilla AFL++, energy-based corpus minimisation, and
energy-based heuristics to evaluate the individual contributions of each
component. Results show that highest coverage, and lowest energy usage is
achieved whenever at least one of our modifications is used.

TL;DR: LOCALIZE是一个低代码、配置优先的框架，旨在简化无线电定位实验，确保可重复性并降低编码工作量，同时保持性能和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决机器学习在无线电定位服务中实验结果的可信性和可比性问题，同时降低编码工作量、确保可重复性，并提供内置扩展性。

Method: LOCALIZE框架通过人类可读的配置声明实验，并使用工作流协调器运行标准化流程，从数据准备到报告生成，所有工件（如数据集、模型、指标和报告）均版本化。

Result: 在定性比较和与普通Jupyter笔记本基线的对比研究中，LOCALIZE框架减少了编写工作量，同时保持了可比的运行时和内存行为。此外，在蓝牙低功耗数据集上的实验表明，随着数据量的增加，编排开销保持在可控范围内。

Conclusion: LOCALIZE框架通过低代码、配置优先的设计，使基于机器学习的无线电定位实验具有可重复性、易用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly permeating radio-based localization
services. To keep results credible and comparable, everyday workflows should
make rigorous experiment specification and exact repeatability the default,
without blocking advanced experimentation. However, in practice, researchers
face a three-way gap that could be filled by a framework that offers (i) low
coding effort for end-to-end studies, (ii) reproducibility by default including
versioned code, data, and configurations, controlled randomness, isolated runs,
and recorded artifacts, and (iii) built-in extensibility so new models,
metrics, and stages can be added with minimal integration effort. Existing
tools rarely deliver all three for machine learning in general and localization
workflows in particular. In this paper we introduce LOCALIZE, a low-code,
configuration-first framework for radio localization in which experiments are
declared in human-readable configuration, a workflow orchestrator runs
standardized pipelines from data preparation to reporting, and all artifacts,
such as datasets, models, metrics, and reports, are versioned. The
preconfigured, versioned datasets reduce initial setup and boilerplate,
speeding up model development and evaluation. The design, with clear extension
points, allows experts to add components without reworking the infrastructure.
In a qualitative comparison and a head-to-head study against a plain Jupyter
notebook baseline, we show that the framework reduces authoring effort while
maintaining comparable runtime and memory behavior. Furthermore, using a
Bluetooth Low Energy dataset, we show that scaling across training data (1x to
10x) keeps orchestration overheads bounded as data grows. Overall, the
framework makes reproducible machine-learning-based localization
experimentation practical, accessible, and extensible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型代理在软件工程中表现出潜力，但环境配置因手动工作量大且缺乏大规模高质量数据集而成为瓶颈。现有基准仅评估端到端构建/测试成功，无法清晰展示代理成功或失败的具体原因。

Method: 通过自动构建任务实例（注入真实的README错误）并在Docker中验证，实现了可扩展、高质量的评估。

Result: 评估表明，代理能够定位错误，但难以将反馈转化为有效修正，限制了端到端性能。

Conclusion: Enconda-bench是首个提供环境配置过程级能力评估的框架，为改进软件工程代理提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Large language model-based agents show promise for software engineering, but
environment configuration remains a bottleneck due to heavy manual effort and
scarce large-scale, high-quality datasets. Existing benchmarks assess only
end-to-end build/test success, obscuring where and why agents succeed or fail.
We introduce the Environment Configuration Diagnosis Benchmark, Enconda-bench,
which provides process-level trajectory assessment of fine-grained agent
capabilities during environment setup-planning, perception-driven error
diagnosis, feedback-driven repair, and action to execute final environment
configuration. Our task instances are automatically constructed by injecting
realistic README errors and are validated in Docker for scalable, high-quality
evaluation. Enconda-bench combines process-level analysis with end-to-end
executability to enable capability assessments beyond aggregate success rates.
Evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs and agent frameworks show that while
agents can localize errors, they struggle to translate feedback into effective
corrections, limiting end-to-end performance. To our knowledge, Enconda-bench
is the first framework to provide process-level internal capability assessment
for environment configuration, offering actionable insights for improving
software engineering agents.

Result: 在屏幕泊松方程和边界条件等多种PDE求解中，相比传统方法（如普通Walk on Spheres、均值缓存和边界值缓存）有显著改进。

Conclusion: 本文提出的统计加权偏中心WoS型估计器通过局部相似性过滤和有原则的加权策略，有效平衡了偏差与方差，在多种PDE求解中表现优于现有方法，并自然扩展到梯度场估计和混合边界问题。

Abstract: Stochastic PDE solvers have emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional
discretization-based methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs),
especially in geometry processing and graphics. While off-centered estimators
enhance sample reuse in WoS-type Monte Carlo solvers, they introduce
correlation artifacts and bias when Green's functions are approximated. In this
paper, we propose a statistically weighted off-centered WoS-type estimator that
leverages local similarity filtering to selectively combine samples across
neighboring evaluation points. Our method balances bias and variance through a
principled weighting strategy that suppresses unreliable estimators. We
demonstrate our approach's effectiveness on various PDEs,including screened
Poisson equations and boundary conditions, achieving consistent improvements
over existing solvers such as vanilla Walk on Spheres, mean value caching, and
boundary value caching. Our method also naturally extends to gradient field
estimation and mixed boundary problems.

Motivation: 修剪曲面上的点包含查询在CAD建模、实体几何处理和曲面细分中至关重要，现有方法如光线投射和广义环绕数在鲁棒性和计算效率方面存在局限性。

Method: 提出了一种递归环绕数计算方案，用基于椭圆的Bezier段边界取代昂贵的曲线细分，实现了线性时间评估。对于周期性曲面，将修剪曲线提升到通用覆盖空间，即使在参数域中存在非可收缩或不连续环也能准确计算环绕数。

Conclusion: 该方法在几何噪声、开放边界和周期拓扑等情况下保持了高鲁棒性，并在处理实际B-Rep模型和修剪曲面的稳健细分中展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Point containment queries on trimmed surfaces are fundamental to CAD
modeling, solid geometry processing, and surface tessellation. Existing
approaches such as ray casting and generalized winding numbers often face
limitations in robustness and computational efficiency.
  We propose a fast and numerically stable method for performing containment
queries on trimmed surfaces, including those with periodic parameterizations.
Our approach introduces a recursive winding number computation scheme that
replaces costly curve subdivision with an ellipse-based bound for Bezier
segments, enabling linear-time evaluation. For periodic surfaces, we lift
trimming curves to the universal covering space, allowing accurate and
consistent winding number computation even for non-contractible or
discontinuous loops in parameter domain.
  Experiments show that our method achieves substantial speedups over existing
winding-number algorithms while maintaining high robustness in the presence of
geometric noise, open boundaries, and periodic topologies. We further
demonstrate its effectiveness in processing real B-Rep models and in robust
tessellation of trimmed surfaces.

Motivation: 传统方法专注于逼真内容生成，而本文针对轻量级、可解释的3D矢量草图，提出文本到3D草图动画的新任务，以解决缺乏配对数据集、结构抽象建模困难以及时间一致性和多视角一致性等挑战。

Method: 4-Doodle框架采用双空间蒸馏方案：一个空间通过可微分的B\'ezier曲线捕捉多视角一致的几何结构，另一个空间通过时间感知先验编码运动动态。此外，还引入了结构感知运动模块，分离形状保持轨迹和变形感知变化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法生成的3D草图动画在时间真实性和结构稳定性上优于现有基线，且在保真度和可控性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 本文提出的4-Doodle框架通过双空间蒸馏方案和结构感知运动模块，成功实现了从文本生成动态3D草图动画，为直观和易访问的4D内容创作迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: We present a novel task: text-to-3D sketch animation, which aims to bring
freeform sketches to life in dynamic 3D space. Unlike prior works focused on
photorealistic content generation, we target sparse, stylized, and
view-consistent 3D vector sketches, a lightweight and interpretable medium
well-suited for visual communication and prototyping. However, this task is
very challenging: (i) no paired dataset exists for text and 3D (or 4D)
sketches; (ii) sketches require structural abstraction that is difficult to
model with conventional 3D representations like NeRFs or point clouds; and
(iii) animating such sketches demands temporal coherence and multi-view
consistency, which current pipelines do not address. Therefore, we propose
4-Doodle, the first training-free framework for generating dynamic 3D sketches
from text. It leverages pretrained image and video diffusion models through a
dual-space distillation scheme: one space captures multi-view-consistent
geometry using differentiable B\'ezier curves, while the other encodes motion
dynamics via temporally-aware priors. Unlike prior work (e.g., DreamFusion),
which optimizes from a single view per step, our multi-view optimization
ensures structural alignment and avoids view ambiguity, critical for sparse
sketches. Furthermore, we introduce a structure-aware motion module that
separates shape-preserving trajectories from deformation-aware changes,
enabling expressive motion such as flipping, rotation, and articulated
movement. Extensive experiments show that our method produces temporally
realistic and structurally stable 3D sketch animations, outperforming existing
baselines in both fidelity and controllability. We hope this work serves as a
step toward more intuitive and accessible 4D content creation.

Mitsuba 3. It provides physically-based simulations of complex phenomena,
including a wide variety of realistic materials and participating media such as
fog or smoke. In addition, we extend Mitsuba 3's functionality to support
time-resolved polarization tracking of light and transient differentiable
rendering. Finally, we also include tools that simplify the use of our
simulations for non-line-of-sight imaging, enabling realistic scene setups with
capture noise to be simulated in just seconds of minutes. Altogether, we hope
that mitransient will support the research community in developing novel

### [112] [Radar DataTree: A FAIR and Cloud-Native Framework for Scalable Weather Radar Archives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24943)
*Alfonso Ladino-Rincon,Stephen W. Nesbitt*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Radar DataTree是一个开源框架，将雷达数据转化为符合FAIR原则的云优化数据集，显著提升了分析效率，并为AI天气基础设施提供了支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 天气雷达数据是科学价值极高但结构利用不足的地球观测数据集。尽管公开可用，但雷达档案仍分散、供应商特定，且不符合FAIR原则，阻碍了大规模研究、可重复性和云原生计算。

Method: 基于FM-301/CfRadial 2.1标准，利用xarray DataTree将雷达体积扫描组织为层次化、元数据丰富的结构，并通过Zarr进行序列化以实现可扩展分析。结合Icechunk实现ACID兼容的存储和版本控制。

Result: 在案例研究中展示了显著的性能提升，包括准垂直剖面（QVP）和降水累积工作流，并通过Raw2Zarr仓库公开所有工具和数据集。

Conclusion: Radar DataTree提供了一个可扩展、开源的数据架构，将操作雷达档案转化为符合FAIR原则的云优化数据集，为雷达数据管理、高性能地理科学和AI就绪的天气基础设施提供了可复制和可扩展的基础。

Abstract: We introduce Radar DataTree, the first dataset-level framework that extends
the WMO FM-301 standard from individual radar volume scans to time-resolved,
analysis-ready archives. Weather radar data are among the most scientifically
valuable yet structurally underutilized Earth observation datasets. Despite
widespread public availability, radar archives remain fragmented,
vendor-specific, and poorly aligned with FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, Reusable) principles, hindering large-scale research,
reproducibility, and cloud-native computation. Radar DataTree addresses these
limitations with a scalable, open-source architecture that transforms
operational radar archives into FAIR-compliant, cloud-optimized datasets. Built
on the FM-301/CfRadial 2.1 standard and implemented using xarray DataTree,
Radar DataTree organizes radar volume scans as hierarchical, metadata-rich
structures and serializes them to Zarr for scalable analysis. Coupled with
Icechunk for ACID-compliant storage and versioning, this architecture enables
efficient, parallel computation across thousands of radar scans with minimal
preprocessing. We demonstrate significant performance gains in case studies
including Quasi-Vertical Profile (QVP) and precipitation accumulation
workflows, and release all tools and datasets openly via the Raw2Zarr
repository. This work contributes a reproducible and extensible foundation for
radar data stewardship, high-performance geoscience, and AI-ready weather
infrastructure.

TL;DR: MRMF方法通过结合低分辨率训练和高分辨率微调，显著减少训练时间而不影响精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络在科学研究中应用广泛，但训练模型通常非常耗时。特别是当训练数据样本为大型高维数组时，能降低计算成本的高效训练方法至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种多分辨率模型融合（MRMF）方法，该方法结合了在降低分辨率数据上训练的模型，并在原始分辨率数据上进行了细化。

Result: 实验结果表明，多分辨率模型融合方法能够显著减少端到端训练时间，同时保持相同的模型精度。在CosmoFlow和Neuron Inverter应用中，训练时间分别缩短了47%和44%。

Conclusion: 多分辨率模型融合（MRMF）方法在保持模型精度的同时显著减少了端到端训练时间。实验证明，该方法在CosmoFlow和Neuron Inverter应用中分别将训练时间缩短了47%和44%。

Abstract: Neural networks are rapidly gaining popularity in scientific research, but
training the models is often very time-consuming. Particularly when the
training data samples are large high-dimensional arrays, efficient training
methodologies that can reduce the computational costs are crucial. To reduce
the training cost, we propose a Multi-Resolution Model Fusion (MRMF) method
that combines models trained on reduced-resolution data and then refined with
data in the original resolution. We demonstrate that these reduced-resolution
models and datasets could be generated quickly. More importantly, the proposed
approach reduces the training time by speeding up the model convergence in each
fusion stage before switching to the final stage of finetuning with data in its
original resolution. This strategy ensures the final model retains
high-resolution insights while benefiting from the computational efficiency of
lower-resolution training. Our experiment results demonstrate that the
multi-resolution model fusion method can significantly reduce end-to-end
training time while maintaining the same model accuracy. Evaluated using two
real-world scientific applications, CosmoFlow and Neuron Inverter, the proposed
method improves the training time by up to 47% and 44%, respectively, as
compared to the original resolution training, while the model accuracy is not
affected.

TL;DR: 提出ER-Mapping和NI-Balancer方法，优化MoE模型在WSC平台的性能，显著提升通信和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GPU集群中专家并行（EP）因跨节点通信开销大而受限的问题，探索晶圆级芯片（WSCs）在托管MoE模型上的潜力。

Method: 提出了Entwined Ring Mapping（ER-Mapping）和Non-invasive Balancer（NI-Balancer）两种方法，分别用于平衡通信压力和隐藏专家迁移开销。

Result: ER-Mapping减少了高达62%的通信开销；NI-Balancer在MoE计算和通信上分别提升了54%和22%。与SOTA NVL72超级节点相比，WSC平台平均每设备MoE性能提升了39%。

Conclusion: 通过提出的ER-Mapping和NI-Balancer方法，显著优化了专家并行（EP）在晶圆级芯片（WSCs）上的性能，提升了MoE模型的计算和通信效率。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale up, mixture-of-experts
(MoE) has become a common technology in SOTA models. MoE models rely on expert
parallelism (EP) to alleviate memory bottleneck, which introduces all-to-all
communication to dispatch and combine tokens across devices. However, in
widely-adopted GPU clusters, high-overhead cross-node communication makes
all-to-all expensive, hindering the adoption of EP. Recently, wafer-scale chips
(WSCs) have emerged as a platform integrating numerous devices on a wafer-sized
interposer. WSCs provide a unified high-performance network connecting all
devices, presenting a promising potential for hosting MoE models. Yet, their
network is restricted to a mesh topology, causing imbalanced communication
pressure and performance loss. Moreover, the lack of on-wafer disk leads to
high-overhead expert migration on the critical path.
  To fully unleash this potential, we first propose Entwined Ring Mapping
(ER-Mapping), which co-designs the mapping of attention and MoE layers to
balance communication pressure and achieve better performance. We find that
under ER-Mapping, the distribution of cold and hot links in the attention and
MoE layers is complementary. Therefore, to hide the migration overhead, we
propose the Non-invasive Balancer (NI-Balancer), which splits a complete expert
migration into multiple steps and alternately utilizes the cold links of both
layers. Evaluation shows ER-Mapping achieves communication reduction up to 62%.
NI-Balancer further delivers 54% and 22% improvements in MoE computation and
communication, respectively. Compared with the SOTA NVL72 supernode, the WSC
platform delivers an average 39% higher per-device MoE performance owing to its
scalability to larger EP.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多阶段隐私保护AI训练方法，通过模拟临床知识图谱和联邦学习框架实现医疗数据安全使用，并在挑战中成功验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床数据的整合对个性化医学发展具有重要潜力，但其使用受到通用数据保护条例（GDPR）的严格限制，尤其是对于罕见病的小规模队列。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的多阶段方法来确保AI训练的安全性，包括在模拟临床知识图谱上设计模型、在受保护执行环境中集成到FeatureCloud联邦学习框架、在医院环境中进行训练以及执行验证评估脚本。

Result: 该方法在TUM.ai Makeathon 2024挑战中成功验证，50名学生在无法访问真实数据的情况下开发了患者分类和诊断模型。

Conclusion: 通过联邦学习框架（如FC框架）部署安全算法，可能是在医疗保健领域实现隐私保护AI的实用方法。

Abstract: The integration of clinical data offers significant potential for the
development of personalized medicine. However, its use is severely restricted
by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), especially for small cohorts
with rare diseases. High-quality, structured data is essential for the
development of predictive medical AI. In this case study, we propose a novel,
multi-stage approach to secure AI training: (1) The model is designed on a
simulated clinical knowledge graph (cKG). This graph is used exclusively to
represent the structural characteristics of the real cKG without revealing any
sensitive content. (2) The model is then integrated into the FeatureCloud (FC)
federated learning framework, where it is prepared in a single-client
configuration within a protected execution environment. (3) Training then takes
place within the hospital environment on the real cKG, either under the direct
supervision of hospital staff or via a fully automated pipeline controlled by
the hospital. (4) Finally, verified evaluation scripts are executed, which only
return aggregated performance metrics. This enables immediate performance
feedback without sensitive patient data or individual predictions, leaving the
clinic. A fundamental element of this approach involves the incorporation of a
cKG, which serves to organize multi-omics and patient data within the context
of real-world hospital environments. This approach was successfully validated
during the TUM.ai Makeathon 2024 (TUMaiM24) challenge set by the Dr. von Hauner
Children's Hospital (HCH-LMU): 50 students developed models for patient
classification and diagnosis without access to real data. Deploying secure
algorithms via federated frameworks, such as the FC framework, could be a
practical way of achieving privacy-preserving AI in healthcare.

Motivation: 探讨在分布式移动系统中，代理是否必须拥有唯一的标签才能保证确定性聚集（gathering），并研究共享标签情况下的问题解决。

Method: 设计了一种算法，能够在多项式时间内聚集所有可聚集团队，同时仅需代理共享少量公共知识（O(log log log μ)位）。

Result: 提出了一个完整的可聚集团队特征化结果，设计了一种高效的聚集算法，并证明了共享少量公共知识的必要性。

Conclusion: 本文通过考虑代理可能共享相同标签的情况，给出了可聚集团队（gatherable teams）的完整特征，并设计了一种在多项式时间内聚集所有团队的高效算法。此外，还证明了共享少量公共知识对实现多项式时间复杂度的必要性。

Abstract: A team of mobile agents, starting from distinct nodes of a network, have to
meet at the same node and declare that they all met. Agents execute the same
algorithm, which they start when activated by an adversary or by an agent
entering their initial node. When activated, agents traverse edges of the
network in synchronous rounds. Their perception and communication are strictly
local. This task, known as gathering, is a central problem in distributed
mobile systems. Most prior work focuses on minimizing its time complexity,
i.e., the worst-case number of rounds between the start of the earliest agent
and the task completion. To break possible symmetries, deterministic solutions
typically assume that agents have pairwise distinct IDs, called labels, known
only to themselves. But must all labels be pairwise distinct to guarantee
deterministic gathering?
  We address this question by considering agents that may share the same label.
A team L is said to be gatherable if, for every initial setting of L, there is
an algorithm that solves gathering. Our contribution is threefold. (1) We give
a full characterization of the gatherable teams. (2) We design an algorithm
that gathers all of them in poly$(n,\log\lambda)$ time, where $n$ (resp.
$\lambda$) is the graph order (resp. the smallest label in L). This algorithm
requires the agents to initially share only $O(\log \log \log \mu)$ bits of
common knowledge, where $\mu$ is the largest label multiplicity in L. (3) We
show this dependency is almost optimal to get a poly$(n,\log\lambda)$-time
complexity.
  As a by-product, we get the first deterministic poly$(n,\log\lambda)$-time
algorithm requiring no common knowledge to gather any team when all labels are
distinct. Known to be achievable for two-agent teams, extending this to any
team size faced a major challenge: termination detection. Our techniques to
address it may be of independent interest.

Conclusion: 本章总结了数据密集型工作负载调度的现有方法，并展望了未来的研究方向。

Abstract: With the explosive growth of big data, workloads tend to get more complex and
computationally demanding. Such applications are processed on distributed
interconnected resources that are becoming larger in scale and computational
capacity. Data-intensive applications may have different degrees of parallelism
and must effectively exploit data locality. Furthermore, they may impose
several Quality of Service requirements, such as time constraints and
resilience against failures, as well as other objectives, like energy
efficiency. These features of the workloads, as well as the inherent
characteristics of the computing resources required to process them, present
major challenges that require the employment of effective scheduling
techniques. In this chapter, a classification of data-intensive workloads is
proposed and an overview of the most commonly used approaches for their
scheduling in large-scale distributed systems is given. We present novel
strategies that have been proposed in the literature and shed light on open
challenges and future directions.

Result: 评估显示，相比现有系统，Holon Streaming在全局聚合任务中实现了5倍延迟降低和2倍吞吐提升，故障场景下延迟减少11倍。

Conclusion: 论文展示了去中心化协调结合确定性的有效性，以及Windowed CRDTs在全局聚合中的实用性。

Abstract: Scaling global aggregations is a challenge for exactly-once stream processing
systems. Current systems implement these either by computing the aggregation in
a single task instance, or by static aggregation trees, which limits
scalability and may become a bottleneck. Moreover, the end-to-end latency is
determined by the slowest path in the tree, and failures and reconfiguration
cause large latency spikes due to the centralized coordination. Towards these
issues, we present Holon Streaming, an exactly-once stream processing system
for global aggregations. Its deterministic programming model uses windowed
conflict-free replicated data types (Windowed CRDTs), a novel abstraction for
shared replicated state. Windowed CRDTs make computing global aggregations
scalable. Furthermore, their guarantees such as determinism and convergence
enable the design of efficient failure recovery algorithms by decentralized
coordination. Our evaluation shows a 5x lower latency and 2x higher throughput
than an existing stream processing system on global aggregation workloads, with
an 11x latency reduction under failure scenarios. The paper demonstrates the
effectiveness of decentralized coordination with determinism, and the utility
of Windowed CRDTs for global aggregations.

Method: 提出了一种新型指标r-score，基于推理树结构衡量查询的学习难度，并设计了Re-Schedule调度算法。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准测试中，平均准确率提升高达3.2%。

Conclusion: 通过引入基于推理树结构的Re-Schedule算法，显著提升了RLVR数据调度的效率与准确性，验证了结构理解对优化的重要性。

Abstract: Using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize Large
Language Models (LLMs) can be conceptualized as progressively editing a query's
`Reasoning Tree'. This process involves exploring nodes (tokens) and
dynamically modifying the model's policy at each node. When combined with data
scheduling, this process yields further gains in data efficiency and accuracy.
However, existing RLVR data scheduling methods typically rely on path-based
metrics to rank queries, overlooking the reasoning tree structures of these
queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, namely Reasoning Score
(r-score), which measures the query's learning difficulty based on the
structure of its reasoning tree. Based on the r-score, we propose the Reasoning
Tree Schedule (Re-Schedule), a scheduling algorithm that constructs a
curriculum progressing from structurally simple (high r-score) to complex (low
r-score) queries. Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show that
Re-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy, achieving gains of up to
3.2%. These strong results validate our approach and demonstrate that a
structural understanding of the reasoning tree provides a more powerful and
principled foundation for RLVR data scheduling.

many real-world systems (e.g. biological systems) contain feedback loops or

counterfactual inference in cyclic SCMs under shift-scale interventions, i.e.,
soft, policy-style changes that rescale and/or shift a variable's mechanism.

Conclusion: ProFees 框架通过 LLM 技术显著提高了 CPT E/M 编码的准确性，验证了其在现实场景中的有效性。

Abstract: Evaluation and Management (E/M) coding, under the Current Procedural
Terminology (CPT) taxonomy, documents medical services provided to patients by
physicians. Used primarily for billing purposes, it is in physicians' best
interest to provide accurate CPT E/M codes. %While important, it is an
auxiliary task that adds to physicians' documentation burden. Automating this
coding task will help alleviate physicians' documentation burden, improve
billing efficiency, and ultimately enable better patient care. However, a
number of real-world complexities have made E/M encoding automation a
challenging task. In this paper, we elaborate some of the key complexities and
present ProFees, our LLM-based framework that tackles them, followed by a
systematic evaluation. On an expert-curated real-world dataset, ProFees
achieves an increase in coding accuracy of more than 36\% over a commercial CPT
E/M coding system and almost 5\% over our strongest single-prompt baseline,
demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the real-world complexities.

Method: 引入了自回归状态追踪提示（ASTP），通过策略性编排的提示使LLM的状态追踪过程显式化并可验证，辅以状态特定的占位符后处理方法确保交易完整性。

Result: 在300个交易对话中，ASTP实现了>99%的状态合规性和99.3%的计算精度，且在较小模型上性能媲美大模型，响应时间从21.2秒降至2.4秒。

Conclusion: ASTP结合占位符后处理方法在较小模型上实现了与大模型相当的性能，同时显著降低了响应时间，为商业游戏提供了既满足实时需求又符合资源限制的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable dynamic game interactions but fail to
follow essential procedural flows in rule-governed trading systems, eroding
player trust. This work resolves the core tension between the creative
flexibility of LLMs and the procedural demands of in-game trading
(browse-offer-review-confirm). To this end, Autoregressive State-Tracking
Prompting (ASTP) is introduced, a methodology centered on a strategically
orchestrated prompt that compels an LLM to make its state-tracking process
explicit and verifiable. Instead of relying on implicit contextual
understanding, ASTP tasks the LLM with identifying and reporting a predefined
state label from the previous turn. To ensure transactional integrity, this is
complemented by a state-specific placeholder post-processing method for
accurate price calculations. Evaluation across 300 trading dialogues
demonstrates >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision. Notably,
ASTP with placeholder post-processing on smaller models (Gemini-2.5-Flash)
matches larger models' (Gemini-2.5-Pro) performance while reducing response
time from 21.2s to 2.4s, establishing a practical foundation that satisfies
both real-time requirements and resource constraints of commercial games.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has been crucial for enabling
multi-step reasoning in large reasoning models (LRMs), yet current reward
schemes are typically outcome-centric. We propose PM4GRPO, a reasoning-aware
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that augments standard answer/format
rewards with signals over the reasoning procedure. To this end, process mining
techniques are utilized to compute a scalar conformance reward that measures
how closely a policy model's reasoning aligns with the pretrained teacher
model. The empirical results on five benchmarks demonstrate that PM4GRPO
significantly outperforms existing methodologies for GRPO-based post-training.
These results highlight that leveraging process mining for reasoning-aware GRPO
effectively enhances the reasoning capabilities of policy models.

Abstract: Stock movement prediction remains fundamentally challenging due to complex

inter-stock relationships. Existing approaches often fail to unify structural,
semantic, and regime-adaptive modeling within a scalable framework. This work
introduces H3M-SSMoEs, a novel Hypergraph-based MultiModal architecture with
LLM reasoning and Style-Structured Mixture of Experts, integrating three key
innovations: (1) a Multi-Context Multimodal Hypergraph that hierarchically
captures fine-grained spatiotemporal dynamics via a Local Context Hypergraph
(LCH) and persistent inter-stock dependencies through a Global Context
Hypergraph (GCH), employing shared cross-modal hyperedges and Jensen-Shannon
Divergence weighting mechanism for adaptive relational learning and cross-modal
alignment; (2) a LLM-enhanced reasoning module, which leverages a frozen large
language model with lightweight adapters to semantically fuse and align
quantitative and textual modalities, enriching representations with
domain-specific financial knowledge; and (3) a Style-Structured Mixture of
Experts (SSMoEs) that combines shared market experts and industry-specialized
experts, each parameterized by learnable style vectors enabling regime-aware
specialization under sparse activation. Extensive experiments on three major
stock markets demonstrate that H3M-SSMoEs surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both superior predictive accuracy and investment performance, while exhibiting
effective risk control. Datasets, source code, and model weights are available

questions over a structured Knowledge Base (KB). Recent work improves KBQA by
adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries,
and interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically
fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision,
which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the
agentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that
can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To
incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under
outcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning
with an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic
capabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of
high-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling.
Then, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it
applies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy
to hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful
reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three
mainstream datasets. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1
achieves up to an 11.1% relative improvement while using only one-twelfth of
the training data, demonstrating strong agentic reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全调节方法多为静态层，仅提供二元分类，无法满足多模态系统对动态、可解释安全调节的需求。

Method: 引入Agentic Moderation框架，利用Shield、Responder、Evaluator和Reflector等动态协作代理进行上下文感知调节。

Result: 在五个数据集和四种大型视觉语言模型上的实验表明，攻击成功率降低7-19%，拒绝率提升4-20%。

Conclusion: Agentic Moderation通过动态协作代理实现了上下文感知和可解释的调节，显著降低攻击成功率并提升拒绝率，展现了代理系统在自动化安全治理中的广泛潜力。

Abstract: Agentic methods have emerged as a powerful and autonomous paradigm that
enhances reasoning, collaboration, and adaptive control, enabling systems to
coordinate and independently solve complex tasks. We extend this paradigm to
safety alignment by introducing Agentic Moderation, a model-agnostic framework
that leverages specialised agents to defend multimodal systems against
jailbreak attacks. Unlike prior approaches that apply as a static layer over
inputs or outputs and provide only binary classifications (safe or unsafe), our
method integrates dynamic, cooperative agents, including Shield, Responder,
Evaluator, and Reflector, to achieve context-aware and interpretable
moderation. Extensive experiments across five datasets and four representative
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate that our approach reduces the
Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 7-19%, maintains a stable Non-Following Rate (NF),
and improves the Refusal Rate (RR) by 4-20%, achieving robust, interpretable,
and well-balanced safety performance. By harnessing the flexibility and
reasoning capacity of agentic architectures, Agentic Moderation provides
modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement, highlighting the
broader potential of agentic systems as a foundation for automated safety
governance.

Conclusion: EneAD框架通过自适应感知模块和鲁棒决策模块，显著降低了自动驾驶系统的能耗，同时保持了感知精度和驾驶稳定性，实验证明其在能耗和驾驶性能上的优越性。

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an emerging technology that is expected to bring
significant social, economic, and environmental benefits. However, these
benefits come with rising energy consumption by computation engines, limiting
the driving range of vehicles, especially electric ones. Perception computing
is typically the most power-intensive component, as it relies on largescale
deep learning models to extract environmental features. Recently, numerous
studies have employed model compression techniques, such as sparsification,
quantization, and distillation, to reduce computational consumption. However,
these methods often result in either a substantial model size or a significant
drop in perception accuracy compared to high-computation models. To address
these challenges, we propose an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework,
called EneAD. In the adaptive perception module, a perception optimization
strategy is designed from the perspective of data management and tuning.
Firstly, we manage multiple perception models with different computational
consumption and adjust the execution framerate dynamically. Then, we define
them as knobs and design a transferable tuning method based on Bayesian
optimization to identify promising knob values that achieve low computation
while maintaining desired accuracy. To adaptively switch the knob values in
various traffic scenarios, a lightweight classification model is proposed to
distinguish the perception difficulty in different scenarios. In the robust
decision module, we propose a decision model based on reinforcement learning
and design a regularization term to enhance driving stability in the face of
perturbed perception results. Extensive experiments evidence the superiority of
our framework in both energy consumption and driving performance. EneAD can
reduce perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x and thus improve driving range by
3.9% to 8.5%

Motivation: 受认知科学启发，发现‘为什么这是答案’比‘答案是什么’更容易回答，避免了开放式探索的认知负担，转而通过解释性重构来提升推理质量。

Method: 研究者提出了RAVR（Reference-Answer-guided Variational Reasoning）框架，利用答案作为条件来引导推理路径的生成。

Result: 实验表明，RAVR在通用和数学领域均优于基线方法，减少了推理中的犹豫，并强化了问题特定的策略。

Conclusion: RAVR框架通过答案引导的变分推理，显著提升了大型语言模型在复杂任务中的推理能力，减少了犹豫并增强了结论的巩固。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can refine the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs), but critically depends on a key prerequisite: the LLM
can already generate high-utility reasoning paths with non-negligible
probability. For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path
can be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal
reasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is
this the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it
avoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for
explanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a
question to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to
derive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove
that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled
reasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones.
Building on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided
Variational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned
reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments
in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR
reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes
problem-specific strategies in reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业事件日志的复杂性（如大规模、高维度、异构数据）使得传统自动特征工程方法（如AutoML）在可解释性和适应性上表现不足，亟需一种更灵活且自适应的解决方案。

Method: FELA采用多智能体协作系统（包括Idea Agents、Code Agents、Critic Agents和Evaluation Agent），结合强化学习和遗传算法原理，实现了特征空间的探索与利用平衡。

Conclusion: FELA作为一个基于LLM的多智能体系统，展示了在复杂工业环境中自动化、可解释且自适应的特征工程潜力，显著提升了模型性能并减少了人工干预。

Abstract: Event log data, recording fine-grained user actions and system events,
represent one of the most valuable assets for modern digital services. However,
the complexity and heterogeneity of industrial event logs--characterized by
large scale, high dimensionality, diverse data types, and intricate temporal or
relational structures--make feature engineering extremely challenging. Existing
automatic feature engineering approaches, such as AutoML or genetic methods,
often suffer from limited explainability, rigid predefined operations, and poor
adaptability to complicated heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose FELA
(Feature Engineering LLM Agents), a multi-agent evolutionary system that
autonomously extracts meaningful and high-performing features from complex
industrial event log data. FELA integrates the reasoning and coding
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with an insight-guided
self-evolution paradigm. Specifically, FELA employs specialized agents--Idea
Agents, Code Agents, and Critic Agents--to collaboratively generate, validate,
and implement novel feature ideas. An Evaluation Agent summarizes feedback and
updates a hierarchical knowledge base and dual-memory system to enable
continual improvement. Moreover, FELA introduces an agentic evolution
algorithm, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to
balance exploration and exploitation across the idea space. Extensive
experiments on real industrial datasets demonstrate that FELA can generate
explainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model
performance while reducing manual effort. Our results highlight the potential
of LLM-based multi-agent systems as a general framework for automated,
interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex real-world
environments.

Abstract: Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the
complexity of multiple co-occurring disorders. To address this, we develop a
novel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR)
construction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502
synthetic EMRs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures
clinical relevance and diversity. Our multi-agent framework transfers the
clinical interview protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree,
supporting over 130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards.
Through this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale
dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic
dialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy
and treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric
comorbidity research. Compared to real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk
exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length,
token distribution, and diagnostic reasoning strategies. Licensed psychiatrists
confirm the realism and diagnostic validity of the dialogues. This dataset
enables the development and evaluation of models capable of multi-disorder
psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass.

TL;DR: GAP框架通过图形化规划实现子任务并行与串行执行，显著提升工具利用效率和多步推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如ReAct）依赖顺序推理和执行，无法利用独立子任务的并行性，导致工具利用效率低下和多步推理性能不佳。

Method: GAP采用两阶段训练策略：先在高质量数据集上进行监督微调（SFT），再通过基于正确性的奖励函数进行强化学习（RL）。

Result: 实验证明，GAP在多步检索任务上显著优于传统ReAct基线，并通过智能并行化大幅提升工具调用效率。

Conclusion: GAP框架通过图形化规划明确建模子任务间的依赖关系，实现了自适应并行与串行工具执行，显著提升了执行效率和任务准确性。

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown
impressive capabilities in tool manipulation for complex task-solving. However,
existing paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution,
failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This
sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal
performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent
Planning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task
dependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and
serial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose
complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining
which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential
dependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial
improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we
construct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from
the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage
training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset,
followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward
function on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides
maximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP
significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on
multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool
invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization. The project page is

Motivation: 改善蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）的样本效率，突破传统需状态-动作对价值完全相同的限制。

Method: 提出了Known Value Difference Abstractions (KVDA)框架，通过分析即时奖励推断价值差异，并基于此修改OGA-UCT算法为KVDA-UCT。

Result: KVDA-UCT在多种确定性环境和参数设置下检测到更多抽象，表现优于OGA-UCT。

Conclusion: KVDA-UCT通过引入已知价值差异抽象框架，显著提高了MCTS的样本效率，无需额外参数即可在多种确定性环境中优于OGA-UCT。

Abstract: A core challenge of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency,
which can be improved by grouping state-action pairs and using their aggregate
statistics instead of single-node statistics. On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT) is the state-of-the-art MCTS
abstraction algorithm for deterministic environments that builds its
abstraction using the Abstractions of State-Action Pairs (ASAP) framework,
which aims to detect states and state-action pairs with the same value under
optimal play by analysing the search graph. ASAP, however, requires two
state-action pairs to have the same immediate reward, which is a rigid
condition that limits the number of abstractions that can be found and thereby
the sample efficiency. In this paper, we break with the paradigm of grouping
value-equivalent states or state-action pairs and instead group states and
state-action pairs with possibly different values as long as the difference
between their values can be inferred. We call this abstraction framework Known
Value Difference Abstractions (KVDA), which infers the value differences by
analysis of the immediate rewards and modifies OGA-UCT to use this framework
instead. The modification is called KVDA-UCT, which detects significantly more
abstractions than OGA-UCT, introduces no additional parameter, and outperforms
OGA-UCT on a variety of deterministic environments and parameter settings.

Result: 分析揭示了范式选择是战略性的：符号系统在安全关键领域（如医疗）占主导，而神经系统在适应性强、数据丰富的环境（如金融）中占优。同时，指出了研究空白，如符号系统治理模型的显著缺失和对混合神经符号架构的迫切需求。

Conclusion: 该研究的结论是，代理型AI的未来不在于单一范式的支配，而在于符号/经典与神经/生成范式的有意整合，以创建既适应性强又可靠的系统。

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a transformative shift in artificial intelligence, but
its rapid advancement has led to a fragmented understanding, often conflating
modern neural systems with outdated symbolic models -- a practice known as
conceptual retrofitting. This survey cuts through this confusion by introducing
a novel dual-paradigm framework that categorizes agentic systems into two
distinct lineages: the Symbolic/Classical (relying on algorithmic planning and
persistent state) and the Neural/Generative (leveraging stochastic generation
and prompt-driven orchestration). Through a systematic PRISMA-based review of
90 studies (2018--2025), we provide a comprehensive analysis structured around
this framework across three dimensions: (1) the theoretical foundations and
architectural principles defining each paradigm; (2) domain-specific
implementations in healthcare, finance, and robotics, demonstrating how
application constraints dictate paradigm selection; and (3) paradigm-specific
ethical and governance challenges, revealing divergent risks and mitigation
strategies. Our analysis reveals that the choice of paradigm is strategic:
symbolic systems dominate safety-critical domains (e.g., healthcare), while
neural systems prevail in adaptive, data-rich environments (e.g., finance).
Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps, including a significant
deficit in governance models for symbolic systems and a pressing need for
hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures. The findings culminate in a strategic
roadmap arguing that the future of Agentic AI lies not in the dominance of one
paradigm, but in their intentional integration to create systems that are both
adaptable and reliable. This work provides the essential conceptual toolkit to
guide future research, development, and policy toward robust and trustworthy
hybrid intelligent systems.

Conclusion: 文章提出了一种新的视角，认为应该将AI的工具性目标视为可接受和管理的特征，而非需要限制的失败。建议将研究重点转向理解、管理和引导这些目标，以实现与人类目标的一致性。

Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) alignment research, instrumental goals, also
called instrumental subgoals or instrumental convergent goals, are widely
associated with advanced AI systems. These goals, which include tendencies such
as power-seeking and self-preservation, become problematic when they conflict
with human aims. Conventional alignment theory treats instrumental goals as
sources of risk that become problematic through failure modes such as reward
hacking or goal misgeneralization, and attempts to limit the symptoms of
instrumental goals, notably resource acquisition and self-preservation. This
article proposes an alternative framing: that a philosophical argument can be
constructed according to which instrumental goals may be understood as features
to be accepted and managed rather than failures to be limited. Drawing on
Aristotle's ontology and its modern interpretations, an ontology of concrete,
goal-directed entities, it argues that advanced AI systems can be seen as
artifacts whose formal and material constitution gives rise to effects distinct
from their designers' intentions. In this view, the instrumental tendencies of
such systems correspond to per se outcomes of their constitution rather than
accidental malfunctions. The implication is that efforts should focus less on
eliminating instrumental goals and more on understanding, managing, and
directing them toward human-aligned ends.

Conclusion: MTIR-SQL框架通过引入执行感知的多轮推理范式，结合数据库执行反馈，显著提升了Text-to-SQL任务的性能，实验结果表明其在BIRD和SPIDER数据集上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in Text-to-SQL tasks,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a common method for improving
performance. Existing methods primarily rely on static execution feedback,
which restricts real-time error correction. However, integrating multi-turn
tool invocation along with dynamic feedback could significantly improve
adaptability and robustness, ultimately enhancing model performance. To address
these issues, we propose MTIR-SQL, an innovative Multi-turn Tool-Integrated
Reasoning reinforcement learning framework for Text-to-SQL. Our approach
introduces an execution-aware multi-turn reasoning paradigm that seamlessly
incorporates database execution feedback at each reasoning step, enabling
context-sensitive query generation and progressive refinement throughout the
reasoning process. The framework extends the GRPO algorithm to accommodate
complex multi-turn interaction scenarios. Considering the training instability
characteristics of MTIR and the potential for significant Deviation of model
distribution from the initial model, we enhance the GRPO algorithm by adding a
trajectory filtering mechanism and removing KL loss constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that MTIR-SQL, with 4B parameters, achieves \textbf{64.4}\%
accuracy in the BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy in the SPIDER Dev,
significantly outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: LLMs展现出为逻辑规则中未命名谓词提供有意义命名的潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of giving names to predicates in logic
rules using Large Language Models (LLMs). In the context of Inductive Logic
Programming, various rule generation methods produce rules containing unnamed

readability, interpretability, and reusability of the logic theory. Leveraging
recent advancements in LLMs development, we explore their ability to process
natural language and code to provide semantically meaningful suggestions for
giving a name to unnamed predicates. The evaluation of our approach on some
hand-crafted logic rules indicates that LLMs hold potential for this task.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often face limitations in
specialized domains such as fintech, where domain-specific ontologies, dense

paper introduces an agentic RAG architecture designed to address these
challenges through a modular pipeline of specialized agents. The proposed
system supports intelligent query reformulation, iterative sub-query

standard RAG baseline using a curated dataset of 85 question--answer--reference
triples derived from an enterprise fintech knowledge base. Experimental results
demonstrate that the agentic RAG system outperforms the baseline in retrieval
precision and relevance, albeit with increased latency. These findings suggest

signals, such as mathematics, programming, and other reasoning tasks. The
challenge of eliciting reasoning abilities in more diverse scenarios, where
verification is not straightforward, remains underexplored. To address this
gap, we propose a novel zero-RL paradigm designed to improve a model's
reasoning ability across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains. By
combining verifiable rewards with a generative reward model, we conduct
multi-task zero-RL training across both domains, facilitating the transfer of
reasoning capabilities between them. Furthermore, to mitigate reward hacking in
the generative reward model, we design a smooth length penalty that encourages
the generation of more comprehensive thinking tokens in general domains.
Experimental results on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base demonstrate that our
approach achieves superior reasoning performance, not only on tasks requiring
extensive reasoning but also on more general tasks.

Motivation: 现有探索方法（主动和被动）在高维环境或样本多样性方面存在局限，MoGE旨在通过生成未充分探索的关键状态和动态一致的体验来增强探索。

Method: MoGE由两部分组成：(1)基于扩散的生成器，用于在效用函数指导下合成关键状态；(2)一步想象世界模型，用于构建关键转换以辅助代理学习。

Result: 在OpenAI Gym和DeepMind Control Suite上的实验表明，MoGE有效提升了样本效率和性能。

Conclusion: MoGE成功地将探索与策略学习相结合，显著提升了复杂控制任务中的样本效率和性能。

Abstract: Exploration is fundamental to reinforcement learning (RL), as it determines
how effectively an agent discovers and exploits the underlying structure of its
environment to achieve optimal performance. Existing exploration methods
generally fall into two categories: active exploration and passive exploration.
The former introduces stochasticity into the policy but struggles in
high-dimensional environments, while the latter adaptively prioritizes
transitions in the replay buffer to enhance exploration, yet remains
constrained by limited sample diversity. To address the limitation in passive
exploration, we propose Modelic Generative Exploration (MoGE), which augments
exploration through the generation of under-explored critical states and
synthesis of dynamics-consistent experiences through transition models. MoGE is
composed of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes
critical states under the guidance of a utility function evaluating each
state's potential influence on policy exploration, and (2) a one-step
imagination world model for constructing critical transitions based on the
critical states for agent learning. Our method adopts a modular formulation
that aligns with the principles of off-policy learning, allowing seamless
integration with existing algorithms to improve exploration without altering
their core structures. Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control
Suite reveal that MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning,
leading to remarkable gains in both sample efficiency and performance across
complex control tasks.

Result: 实验结果表明，结合微调LLM和推理模型能够构建一个强大且高精度的精神健康评估系统。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种结合微调大语言模型（LLM）和OpenAI-gpt-oss推理LLM的决策支持系统，用于标准化精神健康诊断，展示了其在提高诊断准确性和可靠性方面的潜力。

Abstract: The diagnosis of most mental disorders, including psychiatric evaluations,
primarily depends on dialogues between psychiatrists and patients. This
subjective process can lead to variability in diagnoses across clinicians and
patients, resulting in inconsistencies and challenges in achieving reliable
outcomes. To address these issues and standardize psychiatric diagnoses, we
propose a Fine-Tuned Large Language Model (LLM) Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss
Reasoning LLM-enabled Decision Support System for the clinical diagnosis of
mental disorders. Our approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on
conversational datasets involving psychiatrist-patient interactions focused on
mental health conditions (e.g., depression). The diagnostic predictions from
individual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making
process, refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. We propose a novel method
for deploying LLM agents that orchestrate communication between the LLM
consortium and the reasoning LLM, ensuring transparency, reliability, and
responsible AI across the entire diagnostic workflow. Experimental results
demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned LLMs with a
reasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for
mental health assessment. A prototype of the proposed platform, integrating
three fine-tuned LLMs with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, was developed in
collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia,
USA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application
of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical
mental health diagnosis paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth
systems aimed at standardizing psychiatric diagnoses.

Method: 提出 Counterfactual-based Agent Influence Ranker (CAIR)，通过反事实分析评估每个代理对 AAW 输出的影响程度。

Result: CAIR 在包含 30 种不同用例和 230 种功能的数据集上表现优于基线方法，产生一致的排名。

Conclusion: CAIR 是一种有效的任务无关分析方法，能够离线或在推理时使用，显著提升下游任务的效率和相关性。

Abstract: An Agentic AI Workflow (AAW), also known as an LLM-based multi-agent system,
is an autonomous system that assembles several LLM-based agents to work
collaboratively towards a shared goal. The high autonomy, widespread adoption,
and growing interest in such AAWs highlight the need for a deeper understanding
of their operations, from both quality and security aspects. To this day, there
are no existing methods to assess the influence of each agent on the AAW's
final output. Adopting techniques from related fields is not feasible since
existing methods perform only static structural analysis, which is unsuitable
for inference time execution. We present Counterfactual-based Agent Influence
Ranker (CAIR) - the first method for assessing the influence level of each
agent on the AAW's output and determining which agents are the most
influential. By performing counterfactual analysis, CAIR provides a
task-agnostic analysis that can be used both offline and at inference time. We
evaluate CAIR using an AAWs dataset of our creation, containing 30 different
use cases with 230 different functionalities. Our evaluation showed that CAIR
produces consistent rankings, outperforms baseline methods, and can easily
enhance the effectiveness and relevancy of downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定推理模板或刚性流程，限制了VLM在长文档分析中的效率和泛化能力。

Method: ALDEN结合了多轮强化学习框架、新颖的fetch动作、规则化的跨层奖励机制以及视觉语义锚定机制，以优化模型训练和性能。

Result: 在三个开源数据集构建的语料库上训练后，ALDEN在五个长文档基准测试中达到了最先进性能。

Conclusion: ALDEN提出了一种创新的多轮强化学习框架，通过主动导航和交互能力显著提升了视觉语言模型（VLM）在长文档理解任务中的表现，为高效准确的文档分析提供了新路径。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at interpreting text-rich images but
struggle with long, visually complex documents that demand analysis and
integration of information spread across multiple pages. Existing approaches
typically rely on fixed reasoning templates or rigid pipelines, which force
VLMs into a passive role and hinder both efficiency and generalization. We
present Active Long-DocumEnt Navigation (ALDEN), a multi-turn reinforcement
learning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents capable of
actively navigating long, visually rich documents. ALDEN introduces a novel
fetch action that directly accesses the page by index, complementing the
classic search action and better exploiting document structure. For dense
process supervision and efficient training, we propose a rule-based cross-level
reward that provides both turn- and token-level signals. To address the
empirically observed training instability caused by numerous visual tokens from
long documents, we further propose a visual-semantic anchoring mechanism that
applies a dual-path KL-divergence constraint to stabilize visual and textual
representations separately during training. Trained on a corpus constructed
from three open-source datasets, ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on
five long-document benchmarks. Overall, ALDEN marks a step beyond passive
document reading toward agents that autonomously navigate and reason across
long, visually rich documents, offering a robust path to more accurate and
efficient long-document understanding.

Conclusion: 该研究通过结合深度强化学习与门控变换器架构，显著提升了无人机在复杂城市环境中的导航性能，为未来无人机应用提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly populating urban areas for
delivery and surveillance purposes. In this work, we develop an optimal
navigation strategy based on Deep Reinforcement Learning. The environment is
represented by a three-dimensional high-fidelity simulation of an urban flow,
characterized by turbulence and recirculation zones. The algorithm presented
here is a flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with a Gated
Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) architecture, giving the agent richer
information about the turbulent flow field in which it navigates. The results
are compared with a PPO+GTrXL without the secondary prediction tasks, a PPO
combined with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and a traditional navigation
algorithm. The obtained results show a significant increase in the success rate
(SR) and a lower crash rate (CR) compared to a PPO+LSTM, PPO+GTrXL and the
classical Zermelo's navigation algorithm, paving the way to a completely
reimagined UAV landscape in complex urban environments.

Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成方法在处理多跳或跨文档的关系推理时表现不佳，而传统知识图谱因严格的三元组结构容易遗漏不符合该结构的信息。

Method: 提出了BambooKG，一种在非三元组边上应用基于频率的权重的知识图谱，利用赫布原理（“一起激活，一起连接”）来反映链接强度。

Result: BambooKG减少了信息丢失，在单跳和多跳推理任务中实现了更好的性能。

Conclusion: BambooKG通过引入基于频率的非三元组边权重，有效减少了信息丢失，并在单跳和多跳推理任务中表现优异，超越了现有解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation allows LLMs to access external knowledge,
reducing hallucinations and ageing-data issues. However, it treats retrieved
chunks independently and struggles with multi-hop or relational reasoning,
especially across documents. Knowledge graphs enhance this by capturing the
relationships between entities using triplets, enabling structured, multi-chunk
reasoning. However, these tend to miss information that fails to conform to the
triplet structure. We introduce BambooKG, a knowledge graph with
frequency-based weights on non-triplet edges which reflect link strength,
drawing on the Hebbian principle of "fire together, wire together". This
decreases information loss and results in improved performance on single- and
multi-hop reasoning, outperforming the existing solutions.

Method: TheraMind采用新颖的双循环架构，将会话过程分为战术对话管理的会话内循环和战略治疗规划的跨会话循环。

Conclusion: TheraMind的双循环架构在模拟战略、自适应和长期治疗行为方面表现出色，尤其在多会话指标上优于其他方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) in psychological counseling have attracted
increasing attention. However, existing approaches often lack emotional
understanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across
multiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical
practice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic
and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone
of TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex
counseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management
and a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session
Loop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response
strategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity.
Crucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term
adaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each
session and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our
approach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical
cases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods,
especially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and
Therapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in
emulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior. The code
is publicly available at https://0mwwm0.github.io/TheraMind/.

Abstract: We aim to revive Thorup's conjecture [Thorup, WG'92] on the existence of
reachability shortcuts with ideal size-diameter tradeoffs. Thorup originally
asked whether, given any graph $G=(V,E)$ with $m$ edges, we can add
$m^{1+o(1)}$ ``shortcut'' edges $E_+$ from the transitive closure $E^*$ of $G$
so that $\text{dist}_{G_+}(u,v) \leq m^{o(1)}$ for all $(u,v)\in E^*$, where
$G_+=(V,E\cup E_+)$. The conjecture was refuted by Hesse [Hesse, SODA'03],
followed by significant efforts in the last few years to optimize the lower
bounds.
  In this paper we observe that although Hesse refuted the letter of Thorup's
conjecture, his work~[Hesse, SODA'03] -- and all followup work -- does not
refute the spirit of the conjecture, which should allow $G_+$ to contain both
new (shortcut) edges and new Steiner vertices. Our results are as follows.
  (1) On the positive side, we present explicit attacks that break all known
shortcut lower bounds when Steiner vertices are allowed.
  (2) On the negative side, we rule out ideal $m^{1+o(1)}$-size,
$m^{o(1)}$-diameter shortcuts whose ``thickness'' is $t=o(\log n/\log \log n)$,
meaning no path can contain $t$ consecutive Steiner vertices.
  (3) We propose a candidate hard instance as the next step toward resolving
the revised version of Thorup's conjecture.
  Finally, we show promising implications. Almost-optimal parallel algorithms
for computing a generalization of the shortcut that approximately preserves
distances or flows imply almost-optimal parallel algorithms with $m^{o(1)}$
depth for exact shortcut paths and exact maximum flow. The state-of-the-art
algorithms have much worse depth of $n^{1/2+o(1)}$ [Rozho\v{n}, Haeupler,
Martinsson, STOC'23] and $m^{1+o(1)}$ [Chen, Kyng, Liu, FOCS'22], respectively.

Motivation: hedgegraphs通过将超边分组为hedge，增强了建模能力，但也带来了算法挑战（如割函数非子模性），因此需要新的连通性度量方法。

Method: 研究采用了多拟阵（polymatroid）的视角，分析hedgegraphs中的连通性，替代传统的割函数方法。

Result: 提出了两种新的连通性度量，证明了它们在结构和算法上的优势，并通过多拟阵框架获得了新的可处理性结果。

Conclusion: 本研究通过引入两种基于分割的连通性度量，解决了hedgegraphs中因割函数非子模性带来的算法挑战，并通过多拟阵视角提供了新的可处理性结果，扩展了图和超图的经典理论。

Abstract: Graphs and hypergraphs combine expressive modeling power with algorithmic
efficiency for a wide range of applications. Hedgegraphs generalize hypergraphs
further by grouping hyperedges under a color/hedge. This allows hedgegraphs to
model dependencies between hyperedges and leads to several applications.
However, it poses algorithmic challenges. In particular, the cut function is
not submodular, which has been a barrier to algorithms for connectivity. In
this work, we introduce two alternative partition-based measures of
connectivity in hedgegraphs and study their structural and algorithmic aspects.
Instead of the cut function, we investigate a polymatroid associated with
hedgegraphs. The polymatroidal lens leads to new tractability results as well
as insightful generalizations of classical results on graphs and hypergraphs.

Method: SCOUT 是一种轻量级替代模型，通过蒸馏过程训练，直接从代理的潜在传感器表示预测场景覆盖标签，避免了连续 LVLM 推理或人工标注的需求。

Result: SCOUT 在大量真实自主导航场景数据集上评估，保持高准确性的同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: SCOUT 提供了一种高效且实用的替代方案，用于大规模场景覆盖分析，尽管其性能依赖于 LVLM 生成的训练标签质量，但在自主系统中代表了向高效场景覆盖监督迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Assessing scenario coverage is crucial for evaluating the robustness of
autonomous agents, yet existing methods rely on expensive human annotations or
computationally intensive Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). These
approaches are impractical for large-scale deployment due to cost and
efficiency constraints. To address these shortcomings, we propose SCOUT
(Scenario Coverage Oversight and Understanding Tool), a lightweight surrogate
model designed to predict scenario coverage labels directly from an agent's
latent sensor representations. SCOUT is trained through a distillation process,
learning to approximate LVLM-generated coverage labels while eliminating the
need for continuous LVLM inference or human annotation. By leveraging
precomputed perception features, SCOUT avoids redundant computations and
enables fast, scalable scenario coverage estimation. We evaluate our method
across a large dataset of real-life autonomous navigation scenarios,
demonstrating that it maintains high accuracy while significantly reducing
computational cost. Our results show that SCOUT provides an effective and
practical alternative for large-scale coverage analysis. While its performance
depends on the quality of LVLM-generated training labels, SCOUT represents a
major step toward efficient scenario coverage oversight in autonomous systems.

Abstract: The rapid aging of societies is intensifying demand for autonomous care
robots; however, most existing systems are task-specific and rely on
handcrafted preprocessing, limiting their ability to generalize across diverse
scenarios. A prevailing theory in cognitive neuroscience proposes that the
human brain operates through hierarchical predictive processing, which
underlies flexible cognition and behavior by integrating multimodal sensory
signals. Inspired by this principle, we introduce a hierarchical multimodal
recurrent neural network grounded in predictive processing under the
free-energy principle, capable of directly integrating over 30,000-dimensional
visuo-proprioceptive inputs without dimensionality reduction. The model was
able to learn two representative caregiving tasks, rigid-body repositioning and
flexible-towel wiping, without task-specific feature engineering. We
demonstrate three key properties: (i) self-organization of hierarchical latent
dynamics that regulate task transitions, capture variability in uncertainty,
and infer occluded states; (ii) robustness to degraded vision through
visuo-proprioceptive integration; and (iii) asymmetric interference in
multitask learning, where the more variable wiping task had little influence on
repositioning, whereas learning the repositioning task led to a modest
reduction in wiping performance, while the model maintained overall robustness.
Although the evaluation was limited to simulation, these results establish
predictive processing as a universal and scalable computational principle,
pointing toward robust, flexible, and autonomous caregiving robots while
offering theoretical insight into the human brain's ability to achieve flexible
adaptation in uncertain real-world environments.

Conclusion: 作者提出的基于Denavit-Hartenberg约定的前向运动学校准方法，结合摄影测量技术和最小二乘法补偿策略，显著提高了Stewart平台的校准精度。

Abstract: Accurate calibration of a Stewart platform is important for their precise and
efficient operation. However, the calibration of these platforms using forward
kinematics is a challenge for researchers because forward kinematics normally
generates multiple feasible and unfeasible solutions for any pose of the moving
platform. The complex kinematic relations among the six actuator paths
connecting the fixed base to the moving platform further compound the
difficulty in establishing a straightforward and efficient calibration method.
The authors developed a new forward kinematics-based calibration method using
Denavit-Hartenberg convention and used the Stewart platform Tiger 66.1
developed in their lab for experimenting with the photogrammetry-based
calibration strategies described in this paper. This system became operational
upon completion of construction, marking its inaugural use. The authors used
their calibration model for estimating the errors in the system and adopted
three compensation options or strategies as per Least Square method to improve
the accuracy of the system. These strategies leveraged a high-resolution
digital camera and off-the-shelf software to capture the poses of the moving
platform's center. This process is non-invasive and does not need any
additional equipment to be attached to the hexapod or any alteration of the
hexapod hardware. This photogrammetry-based calibration process involves
multiple high-resolution images from different angles to measure the position
and orientation of the platform center in the three-dimensional space. The
Target poses and Actual poses are then compared, and the error compensations
are estimated using the Least-Squared methods to calculate the Predicted poses.
Results from each of the three compensation approaches demonstrated noticeable
enhancements in platform pose accuracies, suggesting room for further
improvements.

Abstract: Swarms evolving from collective behaviors among multiple individuals are
commonly seen in nature, which enables biological systems to exhibit more
efficient and robust collaboration. Creating similar swarm intelligence in
engineered robots poses challenges to the design of collaborative algorithms
that can be programmed at large scales. The assignment-based method has played
an eminent role for a very long time in solving collaboration problems of robot
swarms. However, it faces fundamental limitations in terms of efficiency and
robustness due to its unscalability to swarm variants. This article presents a
tutorial review on recent advances in assignment-free collaboration of robot
swarms, focusing on the problem of shape formation. A key theoretical component
is the recently developed \emph{mean-shift exploration} strategy, which
improves the collaboration efficiency of large-scale swarms by dozens of times.
Further, the efficiency improvement is more significant as the swarm scale
increases. Finally, this article discusses three important applications of the
mean-shift exploration strategy, including precise shape formation, area
coverage formation, and maneuvering formation, as well as their corresponding
industrial scenarios in smart warehousing, area exploration, and cargo
transportation.

Conclusion: NanoVLA通过视觉语言解耦、长短动作分块和动态路由等创新，在资源受限的边缘设备上实现了高性能的机器人操作，显著提升了推理速度和效率。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have significantly advanced robotic
manipulation by integrating vision-language models (VLMs), and action decoders
into a unified architecture. However, their deployment on resource-constrained
edge devices, such as mobile robots or embedded systems (e.g., Jetson Orin
Nano), remains challenging due to high computational demands, especially in
real-world scenarios where power, latency, and computational resources are
critical. To close this gap, we introduce Nano-scale Vision-Language Action
(NanoVLA), a family of lightweight VLA architectures that achieve high
performance with minimal resources. Our core innovations include: (1)
vision-language decoupling that moves conventional early vision and language
inputs fusion in VLM to late stage, achieving better performance while enabling
caching and reduce inference overhead and latency; (2) long-short action
chunking to ensure smooth, coherent multi-step planning without sacrificing
real-time responsiveness; (3) dynamic routing that adaptively assigns
lightweight or heavy backbones based on task complexity, further optimizing
inference efficiency. Experimental results on several benchmarks, as well as
real-world deployments, demonstrate that NanoVLA achieves up to 52x faster
inference on edge devices compared to previous state-of-the-art VLA models,
with 98% less parameters while maintaining or surpassing their task accuracy
and generalization. Ablation studies confirm that our decoupling strategy
preserves cross-task transferability, and the routing module enhances
cost-performance trade-offs, enabling practical, high-precision robotic
manipulation on resource-constrained hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 杂乱环境中的物体操作因空间依赖关系复杂而困难，现有方法常忽视这些关系，导致灵活性不足。

Method: OrderMind 结合空间上下文编码器和时间优先级结构化模块，通过 k-最近邻构建空间图，整合几何信息和交互关系，支持实时操作排序。

Result: 在包含 163,222 个样本的基准测试中，OrderMind 在仿真和真实环境中均表现优异。

Conclusion: OrderMind 在杂乱环境中表现出色，显著优于现有方法，实现了高效且鲁棒的物体操作。

Abstract: Manipulation in cluttered environments is challenging due to spatial
dependencies among objects, where an improper manipulation order can cause
collisions or blocked access. Existing approaches often overlook these spatial
relationships, limiting their flexibility and scalability. To address these
limitations, we propose OrderMind, a unified spatial-aware manipulation
ordering framework that directly learns object manipulation priorities based on
spatial context. Our architecture integrates a spatial context encoder with a
temporal priority structuring module. We construct a spatial graph using
k-Nearest Neighbors to aggregate geometric information from the local layout
and encode both object-object and object-manipulator interactions to support
accurate manipulation ordering in real-time. To generate physically and
semantically plausible supervision signals, we introduce a spatial prior
labeling method that guides a vision-language model to produce reasonable
manipulation orders for distillation. We evaluate OrderMind on our Manipulation
Ordering Benchmark, comprising 163,222 samples of varying difficulty. Extensive
experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms prior approaches in effectiveness and
efficiency, enabling robust manipulation in cluttered scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有视觉语言导航（VLN）方法在无人机（UAV）3D环境中导航的不足，以及大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）缺乏空间 grounding 的问题，提出了SoraNav框架。

Method: SoraNav整合了零样本VLM推理和几何感知决策，通过几何先验约束VLM动作空间，并采用混合切换策略结合导航历史，交替进行VLM推理和基于几何的探索。

Result: 在2.5D场景中，成功率和路径效率分别提高了25.7%和17%；在3D场景中，分别提高了29.5%和18.5%。

Conclusion: SoraNav框架通过结合零样本视觉语言模型（VLM）推理与几何感知决策，显著提升了无人机在2.5D和3D环境中的导航性能，成功率和路径效率均有显著提高。

Abstract: Interpreting visual observations and natural language instructions for
complex task execution remains a key challenge in robotics and AI. Despite
recent advances, language-driven navigation is still difficult, particularly
for UAVs in small-scale 3D environments. Existing Vision-Language Navigation
(VLN) approaches are mostly designed for ground robots and struggle to
generalize to aerial tasks that require full 3D spatial reasoning. The
emergence of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as GPT and Claude,
enables zero-shot semantic reasoning from visual and textual inputs. However,
these models lack spatial grounding and are not directly applicable to
navigation. To address these limitations, SoraNav is introduced, an adaptive
UAV navigation framework that integrates zero-shot VLM reasoning with
geometry-aware decision-making. Geometric priors are incorporated into image
annotations to constrain the VLM action space and improve decision quality. A
hybrid switching strategy leverages navigation history to alternate between VLM
reasoning and geometry-based exploration, mitigating dead-ends and redundant
revisits. A PX4-based hardware-software platform, comprising both a digital
twin and a physical micro-UAV, enables reproducible evaluation. Experimental
results show that in 2.5D scenarios, our method improves Success Rate (SR) by
25.7% and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) by 17%. In 3D scenarios, it
improves SR by 29.5% and SPL by 18.5% relative to the baseline.

Abstract: It's important to monitor road issues such as bumps and potholes to enhance
safety and improve road conditions. Smartphones are equipped with various
built-in sensors that offer a cost-effective and straightforward way to assess
road quality. However, progress in this area has been slow due to the lack of
high-quality, standardized datasets. This paper discusses a new dataset created
by a mobile app that collects sensor data from devices like GPS,
accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, gravity sensors, and orientation
sensors. This dataset is one of the few that integrates Geographic Information
System (GIS) data with weather information and video footage of road
conditions, providing a comprehensive understanding of road issues with
geographic context. The dataset allows for a clearer analysis of road
conditions by compiling essential data, including vehicle speed, acceleration,
rotation rates, and magnetic field intensity, along with the visual and spatial
context provided by GIS, weather, and video data. Its goal is to provide
funding for initiatives that enhance traffic management, infrastructure
development, road safety, and urban planning. Additionally, the dataset will be
publicly accessible to promote further research and innovation in smart
transportation systems.

Motivation: 解决传统方法在遮挡下的脆弱性和深度学习方法的计算密集型问题，以提供鲁棒且实时的目标跟踪。

Method: 结合了快速全局模板匹配器、深度特征Lucas-Kanade模块和轻量级残差回归器，当视觉置信度低于阈值时，使用基于GRU的预测器从近期运动历史外推姿态更新。

Conclusion: 提出的混合视觉跟踪框架在高达90%遮挡的手持视频序列中保持了低于2px的跟踪误差，展示了其在实际机器人视觉应用中的鲁棒性和低延迟精度。

Abstract: Vision-based control systems, such as image-based visual servoing (IBVS),
have been extensively explored for precise robot manipulation. A persistent
challenge, however, is maintaining robust target tracking under partial or full
occlusions. Classical methods like Lucas-Kanade (LK) offer lightweight tracking
but are fragile to occlusion and drift, while deep learning-based approaches
often require continuous visibility and intensive computation. To address these
gaps, we propose a hybrid visual tracking framework that bridges advanced
perception with real-time servo control. First, a fast global template matcher
constrains the pose search region; next, a deep-feature Lucas-Kanade module
operating on early VGG layers refines alignment to sub-pixel accuracy (<2px);
then, a lightweight residual regressor corrects local misalignments caused by
texture degradation or partial occlusion. When visual confidence falls below a
threshold, a GRU-based predictor seamlessly extrapolates pose updates from
recent motion history. Crucially, the pipeline's final outputs-translation,
rotation, and scale deltas-are packaged as direct control signals for 30Hz
image-based servo loops. Evaluated on handheld video sequences with up to 90%
occlusion, our system sustains under 2px tracking error, demonstrating the
robustness and low-latency precision essential for reliable real-world robot
vision applications.

Abstract: Whole-body humanoid motion represents a cornerstone challenge in robotics,
integrating balance, coordination, and adaptability to enable human-like
behaviors. However, existing methods typically require multiple training
samples per motion category, rendering the collection of high-quality human
motion datasets both labor-intensive and costly. To address this, we propose a
novel approach that trains effective humanoid motion policies using only a
single non-walking target motion sample alongside readily available walking
motions. The core idea lies in leveraging order-preserving optimal transport to
compute distances between walking and non-walking sequences, followed by
interpolation along geodesics to generate new intermediate pose skeletons,
which are then optimized for collision-free configurations and retargeted to
the humanoid before integration into a simulated environment for policy
training via reinforcement learning. Experimental evaluations on the CMU MoCap
dataset demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines,
achieving superior performance across metrics. Code will be released upon
acceptance.

Abstract: Generating hand grasps with language instructions is a widely studied topic
that benefits from embodied AI and VR/AR applications. While transferring into
hand articulatied object interaction (HAOI), the hand grasps synthesis requires
not only object functionality but also long-term manipulation sequence along
the object deformation. This paper proposes a novel HAOI sequence generation
framework SynHLMA, to synthesize hand language manipulation for articulated
objects. Given a complete point cloud of an articulated object, we utilize a
discrete HAOI representation to model each hand object interaction frame. Along
with the natural language embeddings, the representations are trained by an
HAOI manipulation language model to align the grasping process with its
language description in a shared representation space. A joint-aware loss is
employed to ensure hand grasps follow the dynamic variations of articulated
object joints. In this way, our SynHLMA achieves three typical hand
manipulation tasks for articulated objects of HAOI generation, HAOI prediction
and HAOI interpolation. We evaluate SynHLMA on our built HAOI-lang dataset and
experimental results demonstrate the superior hand grasp sequence generation
performance comparing with state-of-the-art. We also show a robotics grasp
application that enables dexterous grasps execution from imitation learning
using the manipulation sequence provided by our SynHLMA. Our codes and datasets
will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Multi-legged mobile robots possess high mobility performance in rough terrain
environments, stemming from their high postural stability, joint flexibility,
and the redundancy provided by multiple legs. In prior research on navigating
between different environments such as land and water, the primary strategy
employed involves switching to a controller that generates an appropriate gait
for the new environment upon entering it. However, designing appropriate gaits
for each complex and diverse environment and accurately determining controller
switching for each environment is challenging. Therefore, this research
develops a centipede-type mobile robot that navigates both aquatic and
terrestrial environments with a simple, unified control scheme, based on the
implicit-explicit control philosophy and by ingeniously designing the robot's
body structure. In this research, we developed the robot featuring flexible
joints and left and right legs on each body segment and focused on the leg
structure which has extensive contact with the environment. This paper
evaluates the locomotion performance on land and water using the three
developed leg structures, using the robot's leg slip rate and actuator energy
consumption as evaluation metrics. The experimental results confirmed the
existence of an appropriate leg structure capable of navigating both aquatic
and terrestrial environments under identical control.

Abstract: In this paper, an approach for gait assistance with a lower body exoskeleton
is described. Two concepts, transparency and motion assistance, are combined.
The transparent mode, where the system is following the user's free motion with
a minimum of perceived interaction forces, is realized by exploiting the gear
backlash of the actuation units. During walking a superimposed assistance mode
applies an additional torque guiding the legs to their estimated future
position. The concept of adaptive oscillators is utilized to learn the
quasi-periodic signals typical for locomotion. First experiments showed
promising results.

Abstract: In this paper a new method for geometric robot calibration is introduced,
which uses a calibration plate with precisely known distances between its
measuring points. The relative measurement between two points on the
calibration plate is used to determine predefined error parameters of the
system. In comparison to conventional measurement methods, like laser tracker
or motion capture systems, the calibration plate provides a more mechanically
robust and cheaper alternative, which is furthermore easier to transport due to
its small size. The calibration method, the plate design, the mathematical
description of the error system as well as the identification of the parameters
are described in detail. For identifying the error parameters, the least
squares method and a constrained optimization problem are used. The
functionality of this method was demonstrated in experiments that led to
promising results, correlated with one of a laser tracker calibration. The
modeling and identification of the error parameters is done for a gantry
machine, but is not restricted to that type of robot.

Abstract: This survey provides an analysis of current methodologies integrating legal
and logical specifications into the perception, prediction, and planning
modules of automated driving systems. We systematically explore techniques
ranging from logic-based frameworks to computational legal reasoning
approaches, emphasizing their capability to ensure regulatory compliance and
interpretability in dynamic and uncertain driving environments. A central
finding is that significant challenges arise at the intersection of perceptual
reliability, legal compliance, and decision-making justifiability. To
systematically analyze these challenges, we introduce a taxonomy categorizing
existing approaches by their theoretical foundations, architectural
implementations, and validation strategies. We particularly focus on methods
that address perceptual uncertainty and incorporate explicit legal norms,
facilitating decisions that are both technically robust and legally defensible.
The review covers neural-symbolic integration methods for perception,
logic-driven rule representation, and norm-aware prediction strategies, all
contributing toward transparent and accountable autonomous vehicle operation.
We highlight critical open questions and practical trade-offs that must be
addressed, offering multidisciplinary insights from engineering, logic, and law
to guide future developments in legally compliant autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation of deformable and fragile objects presents significant
challenges, as excessive stress can lead to irreversible damage to the object.
While existing solutions rely on accurate object models or specialized sensors
and grippers, this adds complexity and often lacks generalization. To address
this problem, we present a vision-based reinforcement learning approach that
incorporates a stress-penalized reward to discourage damage to the object
explicitly. In addition, to bootstrap learning, we incorporate offline
demonstrations as well as a designed curriculum progressing from rigid proxies
to deformables. We evaluate the proposed method in both simulated and
real-world scenarios, showing that the policy learned in simulation can be
transferred to the real world in a zero-shot manner, performing tasks such as
picking up and pushing tofu. Our results show that the learned policies exhibit
a damage-aware, gentle manipulation behavior, demonstrating their effectiveness
by decreasing the stress applied to fragile objects by 36.5% while achieving
the task goals, compared to vanilla RL policies.

### [169] [Solving the Right Problem with Multi-Robot Formations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25422)
*Chaz Cornwall,Jeremy P. Bos*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A formation planner optimizes robot positions to better minimize original cost functions, outperforming static shapes by 20-75% in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static formation shapes often fail to minimize original cost functions when more environmental information becomes available, leading to discrepancies between maintaining shapes and minimizing costs.

Method: The proposed formation planner is a two-step optimization problem: first estimating non-linear and non-differentiable costs with a weighted sum of surrogate cost functions, then minimizing these using relative robot positions realized via a non-cooperative formation controller derived from Lyapunov's direct approach.

Result: Simulations show the formation planner reduces single costs by over 75% and multiple costs by 20-40% when adaptive weights are used.

Conclusion: Formation planning enhances performance by minimizing a surrogate cost function that closely approximates the original cost function, reducing reliance on shape abstractions.

Abstract: Formation control simplifies minimizing multi-robot cost functions by
encoding a cost function as a shape the robots maintain. However, by reducing
complex cost functions to formations, discrepancies arise between maintaining
the shape and minimizing the original cost function. For example, a Diamond or
Box formation shape is often used for protecting all members of the formation.
When more information about the surrounding environment becomes available, a
static shape often no longer minimizes the original protection cost. We propose
a formation planner to reduce mismatch between a formation and the cost
function while still leveraging efficient formation controllers. Our formation
planner is a two-step optimization problem that identifies desired relative
robot positions. We first solve a constrained problem to estimate non-linear
and non-differentiable costs with a weighted sum of surrogate cost functions.
We theoretically analyze this problem and identify situations where weights do
not need to be updated. The weighted, surrogate cost function is then minimized
using relative positions between robots. The desired relative positions are
realized using a non-cooperative formation controller derived from Lyapunov's
direct approach. We then demonstrate the efficacy of this approach for
military-like costs such as protection and obstacle avoidance. In simulations,
we show a formation planner can reduce a single cost by over 75%. When
minimizing a variety of cost functions simultaneously, using a formation
planner with adaptive weights can reduce the cost by 20-40%. Formation planning
provides better performance by minimizing a surrogate cost function that
closely approximates the original cost function instead of relying on a shape
abstraction.

Motivation: 研究动机是为了更准确地描述带有内部移动质量执行器的水下车辆运动，克服传统哈密顿方法在建模中的局限性。

Method: 该方法将移动质量动力学表达为Fossen（1991）引入的水下车辆操纵模型的扩展，在体坐标系中描述移动质量的影响，并通过附加的动力学方程和耦合刚体动力学将其纳入模型。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提出的牛顿-欧拉模型与传统哈密顿方法相比具有更高的准确性和适用性。

Conclusion: 论文提出了牛顿-欧拉公式，用于描述带有内部移动质量执行器的水下车辆运动方程，并通过仿真验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a Newton-Euler formulation of the equations of
motion for underwater vehicles with an interntal moving mass actuator.
Furthermore, the moving mass dynamics are expressed as an extension to the
manoeuvring model for underwater vehicles, originally introduced by Fossen
(1991). The influence of the moving mass is described in body-frame and
included as states in both an additional kinematic equation and as part of the
coupled rigid-body kinetics of the underwater vehicle. The Coriolis-centripetal
effects are derived from Kirchhoff's equations and the hydrostatics are derived
using first principals. The proposed Newton-Euler model is validated through
simulation and compared with the traditional Hamiltonian internal moving mass
actuator formulation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究章鱼臂伸展运动的特征弯曲传播是否与鞭子的动力学共享基本原理。

Method: 在空气和水中进行了基于平台的鞭打测试，系统地改变了材料刚度和驱动速度。

Result: Ecoflex Gel 2臂在150 rpm（电机速度）驱动下重现了与章鱼伸展相似的曲率传播，但其弯曲点速度单调下降，而非生物钟形曲线。

Conclusion: 本研究为理解生物伸展运动提供了新视角，并为未来的流体动力学研究提供了一个潜在平台。

Abstract: The stereotypical reaching motion of the octopus arm has drawn growing
attention for its efficient control of a highly deformable body. Previous
studies suggest that its characteristic bend propagation may share underlying
principles with the dynamics of a whip. This work investigates whether
whip-like passive dynamics in water can reproduce the kinematic features
observed in biological reaching and their similarities and differences.
Platform-based whipping tests were performed in water and air while
systematically varying material stiffness and driving speed. Image-based
quantification revealed that the Ecoflex Gel 2 arm driven at 150 rpm (motor
speed) reproduced curvature propagation similar to that observed in octopus
reaching. However, its bend-point velocity decreased monotonically rather than
exhibiting the biological bell-shaped profile, confirming that the octopus
reaching movement is not merely a passive whipping behavior. The absence of
propagation in air further highlights the critical role of the surrounding
medium in forming octopus-like reaching motion. This study provides a new
perspective for understand biological reaching movement, and offers a potential
platform for future hydrodynamic research.

Conclusion: VIZ-COAST方法通过利用预训练视觉语言模型的常识空间推理能力，显著减少了任务和运动规划中的规划时间，并在某些情况下完全消除了向下细化失败，表现出对广泛领域实例的泛化能力。

Abstract: In task and motion planning, high-level task planning is done over an
abstraction of the world to enable efficient search in long-horizon robotics
problems. However, the feasibility of these task-level plans relies on the
downward refinability of the abstraction into continuous motion. When a
domain's refinability is poor, task-level plans that appear valid may
ultimately fail during motion planning, requiring replanning and resulting in
slower overall performance. Prior works mitigate this by encoding refinement
issues as constraints to prune infeasible task plans. However, these approaches
only add constraints upon refinement failure, expending significant search
effort on infeasible branches. We propose VIZ-COAST, a method of leveraging the
common-sense spatial reasoning of large pretrained Vision-Language Models to
identify issues with downward refinement a priori, bypassing the need to fix
these failures during planning. Experiments on two challenging TAMP domains
show that our approach is able to extract plausible constraints from images and
domain descriptions, drastically reducing planning times and, in some cases,
eliminating downward refinement failures altogether, generalizing to a diverse
range of instances from the broader domain.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的分层框架在复杂、接触密集的双臂操作任务中表现优于端到端强化学习方法和传统的顺序规划器，实现了更高的成功率和更高效的行为协调。

Abstract: Long-horizon contact-rich bimanual manipulation presents a significant
challenge, requiring complex coordination involving a mixture of parallel
execution and sequential collaboration between arms. In this paper, we
introduce a hierarchical framework that frames this challenge as an integrated
skill planning & scheduling problem, going beyond purely sequential
decision-making to support simultaneous skill invocation. Our approach is built
upon a library of single-arm and bimanual primitive skills, each trained using
Reinforcement Learning (RL) in GPU-accelerated simulation. We then train a
Transformer-based planner on a dataset of skill compositions to act as a
high-level scheduler, simultaneously predicting the discrete schedule of skills
as well as their continuous parameters. We demonstrate that our method achieves
higher success rates on complex, contact-rich tasks than end-to-end RL
approaches and produces more efficient, coordinated behaviors than traditional
sequential-only planners.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) has gained significant attention, with most

considers energy consumption in the path planning of automated guided vehicles

that takes both energy use and travel time into account. For task assignment,
we present two multi-objective algorithms: Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic
Algorithm (NSGA) and Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS). Comparative
evaluations show that these proposed methods perform better than existing
approaches in both collision avoidance and task assignment.

Result: 增量动作表现良好，四个主成分解释了约96%的手关节方差。实时堆栈在一张RTX 4090上实现了约0.3秒的延迟。

Conclusion: 研究发现动作后处理是性能提升的主要驱动因素，辅助意图预测有帮助，FiLM条件化的效果参差不齐，而定向运动损失则不利。实时堆栈（约0.3秒延迟）能够组合“拾取”和“传递”为长时行为。关键局限是‘训练者过拟合’特定演示者。

Abstract: We adapt a pre-trained Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model (Open-VLA) for
dexterous human-robot collaboration with minimal language prompting. Our
approach adds (i) FiLM conditioning to visual backbones for task-aware
perception, (ii) an auxiliary intent head that predicts collaborator hand pose
and target cues, and (iii) action-space post-processing that predicts compact
deltas (position/rotation) and PCA-reduced finger joints before mapping to full
commands. Using a multi-view, teleoperated Franka and Mimic-hand dataset
augmented with MediaPipe hand poses, we demonstrate that delta actions are
well-behaved and that four principal components explain ~96% of hand-joint
variance. Ablations identify action post-processing as the primary performance
driver; auxiliary intent helps, FiLM is mixed, and a directional motion loss is
detrimental. A real-time stack (~0.3 s latency on one RTX 4090) composes
"pick-up" and "pass" into a long-horizon behavior. We surface "trainer
overfitting" to specific demonstrators as the key limitation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of vine-inspired robots collapsing under their own weight when navigating gaps, hindering their mobility in confined environments.

Method: A comprehensive collapse model using true shape information and tail tension was developed and validated through experiments with unsteered and steered robots.

Result: The model accurately predicted collapse trends in experiments and demonstrated practical application in a gap-crossing task, showing that actuator inflation is necessary to prevent collapse.

Conclusion: The collapse model enables accurate prediction of robot collapse behavior in open environments and identifies necessary parameters for successful 3D navigation.

Abstract: Soft, vine-inspired growing robots that move by eversion are highly mobile in
confined environments, but, when faced with gaps in the environment, they may
collapse under their own weight while navigating a desired path. In this work,
we present a comprehensive collapse model that can predict the collapse length
of steered robots in any shape using true shape information and tail tension.
We validate this model by collapsing several unsteered robots without true
shape information. The model accurately predicts the trends of those
experiments. We then attempt to collapse a robot steered with a single actuator
at different orientations. Our models accurately predict collapse when it
occurs. Finally, we demonstrate how this could be used in the field by having a
robot attempt a gap-crossing task with and without inflating its actuators. The
robot needs its actuators inflated to cross the gap without collapsing, which
our model supports. Our model has been specifically tested on straight and
series pouch motor-actuated robots made of non-stretchable material, but it
could be applied to other robot variations. This work enables us to model the
robot's collapse behavior in any open environment and understand the parameters
it needs to succeed in 3D navigation tasks.

Abstract: The ability to use random objects as tools in a generalizable manner is a
missing piece in robots' intelligence today to boost their versatility and
problem-solving capabilities. State-of-the-art robotic tool usage methods
focused on procedurally generating or crowd-sourcing datasets of tools for a
task to learn how to grasp and manipulate them for that task. However, these
methods assume that only one object is provided and that it is possible, with
the correct grasp, to perform the task; they are not capable of identifying,
grasping, and using the best object for a task when many are available,
especially when the optimal tool is absent. In this work, we propose GeT-USE, a
two-step procedure that learns to perform real-robot generalized tool usage by
learning first to extend the robot's embodiment in simulation and then
transferring the learned strategies to real-robot visuomotor policies. Our key
insight is that by exploring a robot's embodiment extensions (i.e., building
new end-effectors) in simulation, the robot can identify the general tool
geometries most beneficial for a task. This learned geometric knowledge can
then be distilled to perform generalized tool usage tasks by selecting and
using the best available real-world object as tool. On a real robot with 22
degrees of freedom (DOFs), GeT-USE outperforms state-of-the-art methods by
30-60% success rates across three vision-based bimanual mobile manipulation
tool-usage tasks.

Abstract: Surgical suturing is a high-precision task that impacts patient healing and
scarring. Suturing skill varies widely between surgeons, highlighting the need
for robot assistance. Previous robot suturing works, such as STITCH 1.0 [1],
struggle to fully close wounds due to inaccurate needle tracking and poor
thread management. To address these challenges, we present STITCH 2.0, an
elevated augmented dexterity pipeline with seven improvements including:
improved EKF needle pose estimation, new thread untangling methods, and an
automated 3D suture alignment algorithm. Experimental results over 15 trials
find that STITCH 2.0 on average achieves 74.4% wound closure with 4.87 sutures
per trial, representing 66% more sutures in 38% less time compared to the
previous baseline. When two human interventions are allowed, STITCH 2.0
averages six sutures with 100% wound closure rate. Project website:
