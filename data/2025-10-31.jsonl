Existing methods\nto model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic\nhierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability\nacross different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion\nmodeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships\ndirectly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based\nhierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into\nparent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy\ninference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent\nelemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies\nthrough graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction\napproach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and\ndynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show\nthat our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,\nand produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the\nbaseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,\ndata-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation\napplicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks.

To provide perspective,\nthe carbon footprint in the most likely scenario is equivalent to the carbon\ncaptured by 7,615 urban trees in a year, and the water footprint is comparable\nto the water consumed by an average American family over 5,053 years.\n  We explore strategies to mitigate this impact, primarily by reducing wasted\ncomputational resources.

To address this governance vacuum and enable\nthe necessary shift from tactical risk management to holistic risk governance,\nwe conducted a grounded theory study with 15 practitioners to develop a\nholistic risk governance framework. Our study formalizes an analytical\nframework built on a foundational risk principle: an uncontrollable External\nThreat (e.g., a sudden license change in a key dependency) only becomes a\ncritical risk when it exploits a controllable Internal Vulnerability (e.g., an\nundefined risk appetite for single-vendor projects), which then amplifies the\nimpact.The framework operationalizes this principle through a clear logical\nchain: \"Objectives -> Threats -> Vulnerabilities -> Mitigation\" (OTVM). This\nprovides a holistic decision model that transcends mere technical checklists.\nBased on this logic, our contributions are: (1) a \"Strategic Objectives Matrix\"\nto clarify goals; (2) a systematic dual taxonomy of External Threats (Ex-Tech,\nEx-Comm, Ex-Eco) and Internal Vulnerabilities (In-Strat, In-Ops, In-Tech); and\n(3) an actionable mitigation framework mapping capability-building to these\nvulnerabilities.

While this phenomenon is\nwell-known, its quantitative performance impact across key metrics has remained\npoorly understood. In this paper, we address this gap by developing the first\naxiomatic framework for analyzing the joint dynamics of path selection and\ncongestion control. Our model enables the formal characterization of the\nsystem's dynamic equilibria-the stable, periodic patterns of oscillation-and\nprovides a suite of axioms to rate their performance in terms of efficiency,\nloss avoidance, convergence, fairness, and responsiveness. Our analysis reveals\na fundamental trade-off in protocol design between predictable performance\n(efficiency, convergence) and user-centric goals (fairness, responsiveness). We\nprove, however, that no such trade-off exists among efficiency, convergence,\nand loss avoidance, which can be simultaneously optimized through careful\nparameter tuning.

We introduce a\ntwo-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative\n(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must\nminimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the\nevolutionary \"why\" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.\nThe Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression\nmechanically selects for generative, causal models through\nexception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather\nthan a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:\nfrom survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,\nefficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality\nalignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or\nevolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically\nnecessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework\nyields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as\napproach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution\ngeneralization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from\ncorrelational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across\nabstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that\ntrack representational complexity.

Despite their\nstrong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing\ntasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the\nlatent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in\noutputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have\nattempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based\napproaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal\nediting quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation\nframework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these\nlimitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into\nmultiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them\nto form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that\ndecomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,\ngenerating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance\ntoward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and\nsoft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution\nin multi-task learning.

Findings indicate that protective responses are not\nlinear. The moderately anthropomorphic Two-Foot robot, rated highest in\neeriness and \"spine-tingling\" sensations consistent with the uncanny valley,\nelicited the strongest physiological anger expressions. Self-reported anger and\nguilt are significantly higher for both the Two-Foot and Humanoid robots\ncompared to the Spider. Qualitative findings further reveal that as\nanthropomorphism increases, moral reasoning shifts from technical assessments\nof property damage to condemnation of the abuser's character, while governance\nproposals expand from property law to calls for quasi-animal rights and broader\nsocietal responsibility. These results suggest that the uncanny valley does not\ndampen moral concern but paradoxically heightens protective impulses, offering\ncritical implications for robot design, policy, and future legal frameworks."}

In this paper, we introduce Nexus, a novel multi-agent\nframework to address this challenge. Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging\na diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a\nstructured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement.\nDuring the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each\nembodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines\nan initial set of test oracles. Then, in the validation phase, Nexus generates\na plausible candidate implementation of the FUT and executes the proposed\noracles against it in a secure sandbox. For any oracle that fails this\nexecution-based check, Nexus activates an automated selfrefinement loop, using\nthe specific runtime error to debug and correct the oracle before\nre-validation. Our extensive evaluation on seven diverse benchmarks\ndemonstrates that Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms\nstate-of-theart baselines. For instance, Nexus improves the test-level oracle\naccuracy on the LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini.

In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the\nmost common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation,\nrickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto\n(pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of\nauto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from\naccessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite\ndifficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially\nnon-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This\npaper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect\nauto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object\ndetection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of\n1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions.

To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework\nthat represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a\nContext Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes\nnormative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes\nevents as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This\nalignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in\nstructured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation\nand event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments\non 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,\nGraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than\nLLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting\nin higher recall and lower false positive rates.

This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion\nunder the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and\nvisible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse.

However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt\ncalibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on\nimproving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature\ndispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular\nseparation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular\nseparation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the\ncritical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel\nTPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the\ndistribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable\nprompts.

Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual\nKeys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned\nduring language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive\nsystematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to\ntheir under-utilization in the context representation.

By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating\nintervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving\nbeneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores.\nWithout retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both\nworst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing\na new zero-shot state of the art. Beyond performance, our framework provides a\nlightweight representation-level counterfactual approach, offering a practical\ncausal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning."}

Existing data-driven approaches are effective in automatically\ngenerating fixed layouts but fail to produce layout structures. We present\nStructLayoutFormer, a novel Transformer-based approach for conditional\nstructured layout generation. We use a structure serialization scheme to\nrepresent structured layouts as sequences. To better control the structures of\ngenerated layouts, we disentangle the structural information from the element\nplacements. Our approach is the first data-driven approach that achieves\nconditional structured layout generation and produces realistic layout\nstructures explicitly. We compare our approach with existing data-driven layout\ngeneration approaches by including post-processing for structure extraction.\nExtensive experiments have shown that our approach exceeds these baselines in\nconditional structured layout generation. We also demonstrate that our approach\nis effective in extracting and transferring layout structures.

Self-localization based on a camera\noften uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can extract local features\nthat are calculated by nearby pixels. However, when dynamic obstacles, such as\npeople, are present, CNN does not work well. This study proposes a new method\ncombining CNN with Vision Transformer, which excels at extracting global\nfeatures that show the relationship of patches on whole image. Experimental\nresults showed that, compared to the state-of-the-art method (SOTA), the\naccuracy improvement rate in a CG dataset with dynamic obstacles is 1.5 times\nhigher than that without dynamic obstacles. Moreover, the self-localization\nerror of our method is 20.1% smaller than that of SOTA on public datasets.\nAdditionally, our robot using our method can localize itself with 7.51cm error\non average, which is more accurate than SOTA."}

We present AgriGS-SLAM, a Visual--LiDAR SLAM framework that\ncouples direct LiDAR odometry and loop closures with multi-camera 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS) rendering. Batch rasterization across complementary viewpoints\nrecovers orchard structure under occlusions, while a unified gradient-driven\nmap lifecycle executed between keyframes preserves fine details and bounds\nmemory. Pose refinement is guided by a probabilistic LiDAR-based depth\nconsistency term, back-propagated through the camera projection to tighten\ngeometry-appearance coupling. We deploy the system on a field platform in apple\nand pear orchards across dormancy, flowering, and harvesting, using a\nstandardized trajectory protocol that evaluates both training-view and\nnovel-view synthesis to reduce 3DGS overfitting in evaluation. Across seasons\nand sites, AgriGS-SLAM delivers sharper, more stable reconstructions and\nsteadier trajectories than recent state-of-the-art 3DGS-SLAM baselines while\nmaintaining real-time performance on-tractor. While demonstrated in orchard\nmonitoring, the approach can be applied to other outdoor domains requiring\nrobust multimodal perception."}
