Recently\nuncrossed flows have played a key role in approximation algorithms for maximum\ndisjoint paths in fully-planar instances, where the combined supply plus demand\ngraph is planar. In the fully-planar case, any fractional multiflow can be\nconverted into one that is uncrossed, which is then exploited to find a good\nrounding of the fractional solution. We investigate finding an uncrossed\nmultiflow as a standalone algorithmic problem in general planar instances (not\nnecessarily fully-planar). We consider both a congestion model where the given\ndemands must all be routed, and a maximization model where the goal is to pack\nas much flow in the supply graph as possible (not necessarily equitably).\n  For the congestion model, we show that determining if an instance has an\nuncrossed (fractional) multiflow is NP-hard, but the problem of finding an\nintegral uncrossed flow is polytime solvable if the demands span a bounded\nnumber of faces.

Similarly, nodes in graphs play distinct structural roles as\nhubs, bridges, or peripheral members. Current graph language methods provide\ntokens without grammatical annotations to indicate these structural or semantic\nroles. This absence limits language models' ability to reason about graph\ntopology effectively. We propose \\textbf{G2rammar}, a bilingual grammar\nframework that explicitly encodes both structural and semantic grammar for\ntext-attributed graphs. Structural grammar characterizes topological roles\nthrough centrality and neighborhood patterns. Semantic grammar captures content\nrelationships through textual informativity. The framework implements two-stage\nlearning with structural grammar pre-training followed by semantic grammar\nfine-tuning. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that\nG2rammar consistently outperforms competitive baselines by providing language\nmodels with the grammatical context needed to understand graph structures."}

Recent research\nshows that fully asynchronous RL training can disaggregate these stages across\ndisjoint hardware pools without sacrificing training stability, creating a\ngreat opportunity for real-world heterogeneous deployment. To this end, we\npresent AReaL-Hex, a heterogeneity-aware asynchronous RL training system that\neffectively schedules how to execute rollout generation and policy model\ntraining over heterogeneous GPUs while enforcing data staleness bounds.\nConcretely, we use a two-phase scheduler: (i) a constrained search with MILP to\nselect per-stage parallelization strategies and workload assignments given a\nresource budget, and (ii) a graph-partitioning step that allocates\nheterogeneous GPUs and interconnects to maximize end-to-end throughput.

These systems exhibit diverse traffic\npatterns, latency requirements, and mobility behaviors, increasingly operating\nacross overlapping heterogeneous RATs such as 5G, WiFi, satellite, NB-IoT,\nLoRaWAN, Zigbee, etc. This multi-RAT coexistence creates opportunities for\nintelligent access, mobility, and routing strategies. However, most mobility\ndecisions still rely heavily on RSSI, which neglects RAT-specific features,\ncongestion, queuing delays, and application needs, favoring high-power links\nover optimal ones. To address this gap, we propose chrome (Congestion-aware\nOffloading and Handover via Empirical RAT Evaluation), a multi criteria\nframework for dense multi-RAT networks. chrome enhances RSSI with multiple\ncriteria and applies the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to the\nIdeal Solution (TOPSIS) to rank available RATs. Criteria weights are determined\nusing both subjective (operator-driven) and objective (measurement-based)\napproaches. Based on this ranking, chrome performs intelligent cross-RAT\noffloading to reduce congestion on over-utilized links. We evaluate chrome in a\ndense SDN-controlled 5G/WiFi Multi-RAT environment using Mininet WiFi. Compared\nto RSSI-only handover, COHERE reduces the load on the congested RAT by up to\n32%, reduces total handovers by 25%, lowers handovers to the congested RAT by\n55%, and improves link delay by up to 166%, while maintaining comparable or up\nto 11% higher throughput.

Program comprehension is key\nto all these activities, as it demands developers to grasp the knowledge (e.g.,\nimplementation details) required to modify the codebase. Methods as main\nbuilding blocks in a program can offer developers this knowledge source for\ncode comprehension. However, reading entire method statements can be\nchallenging, which necessitates precise and up-to-date comments. Objective: We\npropose a solution as an IntelliJ IDEA plugin, named SmartDoc, that assists\ndevelopers in generating context-aware method comments. Method: This plugin\nacts as an Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent that has its own memory and is\naugmented by target methods' context. When a request is initiated by the\nend-user, the method content and all its nested method calls are used in the\ncomment generation. At the beginning, these nested methods are visited and a\ncall graph is generated. This graph is then traversed using depth-first search\n(DFS), enabling the provision of full-context to enrich Large Language Model\n(LLM) prompts. Result: The product is a software, as a plugin, developed for\nJava codebase and installable on IntelliJ IDEA. This plugin can serve\nconcurrently for methods whose comments are being updated , and it shares\nmemory across all flows to avoid redundant calls. o measure the accuracy of\nthis solution, a dedicated test case is run to record SmartDoc generated\ncomments and their corresponding ground truth. For each collected result-set,\nthree metrics are computed, BERTScore, BLEU and ROUGE-1. These metrics will\ndetermine how accurate the generated comments are in comparison to the ground\ntruth. Result: The obtained accuracy, in terms of the precision, recall and F1,\nis promising, and lies in the range of 0.80 to 0.90 for BERTScore."}

By requiring only stability of\nmeasurement and frequency errors, we can circumvent existing lower bounds,\nleading to dramatic improvements under very general conditions. For example, if\nlinks exhibit a uniform worst-case estimation error of $\\Delta$ and a change in\nestimation errors of $\\delta\\ll \\Delta$ on relevant time scales, we bound the\nlocal skew by $O(\\Delta+\\delta \\log D)$ for networks of diameter $D$,\neffectively ``breaking'' the established $\\Omega(\\Delta\\log D)$ lower bound,\nwhich holds when $\\delta=\\Delta$.

Prior research has primarily focused on star networks featuring\nbit-flip and depolarizing channels, leaving the broader problem -- such as QNT\nfor networks with arbitrary topologies and general Pauli channels -- largely\nunexplored. Moreover, establishing channel identifiability remains a\nsignificant challenge even in simplified quantum star networks.\n  In the first part of this paper, we introduce a novel network tomography\nmethod, termed Mergecast, in quantum networks. We demonstrate that Mergecast,\ntogether with a progressive etching procedure, enables the unique\nidentification of all internal quantum channels in networks characterized by\narbitrary topologies and Pauli channels.

To overcome this challenge, we propose the Deep\nKoopman-boosted Dual-branch Diffusion Policy (D3P) algorithm. D3P introduces a\ndual-branch architecture to decouple the roles of different sensory modality\ncombinations. The visual branch encodes the visual observations to indicate\ntask progression, while the fused branch integrates both visual and\nproprioceptive inputs for precise manipulation. Within this architecture, when\nthe robot fails to accomplish intermediate goals, such as grasping a drawer\nhandle, the policy can dynamically switch to execute action chunks generated by\nthe visual branch, allowing recovery to previously observed states and\nfacilitating retrial of the task. To further enhance visual representation\nlearning, we incorporate a Deep Koopman Operator module that captures\nstructured temporal dynamics from visual inputs. During inference, we use the\ntest-time loss of the generative model as a confidence signal to guide the\naggregation of the temporally overlapping predicted action chunks, thereby\nenhancing the reliability of policy execution.

To\naddress this issue, this paper introduces a field information-driven\noptimization method based on three-dimensional Gaussian radiation-field\nmodeling for real-time optimization of integrated FAS-RIS systems. In the\nproposed approach, obstacles are treated as virtual transmitters and, by\nseparately learning the amplitude and phase variations, the model can quickly\ngenerate high-precision channel information based on the transmitter's\nposition. This design eliminates the need for extensive pilot overhead and\ncumbersome computations. On this framework, an alternating optimization scheme\nis presented to jointly optimize the FAS position and the RIS phase\nconfiguration. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method\nsignificantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of spectrum prediction\naccuracy, convergence speed, and minimum achievable rate, validating its\neffectiveness and practicality in fast-fading scenarios."}

Hypnosis and LLMs also exemplify functional agency - the\ncapacity for complex, goal-directed, context-sensitive behavior - without\nsubjective agency, the conscious awareness of intention and ownership that\ndefines human action. This distinction clarifies how purposive behavior can\nemerge without self-reflective consciousness, governed instead by structural\nand contextual dynamics.

This transformation from concave\nto convex is initiated by changes in turgor pressure and the release of stored\nelastic energy from prestresses in the concave state, which accelerate this\nmovement, leading to inversion of the lobes bi-axial curvature.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a\nDouble Information Bottleneck (DIB) strategy to obtain a powerful, unified\ncompact multimodal representation. Implemented within the framework of low-rank\nRenyi's entropy functional, DIB offers enhanced robustness against diverse\nnoise sources and computational tractability for high-dimensional data, as\ncompared to the conventional Shannon entropy-based methods.

Consequently, DIB yields a multimodal representation that\neffectively filters out noisy information from unimodal data while capturing\ninter-modal complementarity.

While considerable research has addressed optimal\nLiDAR placement for infrastructure, the profound impact of differing LiDAR\nscanning patterns on perceptual performance remains comparatively\nunder-investigated. The inherent nature of various scanning modes - such as\ntraditional repetitive (mechanical/solid-state) versus emerging non-repetitive\n(e.g. prism-based) systems - leads to distinct point cloud distributions at\nvarying distances, critically dictating the efficacy of object detection and\noverall environmental understanding. To systematically investigate these\ndifferences in infrastructure-based contexts, we introduce the \"InfraLiDARs'\nBenchmark,\" a novel dataset meticulously collected in the CARLA simulation\nenvironment using concurrently operating infrastructure-based LiDARs exhibiting\nboth scanning paradigms. Leveraging this benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive\nstatistical analysis of the respective LiDAR scanning abilities and evaluate\nthe impact of these distinct patterns on the performance of various leading 3D\nobject detection algorithms.

These networks\nwere evaluated on downstream tasks for a sinonasal tumor dataset and a squamous\ncell carcinoma of the skin dataset. On both datasets, we found the highest test\naccuracy on the filtered SSL-pretrained model, with 67.48% and 73.52%, both\nconsiderably outperforming their non-SSL baselines. Our results show that SSL\nis an effective method for CLE pretraining.

We investigate multiple\ntop-down traversal methods for autoregressive sampling, incorporating\ntechniques from test-time compute scaling used in language models.\nSpecifically, we integrate beam search and multi-sample inference while\nexploring various selection strategies to determine the final output. This\nenables the model to manage uncertainty by exploring multiple plausible paths\nthrough the hierarchy. We evaluate our method on the Im2GPS3k and YFCC4k\ndatasets against two distinct sets of baselines: those that operate without a\nMultimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and those that leverage one. In the\nMLLM-free setting, our model surpasses other comparable baselines on nearly all\nmetrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance with accuracy gains of up to\n13.9%. When augmented with an MLLM, our model outperforms all baselines,\nsetting a new state-of-the-art across all metrics. The source code is available\nat https://github.com/NNargesNN/GeoToken."}

Analogously,\nour model predicts geographic tokens hierarchically, first identifying a\ngeneral region and then sequentially refining predictions to increasingly\nprecise locations. Rather than relying on explicit semantic partitions, our\nmethod uses S2 cells, a nested, multiresolution global grid, and sequentially\npredicts finer-level cells conditioned on visual inputs and previous\npredictions. This procedure mirrors autoregressive text generation in large\nlanguage models. Much like in language modeling, final performance depends not\nonly on training but also on inference-time strategy. We investigate multiple\ntop-down traversal methods for autoregressive sampling, incorporating\ntechniques from test-time compute scaling used in language models.\nSpecifically, we integrate beam search and multi-sample inference while\nexploring various selection strategies to determine the final output.

Although several studies have attempted to\ncounter this by generating adversarially perturbed samples designed to disrupt\npersonalization, they rely on unrealistic assumptions and become ineffective in\nthe presence of even a few clean images or under simple image transformations.\nTo address these challenges, we shift the protection target from the images to\nthe diffusion model itself to hinder the personalization of specific subjects,\nthrough our novel framework called Anti-Personalized Diffusion Models (APDM).\nWe first provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that a naive approach of\nexisting loss functions to diffusion models is inherently incapable of ensuring\nconvergence for robust anti-personalization. Motivated by this finding, we\nintroduce Direct Protective Optimization (DPO), a novel loss function that\neffectively disrupts subject personalization in the target model without\ncompromising generative quality. Moreover, we propose a new dual-path\noptimization strategy, coined Learning to Protect (L2P).

Moreover,\nour strategy focuses on using RL for challenging samples that are significantly\ndistant from the ground truth, and our RL approach is innovatively implemented\nusing MLLM-based IQA models to align distributions with high-quality images\ninitially. As the samples approach the ground truth's distribution, RL is\nadaptively combined with SFT for more fine-grained alignment. This dynamic\nprocess is facilitated through an automatic weighting strategy that adjusts\nbased on the relative difficulty of the training samples. Our strategy is\nplug-and-play that can be seamlessly applied to diffusion-based restoration\nmodels, boosting its performance across various restoration tasks. Extensive\nexperiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nproposed RL framework."}

However, as they are typically optimized in\nsemantic latent space, where proximity does not guarantee physical correctness\nin visual space, they often produce unrealistic results, such as overexposed\nhighlights, misaligned shadows, and incorrect occlusions. We address this with\nUniLumos, a unified relighting framework for both images and videos that brings\nRGB-space geometry feedback into a flow matching backbone. By supervising the\nmodel with depth and normal maps extracted from its outputs, we explicitly\nalign lighting effects with the scene structure, enhancing physical\nplausibility. Nevertheless, this feedback requires high-quality outputs for\nsupervision in visual space, making standard multi-step denoising\ncomputationally expensive. To mitigate this, we employ path consistency\nlearning, allowing supervision to remain effective even under few-step training\nregimes. To enable fine-grained relighting control and supervision, we design a\nstructured six-dimensional annotation protocol capturing core illumination\nattributes. Building upon this, we propose LumosBench, a disentangled\nattribute-level benchmark that evaluates lighting controllability via large\nvision-language models, enabling automatic and interpretable assessment of\nrelighting precision across individual dimensions.

However, existing methods often rely on panoramic\nobservations and two-stage pipelines involving waypoint predictors, which\nintroduce significant latency and limit real-world applicability. In this work,\nwe propose Fast-SmartWay, an end-to-end zero-shot VLN-CE framework that\neliminates the need for panoramic views and waypoint predictors. Our approach\nuses only three frontal RGB-D images combined with natural language\ninstructions, enabling MLLMs to directly predict actions. To enhance decision\nrobustness, we introduce an Uncertainty-Aware Reasoning module that integrates\n(i) a Disambiguation Module for avoiding local optima, and (ii) a Future-Past\nBidirectional Reasoning mechanism for globally coherent planning. Experiments\non both simulated and real-robot environments demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly reduces per-step latency while achieving competitive or superior\nperformance compared to panoramic-view baselines. These results demonstrate the\npracticality and effectiveness of Fast-SmartWay for real-world zero-shot\nembodied navigation."}

Despite\nadvances in LiDAR inertial visual odometry (LIVO), its performance remains\nhighly sensitive to extrinsic calibration. Meanwhile, 3D vision foundation\nmodels, such as VGGT, suffer from limited scalability in large environments and\ninherently lack metric scale. To overcome these limitations, we propose\nLiDAR-VGGT, a novel framework that tightly couples LiDAR inertial odometry with\nthe state-of-the-art VGGT model through a two-stage coarse- to-fine fusion\npipeline: First, a pre-fusion module with robust initialization refinement\nefficiently estimates VGGT poses and point clouds with coarse metric scale\nwithin each session. Then, a post-fusion module enhances cross-modal 3D\nsimilarity transformation, using bounding-box-based regularization to reduce\nscale distortions caused by inconsistent FOVs between LiDAR and camera sensors.\nExtensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that LiDAR-VGGT\nachieves dense, globally consistent colored point clouds and outperforms both\nVGGT-based methods and LIVO baselines. The implementation of our proposed novel\ncolor point cloud evaluation toolkit will be released as open source."}

Such understanding is captured through articulated objects,\nwhich are essential for tasks such as physical simulation, motion planning, and\npolicy learning. However, creating these models, particularly for complex\nsystems like robots or objects with high degrees of freedom (DoF), remains a\nsignificant challenge. Existing methods typically rely on motion sequences or\nstrong assumptions from hand-curated datasets, which hinders scalability. In\nthis paper, we introduce Kinematify, an automated framework that synthesizes\narticulated objects directly from arbitrary RGB images or text prompts. Our\nmethod addresses two core challenges: (i) inferring kinematic topologies for\nhigh-DoF objects and (ii) estimating joint parameters from static geometry. To\nachieve this, we combine MCTS search for structural inference with\ngeometry-driven optimization for joint reasoning, producing physically\nconsistent and functionally valid descriptions. We evaluate Kinematify on\ndiverse inputs from both synthetic and real-world environments, demonstrating\nimprovements in registration and kinematic topology accuracy over prior work."}

Under review at the Conference on Computer\n  Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2026", "summary": "Explanations for AI models in high-stakes domains like medicine often lack\nverifiability, which can hinder trust. To address this, we propose an\ninteractive agent that produces explanations through an auditable sequence of\nactions. The agent learns a policy to strategically seek external visual\nevidence to support its diagnostic reasoning. This policy is optimized using\nreinforcement learning, resulting in a model that is both efficient and\ngeneralizable. Our experiments show that this action-based reasoning process\nsignificantly improves calibrated accuracy, reducing the Brier score by 18\\%\ncompared to a non-interactive baseline. To validate the faithfulness of the\nagent's explanations, we introduce a causal intervention method. By masking the\nvisual evidence the agent chooses to use, we observe a measurable degradation\nin its performance ($\\Delta$Brier=+0.029), confirming that the evidence is\nintegral to its decision-making process. Our work provides a practical\nframework for building AI systems with verifiable and faithful reasoning\ncapabilities."}

We introduce MARS - a Multi-Agent Robotic\nSystem powered by MLLMs for assistive intelligence and designed for smart home\nrobots supporting people with disabilities. The system integrates four agents:\na visual perception agent for extracting semantic and spatial features from\nenvironment images, a risk assessment agent for identifying and prioritizing\nhazards, a planning agent for generating executable action sequences, and an\nevaluation agent for iterative optimization. By combining multimodal perception\nwith hierarchical multi-agent decision-making, the framework enables adaptive,\nrisk-aware, and personalized assistance in dynamic indoor environments.\nExperiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior overall performance\nof the proposed system in risk-aware planning and coordinated multi-agent\nexecution compared with state-of-the-art multimodal models.

Recent work integrates future images into the\nunderstanding-acting loop, yielding unified VLAs that jointly understand,\ngenerate, and act -- reading text and images and producing future images and\nactions. However, these models either rely on external experts for modality\nunification or treat image generation and action prediction as separate\nprocesses, limiting the benefits of direct synergy between these tasks. Our\ncore philosophy is to optimize generation and action jointly through a\nsynchronous denoising process, where the iterative refinement enables actions\nto evolve from initialization, under constant and sufficient visual guidance.\nWe ground this philosophy in our proposed Unified Diffusion VLA and Joint\nDiscrete Denoising Diffusion Process (JD3P), which is a joint diffusion process\nthat integrates multiple modalities into a single denoising trajectory to serve\nas the key mechanism enabling understanding, generation, and acting to be\nintrinsically synergistic. Our model and theory are built on a unified\ntokenized space of all modalities and a hybrid attention mechanism. We further\npropose a two-stage training pipeline and several inference-time techniques\nthat optimize performance and efficiency. Our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as CALVIN, LIBERO, and\nSimplerEnv with 4$\\times$ faster inference than autoregressive methods, and we\ndemonstrate its effectiveness through in-depth analysis and real-world\nevaluations.
