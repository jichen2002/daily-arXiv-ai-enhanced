Each pause potentially causes KV cache\neviction and extra waiting time before entering the continuous batch for the\nfollowing LLM request. Since these pauses happen for each call, this problem\nbecomes increasingly severe as turn number grow for agentic programs. Previous\nworks either fail to incorporate information from the tool call, evicting KV\ncache that leads to repetitive prefill or loading, or ignore the continuity of\na multi-turn program, creating waiting time between turns that increases\nper-request latency.\n  We present Continuum, a serving system to optimize job completion time for\nmulti-turn agent workloads by combining tool-aware KV cache timeout with\nprogram-level scheduling. By predicting tool call durations in agentic\nworkflows, Continuum selectively pins the KV cache in GPU memory with a\ntime-to-live value based on total turn number. When combined with program-level\nfirst-come-first-serve, Continuum prevents scheduling bubbles, preserves\nmulti-turn continuity, and optimizes for throughput for complex agentic\nworkflows. By modeling the variability of tool call and agent program\ncontinuity, Continuum outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation on\nreal-world agentic workloads (SWE-Bench and BFCL) with Llama-3.1 8B/70B models\nshows that Continuum significantly improves the average job completion times,\nand remains performant across different hardware setups and DRAM offloading\nschemes.

While recent vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have shown\nremarkable transferability across medical domains, their ability to\ndiscriminate anatomically similar structures has not been systematically\ninvestigated. We address this gap by focusing on fetal brain standard\nplanes--transthalamic (TT), transventricular (TV), and transcerebellar\n(TC)--which exhibit highly overlapping anatomical features and pose a critical\nchallenge for reliable biometric assessment.\n  Methods: To ensure a fair and reproducible evaluation, all publicly available\nfetal ultrasound datasets were curated and aggregated into a unified\nmulticenter benchmark, FetalUS-188K, comprising more than 188,000 annotated\nimages from heterogeneous acquisition settings. DINOv3 was pretrained in a\nself-supervised manner to learn ultrasound-aware representations.

The first models considered are of senders running TCP\n(Transmission Control Protocol) and traffic passing through RED (Random Early\nDetection) gateways. Building on earlier work, a first order nonlinear\ndiscrete-time model is developed for the interaction scenario between transport\nprotocols like TCP and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and Active Queuing\nManagement schemes like RED. It is shown that the dynamics resulting from the\ninteraction with TCP is consistent with various dynamical behaviors and\nparameter sensitivities observed in practice. Using bifurcation-theoretic ideas\nit is shown that TCP-RED type networks may lose their stability through a\nperiod doubling bifurcation followed by border collision bifurcations. The\nnonlinear dependence of the throughput function of TCP-type flows on drop\nprobability is found to be responsible for the period doubling bifurcation,\nwhereas limited buffer space and lack of sufficient damping results in border\ncollision bifurcations. A second class of models studied in this work deals\nwith optimal rate control in networks and are based on the rate-control\nframework proposed by Kelly. Using the results on delay-differential equation\nstability, the stability and its lack thereof is studied through an underlying\nmap which arises naturally in time delay systems.

A key issue\nis how to model, analyze, and design these multi-robot systems to realize the\nfull benefits of collaboration, a challenging task since the domain of\nmulti-robot autonomy encompasses both collective and individual behaviors. This\npaper introduces a layered model of multi-robot autonomy that uses the\nprinciple of census, or a weighted count of the inputs from neighbors, for\ncollective decision-making about teaming, coupled with multi-objective behavior\noptimization for individual decision-making about actions. The census component\nis expressed as a nonlinear opinion dynamics model and the multi-objective\nbehavior optimization is accomplished using interval programming. This model\ncan be reduced to recover foundational algorithms in distributed optimization\nand control, while the full model enables new types of collective behaviors\nthat are useful in real-world scenarios. To illustrate these points, a new\nmethod for distributed optimization of subgroup allocation is introduced where\nrobots use a gradient descent algorithm to minimize portions of the cost\nfunctions that are locally known, while being influenced by the opinion states\nfrom neighbors to account for the unobserved costs. With this method the group\ncan collectively use the information contained in the Hessian matrix of the\ntotal global cost. The utility of this model is experimentally validated in\nthree categorically different experiments with fleets of autonomous surface\nvehicles: an adaptive sampling scenario, a high value unit protection scenario,\nand a competitive game of capture the flag."}

The study systematically varies $n$ and evaluates the performance of\nthe arm to reach a fixed target in three scenarios: default baseline condition,\nrecovery from external disturbance, and adaptation to actuator failure.\nQuantitative metrics used for the evaluation are mean action magnitude, mean\nfinal distance, mean episode length, and success rate. The results show that\nthere are no significant benefits of the distributed policy when the number of\ncontrolled sections $n\\le4$. In very simple systems, when $n\\le2$, the\ncentralised policy outperforms the distributed one. When $n$ increases to $4<\nn\\le 12$, the distributed policy shows a high sample efficiency. In these\nsystems, distributed policy promotes a stronger success rate, resilience, and\nrobustness under local observability and yields faster convergence given the\nsame sample size. However, centralised policies achieve much higher time\nefficiency during training as it takes much less time to train the same size of\nsamples. These findings highlight the trade-offs between centralised and\ndistributed policy in reinforcement learning-based control for soft robotic\nsystems and provide actionable design guidance for future sim-to-real transfer\nin soft rod-like manipulators."}

Prior work measured this behavior only with coarse\ndataset-level statistics, overlooking the influence of model's confidence in\nunimodal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that decomposes\nmodality following into two fundamental factors: relative reasoning uncertainty\n(the case-specific confidence gap between unimodal predictions) and inherent\nmodality preference( a model's stable bias when uncertainties are balanced). To\nvalidate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that\nsystematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs.\nUsing entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law:\nthe probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative\nuncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends\nto follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance\npoint, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference. Unlike\ntraditional macro-level ratios, this measure offers a more principled and less\nconfounded way to characterize modality bias, disentangling it from unimodal\ncapabilities and dataset artifacts. Further, by probing layer-wise predictions,\nwe reveal the internal mechanism of oscillation: in ambiguous regions near the\nbalance point, models vacillate between modalities across layers, explaining\nexternally observed indecision.

To address these, we propose Federated Attention\n(FedAttn), which integrates the federated paradigm into the self-attention\nmechanism, creating a new distributed LLM inference framework that\nsimultaneously achieves privacy protection, communication efficiency, and\ncomputational efficiency. FedAttn enables participants to perform local\nself-attention over their own token representations while periodically\nexchanging and aggregating Key-Value (KV) matrices across multiple Transformer\nblocks, collaboratively generating LLM responses without exposing private\nprompts. Further, we identify a structural duality between contextual\nrepresentation refinement in FedAttn and parameter optimization in FL across\nprivate data, local computation, and global aggregation. This key insight\nprovides a principled foundation for systematically porting federated\noptimization techniques to collaborative LLM inference. Building on this\nframework, we theoretically analyze how local self-attention computation within\nparticipants and heterogeneous token relevance among participants shape error\npropagation dynamics across Transformer blocks. Moreover, we characterize the\nfundamental trade-off between response quality and communication/computation\nefficiency, which is governed by the synchronization interval and the number of\nparticipants.

Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks\nsuch as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding\nunderexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG\ncode as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We\nintroduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code\ngeneration: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic\nmeaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general\ncommonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric\nperception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel\nevaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered\nSVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically,\nfrontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap\nbetween language-centric and visual-centric coding.
