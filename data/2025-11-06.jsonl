AURA integrates large language models (LLMs), a high-fidelity\ndigital twin (DT), and human-in-the-loop interaction to detect and respond to\nanomalous behavior in real time. The architecture uses two agents with clear\nroles: (i) a low-level State Anomaly Characterization Agent that monitors\ntelemetry and converts signals into a structured natural-language problem\ndescription, and (ii) a high-level Diagnostic Reasoning Agent that conducts a\nknowledge-grounded dialogue with an operator to identify root causes, drawing\non external sources. Human-validated diagnoses are then converted into new\ntraining examples that refine the low-level perceptual model. This feedback\nloop progressively distills expert knowledge into the AI, transforming it from\na static tool into an adaptive partner.

This setting considers a particular\nadversary that will be applied only to a subset of input configurations. In\nthis setting, they studied the $k$-set agreement task with condition-based\n$t$-resilient adversaries and obtained a sufficient condition on the conditions\nthat make $k$-Set Agreement solvable. In this paper we have three\ncontributions:\n  -We generalize the characterization of~\\cite{CG-24} to \\emph{input-dependent}\nadversaries, which means that the adversaries can change depending on the input\nconfiguration.\n  - We show that core-resilient adversaries of $IIS_n$ have the same\ncomputability power as the core-resilient adversaries of $IIS_n$ where crashes\nonly happen at the start.\n  - Using the two previous contributions, we provide a necessary and sufficient\ncharacterization of the condition-based, core-dependent adversaries that can\nsolve $k$-Set Agreement. We also distinguish four settings that may appear when\npresenting a distributed task as $(\\I,\\Ou,\\Delta)$. Finally, in a later\nsection, we present structural properties on the carrier map $\\Delta$. Such\nproperties allow simpler proof, without changing the computability power of the\ntask.

The challenges posed by optimization problems are primarily\nmanifested in their non-convexity, high-dimensionality, black-box nature, and\nother unfavorable characteristics. Traditional zero-order or first-order\nmethods, which are often characterized by low efficiency, inaccurate gradient\ninformation, and insufficient utilization of optimization information, are\nill-equipped to address these challenges effectively. In recent years, the\nrapid development of large language models (LLM) has led to substantial\nimprovements in their language understanding and code generation capabilities.\nConsequently, the design of optimization algorithms leveraging large language\nmodels has garnered increasing attention from researchers. In this study, we\nchoose the fireworks algorithm(FWA) as the basic optimizer and propose a novel\napproach to assist the design of the FWA by incorporating multi-modal large\nlanguage model(MLLM). To put it simply, we propose the concept of Critical\nPart(CP), which extends FWA to complex high-dimensional tasks, and further\nutilizes the information in the optimization process with the help of the\nmulti-modal characteristics of large language models. We focus on two specific\ntasks: the \\textit{traveling salesman problem }(TSP) and \\textit{electronic\ndesign automation problem} (EDA). The experimental results show that FWAs\ngenerated under our new framework have achieved or surpassed SOTA results on\nmany problem instances."}

Prior work often cites\nthe $\\Omega(n)$ lower bound for non-preemptive algorithms to argue for the\nnecessity of preemption or resource augmentation, which shows the trivial\n$O(n)$-competitive greedy algorithm is tight. However, this lower bound applies\nonly to \\emph{deterministic} algorithms in the \\emph{single-machine} case,\nleaving several fundamental questions unanswered. Can randomness help in the\nnon-preemptive setting, and what is the optimal online deterministic algorithm\nwhen $m \\geq 2$? We resolve both questions. We present a polynomial-time\nrandomized algorithm with competitive ratio $\\Theta(\\sqrt{n/m})$ and prove a\nmatching randomized lower bound, settling the randomized non-preemptive setting\nfor every $m$. This also improves the best-known offline approximation ratio\nfrom $O(\\sqrt{n/m}\\log(n/m))$ to $O(\\sqrt{n/m})$. On the deterministic side, we\npresent a non-preemptive algorithm with competitive ratio\n$O(n/m^{2}+\\sqrt{n/m}\\log m)$ and prove a nearly matching lower bound.\n  Our framework also extends to the kill-and-restart model, where we reveal a\nsharp transition of deterministic algorithms: we design an asymptotically\noptimal algorithm with the competitive ratio $O(\\sqrt{n/m})$ for $m\\ge 2$, yet\nestablish a strong $\\Omega(n/\\log n)$ lower bound for $m=1$. Moreover, we show\nthat randomization provides no further advantage, as the lower bound coincides\nwith that of the non-preemptive setting.\n  While our main results assume prior knowledge of $n$, we also investigate the\nsetting where $n$ is unknown. We show kill-and-restart is powerful enough to\nbreak the $O(n)$ barrier for $m \\geq 2$ even without knowing $n$. Conversely,\nwe prove randomization alone is insufficient, as no algorithm can achieve an\n$o(n)$ competitive ratio in this setting."}

Differential fuzzing, in\nparticular, operates as a guided randomized search, aiming to find (similar)\ninputs that lead to a maximum difference in software outputs or their\nbehaviors. However, fuzzing, as a dynamic analysis, lacks any guarantees on the\nabsence of bugs: from a differential fuzzing campaign that has observed no bugs\n(or a minimal difference), what is the risk of observing a bug (or a larger\ndifference) if we run the fuzzer for one or more steps?\n  This paper investigates the application of Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to\naddress the risk of missing or underestimating bugs in differential fuzzing.\nThe key observation is that differential fuzzing as a random process resembles\nthe maximum distribution of observed differences. Hence, EVT, a branch of\nstatistics dealing with extreme values, is an ideal framework to analyze the\ntail of the differential fuzzing campaign to contain the risk. We perform\nexperiments on a set of real-world Java libraries and use differential fuzzing\nto find information leaks via side channels in these libraries.

Creating rigorous ACs is particularly challenging in the\ncontext of software product lines (SPLs), i.e, sets of software products with\noverlapping but distinct features and behaviours. Since SPLs can encompass very\nlarge numbers of products, developing a rigorous AC for each product\nindividually is infeasible. Moreover, if the SPL evolves, e.g., by the\nmodification or introduction of features, it can be infeasible to assess the\nimpact of this change.

Indeed, in the case of software refactoring, traditional\nLLMs have shown the ability to reduce development time and enhance code\nquality.

In contrast, LLM-based agents can dynamically adapt to evolving\ncontexts and autonomously make decisions by interacting with software tools and\nexecuting workflows. In this paper, we explore the potential of LLM-based\nagents in supporting refactoring activities.

RefAgent consists of specialized agents responsible for planning,\nexecuting, testing, and iteratively refining refactorings using self-reflection\nand tool-calling capabilities. We evaluate RefAgent on eight open-source Java\nprojects, comparing its effectiveness against a single-agent approach, a\nsearch-based refactoring tool, and historical developer refactorings. Our\nassessment focuses on: (1) the impact of generated refactorings on software\nquality, (2) the ability to identify refactoring opportunities, and (3) the\ncontribution of each LLM agent through an ablation study. Our results show that\nRefAgent achieves a median unit test pass rate of 90%, reduces code smells by a\nmedian of 52.5%, and improves key quality attributes (e.g., reusability) by a\nmedian of 8.6%.

In this paper, we present\nLQPR, a highly efficient automatic approach for performance requirements\nquantification.LQPR relies on a new theoretical framework that converts\nquantification as a classification problem. Despite the prevalent applications\nof Large Language Models (LLMs) for requirement analytics, LQPR takes a\ndifferent perspective to address the classification: we observed that\nperformance requirements can exhibit strong patterns and are often\nshort/concise, therefore we design a lightweight linguistically induced\nmatching mechanism. We compare LQPR against nine state-of-the-art\nlearning-based approaches over diverse datasets, demonstrating that it is\nranked as the sole best for 75% or more cases with two orders less cost.

Indeed, in the case of software refactoring, traditional\nLLMs have shown the ability to reduce development time and enhance code\nquality.

RefAgent consists of specialized agents responsible for planning,\nexecuting, testing, and iteratively refining refactorings using self-reflection\nand tool-calling capabilities. We evaluate RefAgent on eight open-source Java\nprojects, comparing its effectiveness against a single-agent approach, a\nsearch-based refactoring tool, and historical developer refactorings. Our\nassessment focuses on: (1) the impact of generated refactorings on software\nquality, (2) the ability to identify refactoring opportunities, and (3) the\ncontribution of each LLM agent through an ablation study. Our results show that\nRefAgent achieves a median unit test pass rate of 90%, reduces code smells by a\nmedian of 52.5%, and improves key quality attributes (e.g., reusability) by a\nmedian of 8.6%.

We propose a novel approach that\nleverages natural language artifacts from GitHub -- such as pull request\ndescriptions, issue descriptions and discussions, and commit messages -- to\nenhance LLM-based code understanding. Our system consists of three components:\none that extracts and structures relevant GitHub context, another that uses\nthis context to generate high-level explanations of the code's purpose, and a\nthird that validates the explanation. We implemented this as a standalone tool,\nas well as a server within the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling\nintegration with other AI-assisted development tools. Our main use case is that\nof enhancing a standard LLM-based code explanation with code insights that our\nsystem generates. To evaluate explanations' quality, we conducted a small scale\nuser study, with developers of several open projects, as well as developers of\nproprietary projects. Our user study indicates that when insights are generated\nthey often are helpful and non trivial, and are free from hallucinations."}
