RAMP converges quickly\nwithin five iterations, and ablation studies confirm that test generation and\nself-reflection are key drivers of its performance.

While recent advances have focused\nprimarily on detecting individual actions, much less work has addressed the\ndetection and annotation of interactions -- a crucial aspect for understanding\nsocial and individualized animal behavior. Existing open-source annotation\ntools support either behavioral labeling without localization of individuals,\nor localization without the capacity to capture interactions.

By linking behavioral\necology with computer vision, SILVI facilitates the development of automated\napproaches for fine-grained behavioral analyses. Although developed primarily\nin the context of animal behavior, SILVI could be useful more broadly to\nannotate human interactions in other videos that require extracting dynamic\nscene graphs.

We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules\ntailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we\nassess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a\ncritical problem in binary code analysis.\n  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,\nsystematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and\ncapturing semantic nuances.

The resulting controller\ndemonstrates strong reactivity, consistently executing coherent and robust\nsoccer behaviors across various scenarios, including real RoboCup matches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u6267\u884c\u8db3\u7403\u6280\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u6a21\u5757\u89e3\u8026\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u8fde\u8d2f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u611f\u77e5\u9650\u5236\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6297\u8fd0\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u865a\u62df\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u4ece\u975e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u7279\u6743\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u771f\u5b9eRoboCup\u6bd4\u8d5b\uff09\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8db3\u7403\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u8db3\u7403\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

While DCQCN provides a\nscalable traffic rate adjustment for congesting flows at end nodes (which is\nslow) and CI effectively isolates these flows in special network resources\n(which requires extra logic in the switches), their combined use, although it\ndiminishes their particular drawbacks, leads to false congestion scenarios\nidentification and signaling, excessive throttling, and inefficient network\nresource utilization. In this paper, we propose a new CI mechanism, called\nImproved Congestion Isolation (ICI), which efficiently combines CI and DCQCN so\nthat the information of the isolated congesting flows is used to guide the ECN\nmarking performed by DCQCN in a way that victim flows do not end up being\nmarked.

However, current memory-intensive algorithms, especially those\nused in big data systems, often overlook PCM's endurance limitations (10^6 to\n10^8 writes before degradation) and write asymmetry. Self-balancing binary\nsearch trees (BSTs), which are widely used for large-scale data management,\nwere developed without considering PCM's unique properties, leading to\npotential performance degradation. This paper introduces HART, a novel hybrid\naddressing scheme for self-balancing BSTs, designed to optimize PCM's\ncharacteristics. By combining DFATGray code addressing for deeper nodes with\nlinear addressing for shallower nodes, HART balances reduced bit flips during\nfrequent rotations at deeper levels with computational simplicity at shallow\nlevels. Experimental results on PCM-aware AVL trees demonstrate significant\nimprovements in performance, with a reduction in bit flips leading to enhanced\nendurance, increased lifetime, and lower write energy and latency.

This capability has been shown to reduce workload\nmakespan, substantially decrease job waiting times and improve overall system\nutilization. In this context, malleability refers to the ability of\napplications to adapt to new resource allocations during execution. Although\nbeneficial, malleability incurs significant reconfiguration costs, making the\nreduction of these costs an important research topic.\n  Some existing methods for MPI applications respawn the entire application,\nwhich is an expensive solution that avoids the reuse of original processes.\nOther MPI methods reuse them, but fail to fully release unneeded processes when\nshrinking, since some ranks within the same communicator remain active across\nnodes, preventing the application from returning those nodes to the system.\nThis work overcomes both limitations by proposing a novel parallel spawning\nstrategy, in which all processes cooperate in spawning before redistribution,\nthereby reducing execution time. Additionally, it removes shrinkage\nlimitations, allowing better adaptation of parallel systems to workload and\nreducing their makespan. As a result, it preserves competitive expansion times\nwith at most a $1.25\\times$ overhead, while enabling fast shrink operations\nthat reduce their cost by at least $20\\times$.

While Unmanned\nAerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms offer a promising solution for tasks like wide-area\nsearch and supply delivery, yet their effective coordination places a\nsignificant cognitive burden on human operators. The core human-machine\ncollaboration bottleneck lies in the ``intention-to-action gap'', which is an\nerror-prone process of translating a high-level rescue objective into a\nlow-level swarm command under high intensity and pressure. To bridge this gap,\nthis study proposes a novel LLM-CRF system that leverages Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to model and augment human-swarm teaming cognition. The proposed\nframework initially captures the operator's intention through natural and\nmulti-modal interactions with the device via voice or graphical annotations. It\nthen employs the LLM as a cognitive engine to perform intention comprehension,\nhierarchical task decomposition, and mission planning for the UAV swarm. This\nclosed-loop framework enables the swarm to act as a proactive partner,\nproviding active feedback in real-time while reducing the need for manual\nmonitoring and control, which considerably advances the efficacy of the SAR\ntask. We evaluate the proposed framework in a simulated SAR scenario.\nExperimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional order and\ncommand-based interfaces, the proposed LLM-driven approach reduced task\ncompletion time by approximately $64.2\\%$ and improved task success rate by\n$7\\%$. It also leads to a considerable reduction in subjective cognitive\nworkload, with NASA-TLX scores dropping by $42.9\\%$.

Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which\nleverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and\nperformance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over\ntraditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem\nfrom its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different\nknowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a\nstudent's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this\npaper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's\nstrength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a\ncausal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise\nrelation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal\nsubsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities\nalign strongly with these causal structures. Furthermore, we propose an\nalternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned\nrepresentations and provide empirical evidence supporting our claim.

Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural\nperspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:\nWhile targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the\ndirection of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not\novercome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a\nrestricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,\nand Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably\nsimilar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with\nselective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment\nwith cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit\ncultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly,\ncombining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an\nEnglish prompt.

This paper\npresents a biomimetic control framework based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN),\ninspired by the human Central Nervous System (CNS), to achieve agile control in\nsuch environments. The proposed framework features five control modules\n(cerebral cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, brainstem, spinal cord), three\nhierarchical control levels (first-order, second-order, third-order), and two\ninformation pathways (ascending, descending). Each module is fully implemented\nusing SNN. The spinal cord module uses spike encoding and Leaky\nIntegrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons for feedback control. The brainstem module\nemploys a network of LIF and non-spiking LIF neurons to dynamically adjust\nspinal cord parameters via reinforcement learning. The thalamus module\nsimilarly adjusts the cerebellum's torque outputs.

ArchPilot consists of three specialized agents: an\norchestration agent that coordinates the search process using a Monte Carlo\nTree Search (MCTS)-inspired novel algorithm with a restart mechanism and\nmanages memory of previous candidates; a generation agent that iteratively\ngenerates, improves, and debugs candidate architectures; and an evaluation\nagent that executes proxy training runs, generates and optimizes proxy\nfunctions, and aggregates the proxy scores into a fidelity-aware performance\nmetric. This multi-agent collaboration allows ArchPilot to prioritize\nhigh-potential candidates with minimal reliance on expensive full training\nruns, facilitating efficient ML engineering under limited budgets. Experiments\non MLE-Bench demonstrate that ArchPilot outperforms SOTA baselines such as AIDE\nand ML-Master, validating the effectiveness of our multi-agent system.", "AI": {"tldr": "ArchPilot\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u641c\u7d22\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5168\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u81ea\u52a8\u5316ML\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709LLM-based\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316ML\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u91cd\u590d\u5168\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fd0\u884c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u5468\u671f\u6162\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "ArchPilot\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u534f\u8c03\u641c\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7f16\u6392\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u5019\u9009\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u751f\u6210\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6267\u884c\u4ee3\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "result": "ArchPilot\u5728MLE-Bench\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ArchPilot\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u5728MLE-Bench\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u5f02\u8868\u73b0\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982AIDE\u548cML-Master\u3002"}}

We\nintroduce a bipartite graph framework that unifies and extends several known\nformulations, including the bipartite matching, matroid intersection, and\nrandom-order matroid secretary problems. In this model, elements form a\nbipartite graph between agents and items, and the objective is to select a\nmatching that satisfies feasibility constraints on both sides, given by two\nindependence systems.\n  We study the free-order setting, where the algorithm may adaptively choose\nthe next element to reveal. For $k$-matroid intersection, we leverage a core\nlemma by (Feldman, Svensson and Zenklusen, 2022) to design an\n$\\Omega(1/k^2)$-competitive algorithm, extending known results for single\nmatroids. Building on this, we identify the structural property underlying our\napproach and introduce $k$-growth systems. We establish a generalized core\nlemma for $k$-growth systems, showing that a suitably defined set of critical\nelements retains a $\\Omega(1/k^2)$ fraction of the optimal weight. Using this\nlemma, we extend our $\\Omega(1/k^2)$-competitive algorithm to $k$-growth\nsystems for the edge-arrival model.\n  We then study the agent-arrival model, which presents unique challenges to\nour framework. We extend the core lemma to this model and then apply it to\nobtain an $\\Omega(\\beta/k^2)$-competitive algorithm for $k$-growth systems,\nwhere $\\beta$ denotes the competitiveness of a special type of order-oblivious\nalgorithm for the item-side constraint. Finally, we relax the matching\nassumption and extend our results to the case of multiple item selection, where\nagents have individual independence systems coupled by a global item-side\nconstraint. We obtain constant-competitive algorithms for fundamental cases\nsuch as partition matroids and $k$-matching constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u90e8\u56fe\u6846\u67b6\u548ck-growth\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u81ea\u7531\u987a\u5e8f\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u5230\u8fbe\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5728\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u987a\u5e8f\u8bbe\u5b9a\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u5230\u8fbe\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e8c\u90e8\u56fe\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6838\u5fc3\u5f15\u7406\u548ck-growth\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9k-\u62df\u9635\u4ea4\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u987a\u5e8f\u8bbe\u5b9a\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u03a9(1/k\u00b2)-\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5355\u62df\u9635\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4ee3\u7406\u5230\u8fbe\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u03a9(\u03b2/k\u00b2)-\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u591a\u91cd\u7269\u54c1\u9009\u62e9\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u6052\u5b9a\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e8c\u90e8\u56fe\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u81ea\u7531\u987a\u5e8f\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3ak-growth\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406\u5230\u8fbe\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5728\u591a\u91cd\u7269\u54c1\u9009\u62e9\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6052\u5b9a\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Existing\nmethods typically prioritize either geometric accuracy (Multi-View Stereo) or\nphotorealistic rendering (Novel View Synthesis), often decoupling geometry and\nappearance optimization, which hinders downstream editing tasks. This paper\nadvocates an unified treatment on geometry and appearance optimization for\nseamless Gaussian-mesh joint optimization.

Among other things, LLM agents are rapidly\ngaining momentum in their application to software development, with\npractitioners claiming a multifold productivity increase after adoption. Yet,\nempirical evidence is lacking around these claims. In this paper, we estimate\nthe causal effect of adopting a widely popular LLM agent assistant, namely\nCursor, on development velocity and software quality. The estimation is enabled\nby a state-of-the-art difference-in-differences design comparing\nCursor-adopting GitHub projects with a matched control group of similar GitHub\nprojects that do not use Cursor.

Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose\ninformation to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI\nvision models.

Strikingly,\n3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that\nkey social information is available in explicit body position but not in the\nlearned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise\nembeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the\ncritical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a\ncompact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and\ndirection of faces in the videos.

However, PPG signal\nquality is challenged by motion artifacts, illumination changes, and\ninter-subject physiological variability, making robust feature extraction and\nclassification crucial. This study proposes a lightweight and cost-effective\nbiometric authentication framework based on PPG signals extracted from\nlow-frame-rate fingertip videos. The CFIHSR dataset, comprising PPG recordings\nfrom 46 subjects at a sampling rate of 14 Hz, is employed for evaluation. The\nraw PPG signals undergo a standard preprocessing pipeline involving baseline\ndrift removal, motion artifact suppression using Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA), bandpass filtering, Fourier-based resampling, and amplitude\nnormalization. To generate robust representations, each one-dimensional PPG\nsegment is converted into a two-dimensional time-frequency scalogram via the\nContinuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), effectively capturing transient\ncardiovascular dynamics.

To address these limitations, we propose Bratrix, the first\nend-to-end framework to achieve multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain\nalignment. Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual and\nlinguistic semantic components, and projects both visual and brain\nrepresentations into a shared latent space, enabling the formation of aligned\nvisual-language and brain-language embeddings. To emulate human-like perceptual\nreliability and handle noisy neural signals, Bratrix incorporates a novel\nuncertainty perception module that applies uncertainty-aware weighting during\nalignment.

However, humans and robots differ\nfundamentally in embodiment, resulting in mismatched action execution. Direct\nkinematic retargeting of human hand motion can therefore produce actions that\nare physically infeasible for robots. Despite these low-level differences,\nhuman demonstrations provide valuable motion cues about how to manipulate and\ninteract with objects. Our key idea is to exploit the forward diffusion\nprocess: as noise is added to actions, low-level execution differences fade\nwhile high-level task guidance is preserved. We present X-Diffusion, a\nprincipled framework for training diffusion policies that maximally leverages\nhuman data without learning dynamically infeasible motions. X-Diffusion first\ntrains a classifier to predict whether a noisy action is executed by a human or\nrobot. Then, a human action is incorporated into policy training only after\nadding sufficient noise such that the classifier cannot discern its embodiment.\nActions consistent with robot execution supervise fine-grained denoising at low\nnoise levels, while mismatched human actions provide only coarse guidance at\nhigher noise levels. Our experiments show that naive co-training under\nexecution mismatches degrades policy performance, while X-Diffusion\nconsistently improves it.

We evaluate our approach in both simulation and on the\nUnitree G1 humanoid across tasks requiring different levels of compliance,\nincluding gentle hugging, sit-to-stand assistance, and safe object\nmanipulation.

We demonstrate that the noise estimate and the additional guidance\nterm exhibit markedly different sensitivity to numerical error by reformulating\nthe classifier-free guidance (CFG) ODE as a multirate system of ODEs. Our\nerror-bound analysis shows that the additional guidance branch is more robust\nto approximation, revealing substantial redundancy that conventional solvers\nfail to exploit. Building on this insight, THG significantly reduces the\ncomputation of the additional guidance: the noise estimate is integrated with\nthe tortoise equation on the original, fine-grained timestep grid, while the\nadditional guidance is integrated with the hare equation only on a coarse grid.\nWe also introduce (i) an error-bound-aware timestep sampler that adaptively\nselects step sizes and (ii) a guidance-scale scheduler that stabilizes large\nextrapolation spans. THG reduces the number of function evaluations (NFE) by up\nto 30% with virtually no loss in generation fidelity ($\\Delta$ImageReward\n$\\leq$ 0.032) and outperforms state-of-the-art CFG-based training-free\naccelerators under identical computation budgets. Our findings highlight the\npotential of multirate formulations for diffusion solvers, paving the way for\nreal-time high-quality image synthesis without any model retraining.

This paper\nintroduces and evaluates PAVe (Personalized Agentic Vehicular Routing), a\nhybrid agentic assistant designed to augment classical pathfinding algorithms\nwith contextual reasoning. Our approach employs a Large Language Model (LLM)\nagent that operates on a candidate set of routes generated by a multi-objective\n(time, CO2) Dijkstra algorithm.

However, the complicated maritime environment often\ncauses camera motion and subsequent visual degradation, posing significant\nchallenges to MOT. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient\nDual-branch Maritime SORT (DMSORT) method for maritime MOT. The core of the\nframework is a parallel tracker with affine compensation, which incorporates an\nobject detection and re-identification (ReID) branch, along with a dedicated\nbranch for dynamic camera motion estimation. Specifically, a Reversible\nColumnar Detection Network (RCDN) is integrated into the detection module to\nleverage multi-level visual features for robust object detection. Furthermore,\na lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE) is designed to\ncapture global contextual information and generate robust appearance features.\nAnother branch decouples platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion by\nconstructing a projective transformation, applying platform-motion compensation\nwithin the Kalman filter, and thereby stabilizing true object trajectories.\nFinally, a clustering-optimized feature fusion module effectively combines\nmotion and appearance cues to ensure identity consistency under noise,\nocclusion, and drift. Extensive evaluations on the Singapore Maritime Dataset\ndemonstrate that DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Yet\nhow closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making remains poorly understood.\nThis gap is critical: misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical\napplications, while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs\nineffective for social simulations. Here, we address this gap by developing a\ndigital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic\nprompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing\nthree open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama\nreproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human\ndeviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash\nequilibrium predictions.

Particularly, using a\nVLM, we infer UI actions, segment videos into short subsequences of actions,\nand assign each subsequence a textual objective. At inference time, a two-stage\nselection mechanism dynamically chooses a single trajectory to add in context\nat each step, focusing the agent on the most helpful local guidance for its\nnext decision. Experiments on two widely used benchmarks show that our\nframework consistently outperforms strong base agents and variants that use\nonly textual tutorials or transcripts.

We utilized a SWMM model to generate a training dataset of peak flowrate\nprofiles across the stormwater network. Furthermore, we applied DSS -\nleveraging singular value decomposition for dimensionality reduction and QR\nfactorization for sensor allocation - to identify the optimal monitoring nodes\nbased on the simulated training dataset. We then validated the\nrepresentativeness of these identified monitoring nodes by comparing the\nDSS-reconstructed peak flowrate profiles with those obtained from SWMM. Three\noptimally placed sensors among 77 nodes achieved satisfactory reconstruction\nperformance with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.92-0.95 (25th to\n75th percentiles). In addition, the model showed good robustness to uncertainty\nin measurements. Its robustness to sensor failures is location-dependent and\nimproves with the number of sensors deployed.

In digital\npathology, registration enables direct comparison and integration of\ninformation from different stains or imaging modalities, sup-porting\napplications such as biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction. Accurate\nregistration of images from different modalities is an essential step in\ndigital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color\ntransformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and\neosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset\nof 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing\nsteps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard,\nVahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and\ndenoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method,\nwhich first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration\nin two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance\nwas evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported\nthe median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values\n(AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based\nevaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done\nseparately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal\nimages. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest\nregistration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors.

Recent studies suggest that\ndiffusion pipelines unintentionally imprint persistent statistical traces,\nknown as signal leaks, within their outputs, particularly in latent\nrepresentations. Building on this observation, we propose Proto-LeakNet, a\nsignal-leak-aware and interpretable attribution framework that integrates\nclosed-set classification with a density-based open-set evaluation on the\nlearned embeddings, enabling analysis of unseen generators without retraining.\nOperating in the latent domain of diffusion models, our method re-simulates\npartial forward diffusion to expose residual generator-specific cues. A\ntemporal attention encoder aggregates multi-step latent features, while a\nfeature-weighted prototype head structures the embedding space and enables\ntransparent attribution.

The primary issue\nlies in their limited textual semantics understanding. Moreover, these text\nencoders cannot rephrase prompts online to better align with user intentions,\nwhich limits both the scalability and usability of the models, To address these\nchallenges, we introduce RISE-T2V, which uniquely integrates the processes of\nprompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction into a single and seamless\nstep instead of two separate steps. RISE-T2V is universal and can be applied to\nvarious pre-trained LLMs and video diffusion models(VDMs), significantly\nenhancing their capabilities for T2V tasks. We propose an innovative module\ncalled the Rephrasing Adapter, enabling diffusion models to utilize text hidden\nstates during the next token prediction of the LLM as a condition for video\ngeneration. By employing a Rephrasing Adapter, the video generation model can\nimplicitly rephrase basic prompts into more comprehensive representations that\nbetter match the user's intent. Furthermore, we leverage the powerful\ncapabilities of LLMs to enable video generation models to accomplish a broader\nrange of T2V tasks.

On the other hand, LiDAR sharply drops in performance\nonly under heavy occlusion, with mAP falling by 47.3% (from 64.7% to 34.1%),\nwith a severe impact on long-range detection. In fused settings, the effect\ndepends on which sensor is occluded: occluding the camera leads to a minor 4.1%\ndrop (from 68.5% to 65.7%), while occluding LiDAR results in a larger 26.8%\ndrop (to 50.1%), revealing the model's stronger reliance on LiDAR for the task\nof 3D object detection. Our results highlight the need for future research into\nocclusion-aware evaluation methods and improved sensor fusion techniques that\ncan maintain detection accuracy in the presence of partial sensor failure or\ndegradation due to adverse environmental conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76BEVFusion\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u76f8\u673a\u548cLiDAR\u906e\u6321\u5bf93D\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LiDAR\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u906e\u6321\u611f\u77e5\u878d\u5408\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u906e\u6321\uff08\u5982\u96fe\u3001\u973e\u6216\u7269\u7406\u969c\u788d\uff09\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8eBEV\u7684\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u54083D\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528BEVFusion\u67b6\u6784\u5728nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u76f8\u673a\u548cLiDAR\u906e\u6321\u5bf93D\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u4e3amAP\u548cNDS\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u673a\u906e\u6321\u5bfc\u81f4mAP\u4e0b\u964d41.3%\uff08\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u76f8\u673a\u65f6\uff09\uff0cLiDAR\u5728\u91cd\u5ea6\u906e\u6321\u4e0bmAP\u4e0b\u964d47.3%\u3002\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\uff0cLiDAR\u906e\u6321\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\uff08mAP\u4e0b\u964d26.8%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u906e\u6321\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u6539\u8fdb\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5931\u6548\u6216\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0d\u4f73\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Evaluation Framework for Talking Head Video Generation", "comment": null, "summary": "Video generation has achieved remarkable progress, with generated videos\nincreasingly resembling real ones. However, the rapid advance in generation has\noutpaced the development of adequate evaluation metrics. Currently, the\nassessment of talking head generation primarily relies on limited metrics,\nevaluating general video quality, lip synchronization, and on conducting user\nstudies. Motivated by this, we propose a new evaluation framework comprising 8\nmetrics related to three dimensions (i) quality, (ii) naturalness, and (iii)\nsynchronization. In selecting the metrics, we place emphasis on efficiency, as\nwell as alignment with human preferences. Based on this considerations, we\nstreamline to analyze fine-grained dynamics of head, mouth, and eyebrows, as\nwell as face quality. Our extensive experiments on 85,000 videos generated by\n17 state-of-the-art models suggest that while many algorithms excel in lip\nsynchronization, they face challenges with generating expressiveness and\nartifact-free details.

The\nParkland Grading Scale (PGS) provides a clinically validated framework for\nstratifying inflammation severity; however, its automation in surgical videos\nremains largely unexplored, particularly in realistic scenarios where complete\nvideos must be analyzed without prior manual curation. Methods: In this work,\nwe introduce STC-Net, a novel framework for SingleTimestamp-based Complexity\nestimation in LC via the PGS, designed to operate under weak temporal\nsupervision. Unlike prior methods limited to static images or manually trimmed\nclips, STC-Net operates directly on full videos. It jointly performs temporal\nlocalization and grading through a localization, window proposal, and grading\nmodule. We introduce a novel loss formulation combining hard and soft\nlocalization objectives and background-aware grading supervision. Results:\nEvaluated on a private dataset of 1,859 LC videos, STC-Net achieves an accuracy\nof 62.11% and an F1-score of 61.42%, outperforming non-localized baselines by\nover 10% in both metrics and highlighting the effectiveness of weak supervision\nfor surgical complexity assessment.

On vision-centric tasks,\nSora-2 is generally comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, and even\nsurpasses VLMs on several tasks, such as Eyeballing Games. On text-centric\ntasks, Sora-2 achieves 92% accuracy on MATH, and 75.53% accuracy on MMMU.\nFurthermore, we systematically analyse the source of these abilities.

We present UniSplat, a\ngeneral feed-forward framework that learns robust dynamic scene reconstruction\nthrough unified latent spatio-temporal fusion. UniSplat constructs a 3D latent\nscaffold, a structured representation that captures geometric and semantic\nscene context by leveraging pretrained foundation models. To effectively\nintegrate information across spatial views and temporal frames, we introduce an\nefficient fusion mechanism that operates directly within the 3D scaffold,\nenabling consistent spatio-temporal alignment. To ensure complete and detailed\nreconstructions, we design a dual-branch decoder that generates dynamic-aware\nGaussians from the fused scaffold by combining point-anchored refinement with\nvoxel-based generation, and maintain a persistent memory of static Gaussians to\nenable streaming scene completion beyond current camera coverage.

Current benchmarks largely test only the early stages, offering\nnarrow coverage of spatial cognition and rarely challenging models in ways that\nrequire true world modeling. To drive progress in spatial supersensing, we\npresent VSI-SUPER, a two-part benchmark: VSR (long-horizon visual spatial\nrecall) and VSC (continual visual spatial counting). These tasks require\narbitrarily long video inputs yet are resistant to brute-force context\nexpansion.

Sun", "Bharath Hariharan"], "title": "Tracking and Understanding Object Transformations", "comment": "NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "Real-world objects frequently undergo state transformations. From an apple\nbeing cut into pieces to a butterfly emerging from its cocoon, tracking through\nthese changes is important for understanding real-world objects and dynamics.\nHowever, existing methods often lose track of the target object after\ntransformation, due to significant changes in object appearance. To address\nthis limitation, we introduce the task of Track Any State: tracking objects\nthrough transformations while detecting and describing state changes,\naccompanied by a new benchmark dataset, VOST-TAS. To tackle this problem, we\npresent TubeletGraph, a zero-shot system that recovers missing objects after\ntransformation and maps out how object states are evolving over time.\nTubeletGraph first identifies potentially overlooked tracks, and determines\nwhether they should be integrated based on semantic and proximity priors.
