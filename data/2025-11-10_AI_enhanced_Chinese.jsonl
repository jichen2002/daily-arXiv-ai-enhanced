Many recent works have attempted to improve these original\nalgorithms using the algebraic tools of fast matrix multiplication. We improve\non these results for the following problems.\n  For $+2$-approximate APSP, the state-of-the-art algorithm runs in\n$O(n^{2.259})$ time [D\\\"urr, IPL 2023; Deng, Kirkpatrick, Rong, Vassilevska\nWilliams, and Zhong, ICALP 2022].

Most existing methods rely on a single model to perform\nfeature fusion and similarity matching. However, this paradigm faces two major\nchallenges. First, one model alone can't see the whole picture and the tiny\ndetails at the same time; it has to handle different tasks with the same\nweights, so it often misses the small but important links between image and\ntext. Second, the absence of dynamic weight allocation prevents adaptive\nleveraging of complementary model strengths, so the resulting embedding drifts\naway from the target and misleads the nearest-neighbor search in CIR. To\naddress these limitations, we propose Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (DAFM) for\nmulti-model collaboration in CIR. Rather than optimizing a single method in\nisolation, DAFM exploits the complementary strengths of heterogeneous models\nand adaptively rebalances their contributions. This not only maximizes\nretrieval accuracy but also ensures that the performance gains are independent\nof the fusion order, highlighting the robustness of our approach.

Karp, Upfal, and Wigderson (FOCS 1985, JCSS\n1988) initiated the study of this problem and established two algorithms for\nfinding a spanning forest: one running in $O(\\log m)$ rounds with\n$m^{\\Theta(\\log m)}$ queries, and another, for any $d \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$,\nrunning in $O(m^{2/d})$ rounds with $\\Theta(m^d)$ queries. A key open question\nthey posed was whether one could simultaneously achieve polylogarithmic rounds\nand polynomially many queries.

In addition, a reader study\ninvolving three imaging scientists confirmed that images identified by the\nmethod as containing network-induced shape artifacts were also flagged by human\nreaders with mean agreement rates of 66% (CSAW-syn) and 68% (VMLO-syn) for the\nmost anomalous partition, approximately 1.5-2 times higher than the least\nanomalous partition. Kendall-Tau correlations between algorithmic and human\nrankings were 0.45 and 0.43 for the two datasets, indicating reasonable\nagreement despite the challenging nature of subtle artifact detection. This\nmethod is a step forward in the responsible use of synthetic data, as it allows\ndevelopers to evaluate synthetic images for known anatomic constraints and\npinpoint and address specific issues to improve the overall quality of a\nsynthetic dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5f62\u72b6\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u65b0\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u5256\u8fb9\u754c\u89d2\u5ea6\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u6bcf\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5e03\u6784\u5efa\u4e13\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u9694\u79bb\u68ee\u6797\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728CSAW-M\u548cVinDr-Mammo\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cAUC\u503c\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.97\u548c0.91\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bfb\u8005\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u662f\u5426\u7b26\u5408\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

However,\nthis interconnected chain of dependencies also creates challenges: bugs in one\nlibrary can propagate downstream, potentially impacting many other libraries\nthat rely on it. We hypothesize that maintainers may not always decide to fix a\nbug, especially if the maintainer decides it falls out of their responsibility\nwithin the chain of dependencies. Aims: To confirm this hypothesis, we\ninvestigate the responsiveness of 30,340 bug reports across 500 of the most\ndepended-upon npm packages. Method: We adopt a mixed-method approach to mine\nrepository issue data and perform qualitative open coding to analyze reasons\nbehind unaddressed bug reports. Results: Our findings show that maintainers are\ngenerally responsive, with a median project-level responsiveness of 70% (IQR:\n55%-89%), reflecting their commitment to support downstream developers.\nConclusions: We present a taxonomy of the reasons some bugs remain unresolved.\nThe taxonomy includes contribution practices, dependency constraints, and\nlibrary-specific standards as reasons for not being responsive.

To avoid the\nprohibitive cost of back-propagating through the sampling process, ControlNet++\noptimizes only low-noise timesteps (e.g., $t < 200$) using a single-step\napproximation, which not only ignores the contribution of high-noise timesteps\nbut also introduces additional approximation errors. A straightforward\nalternative for optimizing controllability across all timesteps is Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO), a fine-tuning method that increases model\npreference for more controllable images ($I^{w}$) over less controllable ones\n($I^{l}$). However, due to uncertainty in generative models, it is difficult to\nensure that win--lose image pairs differ only in controllability while keeping\nother factors, such as image quality, fixed. To address this, we propose\nperforming preference learning over control conditions rather than generated\nimages. Specifically, we construct winning and losing control signals,\n$\\mathbf{c}^{w}$ and $\\mathbf{c}^{l}$, and train the model to prefer\n$\\mathbf{c}^{w}$. This method, which we term \\textit{Condition Preference\nOptimization} (CPO), eliminates confounding factors and yields a low-variance\ntraining objective.

We study the framework of \\emph{language\ngeneration in the limit}, where an adversary enumerates strings from an unknown\nlanguage $K$ drawn from a countable class, and an algorithm must generate\nunseen strings from $K$. Prior work showed that generation is always possible,\nand that some algorithms achieve positive lower density, revealing a\n\\emph{validity--breadth} trade-off between correctness and coverage. We resolve\na main open question in this line, proving a tight bound of $1/2$ on the best\nachievable lower density. We then strengthen the model to allow \\emph{partial\nenumeration}, where the adversary reveals only an infinite subset $C \\subseteq\nK$. We show that generation in the limit remains achievable, and if $C$ has\nlower density $\\alpha$ in $K$, the algorithm's output achieves density at least\n$\\alpha/2$, matching the upper bound.

Each representation is separately trained on different loss functions\nduring canonical pre-training. Then, during dynamic training, different\nparameters are modeled for each deformation field following common filmmaking\npractices.

For example, they may want to\ndetermine how the condition of an if-statement, a specific line in a\nconfiguration file, or the definition of a function changes. We call this the\ncode mapping problem. Existing techniques, such as git diff, address this\nproblem only insufficiently because they show all changes made to a file\ninstead of focusing on a code region of the developer's choice. Other\ntechniques focus on specific code elements and programming languages (e.g.,\nmethods in Java), limiting their applicability. This paper introduces\nCodeMapper, an approach to address the code mapping problem in a way that is\nindependent of specific program elements and programming languages. Given a\ncode region in one commit, CodeMapper finds the corresponding region in another\ncommit. The approach consists of two phases: (i) computing candidate regions by\nanalyzing diffs, detecting code movements, and searching for specific code\nfragments, and (ii) selecting the most likely target region by calculating\nsimilarities. Our evaluation applies CodeMapper to four datasets, including two\nnew hand-annotated datasets containing code region pairs in ten popular\nprogramming languages.

However, their reliance on uniform sampling often leads\nto poor efficiency and slow planning in complex environments. We introduce a\nnovel non-uniform sampling strategy that integrates into existing SBMPs by\nbiasing sampling toward `certified' regions. These regions are constructed by\n(i) generating an initial, possibly infeasible, path using any heuristic path\npredictor (e.g., A* or vision-language models) and (ii) applying conformal\nprediction to quantify the predictor's uncertainty.

In the cleaning system comparisons, the wiper-based system was\nmore efficient than the rail-based system in terms of cost, cleaning speed, and\ntotal power consumption.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6e05\u6d01\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u6750\u6599\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u677f\u56e0\u8986\u76d6\u7269\u5f71\u54cd\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u522e\u7247\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u805a\u78b3\u9178\u916f\u5206\u5c42\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u677f\u5728\u592a\u7a7a\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u91ce\u706b\u76d1\u6d4b\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8fd0\u884c\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u7070\u5c18\u6216\u592a\u7a7a\u788e\u7247\u8986\u76d6\u800c\u53d7\u9650\u751a\u81f3\u7ec8\u6b62\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6e05\u6d01\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u522e\u7247\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e24\u79cd\u6e05\u6d01\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u78b0\u649e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u805a\u78b3\u9178\u916f\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u4fdd\u62a4\u6750\u6599\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u522e\u7247\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6e05\u6d01\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u8f68\u9053\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b\u805a\u78b3\u9178\u916f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fdd\u62a4\u6750\u6599\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u8f6f\u786c\u6750\u6599\u5206\u5c42\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u9762\u677f\u6e05\u6d01\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u6750\u6599\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u677f\u56e0\u7070\u5c18\u6216\u592a\u7a7a\u788e\u7247\u8986\u76d6\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u522e\u7247\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6210\u672c\u3001\u6e05\u6d01\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u603b\u529f\u8017\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u8f68\u9053\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u800c\u805a\u78b3\u9178\u916f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fdd\u62a4\u6750\u6599\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8f6f\u786c\u6750\u6599\u5206\u5c42\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002"}}

In\nthis study, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these challenges\nusing Cellpose as a case study. First, to assess data redundancy, we propose a\nsimple dataset quantization (DQ) strategy for constructing compact yet diverse\ntraining subsets. Experiments on the Cyto dataset show that image segmentation\nperformance saturates with only 10% of the data, revealing substantial\nredundancy and potential for training with minimal annotations. Latent space\nanalysis using MAE embeddings and t-SNE confirms that DQ selected patches\ncapture greater feature diversity than random sampling. Second, to examine\ncatastrophic forgetting, we perform cross domain finetuning experiments and\nobserve significant degradation in source domain performance, particularly when\nadapting from generalist to specialist domains. We demonstrate that selective\nDQ based replay reintroducing just 5-10% of the source data effectively\nrestores source performance, while full replay can hinder target adaptation.\nAdditionally, we find that training domain sequencing improves generalization\nand reduces forgetting in multi stage transfer. Our findings highlight the\nimportance of data centric design in biomedical image segmentation and suggest\nthat efficient training requires not only compact subsets but also retention\naware learning strategies and informed domain ordering.

To address these\nchallenges, recent research has increasingly explored knowledge distillation as\na method for compressing a large language model of code (the teacher) into a\nsmaller model (the student) while maintaining performance. However, the degree\nto which a student model deeply mimics the predictive behavior and internal\nrepresentations of its teacher remains largely unexplored, as current\naccuracy-based evaluation provides only a surface-level view of model quality\nand often fails to capture more profound discrepancies in behavioral fidelity\nbetween the teacher and student models. To address this gap, we empirically\nshow that the student model often fails to deeply mimic the teacher model,\nresulting in up to 285% greater performance drop under adversarial attacks,\nwhich is not captured by traditional accuracy-based evaluation. Therefore, we\npropose MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework that systematically\nevaluates behavioral fidelity by comparing the outputs of teacher and student\nmodels under a set of behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. We evaluate\nMetaCompress on two widely studied tasks, using compressed versions of popular\nlanguage models of code, obtained via three different knowledge distillation\ntechniques: Compressor, AVATAR, and MORPH. The results show that MetaCompress\nidentifies up to 62% behavioral discrepancies in student models, underscoring\nthe need for behavioral fidelity evaluation within the knowledge distillation\npipeline and establishing MetaCompress as a practical framework for testing\ncompressed language models of code derived through knowledge distillation.", "AI": {"tldr": "MetaCompress\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d8\u5f62\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u538b\u7f29\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8868\u9762\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u6559\u5e08\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MetaCompress\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u5f62\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u6559\u5e08\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e00\u7ec4\u884c\u4e3a\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u884c\u4e3a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "MetaCompress\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9ad8\u8fbe62%\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "MetaCompress\u88ab\u63d0\u51fa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u884c\u4e3a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose the\nMixture of Experts-Enhanced Diffusion Policy (MoE-DP), where the core idea is\nto insert a Mixture of Experts (MoE) layer between the visual encoder and the\ndiffusion model. This layer decomposes the policy's knowledge into a set of\nspecialized experts, which are dynamically activated to handle different phases\nof a task. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that MoE-DP exhibits a\nstrong capability to recover from disturbances, significantly outperforming\nstandard baselines in robustness. On a suite of 6 long-horizon simulation\ntasks, this leads to a 36% average relative improvement in success rate under\ndisturbed conditions.

These systems consist of a\nhub node/subsystem connecting with multiple remote nodes/subsystems via a\nnetworked architecture. One challenge for this system is stability, which can\nbe affected by non-ideal network artifacts. Conventional passivity-based\napproaches can stabilize the system under specialized applications like\nsmall-scale networked systems. However, those conventional passive stabilizers\nhave several restrictions, such as distributing compensation across subsystems\nin a decentralized manner, limiting flexibility, and, at the same time, relying\non the restrictive assumptions of node passivity. This paper synthesizes a\ncentralized optimal passivity-based stabilization framework for CMND systems.\nIt consists of a centralized passivity observer monitoring overall energy flow\nand an optimal passivity controller that distributes the just-needed\ndissipation among various nodes, guaranteeing strict passivity and, thus, L2\nstability. The proposed data-driven model-free approach, i.e., Tunable\nCentralized Optimal Passivity Control (TCoPC), optimizes total performance\nbased on the prescribed dissipation distribution strategy while ensuring\nstability. The controller can put high dissipation loads on some sub-networks\nwhile relaxing the dissipation on other nodes.

With a reported 27%\nmisdiagnosis rate among specialist otolaryngologists, improving diagnostic\naccuracy is crucial. The research utilised a real-world dataset from the\nDepartment of Otolaryngology at the Clinical Hospital of the Universidad de\nChile, comprising otoscopic videos of ear examinations depicting various middle\nand external ear conditions. Frames were selected based on the Laplacian and\nShannon entropy thresholds, with blank frames removed. Initially, Swin v1 and\nSwin v2 transformer models achieved accuracies of 100% and 99.1%, respectively,\nmarginally outperforming the ResNet model (99.5%). These results surpassed\nmetrics reported in related studies. However, the evaluation uncovered a\ncritical data leakage issue in the preprocessing step, affecting both this\nstudy and related research using the same raw dataset. After mitigating the\ndata leakage, model performance decreased significantly. Corrected accuracies\nwere 83% for both Swin v1 and Swin v2, and 82% for the ResNet model. This\nfinding highlights the importance of rigorous data handling in machine learning\nstudies, especially in medical applications. The findings indicate that while\nvision transformers show promise, it is essential to find an optimal balance\nbetween the benefits of advanced model architectures and those derived from\neffective data preprocessing.

However, previous works often ignore this\ncharacteristic of the task and rely on a single policy to directly learn the\nwhole process of object manipulation. To address this problem, we propose a\nnovel Dual-Actor Policy, termed DAP, which explicitly considers different\nstages and leverages heterogeneous visual priors to enhance each stage.\nSpecifically, we introduce an affordance-based actor to locate the functional\npart in the manipulation task, thereby improving the approaching process.\nFollowing this, we propose a motion flow-based actor to capture the movement of\nthe component, facilitating the manipulation process. Finally, we introduce a\ndecision maker to determine the current stage of DAP and select the\ncorresponding actor. Moreover, existing object manipulation datasets contain\nfew objects and lack the visual priors needed to support training. To address\nthis, we construct a simulated dataset, the Dual-Prior Object Manipulation\nDataset, which combines the two visual priors and includes seven tasks,\nincluding two challenging long-term, multi-stage tasks.

Proactive deepfake detection using watermarks\nhas emerged to address the challenge of identifying high-quality synthetic\nmedia.

However,\nscaling 3DGS to large (or intricate) scenes is challenging due to its large\nmemory requirement, which exceed most GPU's memory capacity. In this paper, we\ndescribe CLM, a system that allows 3DGS to render large scenes using a single\nconsumer-grade GPU, e.g., RTX4090.

To reduce\nperformance and communication overheads, CLM uses a novel offloading strategy\nthat exploits observations about 3DGS's memory access pattern for pipelining,\nand thus overlap GPU-to-CPU communication, GPU computation and CPU computation.\nFurthermore, we also exploit observation about the access pattern to reduce\ncommunication volume.

These capabilities are mostly driven by large-scale pre-trained\nfoundation models (FMs). However, the approaches with which these models are\ngrounded for human-robot interaction (HRI) perpetuate a master-apprentice\nmodel, where the apprentice (embodied agent) passively receives and executes\nthe master's (human's) commands without reciprocal learning. This reactive\ninteraction approach does not capture the co-adaptive dynamics inherent in\neveryday multi-turn human-human interactions. To address this, we propose a\nSymbiotic Interactive Learning (SIL) approach that enables both the master and\nthe apprentice to co-adapt through mutual, bidirectional interactions. We\nformalised SIL as a co-adaptation process within a shared latent task space,\nwhere the agent and human maintain joint belief states that evolve based on\ninteraction history. This enables the agent to move beyond reactive execution\nto proactive clarification, adaptive suggestions, and shared plan refinement.\nTo realise these novel behaviours, we leveraged pre-trained FMs for spatial\nperception and reasoning, alongside a lightweight latent encoder that grounds\nthe models' outputs into task-specific representations. Furthermore, to ensure\nstability as the tasks evolve, we augment SIL with a memory architecture that\nprevents the forgetting of learned task-space representations. We validate SIL\non both simulated and real-world embodied tasks, including instruction\nfollowing, information retrieval, query-oriented reasoning, and interactive\ndialogues.

To address this challenge, we propose a method of dynamic residual\nencoding with slide-level contrastive learning (DRE-SLCL) for end-to-end WSI\nrepresentation. Our approach utilizes a memory bank to store the features of\ntiles across all WSIs in the dataset. During training, a mini-batch usually\ncontains multiple WSIs. For each WSI in the batch, a subset of tiles is\nrandomly sampled and their features are computed using a tile encoder.

No Problem: Pose-Agnostic and Instance-Aware Test-Time Adaptation for Monocular Depth Estimation", "comment": null, "summary": "Monocular depth estimation (MDE), inferring pixel-level depths in single RGB\nimages from a monocular camera, plays a crucial and pivotal role in a variety\nof AI applications demanding a three-dimensional (3D) topographical scene. In\nthe real-world scenarios, MDE models often need to be deployed in environments\nwith different conditions from those for training. Test-time (domain)\nadaptation (TTA) is one of the compelling and practical approaches to address\nthe issue. Although there have been notable advancements in TTA for MDE,\nparticularly in a self-supervised manner, existing methods are still\nineffective and problematic when applied to diverse and dynamic environments.\nTo break through this challenge, we propose a novel and high-performing TTA\nframework for MDE, named PITTA. Our approach incorporates two key innovative\nstrategies: (i) pose-agnostic TTA paradigm for MDE and (ii) instance-aware\nimage masking. Specifically, PITTA enables highly effective TTA on a pretrained\nMDE network in a pose-agnostic manner without resorting to any camera pose\ninformation. Besides, our instance-aware masking strategy extracts\ninstance-wise masks for dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, etc.)\nfrom a segmentation mask produced by a pretrained panoptic segmentation\nnetwork, by removing static objects including background components. To further\nboost performance, we also present a simple yet effective edge extraction\nmethodology for the input image (i.e., a single monocular image) and depth map.\nExtensive experimental evaluations on DrivingStereo and Waymo datasets with\nvarying environmental conditions demonstrate that our proposed framework,\nPITTA, surpasses the existing state-of-the-art techniques with remarkable\nperformance improvements in MDE during TTA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPITTA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u59ff\u6001\u65e0\u5173TTA\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u611f\u77e5\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709TTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\uff1a(i) \u59ff\u6001\u65e0\u5173\u7684TTA\u8303\u5f0f\uff1b(ii) \u5b9e\u4f8b\u611f\u77e5\u56fe\u50cf\u63a9\u7801\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8fb9\u7f18\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728DrivingStereo\u548cWaymo\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPITTA\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "PITTA\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08MDE\uff09\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u57df\u9002\u5e94\uff08TTA\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

In contrast, conventional quadrotor designs rely\non rigid frames that support agile flight but inherently limit collision\nresilience and squeezability, thereby constraining flight capabilities in\ncluttered environments. Inspired by the anisotropic stiffness and distributed\nmass-energy structures observed in biological organisms, we introduce\nFlexiQuad, a soft-frame quadrotor design approach that limits this trade-off.\nWe demonstrate a 405-gram FlexiQuad prototype, three orders of magnitude more\ncompliant than conventional quadrotors, yet capable of acrobatic manoeuvres\nwith peak speeds above 80 km/h and linear and angular accelerations exceeding 3\ng and 300 rad/s$^2$, respectively. Analysis demonstrates it can replicate\naccelerations of rigid counterparts up to a thrust-to-weight ratio of 8.\nSimultaneously, FlexiQuad exhibits fourfold higher collision resilience,\nsurviving frontal impacts at 5 m/s without damage and reducing destabilising\nforces in glancing collisions by a factor of 39. Its frame can fully compress,\nenabling flight through gaps as narrow as 70% of its nominal width.

We conduct\nextensive experiments on both hand gesture and body action recognition\nbenchmarks to prove the accuracy of our online recognition system which in most\ncases outperforms state-of-the-art performances.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u534a\u6b63\u5b9a\u77e9\u9635\u548cSiamese\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u9aa8\u67b6\u5e8f\u5217\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u624b\u52bf\u548c\u8eab\u4f53\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5206\u6bb5\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u5728\u7ebf\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u8fde\u7eed\u8bc6\u522b\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u7531\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4f7f\u7528\u534a\u6b63\u5b9a\u77e9\u9635\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4f7f\u7528Siamese\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u672a\u5206\u5272\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u80fd\u591f\u9884\u6d4b\u8fd0\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u533a\u95f4\u5185\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u624b\u52bf\u548c\u8eab\u4f53\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

In this work, we first expose that some commonly used metrics\nfor evaluating generated point clouds, particularly those based on Chamfer\nDistance (CD), lack robustness against defects and fail to capture geometric\nfidelity and local shape consistency when used as quality indicators. We\nfurther show that introducing samples alignment prior to distance calculation\nand replacing CD with Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) are simple yet\nessential steps to ensure the consistency and robustness of point cloud\ngenerative model evaluation metrics. While existing metrics primarily focus on\ndirectly comparing 3D Euclidean coordinates, we present a novel metric, named\nSurface Normal Concordance (SNC), which approximates surface similarity by\ncomparing estimated point normals. This new metric, when combined with\ntraditional ones, provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the quality of\ngenerated samples.

This paper presents MPRF, a\nmultimodal pipeline that leverages transformer-based foundation models for both\nvision and LiDAR modalities to achieve robust loop closure in severely\nunstructured environments. Unlike prior work limited to retrieval, MPRF\nintegrates a two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose\nestimation, combining DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for efficient\ncandidate screening and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric\nverification. Experiments on the S3LI dataset and S3LI Vulcano dataset show\nthat MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while\nenhancing pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions. By providing\ninterpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends, MPRF achieves a\nfavorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and reliability,\ndemonstrating the potential of foundation models to unify place recognition and\npose estimation.

However, existing methods heavily rely on labor-intensive\nnucleus-level annotations and struggle to fully exploit large-scale unlabeled\ndata for learning discriminative nucleus representations. In this work, we\npropose MUSE (MUlti-scale denSE self-distillation), a novel self-supervised\nlearning method tailored for NDC. At its core is NuLo (Nucleus-based Local\nself-distillation), a coordinate-guided mechanism that enables flexible local\nself-distillation based on predicted nucleus positions. By removing the need\nfor strict spatial alignment between augmented views, NuLo allows critical\ncross-scale alignment, thus unlocking the capacity of models for fine-grained\nnucleus-level representation.

Existing works attempt to progressively narrow\nthe search space. However, these approaches typically rely on a hand-crafted\nsearch process, lacking end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search\nstrategies. In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal\nsearch as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching\nvideo clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL).\nHowever, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate\nsearch decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content\nand inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO\nwith Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video\nframes from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy\nmodel to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the\ncompleteness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets\nspecifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV,\nfiltering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task\ndifficulty and improve temporal search capabilities.

However, regardless of supervised or self-supervised\npretraining, the pretraining process on ImageNet does not match the goal of\nanomaly detection (i.e., pretraining in natural images doesn't aim to\ndistinguish between normal and abnormal). Moreover, natural images and\nindustrial image data in AD scenarios typically have the distribution shift.\nThe two issues can cause ImageNet-pretrained features to be suboptimal for AD\ntasks. To further promote the development of the AD field, pretrained\nrepresentations specially for AD tasks are eager and very valuable. To this\nend, we propose a novel AD representation learning framework specially designed\nfor learning robust and discriminative pretrained representations for\nindustrial anomaly detection. Specifically, closely surrounding the goal of\nanomaly detection (i.e., focus on discrepancies between normals and anomalies),\nwe propose angle- and norm-oriented contrastive losses to maximize the angle\nsize and norm difference between normal and abnormal features simultaneously.\nTo avoid the distribution shift from natural images to AD images, our\npretraining is performed on a large-scale AD dataset, RealIAD.

Comprehensive experiments\non Artic4D demonstrate that the proposed CanonSeg4D outperforms state of the\nart approaches in panoptic segmentation accuracy in more complex scenarios.\nThese findings highlight the effectiveness of temporal modeling and canonical\nalignment in dynamic object understanding, and pave the way for future advances\nin 4D articulated object perception.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faCanonSeg4D\u6846\u67b6\u548cArtic4D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u5168\u666f\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u5ffd\u7565\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u800c\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u65f6\u5e8f\u7279\u6027\u30024D\u65f6\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u5728\u5168\u666f\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CanonSeg4D\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4f30\u8ba1\u6bcf\u5e27\u504f\u79fb\u5c06\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u90e8\u5206\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u90e8\u5206\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5206\u5272\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u89c4\u8303\u8868\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e8f\u5217\u5e27\u4e2d\u7269\u4f53\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728Artic4D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCanonSeg4D\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5168\u666f\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165Artic4D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cCanonSeg4D\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5168\u666f\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u5bf9\u9f50\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

This field has witnessed numerous\nadvancements, but few works have been attempted in the direction of image\nrestoration. Handling large image sizes and the divergent nature of various\ndegradation poses a unique challenge in the restoration domain. However,\nexisting works require heavily engineered architectural modifications for new\ntask adaptation, resulting in significant computational overhead.\nRegularization-based methods are unsuitable for restoration, as different\nrestoration challenges require different kinds of feature processing. In this\ndirection, we propose a simple modification of the convolution layer to adapt\nthe knowledge from previous restoration tasks without touching the main\nbackbone architecture. Therefore, it can be seamlessly applied to any deep\narchitecture without any structural modifications.
