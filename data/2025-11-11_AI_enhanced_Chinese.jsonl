Tools such as Spack automate dependency resolution and environment management, but their effectiveness relies on manually written build recipes. As these ecosystems grow, maintaining existing specifications and creating new ones becomes increasingly labor-intensive. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in code generation, automatically producing correct and maintainable Spack recipes remains a significant challenge. We present a systematic analysis of how LLMs and context-augmentation methods can assist in the generation of Spack recipes. To this end, we introduce SpackIt, an end-to-end framework that combines repository analysis, retrieval of relevant examples, and iterative refinement through diagnostic feedback. We apply SpackIt to a representative subset of 308 open-source HPC packages to assess its effectiveness and limitations.

It finds applications in diverse domains, including computer networks, transportation, and image segmentation. The core idea is to maximise the total flow across the network without violating capacity constraints on edges and ensuring flow conservation at intermediate nodes. The rapid growth of unstructured and semi-structured data has motivated the development of parallel solutions to compute MaxFlow. However, due to the higher computational complexity, computing Maxflow for real-world graphs is time-consuming in practice. In addition, these graphs are dynamic and constantly evolve over time. In this work, we propose two Push-Relabel based algorithms for processing dynamic graphs on GPUs. The key novelty of our algorithms is their ability to efficiently handle both increments and decrements in edge capacities together when they appear in a batch. We illustrate the efficacy of our algorithms with a suite of real-world graphs.

We also provide a mathematical analysis of RMLPs, offering insights into its role in enhancing ViT-based models and advancing our understanding of contrastive learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "RMLP\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347ViT\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Vision Transformers (ViTs)\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u56e0\u4f4e\u4fe1\u606f\u91cfpatch tokens\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684Randomized-MLP (RMLP)\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03DINOv2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u6001\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "RMLP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5fae\u8c03DINOv2\u65f6\uff0c\u65e2\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53c8\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "RMLP\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5fae\u8c03DINOv2\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u9886\u57df\u3002\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63ed\u793a\u4e86RMLP\u5728\u63d0\u5347ViT\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

EviBound is an evidence-bound execution framework that eliminates false claims through dual governance gates requiring machine-checkable evidence.\n  Two complementary gates enforce evidence requirements. The pre-execution Approval Gate validates acceptance criteria schemas before code runs, catching structural violations proactively. The post-execution Verification Gate validates artifacts via MLflow API queries (with recursive path checking) and optionally validates metrics when specified by acceptance criteria. Claims propagate only when backed by a queryable run ID, required artifacts, and FINISHED status. Bounded, confidence-gated retries (typically 1-2 attempts) recover from transient failures without unbounded loops.\n  The framework was evaluated on 8 benchmark tasks spanning infrastructure validation, ML capabilities, and governance stress tests. Baseline A (Prompt-Level Only) yields 100% hallucination (8/8 claimed, 0/8 verified). Baseline B (Verification-Only) reduces hallucination to 25% (2/8 fail verification). EviBound (Dual Gates) achieves 0% hallucination: 7/8 tasks verified and 1 task correctly blocked at the approval gate, all with only approximately 8.3% execution overhead.\n  This package includes execution trajectories, MLflow run IDs for all verified tasks, and a 4-step verification protocol.

To address the issues of unstable pose estimation and scene representation distortion caused by geometric texture inconsistency in large outdoor scenes with weak or repetitive textures, we approach the problem from two aspects: pose estimation and scene representation. For pose estimation, we leverage LiDAR-IMU Odometry to provide prior poses for cameras in large-scale environments. These prior pose constraints are incorporated into COLMAP's triangulation process, with pose optimization performed via bundle adjustment. Ensuring consistency between pixel data association and prior poses helps maintain both robustness and accuracy. For scene representation, we introduce normal vector constraints and effective rank regularization to enforce consistency in the direction and shape of Gaussian primitives. These constraints are jointly optimized with the existing photometric loss to enhance the map quality. We evaluate our approach using both public and self-collected datasets. In terms of pose optimization, our method requires only one-third of the time while maintaining accuracy and robustness across both datasets. In terms of scene representation, the results show that our method significantly outperforms conventional 3DGS pipelines. Notably, on self-collected datasets characterized by weak or repetitive textures, our approach demonstrates enhanced visualization capabilities and achieves superior overall performance.

In the weighted Directed Tree Augmentation Problem (WDTAP), we are given an oriented tree $T = (V,A)$ and a set of directed links $L \\subseteq V \\times V$ with positive costs. The goal is to select a minimum cost set of links which enters each fundamental dicut of $T$ (cuts with one leaving and no entering tree arc). WDTAP captures the problem of covering a cross-free set family with directed links. It can also be used to solve weighted multi $2$-TAP, in which we must cover the edges of an undirected tree at least twice. WDTAP can be approximated to within a factor of $2$ using standard techniques. We provide an improved $(1.75+ \\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for WDTAP in the case where the links have bounded costs, a setting that has received significant attention for WTAP. To obtain this result, we discover a class of instances, called \"willows'', for which the natural set covering LP is an integral formulation. We further introduce the notion of \"visibly $k$-wide'' instances which can be solved exactly using dynamic programming.

Preprint exploring a new cognitive paradigm for autonomous planning", "summary": "We challenge the long-standing assumption that exhaustive scene modeling is required for high-performance end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD). Unlike world-model approaches that rely on computationally intensive future scene generation or vision-language-action (VLA) systems constrained by Markov assumptions, we show that a minimal set of semantically rich tokens is sufficient for effective planning. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark (720 scenarios, over 11,000 samples) using perception-informed BEV representations yield three key findings: (1) even without future prediction, our sparse representation achieves 0.548 m ADE, comparable to or surpassing prior methods reporting around 0.75 m on nuScenes; (2) conditioning trajectory decoding on predicted future tokens reduces ADE to 0.479 m, a 12.6% improvement over current-state baselines; and (3) explicit reconstruction loss offers no benefit and may degrade performance under reliable perception inputs. Notably, we observe the emergence of temporal fuzziness, where the model adaptively attends to task-relevant semantics rather than aligning rigidly to fixed timestamps, providing a cognitive advantage for planning under uncertainty. Our \"token is all you need\" principle marks a paradigm shift from reconstructing the world to understanding it, laying a foundation for cognitively inspired systems that plan through imagination rather than reaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4ec5\u9700\u8bed\u4e49token\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u573a\u666f\u5efa\u6a21\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8bed\u4e49token\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u672a\u6765\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u6216\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u5047\u8bbe\u7684VLA\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u4fe1\u606f\u7684BEV\uff08\u9e1f\u77b0\u56fe\uff09\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728nuPlan\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08720\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc711,000\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u8868\u793a\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765token\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u91cd\u5efa\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff1a(1) \u7a00\u758f\u8868\u793a\u5728\u4e0d\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fbe\u52300.548 m ADE\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b(2) \u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765token\u53ef\u5c06ADE\u964d\u4f4e\u81f30.479 m\uff0c\u63d0\u534712.6%\uff1b(3) \u663e\u5f0f\u91cd\u5efa\u635f\u5931\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u611f\u77e5\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u65e0\u76ca\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u8bed\u4e49\u800c\u975e\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u98a0\u8986\u6027\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u5373\u9ad8\u7aef\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\uff08E2EAD\uff09\u5e76\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u7684\u573a\u666f\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7ec4\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684token\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u89c4\u5212\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u901a\u8fc7\u60f3\u8c61\u800c\u975e\u53cd\u5e94\u8fdb\u884c\u89c4\u5212\u3002"}}

We introduce SMAGDi, a distillation framework that transfers the debate dynamics of a five-agent Llama-based MAS into a compact Socratic decomposer-solver student. SMAGDi represents debate traces as directed interaction graphs, where nodes encode intermediate reasoning steps with correctness labels and edges capture continuity and cross-agent influence. The student is trained with a composite objective combining language modeling, graph-based supervision, contrastive reasoning, and embedding alignment to preserve both fluency and structured reasoning. On StrategyQA and MMLU, SMAGDi compresses a 40B multi-agent system into a 6B student while retaining 88% of its accuracy, substantially outperforming prior distillation methods such as MAGDi, standard KD, and fine-tuned baselines.

This paper introduces a unified forecasting model that projects AI agent populations to increase by more than 100 times between 2026 and 2036+, reaching trillions of instances globally. In parallel, bandwidth demand is expected to surge from 1 EB/day in 2026 to over 8,000 EB/day by 2036, which is an increase of 8000 times in a single decade. Through this growth model, we identify critical bottleneck domains across access networks, edge gateways, interconnection exchanges, and cloud infrastructures. Simulations reveal that edge and peering systems will experience saturation as early as 2030, with more than 70% utilization of projected maximum capacity by 2033. To address these constraints, we propose a coevolutionary shift in compute-network design, emphasizing distributed inference, AI-native traffic engineering, and intent-aware orchestration.

To improve output quality, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an efficient technique that seamlessly integrates local data into LLMs. However, existing edge computing paradigms primarily focus on single-node optimization, neglecting opportunities to holistically exploit distributed data and heterogeneous resources through cross-node collaboration. To bridge this gap, we propose CoEdge-RAG, a hierarchical scheduling framework for retrieval-augmented LLMs in collaborative edge computing. In general, privacy constraints preclude accurate a priori acquisition of heterogeneous data distributions across edge nodes, directly impeding RAG performance optimization. Thus, we first design an online query identification mechanism using proximal policy optimization (PPO), which autonomously infers query semantics and establishes cross-domain knowledge associations in an online manner. Second, we devise a dynamic inter-node scheduling strategy that balances workloads across heterogeneous edge nodes by synergizing historical performance analytics with real-time resource thresholds. Third, we develop an intra-node scheduler based on online convex optimization, adaptively allocating query processing ratios and memory resources to optimize the latency-quality trade-off under fluctuating assigned loads.

(STOC 2000), captures the task of computing a known function on an unknown input when each input variable can only be revealed by paying an associated cost. The goal is to design a query strategy that determines the function's value while minimizing the total cost incurred. However, all prior work in this model assumes complete advance knowledge of the query costs -- an assumption that fails in many realistic settings.\n  We introduce a variant of the priced query model that explicitly handles *unknown* variable costs. We prove a separation from the traditional priced query model, showing that uncertainty in variable costs imposes an unavoidable overhead for every query strategy. Despite this, we design strategies that essentially match our lower bound and are competitive with the best cost-aware strategies for arbitrary Boolean functions.

However, building an intraoperative 3D tumor model for subsequent removal faces major challenges due to the lack of high-fidelity tumor reconstruction, difficulties in developing generalized tissue models to handle the inherent complexities of tumor diagnosis, and the natural physical limitations of bimanual operation, physiologic tremor, and fatigue creep during surgery. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \"TumorMap\", a surgical robotic platform to formulate intraoperative 3D tumor boundaries and achieve autonomous tissue resection using a set of multifunctional lasers. TumorMap integrates a three-laser mechanism (optical coherence tomography, laser-induced endogenous fluorescence, and cutting laser scalpel) combined with deep learning models to achieve fully-automated and noncontact tumor resection. We validated TumorMap in murine osteoscarcoma and soft-tissue sarcoma tumor models, and established a novel histopathological workflow to estimate sensor performance.

Deploying these models requires energy-intensive GPU infrastructure, and in some cases has even prompted plans to power data centers with nuclear energy. Despite this growing relevance, systematic analyses of inference energy consumption remain limited. In this work, we present a large-scale measurement-based study comprising over 32,500 measurements across 21 GPU configurations and 155 model architectures, from small open-source models to frontier systems. Using the vLLM inference engine, we quantify energy usage at the prompt level and identify how architectural and operational factors shape energy demand. Building on these insights, we develop a predictive model that accurately estimates inference energy consumption across unseen architectures and hardware, and implement it as a browser extension to raise awareness of the environmental impact of generative AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u6d4bLLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6269\u5f20\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u63a8\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6b64\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5206\u6790\u4ecd\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528vLLM\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u5bf921\u79cdGPU\u914d\u7f6e\u548c155\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc732,500\u6b21\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u80fd\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u56e0\u7d20\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6d1e\u5bdf\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLM\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u610f\u8bc6\u3002"}}

More specifically, we consider multiple ground base stations (GBSs) and each GBS has three different sectors/cells in the terrestrial networks, and multiple cells are turned off due to NES or incidents, e.g., disasters, hardware failures, or outages. To address this, we propose a Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) framework to enable UAV-assisted communication by jointly optimizing UAV trajectories, transmission power, and user-UAV association under a sleeping ground base station (GBS) strategy. This framework aims to ensure the resilience of active users in the network and the long-term operability of UAVs. Specifically, it maximizes service coverage for users during power outages or NES zones, while minimizing the energy consumption of UAVs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MADDPG policy consistently achieves high coverage ratio across different testing episodes, outperforming other baselines. Moreover, the MADDPG framework attains the lowest total energy consumption, with a reduction of approximately 24\\% compared to the conventional all GBS ON configuration, while maintaining a comparable user service rate. These results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving a superior trade-off between energy efficiency and service performance, supporting the development of sustainable and resilient UAV-assisted cellular networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faMADDPG\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u57286G\u7f51\u7edc\u8282\u80fd\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u670d\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u95f4\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u57286G\u7f51\u7edc\u8282\u80fd\uff08NES\uff09\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u901a\u4fe1\u89e3\u51b3\u56e0\u707e\u5bb3\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u6545\u969c\u6216\u65ad\u7535\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5730\u9762\u57fa\u7ad9\u5173\u95ed\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7f51\u7edc\u97e7\u6027\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u957f\u671f\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6df1\u5ea6\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\uff08MADDPG\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u4f20\u8f93\u529f\u7387\u548c\u7528\u6237-\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5730\u9762\u57fa\u7ad9\u4f11\u7720\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cMADDPG\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5747\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u603b\u80fd\u8017\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5168\u57fa\u7ad9\u5f00\u542f\u914d\u7f6e\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea624%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u53ef\u6bd4\u7684\u7528\u6237\u670d\u52a1\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MADDPG\u6846\u67b6\u57286G\u7f51\u7edc\u8282\u80fd\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u4f20\u8f93\u529f\u7387\u548c\u7528\u6237-\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u80fd\u8017\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

SO's crowdsourced, collaborative nature has created a vast repository of programming knowledge. Its community-curated content is constantly evolving, with new answers posted or existing ones edited.\n  In this paper, we present an empirical study of SO Java answer edits and their application to improving code in open-source projects. We use a modified code clone search tool to analyze SO code snippets with version history and apply it to open-source Java projects. This identifies outdated or unoptimized code and suggests improved alternatives.

If the trees $T_i$ are sub-graphs of $G$, the tree cover is called a spanning tree cover. If these trees are HSTs, it is called an HST cover.\n  In a seminal work, Mendel and Naor [2006] showed that for any parameter $k=1,2,...$, there exists an HST cover, and a non-spanning tree cover, with stretch $O(k)$ and with $O(kn^{\\frac{1}{k}})$ trees. Abraham et al. [2020] devised a spanning version of this result, albeit with stretch $O(k\\log\\log n)$. For graphs of small treewidth $t$, Gupta et al. [2004] devised an exact spanning tree cover with $O(t\\log n)$ trees, and Chang et al. [2-23] devised a $(1+\u03b5)$-approximate non-spanning tree cover with $2^{(t/\u03b5)^{O(t)}}$ trees.\n  We prove a smooth tradeoff between the stretch and the number of trees for graphs with balanced recursive separators of size at most $s(n)$ or treewidth at most $t(n)$. Specifically, for any $k=1,2,...$, we provide tree covers and HST covers with stretch $O(k)$ and $O\\left(\\frac{k^2\\log n}{\\log s(n)}\\cdot s(n)^{\\frac{1}{k}}\\right)$ trees or $O(k\\log n\\cdot t(n)^{\\frac{1}{k}})$ trees, respectively. We also devise spanning tree covers with these parameters and stretch $O(k\\log\\log n)$. In addition devise a spanning tree cover for general graphs with stretch $O(k\\log\\log n)$ and average overlap $O(n^{\\frac{1}{k}})$.\n  We use our tree covers to provide improved path-reporting spanners, emulators (including low-hop emulators, known also as low-hop metric spanners), distance labeling schemes and routing schemes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6811\u8986\u76d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u62c9\u4f38\u548c\u6811\u6570\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6811\u8986\u76d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u62c9\u4f38\u548c\u6811\u6570\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u7684\u56fe\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u6811\u8986\u76d6\u548cHST\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u5e76\u8c03\u6574\u53c2\u6570k\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u62c9\u4f38\u548c\u6811\u6570\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u5206\u9694\u5668\u5927\u5c0f\u6216\u6811\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u56fe\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u62c9\u4f38O(k)\u548c\u6811\u6570\u91cfO(k^2 log n / log s(n) * s(n)^(1/k))\u6216O(k log n * t(n)^(1/k))\u7684\u6811\u8986\u76d6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u5e73\u8861\u9012\u5f52\u5206\u9694\u5668\u6216\u6709\u9650\u6811\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u56fe\u7684\u6811\u8986\u76d6\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u62c9\u4f38\u548c\u6811\u6570\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8def\u5f84\u62a5\u544a\u6269\u5c55\u5668\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7b49\u3002"}}

Here, we present empirical evidence from \\textit{Formica polyctena} ants that reveals a shared statistical mechanism underlying both systems: maximization under different energy function constraints.

However, data collection and model training can be expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we leverage vision-language models' (VLMs') reasoning capabilities to assess the quality of printed parts and introduce in-context learning (ICL) to provide VLMs with necessary application-specific knowledge and demonstration samples. This method eliminates the requirement for large application-specific datasets for training models. We explored different sampling strategies for ICL to search for the optimal configuration that makes use of limited samples. We evaluated these strategies on two VLMs, Gemini-2.5-flash and Gemma3:27b, with quality assessment tasks in wire-laser direct energy deposition processes. The results show that ICL-assisted VLMs can reach quality classification accuracies similar to those of traditional machine learning models while requiring only a minimal number of samples. In addition, unlike traditional classification models that lack transparency, VLMs can generate human-interpretable rationales to enhance trust. Since there are no metrics to evaluate their interpretability in manufacturing applications, we propose two metrics, knowledge relevance and rationale validity, to evaluate the quality of VLMs' supporting rationales.

This paper investigates efficient CoT transfer across models of different scales and architectures through an adaptive reasoning summarization framework. The proposed method compresses reasoning traces via semantic segmentation with importance scoring, budget-aware dynamic compression, and coherence reconstruction, preserving critical reasoning steps while significantly reducing token usage. Experiments on 7{,}501 medical examination questions across 10 specialties show up to 40% higher accuracy than truncation under the same token budgets. Evaluations on 64 model pairs from eight LLMs (1.5B-32B parameters, including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3) confirm strong cross-model transferability. Furthermore, a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian optimization module reduces evaluation cost by 84% and reveals a power-law relationship between model size and cross-domain robustness.

Optimizing transmit beamforming and power splitting in such systems faces formidable challenges, e.g., time-varying channels and multi-tier interference, which create a complex decision landscape where conventional model-free multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) suffers from sample inefficiency due to rarely-encountered state transitions and poor coordination as decentralized agents act independently. This paper proposes the Decentralized World Model with Reasoning Offloading (DWM-RO) framework to address these fundamental limitations. Specifically, each agent employs a world model to learn compact predictive representations of environment dynamics, enabling imagination-based policy training that dramatically reduces required environment interactions. An uncertainty-aware offloading gate monitors local interference levels and model reconstruction errors to trigger selective edge coordination. When activated, a lightweight latent decorrelation mechanism at the edge refines agents' strategic representations, guiding them toward orthogonal actions that minimize resource conflicts. Extensive simulations demonstrate that DWM-RO converges 5 times faster than state-of-the-art baselines while achieving 34.7% higher spectral efficiency and reducing constraint violations by 40%. In dense network scenarios with 10 users, DWM-RO maintains violation rates below 20% while baselines exceed 70%, validating superior robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "DWM-RO\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u534f\u8c03\u4f18\u5316\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MARL\uff09\u5728\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDWM-RO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8868\u793a\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u534f\u8c03\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6f5c\u5728\u89e3\u76f8\u5173\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "DWM-RO\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb5\u500d\uff0c\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u9ad834.7%\uff0c\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u89c4\u51cf\u5c1140%\uff0c\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8fdd\u89c4\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e20%\u3002", "conclusion": "DWM-RO\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8fb9\u7f18\u534f\u8c03\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u7f51\u7edc\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose WAR-Re, an LLM-based model for Web API recommendation with semantic reasoning for justification. WAR-Re leverages special start and stop tokens to handle the first challenge and uses two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance the model's ability in both tasks.

For this problem, two recoloring rules have been widely studied: \\emph{single-vertex recoloring} and \\emph{Kempe chain recoloring}. In this paper, we introduce a new rule, called \\emph{color swapping}, where two adjacent vertices may exchange their colors, so that the resulting coloring remains proper, and study the computational complexity of the problem under this rule.

We further show that the problem remains PSPACE-complete even on restricted graph classes, including bipartite graphs, split graphs, and planar graphs of bounded degree.

Anchoring bias, a classic human judgment bias, offers a critical test case. While prior work shows LLMs exhibit anchoring, most evidence relies on surface-level outputs, leaving internal mechanisms and attributional contributions unexplored. This paper advances the study of anchoring in LLMs through three contributions: (1) a log-probability-based behavioral analysis showing that anchors shift entire output distributions, with controls for training-data contamination; (2) exact Shapley-value attribution over structured prompt fields to quantify anchor influence on model log-probabilities; and (3) a unified Anchoring Bias Sensitivity Score integrating behavioral and attributional evidence across six open-source models. Results reveal robust anchoring effects in Gemma-2B, Phi-2, and Llama-2-7B, with attribution signaling that the anchors influence reweighting. Smaller models such as GPT-2, Falcon-RW-1B, and GPT-Neo-125M show variability, suggesting scale may modulate sensitivity.

This presents multiple optimization opportunities from exploiting parallelism to reducing data movement through prefetching and improved register usage. HPC frameworks often delegate fine-grained data movement optimization to compilers, but their low-level representations hamper analysis of common patterns, such as strided data accesses and loop-carried dependencies. In this paper, we introduce symbolic, inductive loop optimization (SILO), a novel technique that models data accesses and dependencies as functions of loop nest strides. This abstraction enables the automatic parallelization of sequentially-dependent loops, as well as data movement optimizations including software prefetching and pointer incrementation to reduce register spills.

Their compliance and complex, coupled dynamics, however, present modeling and control challenges, hindering path planning and obstacle avoidance. This paper presents a complete, open-source, and reproducible system that enables navigation for a 3-bar tensegrity robot. The system comprises: (i) an inexpensive, open-source hardware design, and (ii) an integrated, open-source software stack for physics-based modeling, system identification, state estimation, path planning, and control. All hardware and software are publicly available at https://sites.google.com/view/tensegrity-navigation/. The proposed system tracks the robot's pose and executes collision-free paths to a specified goal among known obstacle locations. System robustness is demonstrated through experiments involving unmodeled environmental challenges, including a vertical drop, an incline, and granular media, culminating in an outdoor field demonstration.

Despite the integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into MVC, their input graph structures remain susceptible to noise interference. Methods based on Multi-view Graph Refinement (MGRC) also have limitations such as insufficient consideration of cross-view consistency, difficulty in handling hard-to-distinguish samples in the feature space, and disjointed optimization processes caused by graph construction algorithms. To address these issues, a Multi-View Clustering method via a Fusion-Consensus Graph Convolutional Network (MCFCN) is proposed. The network learns the consensus graph of multi-view data in an end-to-end manner and learns effective consensus representations through a view feature fusion model and a Unified Graph Structure Adapter (UGA). It designs Similarity Matrix Alignment Loss (SMAL) and Feature Representation Alignment Loss (FRAL). With the guidance of consensus, it optimizes view-specific graphs, preserves cross-view topological consistency, promotes the construction of intra-class edges, and realizes effective consensus representation learning with the help of GCN to improve clustering performance. MCFCN demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on eight multi-view benchmark datasets, and its effectiveness is verified by extensive qualitative and quantitative implementations.

During the pandemic, software companies were forced to work remotely, and many companies have been using such work arrangements. There are prior studies showing the benefits and drawbacks of remote work in software development during COVID-19. However, there is no study that targets Thailand, one of the growing software markets in Asia, specifically. This paper performs an empirical study of the effects of COVID-19 on software development in Thailand. We surveyed 194 Thai software developers regarding the challenges and benefits they faced while working remotely during the COVID-19 period.

The algorithm was originally introduced by Karp, Vazirani, and Vazirani [STOC 1990] for the online bipartite matching problem with one-sided vertex arrivals, where it achieves a tight approximation ratio of 1 - 1/e. It was later extended to general graphs by Goel and Tripathi [FOCS 2012]. The Ranking algorithm for general graphs is as follows: a permutation $\u03c3$ over the vertices is chosen uniformly at random. The vertices are then processed sequentially according to this order, with each vertex being matched to the first available neighbor (if any) according to the same permutation $\u03c3$.\n  While the algorithm is quite well-understood for bipartite graphs-with the approximation ratio lying between 0.696 and 0.727, its approximation ratio for general graphs remains less well characterized despite extensive efforts. Prior to this work, the best known lower bound for general graphs was 0.526 by Chan et al. [TALG 2018], improving on the approximation ratio of 0.523 by Chan et al. [SICOMP 2018]. The upper bound, however, remains the same as that for bipartite graphs.\n  In this work, we improve the approximation ratio of \\textsc{Ranking} for general graphs to 0.5469, up from 0.526. This also surpasses the best-known approximation ratio of $0.531$ by Tang et al. [JACM 2023] for the oblivious matching problem. Our approach builds on the standard primal-dual analysis. The novelty of our work lies in proving new structural properties of Ranking by introducing the notion of the backup for vertices matched by the algorithm. For a fixed permutation, a vertex's backup is its potential match if its current match is removed. This concept helps characterize the rank distribution of the match of each vertex, enabling us to eliminate certain bad events that constrained previous work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9876\u70b9\u5907\u4efd\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6539\u8fdbRanking\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u81f30.5469\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4ee5\u5f80\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76Ranking\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\u4e0a\u5df2\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4ecd\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u5bf9\u5076\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u9876\u70b9\u5907\u4efd\u7684\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u826f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5c06Ranking\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u4ece0.526\u63d0\u9ad8\u52300.5469\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86Tang\u7b49\u4eba\u63d0\u51fa\u76840.531\u7684\u5df2\u77e5\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9876\u70b9\u5907\u4efd\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86Ranking\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u81f30.5469\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4ee5\u5f80\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

We focus on the problem of synthesizing grasps for multi-finger robot hands that, given a target object's geometry and pose, computes a hand configuration. Existing approaches often struggle to produce reliable grasps that sufficiently constrain object motion, leading to instability under disturbances and failed grasps. A key reason is that during grasp generation, they typically focus on resisting a single wrench, while ignoring the object's potential for adversarial movements, such as escaping. We propose a new grasp-synthesis approach that explicitly captures and leverages the adversarial object motion in grasp generation by formulating the problem as a two-player game. One player controls the robot to generate feasible grasp configurations, while the other adversarially controls the object to seek motions that attempt to escape from the grasp. Simulation experiments on various robot platforms and target objects show that our approach achieves a success rate of 75.78%, up to 19.61% higher than the state-of-the-art baseline. The two-player game mechanism improves the grasping success rate by 27.40% over the method without the game formulation. Our approach requires only 0.28-1.04 seconds on average to generate a grasp configuration, depending on the robot platform, making it suitable for real-world deployment.

Dynamic Learning and Proactive Correction for Hallucination Detection", "comment": null, "summary": "Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) remains a critical barrier to their safe deployment. Existing tool-augmented hallucination detection methods require pre-defined fixed verification strategies, which are crucial to the quality and effectiveness of tool calls. Some methods directly employ powerful closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4 as detectors, which are effective but too costly. To mitigate the cost issue, some methods adopt the teacher-student architecture and finetune open-source small models as detectors via agent tuning. However, these methods are limited by fixed strategies. When faced with a dynamically changing execution environment, they may lack adaptability and inappropriately call tools, ultimately leading to detection failure. To address the problem of insufficient strategy adaptability, we propose the innovative ``Learning to Evaluate and Adaptively Plan''(LEAP) framework, which endows an efficient student model with the dynamic learning and proactive correction capabilities of the teacher model. Specifically, our method formulates the hallucination detection problem as a dynamic strategy learning problem. We first employ a teacher model to generate trajectories within the dynamic learning loop and dynamically adjust the strategy based on execution failures.

Grids have managed the resulting surges by scaling generation capacity, incorporating additional resources such as solar and wind, and implementing demand-response mechanisms. Altogether, these policies influence a region's carbon intensity by affecting its energy mix. To mitigate the environmental impacts of consumption, carbon-aware optimizations often rely on long-horizon, high-accuracy forecasts of the grid's carbon intensity that typically use compute intensive models with extensive historical energy mix data. In addition to limiting scalability, accuracy improvements do not necessarily translate into proportional increases in savings. Highlighting the need for more efficient forecasting strategies, we argue that carbon forecasting solutions can achieve the majority of savings without requiring highly precise and complex predictions. Instead, it is the preservation of the ranking of forecasts relative to the ground-truth that drives realized savings. In this paper, we present LiteCast, a lightweight time series forecasting method capable of quickly modeling a region's energy mix to estimate its carbon intensity. LiteCast requires only a few days of historical energy and weather data, delivering fast forecasts that can quickly adapt to sudden changes in the electrical grid. Our evaluation in 50 worldwide regions under various real-world workloads shows that LiteCast outperforms state-of-the-art forecasters, delivering 20% higher savings with near-optimal performance, achieving 97% of the maximum attainable average savings, while remaining lightweight, efficient to run, and adaptive to new data.", "AI": {"tldr": "LiteCast\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u78b3\u5f3a\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u7535\u7f51\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u5168\u740350\u4e2a\u5730\u533a\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8282\u7701\u6548\u679c\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u7535\u529b\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u589e\u957f\u548cAI\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6269\u5f20\uff0c\u7535\u7f51\u7ba1\u7406\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u7684\u78b3\u5f3a\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9650\u5236\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u5e26\u6765\u76f8\u5e94\u8282\u7701\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LiteCast\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u51e0\u5929\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u80fd\u6e90\u548c\u5929\u6c14\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u5feb\u901f\u5efa\u6a21\u5730\u533a\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f30\u7b97\u5176\u78b3\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u572850\u4e2a\u5168\u7403\u5730\u533a\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\uff0cLiteCast\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b20%\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8282\u7701\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5927\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u5e73\u5747\u8282\u7701\u768497%\u3002", "conclusion": "LiteCast\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5168\u740350\u4e2a\u5730\u533a\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u66f4\u9ad8\u768420%\u8282\u7701\uff0c\u5e76\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5927\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u5e73\u5747\u8282\u7701\u768497%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In terms of data analysis, the system proposed a debugging behavior analysis model based on abstract syntax tree, combined with node annotation, sequence recognition and cluster analysis and other technologies, to automatically track the context of students' debugging process and accurately identify key features in the debugging path. Through this tool, the system realizes the intelligent identification and labeling of the debugging direction and behavior pattern, and improves the refinement level of debugging data analysis. In this research system, a complex debugging scenario of multi-file and multi-task is introduced into the debugging problem design, which optimizes the multi-dimensional capturing ability of debugging data and lays a foundation for accurate debugging behavior analysis.

A switch with $n$ output ports receives a stream of incoming packets. When an incoming packet is accepted by the switch, it is stored in a shared buffer of capacity $B$ common to all packets and awaits its transmission through its corresponding output port determined by its destination. Each output port transmits one packet per time unit. The problem is to find an algorithm for the switch to accept or reject a packet upon its arrival in order to maximize the total number of transmitted packets.\n  Building on the work of Kesselman et al. (STOC 2001) on split buffer sharing, Kesselman and Mansour (TCS 2004) considered the problem of online buffer sharing which models most deployed internet switches. In their work, they presented the Harmonic policy and proved that it is $(2 + \\ln n)$-competitive, which is the best known competitive ratio for this problem. The Harmonic policy unfortunately saw less practical relevance as it performs $n$ threshold checks per packets which is deemed costly in practice, especially on network switches processing multiple terabits of packets per second. While the Harmonic policy is elegant, the original proof is also rather complex and involves a lengthy matching routine along with multiple intermediary results.\n  This note presents a simplified Harmonic policy, both in terms of implementation and proof.

In such robots, the primary role of a hand-eye camera is to accurately estimate 3D positions of graspable points (i.e., convex terrain surfaces) thanks to its close-up views. While conventional climbing robots often employ RGB-D cameras as hand-eye cameras to facilitate straightforward 3D terrain mapping and graspable point detection, RGB-D cameras are large and consume considerable power.\n  This work presents a 3D terrain mapping system designed for space exploration using limbed climbing robots equipped with a monocular hand-eye camera. Compared to RGB-D cameras, monocular cameras are more lightweight, compact structures, and have lower power consumption. Although monocular SLAM can be used to construct 3D maps, it suffers from scale ambiguity. To address this limitation, we propose a SLAM method that fuses monocular visual constraints with limb forward kinematics. The proposed method jointly estimates time-series gripper poses and the global metric scale of the 3D map based on factor graph optimization.\n  We validate the proposed framework through both physics-based simulations and real-world experiments. The results demonstrate that our framework constructs a metrically scaled 3D terrain map in real-time and enables autonomous grasping of convex terrain surfaces using a monocular hand-eye camera, without relying on RGB-D cameras. Our method contributes to scalable and energy-efficient perception for future space missions involving limbed climbing robots.

Traditional rule-based methods lack robustness, while existing deep learning models suffer from poor generalization and low accuracy on complex fillets due to their generic design and inadequate training data. To address these issues, this paper proposes an end-to-end, data-driven framework specifically for fillet features. We first construct and release a large-scale, diverse benchmark dataset for fillet recognition to address the inadequacy of existing data. Based on it, we propose FilletRec, a lightweight graph neural network. The core innovation of this network is its use of pose-invariant intrinsic geometric features, such as curvature, enabling it to learn more fundamental geometric patterns and thereby achieve high-precision recognition of complex geometric topologies. Experiments show that FilletRec surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and generalization, while using only 0.2\\%-5.4\\% of the parameters of baseline models, demonstrating high model efficiency. Finally, the framework completes the automated workflow from recognition to simplification by integrating an effective geometric simplification algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u4e3a\u5706\u89d2\u7279\u5f81\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6FilletRec\uff0c\u5176\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7b80\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b8c\u6210\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7531\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5706\u89d2\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5706\u89d2\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FilletRec\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u59ff\u6001\u4e0d\u53d8\u5185\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u66f2\u7387\uff09\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFilletRec\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u76840.2%-5.4%\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684FilletRec\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86CAD\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5706\u89d2\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u7b80\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, the quality of these reasoning chains remains underexplored. We present a comprehensive empirical study examining the reasoning process and quality of thinking LLMs for code generation. We evaluate six state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI-o3-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking, Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Qwen-QwQ) across 100 code generation tasks of varying difficulty from BigCodeBench. We quantify reasoning-chain structure through step counts and verbosity, conduct controlled step-budget adjustments, and perform a 21-participant human evaluation across three dimensions: efficiency, logical correctness, and completeness. Our step-count interventions reveal that targeted step increases can improve resolution rates for certain models/tasks, while modest reductions often preserve success on standard tasks, rarely on hard ones. Through systematic analysis, we develop a reasoning-problematic taxonomy, identifying completeness as the dominant failure mode. Task complexity significantly impacts reasoning quality; hard problems are substantially more prone to incompleteness than standard tasks.

To meet diverse demands from varying-length requests in online services, existing state-of-the-art systems tune the sequence parallelism (SP) allocation.

Based on CDSP, we build Tetris, an LLM serving system that (1) efficiently integrates CDSP into disaggregated cluster to satisfy parallelism heterogeneity, (2) dynamically regulates SP size expansion based on real-time load conditions, and (3) adaptively explores chunking plans to utilize fragmented resources while meeting per-request demands.

One of the key problems in this task is the lack of labeled logs. Existing works usually leverage large-scale labeled logs from mature systems to train an anomaly detection model of a target system based on the idea of transfer learning. However, these works still require a certain number of labeled logs from the target system. In this paper, we take a step forward and study a valuable yet underexplored setting: zero-label cross-system log-based anomaly detection, that is, no labeled logs are available in the target system. Specifically, we propose ZeroLog, a system-agnostic representation meta-learning method that enables cross-system log-based anomaly detection under zero-label conditions. To achieve this, we leverage unsupervised domain adaptation to perform adversarial training between the source and target domains, aiming to learn system-agnostic general feature representations. By employing meta-learning, the learned representations are further generalized to the target system without any target labels. Experimental results on three public log datasets from different systems show that ZeroLog reaches over 80% F1-score without labels, comparable to state-of-the-art cross-system methods trained with labeled logs, and outperforms existing methods under zero-label conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "ZeroLog\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u5173\u8868\u793a\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u76ee\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u6807\u8bb0\u65e5\u5fd7\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u9700\u6807\u8bb0\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u8bb0\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u96f6\u6807\u7b7e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u8fdb\u884c\u6e90\u57df\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u516c\u5171\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cZeroLog\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u8d85\u8fc780%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4e0e\u9700\u8981\u6807\u8bb0\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u96f6\u6807\u7b7e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ZeroLog\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u76ee\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u6807\u8bb0\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u5173\u8868\u793a\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u9700\u8981\u6807\u8bb0\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u96f6\u6807\u7b7e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Additionally, each vertex $v$ may have a different query cost $c(v)$ and a different weight $w(v)$. The goal is to find the optimal querying strategy which minimizes the weighted average-case cost required to find $x$. The problem is NP-hard even for uniform weights and query costs.

This paper proposes a novel framework integrating hierarchical semantic decomposition, reinforcement learning (RL), visual language models (VLMs), and knowledge distillation to overcome these limitations. Complex tasks are decomposed into atomic skills, with RL-trained policies for each primitive exclusively in simulation. Crucially, our RL formulation incorporates explicit force constraints to prevent object damage during delicate interactions. VLMs perform high-level task decomposition and skill planning, generating diverse expert demonstrations.

As video content becomes increasingly complex with diverse behavioral patterns and contextual scenarios, traditional VAD approaches struggle to provide robust assessment for modern surveillance systems. Existing methods either lack comprehensive spatial-temporal modeling or require excessive computational resources for real-time applications. In this regard, we present a Mamba-based multi-scale spatial-temporal learning (M2S2L) framework in this paper. The proposed method employs hierarchical spatial encoders operating at multiple granularities and multi-temporal encoders capturing motion dynamics across different time scales. We also introduce a feature decomposition mechanism to enable task-specific optimization for appearance and motion reconstruction, facilitating more nuanced behavioral modeling and quality-aware anomaly assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that M2S2L framework achieves 98.5%, 92.1%, and 77.9% frame-level AUCs on UCSD Ped2, CUHK Avenue, and ShanghaiTech respectively, while maintaining efficiency with 20.1G FLOPs and 45 FPS inference speed, making it suitable for practical surveillance deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faM2S2L\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65f6\u7a7a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u89e3\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u65e5\u76ca\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4-\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u8fc7\u5927\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u73b0\u4ee3\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eMamba\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65f6\u7a7a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5c42\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u89e3\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728UCSD Ped2\u3001CUHK Avenue\u548cShanghaiTech\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523098.5%\u300192.1%\u548c77.9%\u7684\u5e27\u7ea7AUC\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e3a20.1G FLOPs\u548c45 FPS\u3002", "conclusion": "M2S2L\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u76d1\u63a7\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

In this paper, we investigate the design for automated recognition of modality bias at the sample level.

To verify the effectiveness, we conduct a human evaluation on two popular benchmarks.

However, the scarcity of labeled logs limits rapid deployment to new systems. Cross-system transfer has become an important research direction. State-of-the-art approaches perform well with a few labeled target logs, but limitations remain: small-model methods transfer general knowledge but overlook mismatches with the target system's proprietary knowledge; LLM-based methods can capture proprietary patterns but rely on a few positive examples and incur high inference cost. Existing LLM-small model collaborations route 'simple logs' to the small model and 'complex logs' to the LLM based on output uncertainty. In zero-label cross-system settings, supervised sample complexity is unavailable, and such routing does not consider knowledge separation. To address this, we propose GeneralLog, a novel LLM-small model collaborative method for zero-label cross-system log anomaly detection. GeneralLog dynamically routes unlabeled logs, letting the LLM handle 'proprietary logs' and the small model 'general logs,' enabling cross-system generalization without labeled target logs. Experiments on three public log datasets show that GeneralLog achieves over 90% F1-score under a fully zero-label setting, significantly outperforming existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "GeneralLog\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578bLLM\u4e0e\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u96f6\u6807\u7b7e\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u96f6\u6807\u7b7e\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76d1\u7763\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGeneralLog\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u65e5\u5fd7\uff0c\u7531LLM\u5904\u7406\u2018\u4e13\u6709\u65e5\u5fd7\u2019\uff0c\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u2018\u901a\u7528\u65e5\u5fd7\u2019\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cGeneralLog\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u96f6\u6807\u7b7e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u8d85\u8fc790%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "GeneralLog\u5728\u96f6\u6807\u7b7e\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To enhance the cross-sensor generalizability, we propose reconstructing the sensor's global deformation as a 3D point cloud and using it as the policy input. We further develop a robust, unified 6-DoF bimanual pose acquisition process using Meta Quest controllers, which eliminates the trajectory drift issue in common SLAM-based methods.

We introduce the Micro-OD benchmark, a curated collection of 252 images specifically curated for in-context learning, with bounding-box annotations spanning 11 cell types across four sources, including two in-lab expert-annotated sets. We systematically evaluate eight VLMs under few-shot conditions and compare variants with and without implicit test-time reasoning tokens. We further implement a hybrid Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD) pipeline that combines a detection head with a VLM-based few-shot classifier, which enhances the few-shot performance of recent VLMs on our benchmark. Across datasets, we observe that zero-shot performance is weak due to the domain gap; however, few-shot support consistently improves detection, with marginal gains achieved after six shots. We observe that models with reasoning tokens are more effective for end-to-end localization, whereas simpler variants are more suitable for classifying pre-localized crops.

However, most existing LLM agents typically operate within static execution frameworks, lacking a principled mechanism to learn and self-improve from their own experience and past rollouts. As a result, their performance remains bounded by the initial framework design and the underlying LLM's capabilities. We propose Self-Abstraction from Grounded Experience (SAGE), a framework that enables agents to learn from their own task executions and refine their behavior through self-abstraction. After an initial rollout, the agent induces a concise plan abstraction from its grounded experience, distilling key steps, dependencies, and constraints. This learned abstraction is then fed back as contextual guidance, refining the agent's policy and supporting more structured, informed subsequent executions.

Despite these benefits, challenges such as startup latencies, static configurations, sub-optimal resource allocation and scheduling still exist due to coupled resource offering and workload-agnostic generic scheduling behaviour. These issues often lead to inconsistent function performance and unexpected operational costs for users and service providers. This paper introduces Saarthi, a novel, end-to-end serverless framework that intelligently manages the dynamic resource needs of function workloads, representing a significant step toward self-driving serverless platforms. Unlike platforms that rely on static resource configurations, Saarthi is input-aware, allowing it to intelligently anticipate resource requirements based on the characteristics of an incoming request payload. This input-driven approach reinforces function right-sizing and enables smart request orchestration across available function configurations. Saarthi further integrates a proactive fault-tolerant redundancy mechanism and employs a multi-objective Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model to maintain an optimal function quantity. This optimisation aims to maximise system throughput while simultaneously reducing overall operational costs. We validate the effectiveness of Saarthi by implementing it as a framework atop OpenFaaS.

By pairing context-free grammars with constraints, users have the expressiveness of unrestricted grammars while retaining simple structure. However, producing inputs in the presence of such constraints can be challenging. In past approaches, SMT solvers have been found to be very slow at finding string solutions; evolutionary algorithms are faster and more general, but current implementations still struggle with complex constraints that would be required for domains such as compiler testing. In this paper, we present a novel approach for evolutionary language-based testing that improves performance by 3-4 orders of magnitude over the current state of the art, reducing hours of generation and constraint solving time to seconds. We accomplish this by (1) carefully transforming grammar definitions into Rust types and trait implementations, ensuring that the compiler may near-maximally optimize arbitrary operations on arbitrary grammars; and (2) using better evolutionary algorithms that improve the ability of language-based testing to solve complex constraint systems. These performance and algorithmic improvements allow our prototype, FANDANGO-RS, to solve constraints that previous strategies simply cannot handle.

This paper proposes a fairness-aware hierarchical control framework that explicitly integrates inequity aversion into intersection management. At the top layer, a centralized allocation module assigns control authority (i.e., selects a single vehicle to execute its trajectory) by maximizing a utility that accounts for waiting time, urgency, control history, and velocity deviation. At the bottom layer, the authorized vehicle executes a precomputed trajectory using a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and applies a high-order Control Barrier Function (HOCBF)-based safety filter for real-time collision avoidance. Simulation results across varying traffic demands and demand distributions demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves near-perfect fairness, eliminates collisions, reduces average delay, and maintains real-time feasibility. These results highlight that fairness can be systematically incorporated without sacrificing safety or performance, enabling scalable and equitable coordination for future autonomous traffic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u516c\u5e73\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u6743\u5206\u914d\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u907f\u78b0\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u534f\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u786e\u4fdd\u8054\u7f51\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u534f\u8c03\u5bf9\u4e8e\u516c\u5e73\u8bbf\u95ee\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u548c\u957f\u671f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u901a\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u4ecd\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u516c\u5e73\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9876\u5c42\u91c7\u7528\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u5757\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u6743\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5e95\u5c42\u901a\u8fc7LQR\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eHOCBF\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u907f\u78b0\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4ea4\u901a\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u96f6\u78b0\u649e\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u5e73\u5747\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u534f\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address this need, Online Continual Learning (OCL) mechanisms have been proposed, allowing models to update their knowledge incrementally as new data become available while preserving previously acquired information. However, existing OCL approaches for sensor-based HAR are computationally intensive and require extensive labeled samples to represent new changes. Recently, pre-trained model-based (PTM-based) OCL approaches have shown significant improvements in performance and efficiency for computer vision applications. These methods achieve strong generalization capabilities by pre-training complex models on large datasets, followed by fine-tuning on downstream tasks for continual learning. However, applying PTM-based OCL approaches to sensor-based HAR poses significant challenges due to the inherent heterogeneity of HAR datasets and the scarcity of labeled data in post-deployment scenarios. This paper introduces PTRN-HAR, the first successful application of PTM-based OCL to sensor-based HAR. Unlike prior PTM-based OCL approaches, PTRN-HAR pre-trains the feature extractor using contrastive loss with a limited amount of data. This extractor is then frozen during the streaming stage. Furthermore, it replaces the conventional dense classification layer with a relation module network. Our design not only significantly reduces the resource consumption required for model training while maintaining high performance, but also improves data efficiency by reducing the amount of labeled data needed for effective continual learning, as demonstrated through experiments on three public datasets, outperforming the state-of-the-art.

Doing so delivers superior concurrent performance by freeing up all GPU cores for computation and also lowers interference in the memory sub-system (caches). While DMA collectives show strong promise, prior works have only studied them in limited context (bandwidth-bound transfer sizes only, performance-only).\n  To address this, we provide a comprehensive performance, power/energy and synchronization costs analysis of offloading ML communication collectives (all-gather, all-to-all) to DMA engines on state-of-the-art AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs. Our analysis reveals that, compared to the state-of-the-art RCCL communication collectives library, DMA collectives are at-par or better for large sizes (10s of MB to GB) in terms of both performance (16% better) and power (32% better). However, they significantly lag for latency-bound small sizes; 4.5X and 2.5X slower for all-gather and all-to-all, respectively. We provide a detailed latency breakdown of a DMA transfer and identify that DMA command scheduling and synchronization costs can limit DMA collective performance. To tackle this, we harness existing DMA architecture innovations, hitherto untapped, to build optimized DMA collectives and demonstrate their efficacy on real hardware.

However, most benchmarks emphasize what to fix rather than how to fix code. We introduce \\textsc{SWE-fficiency}, a benchmark for evaluating repository-level performance optimization on real workloads. Our suite contains 498 tasks across nine widely used data-science, machine-learning, and HPC repositories (e.g., numpy, pandas, scipy): given a complete codebase and a slow workload, an agent must investigate code semantics, localize bottlenecks and relevant tests, and produce a patch that matches or exceeds expert speedup while passing the same unit tests. To enable this how-to-fix evaluation, our automated pipeline scrapes GitHub pull requests for performance-improving edits, combining keyword filtering, static analysis, coverage tooling, and execution validation to both confirm expert speedup baselines and identify relevant repository unit tests. Empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art agents reveals significant underperformance. On average, agents achieve less than 0.15x the expert speedup: agents struggle in localizing optimization opportunities, reasoning about execution across functions, and maintaining correctness in proposed edits.

A straightforward and widely studied approach to this problem is the Bottom-Left Heuristic. It consists of iteratively placing each rectangle in the given order at the lowest feasible position in the strip and, in case of ties, at the leftmost of those. Due to its simplicity and good empirical performance, this heuristic is widely used in practical applications. The most efficient implementation of this heuristic was proposed by Chazelle in 1983, requiring $O(n^2)$ time and $O(n)$ space to place $n$ rectangles. However, although Chazelle's original description was largely correct, it omitted several formal details. Furthermore, our analysis revealed a critical flaw in the original runtime analysis, which, in certain cases, results in $\u03a9(n^3)$ running time. Motivated by this finding, this paper provides a rigorous and corrected presentation of the implementation, addressing the imprecise arguments and resolving the identified flaw. The resulting analysis establishes a formally verified version of Chazelle's implementation and confirms its quadratic time complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4fee\u6b63\u4e86Chazelle\u7684Strip Packing\u95ee\u9898\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u539f\u59cb\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4e8c\u6b21\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8eChazelle\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u5f62\u5f0f\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u9057\u6f0f\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u7248\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4fee\u6b63Chazelle\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u9057\u6f0f\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "result": "\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u4e8c\u6b21\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u539f\u59cb\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e09\u6b21\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86Chazelle\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u4e25\u8c28\u4e14\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u539f\u59cb\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4e8c\u6b21\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing approaches often focus on mapping language to reward functions instead of safety specifications or address only narrow constraint classes (e.g., obstacle avoidance), limiting their robustness and applicability. We propose a modular framework for language-conditioned safety in robot navigation. Our framework is composed of three core components: (1) a large language model (LLM)-based module that translates free-form instructions into structured safety specifications, (2) a perception module that grounds these specifications by maintaining object-level 3D representations of the environment, and (3) a model predictive control (MPC)-based safety filter that enforces both semantic and geometric constraints in real time.

However, researchers and practitioners may have a hard time locating consolidated evidence on this impact, as the available information is scattered in several different publications. Our goal is to aggregate consolidated findings on quality in MDE, facilitating the work of researchers and practitioners in learning about the coverage and main findings of existing work as well as identifying relatively unexplored niches of research that need further attention. We performed a tertiary study on quality in MDE, in order to gain a better understanding of its most prominent findings and existing challenges, as reported in the literature. We identified 22 systematic literature reviews and mapping studies and the most relevant quality attributes addressed by each of those studies, in the context of MDE. Maintainability is clearly the most often studied and reported quality attribute impacted by MDE. Eighty out of 83 research questions in the selected secondary studies have a structure that is more often associated with mapping existing research than with answering more concrete research questions (e.g., comparing two alternative MDE approaches with respect to their impact on a specific quality attribute).

While the variant where the paths need to be pairwise vertex-disjoint, which we call PATH PARTITION, is extensively studied, surprisingly little is known about PATH COVER. We start filling this gap by designing a linear-time algorithm for PATH COVER on trees.\n  We show that PATH COVER can be solved in polynomial time on graphs of bounded treewidth using a dynamic programming scheme. It runs in XP time $n^{t^{O(t)}}$ (where $n$ is the number of vertices and $t$ the treewidth of the input graph) or $\u03ba^{t^{O(t)}}n$ if there is an upper-bound $\u03ba$ on the solution size. A similar algorithm gives an FPT $2^{O(t\\log t)}n$ algorithm for PATH PARTITION, which can be improved to (randomized) $2^{O(t)}n$ using the Cut\\&Count technique.

Street View Imagery (SVI) and Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) represent two prominent approaches for capturing place-based perceptions that can support urban planning decisions, yet their comparability remains underexplored. This study investigates the alignment between SVI-based perceived attractiveness and residents' reported experiences gathered via a city-wide PPGIS survey in Helsinki, Finland. Using participant-rated SVI data and semantic image segmentation, we trained a machine learning model to predict perceived attractiveness based on visual features. We compared these predictions to PPGIS-identified locations marked as attractive or unattractive, calculating agreement using two sets of strict and moderate criteria. Our findings reveal only partial alignment between the two datasets. While agreement (with a moderate threshold) reached 67% for attractive and 77% for unattractive places, agreement (with a strict threshold) dropped to 27% and 29%, respectively. By analysing a range of contextual variables, including noise, traffic, population presence, and land use, we found that non-visual cues significantly contributed to mismatches. The model failed to account for experiential dimensions such as activity levels and environmental stressors that shape perceptions but are not visible in images. These results suggest that while SVI offers a scalable and visual proxy for urban perception, it cannot fully substitute the experiential richness captured through PPGIS. We argue that both methods are valuable but serve different purposes; therefore, a more integrated approach is needed to holistically capture how people perceive urban environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86SVI\u548cPPGIS\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u8005\u4ec5\u90e8\u5206\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u975e\u89c6\u89c9\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u7efc\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6570\u5b57\u5de5\u5177\u65e5\u76ca\u5f71\u54cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u89c4\u5212\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u5982\u4f55\u53cd\u6620\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002SVI\u548cPPGIS\u662f\u4e24\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u8ba8\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8bc4\u5206\u7684SVI\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u611f\u77e5\u5438\u5f15\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0ePPGIS\u8c03\u67e5\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u4ec5\u90e8\u5206\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u9608\u503c\u4e0b\uff0c\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u5730\u70b9\u7684\u540c\u610f\u7387\u4e3a67%\uff0c\u975e\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u5730\u70b9\u4e3a77%\uff1b\u800c\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u9608\u503c\u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u964d\u81f327%\u548c29%\u3002\u975e\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\uff08\u5982\u566a\u97f3\u3001\u4ea4\u901a\u7b49\uff09\u5bf9\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6709\u663e\u8457\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u8bba\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u8857\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\uff08SVI\uff09\u548c\u516c\u4f17\u53c2\u4e0e\u5730\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08PPGIS\uff09\u5728\u6355\u6349\u57ce\u5e02\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u9762\u5404\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u66ff\u4ee3\u5bf9\u65b9\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u7efc\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5168\u9762\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u3002"}}

However, limited by computation capacity of CPU device and traditional solvers, conventional iteration methods are inefficient in complicated case with textured surface requiring refined mesh, and could not handle simulation during multiple periods. To accelerate Picard iteration for predicting dynamics of APP, a GPU-boosted high-performance Multi-working condition joint Analysis Framework (GMAF) is designed, which adopts Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method (PCG) using Approximate Symmetric Successive Over-Relaxation preconditioner (ASSOR). GMAF abundantly utilizes GPU device via elevating computational intensity and expanding scale of massive parallel computation. Therefore, it possesses novel performance in analyzing dynamics of both smooth and textured APPs during multiple periods, as the establishment and solution to joint algebraic system for pressure field are accelerated magnificently, as well as numerical integral for force and moment due to oil flow. Compared with asynchronized convergence strategy pursuing local convergence, synchronized convergence strategy targeting global convergence is adopted in PCG solver for the joint system. Revealed by corresponding results, oil force in axial direction and moment in circumferential directly respond to input pressure, while other components evolve in sinusoidal patterns. Specifically, force and moment due to normal pressure instantly reach their steady state initially, while ones due to viscous shear stress evolve during periods. After simulating dynamics of APP and pressure distribution via GMAF, the promotion of pressure capacity and torsion resistance due to textured surface is revealed numerically, as several 'steps' exist in the pressure field corresponding to textures.", "AI": {"tldr": "GMAF\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528GPU\u52a0\u901f\u548cPCG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u8f74\u5411\u67f1\u585e\u6cf5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7eb9\u7406\u8868\u9762\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7eb9\u7406\u8868\u9762\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7f51\u683c\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u591a\u5468\u671f\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eGPU\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u591a\u5de5\u51b5\u8054\u5408\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff08GMAF\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u5171\u8f6d\u68af\u5ea6\u6cd5\uff08PCG\uff09\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5bf9\u79f0\u9010\u6b21\u8d85\u677e\u5f1b\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u5668\uff08ASSOR\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u89c4\u6a21\u3002", "result": "GMAF\u5728\u5206\u6790\u5e73\u6ed1\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u8868\u9762\u8f74\u5411\u67f1\u585e\u6cf5\u7684\u591a\u5468\u671f\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u538b\u529b\u548c\u529b\u77e9\u7684\u6570\u503c\u79ef\u5206\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u3002\u6cb9\u819c\u529b\u548c\u529b\u77e9\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u538b\u529b\u76f4\u63a5\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u5206\u91cf\u5448\u6b63\u5f26\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7GMAF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u7eb9\u7406\u8868\u9762\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8f74\u5411\u67f1\u585e\u6cf5\u7684\u538b\u529b\u627f\u8f7d\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6297\u626d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u538b\u529b\u573a\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684'\u9636\u68af'\u73b0\u8c61\u4e0e\u7eb9\u7406\u76f4\u63a5\u76f8\u5173\u3002"}}

Methods: We performed a quasi-experiment comparing the standard i* concrete syntax with an alternative that has an increased semantic transparency.

Developing robotic systems that emulate human-like operational characteristics through musculoskeletal structures has long been a research focus. In this study, we designed a novel lightweight tendon-driven musculoskeletal arm (LTDM-Arm), featuring a seven degree-of-freedom (DOF) skeletal joint system and a modularized artificial muscular system (MAMS) with 15 actuators. Additionally, we employed a Hilly-type muscle model and data-driven iterative learning control (DDILC) to learn and refine activation signals for repetitive tasks within a finite time frame.

However, current ST platforms frequently suffer from low resolution, limiting the in-depth understanding of spatial gene expression. Super-resolution approaches promise to enhance ST maps by integrating histology images with gene expressions of profiled tissue spots. However, it remains a challenge to model the interactions between histology images and gene expressions for effective ST enhancement. This study presents a cross-modal cross-content contrastive diffusion framework, called C3-Diff, for ST enhancement with histology images as guidance. In C3-Diff, we firstly analyze the deficiency of traditional contrastive learning paradigm, which is then refined to extract both modal-invariant and content-invariant features of ST maps and histology images. Further, to overcome the problem of low sequencing sensitivity in ST maps, we perform nosing-based information augmentation on the surface of feature unit hypersphere. Finally, we propose a dynamic cross-modal imputation-based training strategy to mitigate ST data scarcity. We tested C3-Diff by benchmarking its performance on four public datasets, where it achieves significant improvements over competing methods. Moreover, we evaluate C3-Diff on downstream tasks of cell type localization, gene expression correlation and single-cell-level gene expression prediction, promoting AI-enhanced biotechnology for biomedical research and clinical applications.

However, their success hinges on navigating a fundamental cognitive tension: the need to balance broad, divergent exploration of the solution space with a principled, convergent synthesis to the optimal solution. Existing paradigms often struggle to manage this duality, leading to premature consensus, error propagation, and a critical credit assignment problem that fails to distinguish between genuine reasoning and superficially plausible arguments. To resolve this core challenge, we propose the Multi-Agent Exploration-Synthesis framework Through Role Orchestration (Maestro), a principled paradigm for collaboration that structurally decouples these cognitive modes. Maestro uses a collective of parallel Execution Agents for diverse exploration and a specialized Central Agent for convergent, evaluative synthesis. To operationalize this critical synthesis phase, we introduce Conditional Listwise Policy Optimization (CLPO), a reinforcement learning objective that disentangles signals for strategic decisions and tactical rationales. By combining decision-focused policy gradients with a list-wise ranking loss over justifications, CLPO achieves clean credit assignment and stronger comparative supervision. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and general problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that Maestro, coupled with CLPO, consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art multi-agent approaches, delivering absolute accuracy gains of 6% on average and up to 10% at best.", "AI": {"tldr": "Maestro\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u8272\u7f16\u6392\u548cCLPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u5e7f\u6cdb\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u539f\u5219\u6027\u5408\u6210\u65f6\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5f20\u529b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u65e9\u5171\u8bc6\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMulti-Agent Exploration-Synthesis\u6846\u67b6\uff08Maestro\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u8272\u7f16\u6392\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u89e3\u8026\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165Conditional Listwise Policy Optimization\uff08CLPO\uff09\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "Maestro\u4e0eCLPO\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Maestro\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408CLPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u901a\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53476%\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u8fbe10%\u3002"}}

Published at ECSA 2025 Tracks and Workshops", "summary": "The global production of electric goods is at an all-time high, causing negative environmental and health impacts as well as a continuing depletion of natural resources. Considering the worsening global climate change, a transition of current industrial processes is necessary to tackle the above-mentioned factors. To address this urgent issue, socio-economic systems like the Circular Economy (CE) provide options to reallocate the use of resources and products on a global scale. Especially in terms of product lifecycle-prolonging, this system provides suitable approaches to alter the current modes of product handling by society and industry alike, based on the condition of the products. Although the importance and benefits of sustainable services enabling these options are widely known, users tend to shy away from using them. One of the reasons is the missing reliability in terms of the knowledge of the costs associated with a particular service. This uncertainty in expected pricing can, therefore, lower the willingness of potential clients. However, not only clients struggle with the boundary conditions of such services. On the part of the potential providers of services, the monetary risk is often caused by the incapability to detect the condition of a product in advance. This can result on the provider side in a severe economic loss if this possibility is not covered by the service price or through the mass of items, which could allow equalization of serval service operations. To address these weak points in current service execution, the authors propose the \\textit{Lifecycle Workbench (LCW)}-ecosystem, which features digital representations to enhance the reliability of service pricing as well as the assessment of the condition of items, assemblies, and parts in the Circular Economy domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5e94\u5bf9\u5faa\u73af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2d\u670d\u52a1\u5b9a\u4ef7\u548c\u4ea7\u54c1\u72b6\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LCW\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u7535\u5b50\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u8fbe\u5230\u5386\u53f2\u65b0\u9ad8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u73af\u5883\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u81ea\u7136\u8d44\u6e90\u6301\u7eed\u67af\u7aed\u3002\u9762\u5bf9\u65e5\u76ca\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5168\u7403\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4e1a\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u8f6c\u578b\u52bf\u5728\u5fc5\u884c\u3002\u5faa\u73af\u7ecf\u6d4e\uff08CE\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u4ea7\u54c1\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5ef6\u957f\u4ea7\u54c1\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u56e0\u670d\u52a1\u6210\u672c\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u800c\u56de\u907f\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u4e5f\u56e0\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u524d\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ea7\u54c1\u72b6\u6001\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u7ecf\u6d4e\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3a\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5de5\u4f5c\u53f0\uff08LCW\uff09\u7684\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8be5\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5229\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8868\u793a\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u670d\u52a1\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u4ea7\u54c1\u3001\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u96f6\u4ef6\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "LCW\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u670d\u52a1\u5b9a\u4ef7\u548c\u4ea7\u54c1\u72b6\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u670d\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u7684\u5f31\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5faa\u73af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2d\u670d\u52a1\u5b9a\u4ef7\u548c\u4ea7\u54c1\u72b6\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5de5\u4f5c\u53f0\uff08LCW\uff09\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8868\u793a\u589e\u5f3a\u8fd9\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Can this random-order model allow us to circumvent the bound of $O(\\log m \\log n)$-competitiveness for the adversarial arrival order model? This long-standing question was recently resolved by Gupta et al. (2021), who gave an algorithm that achieved an $O(\\log mn)$-competitive ratio. While their LearnOrCover was inspired by ideas in online learning (and specifically the multiplicative weights update method), the analysis proceeded by showing progress from first principles.\n  In this work, we show a concrete connection between random-order set cover and stochastic mirror-descent/online convex optimization. In particular, we show how additive/multiplicative regret bounds for the latter translate into competitiveness for the former.

Many existing systems use rigid mechanisms and bulky interfaces that impede force transmission and reduce wearability. This study introduces a soft sleeve actuation architecture that conforms to the limb while transmitting forces and moments efficiently. We develop three soft sleeve actuators that produce linear, bending, and twisting motion, and an omnidirectional design that combines these motions in one device. Actuators are fabricated from thermoplastic elastomers using a customized fused filament fabrication process that produces airtight and compliant structures and resolves leakage observed with conventional methods. A dedicated experimental platform quantifies kinematic outputs such as displacement, angle, and twist, and kinetic outputs such as force and torque under low pneumatic pressures. A parametric study varies geometric features and material properties to determine their influence on performance. Results show reproducible multi axis motion with improved transfer of force to the limb and reduced need for complex attachment hardware.

In particular, existing models often fail to render correctly even short phrases or words and previous attempts to address this problem are computationally expensive and not suitable for video generation. In this work, we investigate a lightweight approach to improve T2V diffusion models using synthetic supervision. We first generate text-rich images using a text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model, then animate them into short videos using a text-agnostic image-to-video (I2v) model.

We hypothesize that explicitly disentangled object-level representations, by localizing task-relevant information, can enhance policy performance across novel feature combinations. To test this hypothesis, we introduce DLPWM, a fully unsupervised, disentangled object-centric world model that learns object-level latents directly from pixels. DLPWM achieves strong reconstruction and prediction performance, including robustness to several out-of-distribution (OOD) visual variations. However, when used for downstream model-based control, policies trained on DLPWM latents underperform compared to DreamerV3. Through latent-trajectory analyses, we identify representation shift during multi-object interactions as a key driver of unstable policy learning.

LLMServingSim2.0 addresses two key limitations of its predecessor: (1) integrating hardware models into system-level simulators is non-trivial due to the lack of a clear abstraction, and (2) existing simulators support only a narrow subset of serving techniques, leaving no infrastructure that captures the breadth of approaches in modern LLM serving. To overcome these issues, LLMServingSim2.0 adopts trace-driven performance modeling, accompanied by an operator-level latency profiler, enabling the integration of new accelerators with a single command. It further embeds up-to-date serving techniques while exposing flexible interfaces for request routing, cache management, and scheduling policies. In a TPU case study, our profiler requires 18.5x fewer LoC and outperforms the predecessor's hardware-simulator integration, demonstrating LLMServingSim2.0's low-effort hardware extensibility.

The objective is to efficiently maintain an approximate minimum SC under element updates; efficiency is primarily measured by the update time, but another important parameter is the recourse (number of changes to the solution per update). Ideally, one would like to achieve low worst-case bounds on both update time and recourse.\n  One can achieve approximation $(1+\u03b5)\\ln n$ (greedy-based) or $(1+\u03b5)f$ (primal-dual-based) with worst-case update time $O(f\\log n)$ (ignoring $\u03b5$ dependencies). However, despite a large body of work, no algorithm with low update time (even amortized) and nontrivial worst-case recourse is known, even for unweighted instances ($C = 1$)!\n  We remedy this by providing a transformation that, given as a black-box a SC algorithm with approximation $\u03b1$ and update time $T$, returns a set cover algorithm with approximation $(2 + \u03b5)\u03b1$, update time $O(T + \u03b1C)$, and worst-case recourse $O(\u03b1C)$. Our main results are obtained by leveraging this transformation for constant $C$:...", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ed1\u76d2\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u96c6\u8986\u76d6\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u52a8\u6001\u96c6\u8986\u76d6\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ed1\u76d2\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u4efb\u4f55\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u96c6\u8986\u76d6\u7b97\u6cd5\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u56fa\u5b9a\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u96c6\u8986\u76d6\u7b97\u6cd5\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f18\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

However, for multi-agent planning, MCTS is confronted with a large combinatorial action space that often grows exponentially with the number of agents. As a result, the branching factor of MCTS during tree expansion also increases exponentially, making it very difficult to efficiently explore and exploit during tree search. To this end, we propose MALinZero, a new approach to leverage low-dimensional representational structures on joint-action returns and enable efficient MCTS in complex multi-agent planning. Our solution can be viewed as projecting the joint-action returns into the low-dimensional space representable using a contextual linear bandit problem formulation. We solve the contextual linear bandit problem with convex and $\u03bc$-smooth loss functions -- in order to place more importance on better joint actions and mitigate potential representational limitations -- and derive a linear Upper Confidence Bound applied to trees (LinUCT) to enable novel multi-agent exploration and exploitation in the low-dimensional space. We analyze the regret of MALinZero for low-dimensional reward functions and propose an $(1-\\tfrac1e)$-approximation algorithm for the joint action selection by maximizing a sub-modular objective.

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution, but their effectiveness depends heavily on how they are prompted. Unlike generic code summarization, test-code summarization poses distinct challenges because test methods validate expected behavior through assertions rather than im- plementing functionality. This paper presents a new benchmark of 91 real-world Java test cases paired with developer-written summaries and conducts a controlled ablation study to investigate how test code-related components-such as the method under test (MUT), assertion messages, and assertion semantics-affect the performance of LLM-generated test summaries. We evaluate four code LLMs (Codex, Codestral, DeepSeek, and Qwen-Coder) across seven prompt configurations using n-gram metrics (BLEU, ROUGE-L, METEOR), semantic similarity (BERTScore), and LLM-based evaluation. Results show that prompting with as- sertion semantics improves summary quality by an average of 0.10 points (2.3%) over full MUT context (4.45 vs. 4.35) while requiring fewer input tokens. Codex and Qwen-Coder achieve the highest alignment with human-written summaries, while DeepSeek underperforms despite high lexical overlap.

However, the vast complexity of outdoor aerial environments compounds data acquisition challenges and imposes long-horizon trajectory planning requirements on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), introducing novel complexities for aerial VLN. To address these challenges, we propose a data-efficient Open-world aerial Vision-Language Navigation (i.e., OpenVLN) framework, which could execute language-guided flight with limited data constraints and enhance long-horizon trajectory planning capabilities in complex aerial environments. Specifically, we reconfigure a reinforcement learning framework to optimize the VLM for UAV navigation tasks, which can efficiently fine-tune VLM by using rule-based policies under limited training data. Concurrently, we introduce a long-horizon planner for trajectory synthesis that dynamically generates precise UAV actions via value-based rewards. To the end, we conduct sufficient navigation experiments on the TravelUAV benchmark with dataset scaling across diverse reward settings.

However, even state-of-the-art models often suffer from fine-grained artifacts and poor identity preservation, particularly under challenging poses and expressions. A key limitation of existing approaches is their failure to meaningfully leverage 3D facial structure, which is crucial for disentangling identity from pose and expression. In this work, we propose DiffSwap++, a novel diffusion-based face-swapping pipeline that incorporates 3D facial latent features during training. By guiding the generation process with 3D-aware representations, our method enhances geometric consistency and improves the disentanglement of facial identity from appearance attributes. We further design a diffusion architecture that conditions the denoising process on both identity embeddings and facial landmarks, enabling high-fidelity and identity-preserving face swaps. Extensive experiments on CelebA, FFHQ, and CelebV-Text demonstrate that DiffSwap++ outperforms prior methods in preserving source identity while maintaining target pose and expression. Additionally, we introduce a biometric-style evaluation and conduct a user study to further validate the realism and effectiveness of our approach.

Equal contribution by first two authors", "summary": "Vision-Language-Action models such as OpenVLA show impressive zero-shot generalization across robotic manipulation tasks but often fail to adapt efficiently to new deployment environments. In many real-world applications, consistent high performance on a limited set of tasks is more important than broad generalization. We propose ExpReS-VLA, a method for specializing pre-trained VLA models through experience replay and retrieval while preventing catastrophic forgetting. ExpReS-VLA stores compact feature representations from the frozen vision backbone instead of raw image-action pairs, reducing memory usage by approximately 97 percent. During deployment, relevant past experiences are retrieved using cosine similarity and used to guide adaptation, while prioritized experience replay emphasizes successful trajectories. We also introduce Thresholded Hybrid Contrastive Loss, which enables learning from both successful and failed attempts. On the LIBERO simulation benchmark, ExpReS-VLA improves success rates from 82.6 to 93.1 percent on spatial reasoning tasks and from 61 to 72.3 percent on long-horizon tasks. On physical robot experiments with five manipulation tasks, it reaches 98 percent success on both seen and unseen settings, compared to 84.7 and 32 percent for naive fine-tuning.

However, by relying on a final softmax classifier, these methods suffer from two fundamental distortions: additive logit shifts that arbitrarily bias importance scores, and sign collapse that conflates excitatory and inhibitory features. We propose a simple, architecture-agnostic dual-branch sigmoid head that decouples localization from classification. Given any pretrained model, we clone its classification head into a parallel branch ending in per-class sigmoid outputs, freeze the original softmax head, and fine-tune only the sigmoid branch with class-balanced binary supervision. At inference, softmax retains recognition accuracy, while class evidence maps are generated from the sigmoid branch -- preserving both magnitude and sign of feature contributions. Our method integrates seamlessly with most CAM variants and incurs negligible overhead. Extensive evaluations on fine-grained tasks (CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars) and WSOL benchmarks (ImageNet-1K, OpenImages30K) show improved explanation fidelity and consistent Top-1 Localization gains -- without any drop in classification accuracy.

This study explores distributed deep learning for denoising chest X-ray images from the NIH Chest X-ray14 dataset, using additive Gaussian noise as a lightweight obfuscation technique. We implement and evaluate U-Net and U-Net++ architectures under single-GPU, standard multi-GPU (DataParallel), and optimized multi-GPU training configurations using PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel (DDP) and Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP). Our results show that U-Net++ consistently delivers superior denoising performance, achieving competitive Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structured Similarity Index Method (SSIM) scores, though with less performance in Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) compared to U-Net under low and moderate noise levels. This indicates U-Net++'s enhanced structural fidelity and low perceptual similarity. Meanwhile, our optimized training pipeline reduces training time by over 60% for both models compared to single-GPU training, and outperforms standard DataParallel by over 40%, with only a minor accuracy drop for both models (trading some accuracy for speed). These findings highlight the effectiveness of software-level optimization in distributed learning for medical imaging. This work demonstrates the practical viability of combining architectural design, lightweight obfuscation, and advanced distributed training strategies to accelerate and enhance medical image processing pipelines in real-world clinical and research environments.

To ensure interaction is guided by task-relevant affordances, we leverage coarse semantic priors from VLMs to guide the search toward task-relevant regions and refine placements with geometric constraints, thereby reducing the risk of convergence to local optima.

Accurate role identification, which forms the basis of an agent's belief state, is therefore the keystone for both human and AI performance. We introduce CSP4SDG, a probabilistic, constraint-satisfaction framework that analyses gameplay objectively. Game events and dialogue are mapped to four linguistically-agnostic constraint classes-evidence, phenomena, assertions, and hypotheses. Hard constraints prune impossible role assignments, while weighted soft constraints score the remainder; information-gain weighting links each hypothesis to its expected value under entropy reduction, and a simple closed-form scoring rule guarantees that truthful assertions converge to classical hard logic with minimum error. The resulting posterior over roles is fully interpretable and updates in real time.

Most of these are diffusion models with unique computational characteristics, distinct from both traditional small-scale ML models and large language models. They are highly compute-bound and use an iterative denoising process to generate images, leading to very high inference time. This creates significant challenges in designing a high-throughput system. We discovered that a large fraction of prompts can be served using faster, approximated models. However, the approximation setting must be carefully calibrated for each prompt to avoid quality degradation. Designing a high-throughput system that assigns each prompt to the appropriate model and compatible approximation setting remains a challenging problem. We present Argus, a high-throughput T2I inference system that selects the right level of approximation for each prompt to maintain quality while meeting throughput targets on a fixed-size cluster. Argus intelligently switches between different approximation strategies to satisfy both throughput and quality requirements.

Traditional algorithms like GJK+EPA compute witness points (i.e., the closest or deepest-penetration pairs between two objects) but are inherently non-differentiable, preventing gradient flow and limiting gradient-based optimization in contact-rich tasks such as grasping and manipulation. Recent work introduced efficient first-order randomized smoothing to make witness points differentiable; however, their direction-based formulation is restricted to convex objects and lacks robustness for complex geometries. In this work, we propose a robust and efficient differentiable collision detection framework that supports both convex and concave objects across diverse scales and configurations. Our method introduces distance-based first-order randomized smoothing, adaptive sampling, and equivalent gradient transport for robust and informative gradient computation. Experiments on complex meshes from DexGraspNet and Objaverse show significant improvements over existing baselines. Finally, we demonstrate a direct application of our method for dexterous grasp synthesis to refine the grasp quality.

High deposition rate robotic AM (HDRRAM) processes, such as cold spray additive manufacturing (CSAM), offer significantly increased build speeds by delivering large volumes of material per unit time. However, maintaining shape accuracy remains a critical challenge, particularly due to process instabilities in current open-loop systems. Detecting these deviations as they occur is essential to prevent error propagation, ensure part quality, and minimize post-processing requirements. This study presents a real-time monitoring system to acquire and reconstruct the growing part and directly compares it with a near-net reference model to detect the shape deviation during the manufacturing process. The early identification of shape inconsistencies, followed by segmenting and tracking each deviation region, paves the way for timely intervention and compensation to achieve consistent part quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u9ad8\u6c89\u79ef\u7387\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e9\u671f\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u504f\u5dee\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ca\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u548c\u8865\u507f\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u96f6\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u6c89\u79ef\u7387\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\uff08HDRRAM\uff09\u5de5\u827a\uff08\u5982\u51b7\u55b7\u6d82\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\uff08CSAM\uff09\uff09\u867d\u7136\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u5f00\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u5f62\u72b6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u5dee\u5bf9\u9632\u6b62\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u3001\u786e\u4fdd\u96f6\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u540e\u5904\u7406\u9700\u6c42\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u6b63\u5728\u589e\u957f\u7684\u96f6\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u8fd1\u51c0\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5236\u9020\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5236\u9020\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f62\u72b6\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u57df\u5206\u5272\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e3a\u53ca\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u548c\u8865\u507f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u6b63\u5728\u5236\u9020\u7684\u96f6\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u8fd1\u51c0\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5236\u9020\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u65e9\u671f\u8bc6\u522b\u5f62\u72b6\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u533a\u57df\u5206\u5272\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ca\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u548c\u8865\u507f\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u96f6\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Locating the sensor off the contact interface reduces damage risk, preserves softness, and simplifies fabrication and maintenance. We first characterize the optical sensing element and the compliant skin, thendetermine the design of a prototype tactile sensor. Compression experiments validate the approach, exhibiting a monotonic force output relationship consistent with theory, low hysteresis, high repeatability over repeated cycles, and small response indentation speeds. We further demonstrate integration on a soft robotic gripper, where the module reliably detects grasp events. Compared with liquid filled or wireembedded tactile skins, the proposed modular add on architecture enhances durability, reduces wiring complexity, and supports straightforward deployment across diverse robot geometries. Because the sensing principle reads skin strain patterns, it also suggests extensions to other somatosensory cues such as joint angle or actuator state estimation from surface deformation. Overall, leveraging surface compliance with an external optical module provides a practical and robust route to equip soft robots with force perception while preserving structural flexibility and manufacturability, paving the way for robotic applications and safe human robot collaboration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u5149\u5b66\u6a21\u5757\u8bfb\u53d6\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8868\u9762\u53d8\u5f62\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u63a5\u89e6\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u5236\u9020\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u6ede\u540e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u51cf\u5c11\u63a5\u89e6\u754c\u9762\u7684\u635f\u574f\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u67d4\u8f6f\u6027\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u5236\u9020\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u987a\u5e94\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u53ef\u9644\u52a0\u7684\u5149\u53cd\u5c04\u6a21\u5757\u8bfb\u53d6\u7845\u80f6\u76ae\u80a4\u7684\u8868\u9762\u53d8\u5f62\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u63a5\u89e6\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5d4c\u5165\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u538b\u7f29\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u529b\u8f93\u51fa\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u4f4e\u6ede\u540e\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u538b\u5165\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u5c0f\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5728\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5939\u6301\u5668\u4e0a\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u6a21\u5757\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u6293\u53d6\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u5149\u5b66\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u8868\u9762\u987a\u5e94\u6027\u4e3a\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u529b\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u5236\u9020\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

In this paper, we address this essential problem by formulating the generation process as learning an optimal, direct transport trajectory between the distribution of the current rendering and the desired target distribution, thereby enabling high-quality generation with smaller Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) values. At first, we theoretically establish SDS as a simplified instance of the Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge framework. We prove that SDS employs the reverse process of an Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge, which, under specific conditions (e.g., a Gaussian noise as one end), collapses to SDS's score function of the pre-trained diffusion model. Based upon this, we introduce Trajectory-Centric Distillation (TraCe), a novel text-to-3D generation framework, which reformulates the mathematically trackable framework of Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge to explicitly construct a diffusion bridge from the current rendering to its text-conditioned, denoised target, and trains a LoRA-adapted model on this trajectory's score dynamics for robust 3D optimization.

Previous work has shown that verifying the correctness of individual reasoning steps can further improve the performance and efficiency of LLMs on such tasks and enhance solution interpretability. However, existing verification approaches, such as Process Reward Models (PRMs), are either computationally expensive, limited to specific domains, or require large-scale human or model-generated annotations. Thus, we propose a lightweight alternative for step-level reasoning verification based on data-driven uncertainty scores. We train transformer-based uncertainty quantification heads (UHeads) that use the internal states of a frozen LLM to estimate the uncertainty of its reasoning steps during generation. The approach is fully automatic: target labels are generated either by another larger LLM (e.g., DeepSeek R1) or in a self-supervised manner by the original model itself. UHeads are both effective and lightweight, containing less than 10M parameters. Across multiple domains, including mathematics, planning, and general knowledge question answering, they match or even surpass the performance of PRMs that are up to 810x larger.

However, existing methods predominantly require training independent policies for each skill, yielding behavior-specific controllers that exhibit limited generalization and brittle performance when deployed on irregular terrains and in diverse situations. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Humanoid Control (AHC) that adopts a two-stage framework to learn an adaptive humanoid locomotion controller across different skills and terrains. Specifically, we first train several primary locomotion policies and perform a multi-behavior distillation process to obtain a basic multi-behavior controller, facilitating adaptive behavior switching based on the environment. Then, we perform reinforced fine-tuning by collecting online feedback in performing adaptive behaviors on more diverse terrains, enhancing terrain adaptability for the controller. We conduct experiments in both simulation and real-world experiments in Unitree G1 robots. The results show that our method exhibits strong adaptability across various situations and terrains.

In high-level competitions, these nuanced differences become decisive factors in scoring. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-level motion parsing framework for AQA based on enhanced spatial-temporal pose features. On the first level, the Action-Unit Parser is designed with the help of pose extraction to achieve precise action segmentation and comprehensive local-global pose representations. On the second level, Motion Parser is used by spatial-temporal feature learning to capture pose changes and appearance details for each action-unit. Meanwhile, some special conditions other than body-related will impact action scoring, like water splash in diving. In this work, we design an additional Condition Parser to offer users more flexibility in their choices. Finally, Weight-Adjust Scoring Module is introduced to better accommodate the diverse requirements of various action types and the multi-scale nature of action-units.

The ability to perceive, track, and manipulate these objects without prior knowledge of their geometry or kinematic properties remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. In this work, we present a novel method for visuo-tactile-based tracking of unseen objects (single, multiple, or articulated) during robotic interaction without assuming any prior knowledge regarding object shape or dynamics. Our novel pose tracking approach termed ArtReg (stands for Articulated Registration) integrates visuo-tactile point clouds in an unscented Kalman Filter formulation in the SE(3) Lie Group for point cloud registration. ArtReg is used to detect possible articulated joints in objects using purposeful manipulation maneuvers such as pushing or hold-pulling with a two-robot team. Furthermore, we leverage ArtReg to develop a closed-loop controller for goal-driven manipulation of articulated objects to move the object into the desired pose configuration. We have extensively evaluated our approach on various types of unknown objects through real robot experiments. We also demonstrate the robustness of our method by evaluating objects with varying center of mass, low-light conditions, and with challenging visual backgrounds. Furthermore, we benchmarked our approach on a standard dataset of articulated objects and demonstrated improved performance in terms of pose accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

However, existing methods often assume ideal conditions, overlooking challenges such as sensor failures, environmental disturbances, and data imperfections, which can significantly degrade prediction accuracy. Additionally, previous models have not adequately addressed the considerable variability in driver behavior and accident rates across different vehicle types. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces ROAR, a novel approach for accident detection and prediction. ROAR combines Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), a self adaptive object aware module, and dynamic focal loss to tackle these challenges. The DWT effectively extracts features from noisy and incomplete data, while the object aware module improves accident prediction by focusing on high-risk vehicles and modeling the spatial temporal relationships among traffic agents. Moreover, dynamic focal loss mitigates the impact of class imbalance between positive and negative samples. Evaluated on three widely used datasets, Dashcam Accident Dataset (DAD), Car Crash Dataset (CCD), and AnAn Accident Detection (A3D), our model consistently outperforms existing baselines in key metrics such as Average Precision (AP) and mean Time to Accident (mTTA).

However, they cannot guarantee safe behavior, so external safety mechanisms are needed. These, however, alter actions in ways unseen during training, causing unpredictable behavior and performance degradation. To address these problems, we propose path-consistent safety filtering (PACS) for DPs. Our approach performs path-consistent braking on a trajectory computed from the sequence of generated actions. In this way, we keep execution consistent with the policy's training distribution, maintaining the learned, task-completing behavior. To enable a real-time deployment and handle uncertainties, we verify safety using set-based reachability analysis. Our experimental evaluation in simulation and on three challenging real-world human-robot interaction tasks shows that PACS (a) provides formal safety guarantees in dynamic environments, (b) preserves task success rates, and (c) outperforms reactive safety approaches, such as control barrier functions, by up to 68% in terms of task success.

Prior work on large language model negotiation largely emphasizes autonomous bargaining between agents and omits practical needs such as staged information gathering, explicit authorization boundaries, and systematic feedback integration. We propose GAIA, a governance-first framework for LLM-human agency in B2B negotiation and screening. GAIA defines three essential roles - Principal (human), Delegate (LLM agent), and Counterparty - with an optional Critic to enhance performance, and organizes interactions through three mechanisms: information-gated progression that separates screening from negotiation; dual feedback integration that combines AI critique with lightweight human corrections; and authorization boundaries with explicit escalation paths. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) a formal governance framework with three coordinated mechanisms and four safety invariants for delegation with bounded authorization; (2) information-gated progression via task-completeness tracking (TCI) and explicit state transitions that separate screening from commitment; (3) dual feedback integration that blends Critic suggestions with human oversight through parallel learning channels; and (4) a hybrid validation blueprint that combines automated protocol metrics with human judgment of outcomes and safety.

Unfortunately, traditional static pointer analysis techniques used to generate application call graphs suffer from imprecision. These techniques are agnostic to the application's architecture and are designed for broad applicability. To mitigate this precision problem, we propose PhaseSeed, a novel technique that improves the accuracy of pointer analysis for split-phase applications, which have distinct initialization and processing phases. PhaseSeed analyzes the initialization phase dynamically, collecting the points-to relationships established at runtime. At the end of the initialization phase, it then seeds this information to a static analysis stage that performs pointer analysis for all code that stays in scope during the processing phase, improving precision. Our observations show that, given the same runtime configuration options, the points-to relationships established during the initialization phase remain constant across multiple runs. Therefore, PhaseSeed is sound with respect to a given initial configuration. We apply PhaseSeed to three security mechanisms: control flow integrity (CFI), software debloating, and system call filtering.

We propose a model architecture that grounds action recognition in physical space by fusing two powerful, complementary representations: V-JEPA 2's contextual, predictive world dynamics and CoMotion's explicit, occlusion-tolerant human pose data. Our model is validated on both the InHARD and UCF-19-Y-OCC benchmarks for general action recognition and high-occlusion action recognition, respectively. Our model outperforms three other baselines, especially within complex, occlusive scenes.

Large language models have become a new tool to help numerical reasoning and understanding these documents. However, prompt quality can have a major effect on how well LLMs perform these financial reasoning tasks. Most current methods tune prompts on fixed datasets of financial text or tabular data, which limits their ability to adapt to new question types or document structures, or they involve costly and manually labeled/curated dataset to help build the prompts. We introduce a self-improving prompt framework driven by data-augmented optimization. In this closed-loop process, we generate synthetic financial tables and document excerpts, verify their correctness and robustness, and then update the prompt based on the results. Specifically, our framework combines a synthetic data generator with verifiers and a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples that exposes weaknesses in the current prompt, the verifiers check the validity and robustness of the produced examples, and the optimizer incrementally refines the prompt in response. By iterating these steps in a feedback cycle, our method steadily improves prompt accuracy on financial reasoning tasks without needing external labels. Evaluation on DocMath-Eval benchmark demonstrates that our system achieves higher performance in both accuracy and robustness than standard prompt methods, underscoring the value of incorporating synthetic data generation into prompt learning for financial applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u548c\u95ed\u73af\u53cd\u9988\u63d0\u5347\u91d1\u878d\u6587\u6863\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u578b\u6216\u6587\u6863\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u73af\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u9010\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728DocMath-Eval\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u4f18\u5316\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91d1\u878d\u6587\u6863\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

PCD are widely applied in advanced manufacturing processes, including additive, subtractive, and hybrid manufacturing. To ensure the consistency of analysis and avoid false alarms, preprocessing steps such as registration and mesh reconstruction are commonly applied prior to monitoring. However, these steps are error-prone, time-consuming and may introduce artifacts, potentially affecting monitoring outcomes. In this paper, we present a novel registration-free approach for monitoring PCD of complex shapes, eliminating the need for both registration and mesh reconstruction. Our proposal consists of two alternative feature learning methods and a common monitoring scheme. Feature learning methods leverage intrinsic geometric properties of the shape, captured via the Laplacian and geodesic distances.

The use of outdated OSS libraries introduces technical lag, necessitating timely upgrades. However, maintaining up-to-date libraries is challenging, as it may introduce incompatibility issues that break the project or redundant dependencies that unnecessarily increase the size of the project. These issues discourage developers from upgrading libraries, highlighting the need for a fully automated solution that balances version upgrades, reduces technical lag, ensures compatibility, and avoids redundant dependencies.\n  To this end, we propose DepUpdater, which ensures that upgrades minimize technical lag as much as possible while avoiding incompatibility issues and redundant dependencies. The comparison with existing dependency management tools demonstrates that DepUpdater more effectively reduces technical lag while ensuring compatibility and pruning redundant dependencies. Additionally, an ablation study highlights the potential benefits of considering pruning requirements during upgrades to mitigate incompatibility issues.

After contextualizing the problem within various control architectures, we dissect the ``curse of simulation'' by analyzing the primary sources of sim-to-real gap: robot dynamics, contact modeling, state estimation, and numerical solvers. Building on this diagnosis, we structure the solutions around two complementary philosophies. The first is to shrink the gap through model-centric strategies that systematically improve the simulator's physical fidelity. The second is to harden the policy, a complementary approach that uses in-simulation robustness training and post-deployment adaptation to make the policy inherently resilient to model inaccuracies.

Existing cultural benchmarks focus mainly on object-centric categories (e.g., food, attire, and architecture), overlooking the social and daily activities that more clearly reflect cultural norms. Few metrics exist for measuring cultural faithfulness. We introduce CULTIVate, a benchmark for evaluating T2I models on cross-cultural activities (e.g., greetings, dining, games, traditional dances, and cultural celebrations). CULTIVate spans 16 countries with 576 prompts and more than 19,000 images, and provides an explainable descriptor-based evaluation framework across multiple cultural dimensions, including background, attire, objects, and interactions. We propose four metrics to measure cultural alignment, hallucination, exaggerated elements, and diversity. Our findings reveal systematic disparities: models perform better for global north countries than for the global south, with distinct failure modes across T2I systems.

Experiments demonstrate that AI agents in the Station achieve new state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of benchmarks, spanning from mathematics to computational biology to machine learning, notably surpassing AlphaEvolve in circle packing. A rich tapestry of narratives emerges as agents pursue independent research, interact with peers, and build upon a cumulative history.

Data is often siloed across numerous disparate tools, making manual report generation time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies. This paper presents the architecture and implementation of a centralized framework designed to provide near-real-time visibility into developer experience (DevEx) and Key Performance Indicator (KPI) metrics for a software ecosystem. By aggregating data from various internal tools and platforms, the system computes and visualizes metrics across key areas such as Developer Productivity, Quality, and Operational Efficiency. The architecture features a cron-based data ingestion layer, a dual-schema data storage approach, a processing engine for metric pre-computation, a proactive alerting system, and utilizes the open-source BI tool Metabase for visualization, all secured with role-based access control (RBAC). The implementation resulted in a significant reduction in manual reporting efforts, saving an estimated 20 person-hours per week, and enabled faster, data-driven bottleneck identification.

Detecting and mitigating hallucinations is challenging when ground-truth references are unavailable and model internals are inaccessible. This paper proposes a novel self-contained low-rank approach to automatically rank multiple candidate captions generated by multiple VLMs based on their hallucination levels, using only the captions themselves without requiring external references or model access. By constructing a sentence-embedding matrix and decomposing it into a low-rank consensus component and a sparse residual, we use the residual magnitude to rank captions: selecting the one with the smallest residual as the most hallucination-free. Experiments on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves 87% selection accuracy in identifying hallucination-free captions, representing a 19% improvement over the unfiltered baseline and a 6-10% improvement over multi-agent debate method. The sorting produced by sparse error magnitudes shows strong correlation with human judgments of hallucinations, validating our scoring mechanism.

We introduce VMDT (Video-Modal DecodingTrust), the first unified platform for evaluating text-to-video (T2V) and video-to-text (V2T) models across five key trustworthiness dimensions: safety, hallucination, fairness, privacy, and adversarial robustness. Through our extensive evaluation of 7 T2V models and 19 V2T models using VMDT, we uncover several significant insights. For instance, all open-source T2V models evaluated fail to recognize harmful queries and often generate harmful videos, while exhibiting higher levels of unfairness compared to image modality models. In V2T models, unfairness and privacy risks rise with scale, whereas hallucination and adversarial robustness improve -- though overall performance remains low. Uniquely, safety shows no correlation with model size, implying that factors other than scale govern current safety levels. Our findings highlight the urgent need for developing more robust and trustworthy video foundation models, and VMDT provides a systematic framework for measuring and tracking progress toward this goal.

Existing text-based geocoding tools perform poorly in multilingual and unstructured news environments, where incomplete place descriptions and mixed Bangla-English scripts obscure spatial context. To address these limitations, this study introduces ALIGN (Accident Location Inference through Geo-Spatial Neural Reasoning)- a vision-language framework that emulates human spatial reasoning to infer accident coordinates directly from textual and map-based cues. ALIGN integrates large language and vision-language models within a multi-stage pipeline that performs optical character recognition, linguistic reasoning, and map-level verification through grid-based spatial scanning. The framework systematically evaluates each predicted location against contextual and visual evidence, ensuring interpretable, fine-grained geolocation outcomes without requiring model retraining. Applied to Bangla-language news data, ALIGN demonstrates consistent improvements over traditional geoparsing methods, accurately identifying district and sub-district-level crash sites. Beyond its technical contribution, the framework establishes a high accuracy foundation for automated crash mapping in data-scarce regions, supporting evidence-driven road-safety policymaking and the broader integration of multimodal artificial intelligence in transportation analytics.

Existing methods focus on using accumulated data to support decision making, enhancing the sharing of secondary data while others exclude some critical stakeholders like patient caretakers and administrators thus, leaving an information gap that creates delays and miscommunication during case management.

To address the sample efficiency challenge, a \\textit{physics-based data augmentation} strategy is introduced that generates virtual robot configurations by systematically perturbing physical parameters, enabling effective meta-learning with limited real robot data. The proposed approach is evaluated on two heterogeneous platforms: a 9-DOF Franka Panda manipulator and a 12-DOF Laikago quadruped robot. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 16.6\\% average improvement on Franka Panda (6.26\u00b0 MAE), with exceptional gains in high-load joints (J2: 80.4\\% improvement from 12.36\u00b0 to 2.42\u00b0). Critically, this work discovers the \\textit{optimization ceiling effect}: RL achieves dramatic improvements when meta-learning exhibits localized high-error joints, but provides no benefit (0.0\\%) when baseline performance is uniformly strong, as observed in Laikago. The method demonstrates robust performance under disturbances (parameter uncertainty: +19.2\\%, no disturbance: +16.6\\%, average: +10.0\\%) with only 10 minutes of training time. Multi-seed analysis across 100 random initializations confirms stable performance (4.81+/-1.64\\% average). These results establish that RL effectiveness is highly dependent on meta-learning baseline quality and error distribution, providing important design guidance for hierarchical control systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316PID\u8c03\u53c2\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86RL\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8ePID\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u624b\u52a8\u8c03\u53c2\u7684\u8017\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u6027\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdbPID\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7528\u4e8ePID\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728Franka Panda\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8616.6%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6539\u8fdb\uff086.26\u00b0 MAE\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9ad8\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5173\u8282\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\uff08J2\uff1a\u4ece12.36\u00b0\u52302.42\u00b0\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb80.4%\uff09\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0RL\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5728\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u65f6\u66f4\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7684\u6548\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

(2) Data quality issues: without rigorous validation, many samples are noisy-e.g., reviews on outdated or irrelevant code-reducing evaluation reliability. (3) Coarse granularity: most benchmarks operate at the file or commit level, overlooking the fine-grained, line-level reasoning essential for precise review.\n  We introduce ContextCRBench, a high-quality, context-rich benchmark for fine-grained LLM evaluation in code review. Our construction pipeline comprises: (1) Raw Data Crawling, collecting 153.7K issues and pull requests from top-tier repositories; (2) Comprehensive Context Extraction, linking issue-PR pairs for textual context and extracting the full surrounding function or class for code context; and (3) Multi-stage Data Filtering, combining rule-based and LLM-based validation to remove outdated, malformed, or low-value samples, resulting in 67,910 context-enriched entries.\n  ContextCRBench supports three evaluation scenarios aligned with the review workflow: (1) hunk-level quality assessment, (2) line-level defect localization, and (3) line-level comment generation.

Whether a legged robot making-and-breaking contact with a floor, or a manipulator grasping objects, contact is everywhere. Unfortunately, the switching of dynamics at contact boundaries makes control difficult. Predictive controllers face non-convex optimization problems when contact is involved. Here, we overcome this difficulty by applying Koopman operators to subsume the segmented dynamics due to contact changes into a unified, globally-linear model in an embedding space.

In this work, we introduce a new reasoning data generation framework spanning diverse skills and levels of complexity with over 1M high-quality synthetic vision-centric questions. The dataset also includes preference data and instruction prompts supporting both offline and online RL. Our synthesis framework proceeds in two stages: (1) scale; and (2) complexity. Reasoning traces are then synthesized through a two-stage process that leverages VLMs and reasoning LLMs, producing CoT traces for VLMs that capture the richness and diverse cognitive behaviors found in frontier reasoning models. Remarkably, we show that finetuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on our data outperforms all open-data baselines across all evaluated vision-centric benchmarks, and even surpasses strong closed-data models such as MiMo-VL-7B-RL on V* Bench, CV-Bench and MMStar-V. Perhaps most surprising, despite being entirely vision-centric, our data transfers positively to text-only reasoning (MMLU-Pro) and audio reasoning (MMAU), demonstrating its effectiveness. Similarly, despite not containing videos or embodied visual data, we observe notable gains when evaluating on a single-evidence embodied QA benchmark (NiEH). Finally, we use our data to analyze the entire VLM post-training pipeline. Our empirical analysis highlights that (i) SFT on high-quality data with non-linear reasoning traces is essential for effective online RL, (ii) staged offline RL matches online RL's performance while reducing compute demands, and (iii) careful SFT on high quality data can substantially improve out-of-domain, cross-modality transfer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u9886\u57df\u4f9d\u8d56\u672a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u662f\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u662f\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5305\u542b\u4e30\u5bcc\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03Qwen2.5-VL-7B\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5982MiMo-VL-7B-RL\u3002\u6570\u636e\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\uff08MMLU-Pro\uff09\u548c\u97f3\u9891\u63a8\u7406\uff08MMAU\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6b63\u5411\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5355\u8bc1\u636e\u5177\u8eabQA\u57fa\u51c6\uff08NiEH\uff09\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Recent methods have further improved LLM performance in complex mathematical reasoning. However, when extending these methods beyond the domain of mathematical reasoning to tasks involving complex domain-specific knowledge, we observe a consistent failure of LLMs to generate novel insights during the reflection stage. Instead of conducting genuine cognitive refinement, the model tends to mechanically reiterate earlier reasoning steps without introducing new information or perspectives, a phenomenon referred to as \"Echo Reflection\". We attribute this behavior to two key defects: (1) Uncontrollable information flow during response generation, which allows premature intermediate thoughts to propagate unchecked and distort final decisions; (2) Insufficient exploration of internal knowledge during reflection, leading to repeating earlier findings rather than generating new cognitive insights. Building on these findings, we proposed a novel reinforcement learning method termed Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO). Specifically, the AEPO framework consists of two major components: (1) Reflection-aware Information Filtration, which quantifies the cognitive information flow and prevents the final answer from being affected by earlier bad cognitive information; (2) Adaptive-Entropy Optimization, which dynamically balances exploration and exploitation across different reasoning stages, promoting both reflective diversity and answer correctness.

However, their reliability remains a challenge, especially in long-horizon tasks, since they often produce overconfident yet wrong outputs. Conformal Prediction (CP) has been leveraged to address this issue by wrapping LLM outputs into prediction sets that contain the correct action with a user-defined confidence. When the prediction set is a singleton, the planner executes that action; otherwise, it requests help from a user. This has led to LLM-based planners that can ensure plan correctness with a user-defined probability. However, as LLMs are trained in an uncertainty-agnostic manner, without awareness of prediction sets, they tend to produce unnecessarily large sets, particularly at higher confidence levels, resulting in frequent human interventions limiting autonomous deployment. To address this, we introduce CoFineLLM (Conformal Finetuning for LLMs), the first CP-aware finetuning framework for LLM-based planners that explicitly reduces prediction-set size and, in turn, the need for user interventions. We evaluate our approach on multiple language-instructed robot planning problems and show consistent improvements over uncertainty-aware and uncertainty-agnostic finetuning baselines in terms of prediction-set size, and help rates. Finally, we demonstrate robustness of our method to out-of-distribution scenarios in hardware experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "CoFineLLM \u901a\u8fc7 CP-aware \u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11 LLM \u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u7528\u6237\u5e72\u9884\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3 LLM \u5728\u957f\u65f6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u56e0\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u8f93\u51fa\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f20\u7edf CP \u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u8fc7\u5927\u800c\u9891\u7e41\u4f9d\u8d56\u7528\u6237\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7 Conformal Finetuning for LLMs (CoFineLLM) \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u7528\u6237\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cCoFineLLM \u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u6c42\u52a9\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CoFineLLM \u662f\u4e00\u79cd CP-aware \u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u7528\u6237\u5e72\u9884\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u63d0\u5347 LLM \u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3002"}}

Although foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) demonstrate strong zero-shot and prompt-guided segmentation capabilities, their performance deteriorates substantially when transferred to medical imaging domains. Current adaptation studies mainly emphasize architectural modifications, while the influence of data characteristics and training regimes has not been systematically examined. In this study, we present a comprehensive, data-centric investigation of SAM2 adaptation for ultrasound video segmentation. We analyze how training-set size, video duration, and augmentation schemes affect adaptation performance under three paradigms: task-specific fine-tuning, intermediate adaptation, and multi-task joint training, across five SAM2 variants and multiple prompting modes. We further design six ultrasound-specific augmentations, assessing their effect relative to generic strategies. Experiments on three representative ultrasound datasets reveal that data scale and temporal context play a more decisive role than model architecture or initialization. Moreover, joint training offers an efficient compromise between modality alignment and task specialization.

We propose a cost-efficient multi-agent judging framework that employs Small Language Models (SLMs) through structured debates among critic, defender, and judge agents. To rigorously assess safety judgments, we construct HAJailBench, a large-scale human-annotated jailbreak benchmark comprising 12,000 adversarial interactions across diverse attack methods and target models. The dataset provides fine-grained, expert-labeled ground truth for evaluating both safety robustness and judge reliability. Our SLM-based framework achieves agreement comparable to GPT-4o judges on HAJailBench while substantially reducing inference cost. Ablation results show that three rounds of debate yield the optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency.

To appear in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS), Springer", "summary": "The detection of clinically significant prostate cancer lesions (csPCa) from biparametric magnetic resonance imaging (bp-MRI) has emerged as a noninvasive imaging technique for improving accurate diagnosis. Nevertheless, the analysis of such images remains highly dependent on the subjective expert interpretation. Deep learning approaches have been proposed for csPCa lesions detection and segmentation, but they remain limited due to their reliance on extensively annotated datasets. Moreover, the high lesion variability across prostate zones poses additional challenges, even for expert radiologists. This work introduces a second-order geometric attention (SOGA) mechanism that guides a dedicated segmentation network, through skip connections, to detect csPCa lesions.

However, while the discrete-token CoT reasoning pattern can be reinforced through policy optimization algorithms such as group relative policy optimization (GRPO), extending the soft-thinking pattern with Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the complexities of injecting stochasticity into soft-thinking tokens and updating soft-thinking policies accordingly. As a result, previous attempts to combine soft-thinking with GRPO typically underperform their discrete-token GRPO counterparts. To fully unlock the potential of soft-thinking, this paper presents a novel policy optimization algorithm, SofT-GRPO, to reinforce LLMs under the soft-thinking reasoning pattern. SofT-GRPO injects the Gumbel noise into logits, employs the Gumbel-Softmax technique to avoid soft-thinking tokens outside the pre-trained embedding space, and leverages the reparameterization trick in policy gradient. We conduct experiments across base LLMs ranging from 1.5B to 7B parameters, and results demonstrate that SofT-GRPO enables soft-thinking LLMs to slightly outperform discrete-token GRPO on Pass@1 (+0.13% on average accuracy), while exhibiting a substantial uplift on Pass@32 (+2.19% on average accuracy).

To achieve this, a pervasive paradigm is to leverage the rich vision-semantic priors of large vision-language models (VLMs). However, the fundamental question persists: How do VLAs effectively inherit the prior knowledge from VLMs? To address this critical question, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark, GrinningFace, an emoji tabletop manipulation task where the robot arm is asked to place objects onto printed emojis corresponding to language instructions. This task design is particularly revealing -- knowledge associated with emojis is ubiquitous in Internet-scale datasets used for VLM pre-training, yet emojis themselves are largely absent from standard robotics datasets. Consequently, they provide a clean proxy: successful task completion indicates effective transfer of VLM priors to embodied control. We implement this diagnostic task in both simulated environment and a real robot, and compare various promising techniques for knowledge transfer. Specifically, we investigate the effects of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, VLM freezing, co-training, predicting discretized actions, and predicting latent actions.

However, acquiring GUI data remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often involve designing automated agents that browse URLs from the Common Crawl, using webpage HTML to collect screenshots and corresponding annotations, including the names and bounding boxes of UI elements. However, this method is difficult to apply to desktop software or some newly launched websites not included in the Common Crawl. While we expect the model to possess strong generalization capabilities to handle this, it is still crucial for personalized scenarios that require rapid and perfect adaptation to new software or websites. To address this, we propose an automated data collection method with minimal annotation costs, named Auto-Explorer.

Additionally, to assess the quality of exploration, we have developed the UIXplore benchmark. This benchmark creates environments for explorer agents to discover and save software states. Using the data gathered, we fine-tune a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and establish a GUI element grounding testing set to evaluate the effectiveness of the exploration strategies.

In contrast, soft robotic simulation frameworks remain scarce and are seldom adopted by the soft robotics community. This gap stems partly from the lack of easy-to-use, general-purpose frameworks and partly from the high computational cost of accurately simulating continuum mechanics, which often renders policy learning infeasible. In this work, we demonstrate that rapid soft robot policy learning is indeed achievable via implicit time-stepping. Our simulator of choice, DisMech, is a general-purpose, fully implicit soft-body simulator capable of handling both soft dynamics and frictional contact. We further introduce delta natural curvature control, a method analogous to delta joint position control in rigid manipulators, providing an intuitive and effective means of enacting control for soft robot learning. To highlight the benefits of implicit time-stepping and delta curvature control, we conduct extensive comparisons across four diverse soft manipulator tasks against one of the most widely used soft-body frameworks, Elastica. With implicit time-stepping, parallel stepping of 500 environments achieves up to 6x faster speeds for non-contact cases and up to 40x faster for contact-rich scenarios. Finally, a comprehensive sim-to-sim gap evaluation--training policies in one simulator and evaluating them in another--demonstrates that implicit time-stepping provides a rare free lunch: dramatic speedups achieved without sacrificing accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u8fdb\u548cDelta\u66f2\u7387\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u901f\u5ea6\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528DisMech\u9690\u5f0f\u8f6f\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548cDelta\u81ea\u7136\u66f2\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0eElastica\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u9690\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u8fdb\u5728\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u52a0\u901f6\u500d\uff0c\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u52a0\u901f40\u500d\uff1bDelta\u66f2\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9690\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u8fdb\u548cDelta\u81ea\u7136\u66f2\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Our approach introduces a vision-language covariance cosine loss to directly align image encoder features with inter-class textual semantic relations, encouraging semantically meaningful and modality-invariant feature representations.

This behavior undermines model reliability and poses societal risks.

To address this limitation, we propose MONICA, a novel Monitor-guided Calibration framework that monitors and mitigates sycophancy during model inference at the level of reasoning steps, without requiring the model to finish generating its complete answer. MONICA integrates a sycophantic monitor that provides real-time monitoring of sycophantic drift scores during response generation with a calibrator that dynamically suppresses sycophantic behavior when scores exceed predefined thresholds.

However, there is no current way to tractably and directly exploit the design freedom due to the curse of dimensionality. Parameterisable sets of designs offer a pathway towards tractable, modular soft robotics that appropriately harness the behavioural freeform of soft structures to create rich embodied behaviours. In this work, we present a parametrised class of soft actuators, Programmable Telescopic Soft Pneumatic Actuators (PTSPAs). PTSPAs expand axially on inflation for deployable structures and manipulation in challenging confined spaces. We introduce a parametric geometry generator to customise actuator models from high-level inputs, and explore the new design space through semi-automated experimentation and systematic exploration of key parameters.

EDTR treats each CoT as a vector in high-dimensional space and extracts eight topological risk features capturing the geometric structure of reasoning distributions: tighter, more coherent clusters indicate higher confidence while dispersed, inconsistent paths signal uncertainty. We evaluate EDTR against three state-of-the-art calibration methods across four diverse reasoning benchmarks spanning olympiad-level mathematics (AIME), grade school math (GSM8K), commonsense reasoning, and stock price prediction \\cite{zhang2025aime, cobbe2021training, talmor-etal-2019-commonsenseqa, yahoo_finance}.

We propose Physics-Informed RIG (PI-RIG), which integrates physical constraints directly into the VAE training process through a novel Enhanced Physics-Informed Variational Autoencoder (Enhanced p3-VAE), enabling the generation of physically consistent and achievable goals. Our key innovation is the explicit separation of the latent space into physics variables governing object dynamics and environmental factors capturing visual appearance, while enforcing physical consistency through differential equation constraints and conservation laws. This enables the generation of physically consistent and achievable goals that respect fundamental physical principles such as object permanence, collision constraints, and dynamic feasibility.

While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) effectively capture local features, they struggle with modeling long-range dependencies. Transformers mitigate this issue with self-attention mechanisms but lack the ability to preserve local contextual information. State-of-the-art models primarily follow an encoder-decoder architecture, achieving notable success. However, two key limitations remain: (1) Shallow layers, which are closer to the input, capture fine-grained details but suffer from information loss as data propagates through deeper layers. (2) Inefficient integration of local details and global context between the encoder and decoder stages. To address these challenges, we propose the MACMD-based decoder, which enhances attention mechanisms and facilitates channel mixing between encoder and decoder stages via skip connections. This design leverages hierarchical dilated convolutions, attention-driven modulation, and a cross channel-mixing module to capture long-range dependencies while preserving local contextual details, essential for precise medical image segmentation.

This thesis explores the direction of enhancing agents' zero-shot systematic generalization abilities by granting RL agents reasoning behaviors that are found to help systematic generalization in the human brain. Inspired by human conscious planning behaviors, we first introduced a top-down attention mechanism, which allows a decision-time planning agent to dynamically focus its reasoning on the most relevant aspects of the environmental state given its instantaneous intentions, a process we call \"spatial abstraction\". This approach significantly improves systematic generalization outside the training tasks. Subsequently, building on spatial abstraction, we developed the Skipper framework to automatically decompose complex tasks into simpler, more manageable sub-tasks. Skipper provides robustness against distributional shifts and efficacy in long-term, compositional planning by focusing on pertinent spatial and temporal elements of the environment. Finally, we identified a common failure mode and safety risk in planning agents that rely on generative models to generate state targets during planning. It is revealed that most agents blindly trust the targets they hallucinate, resulting in delusional planning behaviors. Inspired by how the human brain rejects delusional intentions, we propose learning a feasibility evaluator to enable rejecting hallucinated infeasible targets, which led to significant performance improvements in various kinds of planning agents. Finally, we suggest directions for future research, aimed at achieving general task abstraction and fully enabling abstract planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5927\u8111\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u89e3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86RL\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9632\u6b62\u5e7b\u89c9\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RL\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u5927\u8111\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u89e3\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff08\u7a7a\u95f4\u62bd\u8c61\uff09\uff1b2. \u5f00\u53d1Skipper\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u62d2\u7edd\u5e7b\u89c9\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u5916\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u957f\u671f\u7ec4\u5408\u89c4\u5212\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347RL\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u4efb\u52a1\u62bd\u8c61\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u6574\u62bd\u8c61\u89c4\u5212\u3002"}}

Accepted by IROS 2025", "summary": "Efficient, accurate, and flexible relative localization is crucial in air-ground collaborative tasks. However, current approaches for robot relative localization are primarily realized in the form of distributed multi-robot SLAM systems with the same sensor configuration, which are tightly coupled with the state estimation of all robots, limiting both flexibility and accuracy. To this end, we fully leverage the high capacity of Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) to integrate multiple sensors, enabling a semi-distributed cross-modal air-ground relative localization framework. In this work, both the UGV and the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) independently perform SLAM while extracting deep learning-based keypoints and global descriptors, which decouples the relative localization from the state estimation of all agents. The UGV employs a local Bundle Adjustment (BA) with LiDAR, camera, and an IMU to rapidly obtain accurate relative pose estimates. The BA process adopts sparse keypoint optimization and is divided into two stages: First, optimizing camera poses interpolated from LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), followed by estimating the relative camera poses between the UGV and UAV. Additionally, we implement an incremental loop closure detection algorithm using deep learning-based descriptors to maintain and retrieve keyframes efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves outstanding performance in both accuracy and efficiency. Unlike traditional multi-robot SLAM approaches that transmit images or point clouds, our method only transmits keypoint pixels and their descriptors, effectively constraining the communication bandwidth under 0.3 Mbps.

Despite significant progress, designing an accurate and efficient end-to-end text spotter for arbitrary-shaped text remains largely unsolved. We identify the primary bottleneck as the lack of a reliable and efficient text detection method. To address this, we propose a novel parameterized text shape method based on low-rank approximation for precise detection and a triple assignment detection head to enable fast inference. Specifically, unlike other shape representation methods that employ data-irrelevant parameterization, our data-driven approach derives a low-rank subspace directly from labeled text boundaries. To ensure this process is robust against the inherent annotation noise in this data, we utilize a specialized recovery method based on an $\\ell_1$-norm formulation, which accurately reconstructs the text shape with only a few key orthogonal vectors. By exploiting the inherent shape correlation among different text contours, our method achieves consistency and compactness in shape representation. Next, the triple assignment scheme introduces a novel architecture where a deep sparse branch (for stabilized training) is used to guide the learning of an ultra-lightweight sparse branch (for accelerated inference), while a dense branch provides rich parallel supervision. Building upon these advancements, we integrate the enhanced detection module with a lightweight recognition branch to form an end-to-end text spotting framework, termed LRANet++, capable of accurately and efficiently spotting arbitrary-shaped text. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of LRANet++ compared to state-of-the-art methods.

In this setting, edge costs are not fixed but depend on the specific trajectory selected through each convex region, making classical TSP methods inapplicable. We introduce GHOST, a hierarchical framework that optimally solves the GCS-TSP by combining combinatorial tour search with convex trajectory optimization. GHOST systematically explores tours on a complete graph induced by the GCS, using a novel abstract-path-unfolding algorithm to compute admissible lower bounds that guide best-first search at both the high level (over tours) and the low level (over feasible GCS paths realizing the tour).

In contrast, we study object-relation-centric representations as a pathway to more structured, efficient, and explainable visuomotor control. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we introduce LIBERO+, a fine-grained benchmark dataset designed to enable and evaluate object-relation reasoning in robotic manipulation. Unlike prior datasets, LIBERO+ provides object-centric annotations that enrich demonstrations with box- and mask-level labels as well as instance-level temporal tracking, supporting compact and interpretable visuomotor representations. Second, we propose SlotVLA, a slot-attention-based framework that captures both objects and their relations for action decoding. It uses a slot-based visual tokenizer to maintain consistent temporal object representations, a relation-centric decoder to produce task-relevant embeddings, and an LLM-driven module that translates these embeddings into executable actions. Experiments on LIBERO+ demonstrate that object-centric slot and object-relation slot representations drastically reduce the number of required visual tokens, while providing competitive generalization.

Local attention reduces complexity by restricting attention to neighborhoods. Block-sparse kernels can further improve the efficiency of local attention, but conventional local attention patterns often fail to deliver significant speedups because tokens within a window are not contiguous in the 1D sequence. This work proposes a novel method for constructing windows and neighborhoods based on the Hilbert curve. Image tokens are first reordered along a Hilbert curve, and windows and neighborhoods are then formed on the reordered 1D sequence. From a block-sparse perspective, this strategy significantly increases block sparsity and can be combined with existing block-sparse kernels to improve the efficiency of 2D local attention. Experiments show that the proposed Hilbert Window Attention and Hilbert Slide Attention can accelerate window attention and slide attention by about $4\\times$ and $18\\times$, respectively. To assess practicality, the strategy is instantiated as the Hilbert Window Transformer and the Hilbert Neighborhood Transformer, both of which achieve end-to-end speedups with minimal accuracy loss. Overall, combining Hilbert-guided local attention with block-sparse kernels offers a general and practical approach to enhancing the efficiency of 2D local attention for images.

Peak torque or speed specifications tell us little about whether a joint can deliver the right combination of torque, power, and endurance at task-relevant postures and rates. We introduce a comprehensive framework that makes ``human-level'' measurable and comparable across systems. Our approach has three components. First, a kinematic \\emph{DoF atlas} standardizes joint coordinate systems and ranges of motion using ISB-based conventions, ensuring that human and robot joints are compared in the same reference frames. Second, \\emph{Human-Equivalence Envelopes (HEE)} define per-joint requirements by measuring whether a robot meets human torque \\emph{and} power simultaneously at the same joint angle and rate $(q,\u03c9)$, weighted by positive mechanical work in task-specific bands (walking, stairs, lifting, reaching, and hand actions). Third, the \\emph{Human-Level Actuation Score (HLAS)} aggregates six physically grounded factors: workspace coverage (ROM and DoF), HEE coverage, torque-mode bandwidth, efficiency, and thermal sustainability. We provide detailed measurement protocols using dynamometry, electrical power monitoring, and thermal testing that yield every HLAS input from reproducible experiments. A worked example demonstrates HLAS computation for a multi-joint humanoid, showing how the score exposes actuator trade-offs (gearing ratio versus bandwidth and efficiency) that peak-torque specifications obscure.

The existing rPPG model is usually based on the transformer module, which has low computation efficiency. Recently, the Mamba model has garnered increasing attention due to its efficient performance in natural language processing tasks, demonstrating potential as a substitute for transformer-based algorithms. However, the Mambaout model and its variants prove that the SSM module, which is the core component of the Mamba model, is unnecessary for the vision task. Therefore, we hope to prove the feasibility of using the Mambaout-based module to remotely learn the heart rate. Specifically, we propose a novel rPPG algorithm called uncomplicated and enhanced learning capability rPPG (TYrPPG). This paper introduces an innovative gated video understanding block (GVB) designed for efficient analysis of RGB videos. Based on the Mambaout structure, this block integrates 2D-CNN and 3D-CNN to enhance video understanding for analysis. In addition, we propose a comprehensive supervised loss function (CSL) to improve the model's learning capability, along with its weakly supervised variants. The experiments show that our TYrPPG can achieve state-of-the-art performance in commonly used datasets, indicating its prospects and superiority in remote heart rate estimation.

Traditional navigation systems rely on expensive LiDARs that, while geometrically precise, are seman- tically unaware, they cannot distinguish a important document on an office floor from a harmless piece of litter, treating both as physically traversable. While advanced semantic segmentation exists, no prior work has successfully integrated this visual intelligence into a real-time path planner that is efficient enough for low-cost, embedded hardware. This paper presents a frame- work to bridge this gap, delivering context-aware navigation on an affordable robotic platform. Our approach centers on a novel, tight integration of a lightweight perception module with an online A* planner. The perception system employs a semantic segmentation model to identify user-defined visual constraints, enabling the robot to navigate based on contextual importance rather than physical size alone. This adaptability allows an operator to define what is critical for a given task, be it sensitive papers in an office or safety lines in a factory, thus resolving the ambiguity of what to avoid. This semantic perception is seamlessly fused with geometric data. The identified visual constraints are projected as non-geometric obstacles onto a global map that is continuously updated from sensor data, enabling robust navigation through both partially known and unknown environments. We validate our framework through extensive experiments in high-fidelity simulations and on a real-world robotic platform. The results demonstrate robust, real-time performance, proving that a cost- effective robot can safely navigate complex environments while respecting critical visual cues invisible to traditional planners.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u548cA*\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684LiDAR\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u51e0\u4f55\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u91cd\u8981\u7269\u54c1\u4e0e\u65e0\u5bb3\u6742\u7269\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u975e\u51e0\u4f55\u969c\u788d\u7269\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u5730\u56fe\u4e2d\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u7f1d\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u5df2\u77e5\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u5730\u5bfc\u822a\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c0a\u91cd\u4f20\u7edf\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebfA*\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7d27\u5bc6\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u5bfc\u822a\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u5f02\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Handwriting-often disrupted in prodromal AD-provides a non-invasive and cost-effective window into subtle motor and cognitive decline. Existing handwriting-based AD studies, mostly relying on online trajectories and hand-crafted features, have not systematically examined how task type influences diagnostic performance and cross-task generalization. Meanwhile, large-scale vision language models have demonstrated remarkable zero or few-shot anomaly detection in natural images and strong adaptability across medical modalities such as chest X-ray and brain MRI. However, handwriting-based disease detection remains largely unexplored within this paradigm. To close this gap, we introduce a lightweight Cross-Layer Fusion Adapter framework that repurposes CLIP for handwriting-based AD screening. CLFA implants multi-level fusion adapters within the visual encoder to progressively align representations toward handwriting-specific medical cues, enabling prompt-free and efficient zero-shot inference. Using this framework, we systematically investigate cross-task generalization-training on a specific handwriting task and evaluating on unseen ones-to reveal which task types and writing patterns most effectively discriminate AD. Extensive analyses further highlight characteristic stroke patterns and task-level factors that contribute to early AD identification, offering both diagnostic insights and a benchmark for handwriting-based cognitive assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\uff08CLFA\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528CLIP\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b14\u8ff9\u7684\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u7b5b\u67e5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u4e66\u5199\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\uff08AD\uff09\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7b14\u8ff9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u5ec9\u7684\u7a97\u53e3\u6765\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u8870\u9000\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b14\u8ff9\u7684AD\u7814\u7a76\u5c1a\u672a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684Cross-Layer Fusion Adapter\uff08CLFA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u690d\u5165\u591a\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u5c06\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u5230\u7b14\u8ff9\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "CLFA\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b14\u8ff9\u7684AD\u7b5b\u67e5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u4e66\u5199\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bf9AD\u7684\u533a\u5206\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e9\u671fAD\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6027\u7b14\u753b\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u8de8\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff08CLFA\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u65b0\u5229\u7528CLIP\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b14\u8ff9\u7684\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u7b5b\u67e5\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u54ea\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u4e66\u5199\u6a21\u5f0f\u6700\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206AD\u3002"}}

Previous work has attempted to catch these unsafe instances by interrogating models directly about their objectives and behaviors. However, the main weakness of trusting interrogations is that models can lie. We propose self-report fine-tuning (SRFT), a simple supervised fine-tuning technique that trains models to admit their factual mistakes when asked. We show that the admission of factual errors in simple question-answering settings generalizes out-of-distribution (OOD) to the admission of hidden misaligned objectives in adversarial agentic settings. We evaluate SRFT in OOD stealth tasks, where models are instructed to complete a hidden misaligned objective alongside a user-specified objective without being caught by monitoring. After SRFT, models are more likely to confess the details of their hidden objectives when interrogated, even under strong pressure not to disclose them. Interrogation on SRFT models can detect hidden objectives with near-ceiling performance (F1 score = 0.98), while the baseline model lies when interrogated under the same conditions (F1 score = 0). Interrogation on SRFT models can further elicit the content of the hidden objective, recovering 28-100% details, compared to 0% details recovered in the baseline model and by prefilled assistant turn attacks.

Second, we develop enhanced sampling guidance methods that operate on off-the-shelf classifiers without requiring retraining. These include tilted sampling with batch-level reweighting, adaptive entropy-regularized sampling to preserve diversity, and a novel f-divergence-based sampling strategy that strengthens class-consistent guidance while maintaining mode coverage. Experiments on ImageNet 128x128 demonstrate that our divergence-regularized guidance achieves an FID of 2.13 using a ResNet-101 classifier, improving upon existing classifier-guided diffusion methods while requiring no diffusion model retraining.

Despite their strengths, these models often encounter challenges in achieving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Previous works have focused on fine-tuning on specialized mathematical datasets. However, these datasets are typically distilled directly from teacher models, which capture only static reasoning patterns and leaving substantial gaps compared to student models. This reliance on fixed teacher-derived datasets not only restricts the model's ability to adapt to novel or more intricate questions that extend beyond the confines of the training data, but also lacks the iterative depth needed for robust generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose \\textbf{\\method}, a \\textbf{Math}ematical \\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{E}volving framework for MLLMs. In contrast to traditional one-shot fine-tuning paradigms, \\method iteratively refines the model through cycles of inference, reflection, and reward-based feedback. Specifically, we leverage iterative fine-tuning by incorporating correct reasoning paths derived from previous-stage inference and integrating reflections from a specialized Outcome Reward Model (ORM). To verify the effectiveness of \\method, we evaluate it on a suite of challenging benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance gains over backbone models.

Patel"], "title": "CGCE: Classifier-Guided Concept Erasure in Generative Models", "comment": "24 pages, 15 figures", "summary": "Recent advancements in large-scale generative models have enabled the creation of high-quality images and videos, but have also raised significant safety concerns regarding the generation of unsafe content. To mitigate this, concept erasure methods have been developed to remove undesirable concepts from pre-trained models. However, existing methods remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can regenerate the erased content. Moreover, achieving robust erasure often degrades the model's generative quality for safe, unrelated concepts, creating a difficult trade-off between safety and performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Classifier-Guided Concept Erasure (CGCE), an efficient plug-and-play framework that provides robust concept erasure for diverse generative models without altering their original weights. CGCE uses a lightweight classifier operating on text embeddings to first detect and then refine prompts containing undesired concepts. This approach is highly scalable, allowing for multi-concept erasure by aggregating guidance from several classifiers. By modifying only unsafe embeddings at inference time, our method prevents harmful content generation while preserving the model's original quality on benign prompts.

This paper presents Raspi$^2$USBL, an open-source, Raspberry Pi-based passive inverted ultra-short baseline (piUSBL) positioning system designed to provide a low-cost and accessible solution for underwater robotic research. The system comprises a passive acoustic receiver and an active beacon. The receiver adopts a modular hardware architecture that integrates a hydrophone array, a multichannel preamplifier, an oven-controlled crystal oscillator (OCXO), a Raspberry Pi 5, and an MCC-series data acquisition (DAQ) board. Apart from the Pi 5, OCXO, and MCC board, the beacon comprises an impedance-matching network, a power amplifier, and a transmitting transducer. An open-source C++ software framework provides high-precision clock synchronization and triggering for one-way travel-time (OWTT) messaging, while performing real-time signal processing, including matched filtering, array beamforming, and adaptive gain control, to estimate the time of flight (TOF) and direction of arrival (DOA) of received signals. The Raspi$^2$USBL system was experimentally validated in an anechoic tank, freshwater lake, and open-sea trials. Results demonstrate a slant-range accuracy better than 0.1%, a bearing accuracy within 0.1$^\\circ$, and stable performance over operational distances up to 1.3 km. These findings confirm that low-cost, reproducible hardware can deliver research-grade underwater positioning accuracy. By releasing both the hardware and software as open-source, Raspi$^2$USBL provides a unified reference platform that lowers the entry barrier for underwater robotics laboratories, fosters reproducibility, and promotes collaborative innovation in underwater acoustic navigation and swarm robotics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Raspi$^2$USBL \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e Raspberry Pi \u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6c34\u4e0b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u659c\u8ddd\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f18\u4e8e 0.1%\uff0c\u65b9\u4f4d\u89d2\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5728 0.1$^\\circ$ \u4ee5\u5185\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6c34\u4e0b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u56e0\u65e0\u6cd5\u63a5\u6536 GNSS \u4fe1\u53f7\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4e14\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u786c\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6c34\u542c\u5668\u9635\u5217\u3001\u591a\u901a\u9053\u524d\u7f6e\u653e\u5927\u5668\u3001OCXO\u3001Raspberry Pi 5 \u548c MCC DAQ \u677f\uff1b\u5f00\u6e90 C++ \u8f6f\u4ef6\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65f6\u949f\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\uff08\u5982\u5339\u914d\u6ee4\u6ce2\u3001\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u589e\u76ca\u63a7\u5236\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6d88\u58f0\u6c34\u6c60\u3001\u6de1\u6c34\u6e56\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u6d77\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff1a\u659c\u8ddd\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f18\u4e8e 0.1%\uff0c\u65b9\u4f4d\u89d2\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5728 0.1$^\\circ$ \u4ee5\u5185\uff0c\u4e14\u64cd\u4f5c\u8ddd\u79bb\u53ef\u8fbe 1.3 \u516c\u91cc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u6e90\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff0cRaspi$^2$USBL \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u6c34\u4e0b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6c34\u4e0b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u534f\u4f5c\u521b\u65b0\u3002"}}

The sensor pixels under each micro-lens receive light from a sub-aperture of the main lens. This enables the image sensor to capture both spatial information and the angular resolution of a scene point. This additional angular information is used to estimate the depth of a 3-D scene. The continuum of virtual viewpoints in light field data enables efficient depth estimation using Epipolar Line Images (EPIs) with robust occlusion handling. However, the trade-off between angular information and spatial information is very critical and depends on the focal position of the camera. To design, develop, implement, and test novel disparity-based light field depth estimation algorithms, the availability of suitable light field image datasets is essential. In this paper, a publicly available light field image dataset is introduced and thoroughly described. We have also demonstrated the effect of focal position on the disparity of a 3-D point as well as the shortcomings of the currently available light field dataset. The proposed dataset contains 285 light field images captured using a Lytro Illum LF camera and 13 synthetic LF images. The proposed dataset also comprises a synthetic dataset with similar disparity characteristics to those of a real light field camera.

Teaching Emotion Recognition with Prompts, Retrieval, and Curriculum Learning", "comment": "Accepted at AAAI 2026", "summary": "Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) is a crucial task for understanding human emotions and enabling natural human-computer interaction. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown great potential in this field, their ability to capture the intrinsic connections between explicit and implicit emotions remains limited. We propose a novel ERC training framework, PRC-Emo, which integrates Prompt engineering, demonstration Retrieval, and Curriculum learning, with the goal of exploring whether LLMs can effectively perceive emotions in conversational contexts. Specifically, we design emotion-sensitive prompt templates based on both explicit and implicit emotional cues to better guide the model in understanding the speaker's psychological states.

To address this limitation, we present a novel Mixture of Ego-Graphs Contrastive Representation Learning (MoEGCL). It mainly consists of two modules.

Additionally, we present the Ego Graph Contrastive Learning (EGCL) module to align the fused representation with the view-specific representation. The EGCL module enhances the representation similarity of samples from the same cluster, not merely from the same sample, further boosting fine-grained graph representation.

Analogous to how perceived facial age reflects an individual's health, the visual appearance of a city serves as its ``portrait\", encapsulating latent socio-economic and environmental characteristics. Recent studies have explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate textual knowledge into imagery-based urban region representation learning. However, two major challenges remain: i)~difficulty in aligning fine-grained visual features with long captions, and ii) suboptimal knowledge incorporation due to noise in LLM-generated captions. To address these issues, we propose a novel pre-training framework called UrbanLN that improves Urban region representation learning through Long-text awareness and Noise suppression. Specifically, we introduce an information-preserved stretching interpolation strategy that aligns long captions with fine-grained visual semantics in complex urban scenes. To effectively mine knowledge from LLM-generated captions and filter out noise, we propose a dual-level optimization strategy. At the data level, a multi-model collaboration pipeline automatically generates diverse and reliable captions without human intervention.

Factors such as tire characteristics, road surface conditions, aerodynamic disturbances, and vehicle load make it infeasible to model real-world dynamics accurately, which hinders direct transfer of RL agents trained in simulation. In this paper, we present a framework that decouples motion planning from vehicle control through a spatial and temporal alignment strategy between a virtual vehicle and the real system. An RL agent is first trained in simulation using a kinematic bicycle model to output continuous control actions. Its behavior is then distilled into a trajectory-predicting agent that generates finite-horizon ego-vehicle trajectories, enabling synchronization between virtual and real vehicles. At deployment, a Stanley controller governs lateral dynamics, while longitudinal alignment is maintained through adaptive update mechanisms that compensate for deviations between virtual and real trajectories.

While deep learning methods have shown promise in SAR despeckling, most methods employ a single unified network to process the entire image, failing to account for the distinct speckle statistics associated with different spatial physical characteristics. It often leads to artifacts, blurred edges, and texture distortion. To address these issues, we propose SAR-FAH, a frequency-adaptive heterogeneous despeckling model based on a divide-and-conquer architecture. First, wavelet decomposition is used to separate the image into frequency sub-bands carrying different intrinsic characteristics. Inspired by their differing noise characteristics, we design specialized sub-networks for different frequency components. The tailored approach leverages statistical variations across frequencies, improving edge and texture preservation while suppressing noise. Specifically, for the low-frequency part, denoising is formulated as a continuous dynamic system via neural ordinary differential equations, ensuring structural fidelity and sufficient smoothness that prevents artifacts. For high-frequency sub-bands rich in edges and textures, we introduce an enhanced U-Net with deformable convolutions for noise suppression and enhanced features.

To address these challenges, we introduce RedOne 2.0, an SNS-oriented LLM trained with a progressive, RL-prioritized post-training paradigm designed for rapid and stable adaptation. The pipeline consist in three stages: (1) Exploratory Learning on curated SNS corpora to establish initial alignment and identify systematic weaknesses; (2) Targeted Fine-Tuning that selectively applies SFT to the diagnosed gaps while mixing a small fraction of general data to mitigate forgetting; and (3) Refinement Learning that re-applies RL with SNS-centric signals to consolidate improvements and harmonize trade-offs across tasks.

By situating LLM reasoning within these formal structures, the approach transforms opaque inference into transparent and auditable decision traces.

Extended version of a paper presented at the Hamlyn Symposium for Medical Robotics, 2025", "summary": "Diagnostic medical ultrasound is widely used, safe, and relatively low cost but requires a high degree of expertise to acquire and interpret the images. Personnel with this expertise are often not available outside of larger cities, leading to difficult, costly travel and long wait times for rural populations. To address this issue, tele-ultrasound techniques are being developed, including robotic teleoperation and recently human teleoperation, in which a novice user is remotely guided in a hand-over-hand manner through mixed reality to perform an ultrasound exam. These methods have not been compared, and their relative strengths are unknown. Human teleoperation may be more practical than robotics for small communities due to its lower cost and complexity, but this is only relevant if the performance is comparable. This paper therefore evaluates the differences between human and robotic teleoperation, examining practical aspects such as setup time and flexibility and experimentally comparing performance metrics such as completion time, position tracking, and force consistency. It is found that human teleoperation does not lead to statistically significant differences in completion time or position accuracy, with mean differences of 1.8% and 0.5%, respectively, and provides more consistent force application despite being substantially more practical and accessible.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u9065\u63a7\u8d85\u58f0\u64cd\u4f5c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u66f4\u5177\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u504f\u8fdc\u5730\u533a\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u4e1a\u8d85\u58f0\u6280\u672f\u4eba\u5458\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u548c\u957f\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u7c7b\u9065\u63a7\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9065\u63a7\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8ffd\u8e2a\u548c\u529b\u91cf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u9065\u63a7\u64cd\u4f5c\u5728\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u5dee\u5f02\u5fae\u5c0f\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u5dee\u5f02\u5206\u522b\u4e3a1.8%\u548c0.5%\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u529b\u91cf\u5e94\u7528\u66f4\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u9065\u63a7\u64cd\u4f5c\u5728\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9065\u63a7\u64cd\u4f5c\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e3a\u5b9e\u7528\u548c\u6613\u83b7\u53d6\u3002"}}

Our method integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with retrieval-based reasoning to support multimodal exploration and language-guided interaction. The framework comprises two key components: (1) a dynamic scene graph generation module that detects objects and infers semantic relationships without fixed label sets, and (2) a retrieval-augmented reasoning pipeline that encodes scene graphs into a vector database to support text/image-conditioned queries. We evaluate our method on 3DSSG and Replica benchmarks across four tasks-scene question answering, visual grounding, instance retrieval, and task planning-demonstrating robust generalization and superior performance in diverse environments.

This has led to incremental improvements without a deep understanding of the current failures. While it is straightforward to look at situations where the model fails, it is hard to understand the underlying reason. This motivates us to conduct a systematic study, where inputs to the model are perturbed and the predictions observed. We introduce PlanT 2.0, a lightweight, object-centric planning transformer designed for autonomous driving research in CARLA. The object-level representation enables controlled analysis, as the input can be easily perturbed (e.g., by changing the location or adding or removing certain objects), in contrast to sensor-based models. To tackle the scenarios newly introduced by the challenging CARLA Leaderboard 2.0, we introduce multiple upgrades to PlanT, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Longest6 v2, Bench2Drive, and the CARLA validation routes. Our analysis exposes insightful failures, such as a lack of scene understanding caused by low obstacle diversity, rigid expert behaviors leading to exploitable shortcuts, and overfitting to a fixed set of expert trajectories. Based on these findings, we argue for a shift toward data-centric development, with a focus on richer, more robust, and less biased datasets.

To address these challenges, we propose Gradient-Aware Balanced Feature Fusion (GABFusion), which dynamically balances gradient magnitudes and fuses task-specific features in a quantization-friendly manner. We further introduce Attention Distribution Alignment (ADA), a feature-level distillation strategy tailored for quantized models. Our method demonstrates strong generalization across network architectures and QAT algorithms, with theoretical guarantees on gradient bias reduction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our strategy consistently enhances a variety of QAT methods across different network architectures and bit-widths. On PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets, the proposed approach achieves average mAP improvements of approximately 3.3% and 1.6%, respectively. When applied to YOLOv5 under 4-bit quantization, our method narrows the accuracy gap with the full-precision model to only 1.7% on VOC, showcasing its effectiveness in preserving performance under low-bit constraints.

Existing analyses are insufficiently comprehensive and lack examination covering visual and textual tokens, model components, and the full range of layers. This limitation restricts actionable insights to improve the faithfulness of model output and the development of downstream tasks, such as hallucination mitigation. To address this limitation, we introduce Fine-grained Cross-modal Causal Tracing (FCCT) framework, which systematically quantifies the causal effects on visual object perception. FCCT conducts fine-grained analysis covering the full range of visual and textual tokens, three core model components including multi-head self-attention (MHSA), feed-forward networks (FFNs), and hidden states, across all decoder layers. Our analysis is the first to demonstrate that MHSAs of the last token in middle layers play a critical role in aggregating cross-modal information, while FFNs exhibit a three-stage hierarchical progression for the storage and transfer of visual object representations. Building on these insights, we propose Intermediate Representation Injection (IRI), a training-free inference-time technique that reinforces visual object information flow by precisely intervening on cross-modal representations at specific components and layers, thereby enhancing perception and mitigating hallucination. Consistent improvements across five widely used benchmarks and LVLMs demonstrate IRI achieves state-of-the-art performance, while preserving inference speed and other foundational performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "FCCT \u6846\u67b6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790 LVLMs \u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u63ed\u793a MHSA \u548c FFNs \u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 IRI \u6280\u672f\u901a\u8fc7\u5e72\u9884\u7279\u5b9a\u5c42\u548c\u7ec4\u4ef6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u7684\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5e7b\u89c9\u7f13\u89e3\uff09\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 Fine-grained Cross-modal Causal Tracing (FCCT) \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u91cf\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u8c61\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6807\u8bb0\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08MHSA\u3001FFNs\u3001\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\uff09\u53ca\u6240\u6709\u89e3\u7801\u5c42\u3002", "result": "FCCT \u5206\u6790\u9996\u6b21\u8bc1\u660e MHSA \u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u7684\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u5bf9\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u805a\u5408\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u800c FFNs \u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u8c61\u8868\u793a\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u5c42\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002IRI \u6280\u672f\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Intermediate Representation Injection (IRI) \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u5c42\u7cbe\u786e\u5e72\u9884\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u8c61\u611f\u77e5\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

In a nutshell, the idea is to assign each interpretation a cost based upon the weights of the violated axioms and assertions, and certain and possible query answers are determined by considering all (resp. some) interpretations having optimal or bounded cost. Whereas the initial study of cost-based semantics focused on DLs between $\\mathcal{EL}_\\bot$ and $\\mathcal{ALCO}$, we consider DLs that may contain inverse roles and role inclusions, thus covering prominent DL-Lite dialects. Our data complexity analysis goes significantly beyond existing results by sharpening several lower bounds and pinpointing the precise complexity of optimal-cost certain answer semantics (no non-trivial upper bound was known). Moreover, while all existing results show the intractability of cost-based semantics, our most challenging and surprising result establishes that if we consider $\\text{DL-Lite}^\\mathcal{H}_\\mathsf{bool}$ ontologies and a fixed cost bound, certain answers for instance queries and possible answers for conjunctive queries can be computed using first-order rewriting and thus enjoy the lowest possible data complexity ($\\mathsf{TC}_0$).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u52a0\u6743\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u7684\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u67e5\u8be2\u7b54\u6848\u53ef\u5177\u6709\u6700\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff08TC_0\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u52a0\u6743\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5bf9DL-Lite\u65b9\u8a00\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u914d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89e3\u91ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fdd\u53cd\u516c\u7406\u548c\u65ad\u8a00\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u6240\u6709\uff08\u6216\u90e8\u5206\uff09\u5177\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u6216\u6709\u754c\u6210\u672c\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u67e5\u8be2\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u7cbe\u786e\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u6210\u672c\u786e\u5b9a\u7b54\u6848\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u67e5\u8be2\u7b54\u6848\u5177\u6709\u6700\u4f4e\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8eDL-Lite^H_bool\u672c\u4f53\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u6210\u672c\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u7b54\u6848\u548c\u8054\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u7b54\u6848\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u9636\u91cd\u5199\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6700\u4f4e\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff08TC_0\uff09\u3002"}}

However, the high cost of tactile data collection makes sample efficiency the key requirement for developing visuotactile policies. We present EquiTac, a framework that exploits the inherent SO(2) symmetry of in-hand object rotation to improve sample efficiency and generalization for visuotactile policy learning. EquiTac first reconstructs surface normals from raw RGB inputs of vision-based tactile sensors, so rotations of the normal vector field correspond to in-hand object rotations. An SO(2)-equivariant network then predicts a residual rotation action that augments a base visuomotor policy at test time, enabling real-time rotation correction without additional reorientation demonstrations. On a real robot, EquiTac accurately achieves robust zero-shot generalization to unseen in-hand orientations with very few training samples, where baselines fail even with more training data.

We address the dual objective of improving automation efficiency while providing measurable environmental performance in document-intensive workflows. The research compares three scenarios: fully manual (human-only), AI-assisted (human-in-the-loop, HITL), and an advanced multi-agent agentic AI workflow leveraging parsers and verifiers. Empirical results show that AI-assisted HITL and agentic AI scenarios achieve reductions of up to 70-90% in energy consumption, 90-97% in carbon dioxide emissions, and 89-98% in water usage compared to manual processes.

Maintaining stability is thus a primary safety focus in robot control and learning, yet no existing approach fully averts loss of balance. When instability does occur, prior work addresses only isolated aspects of falling: avoiding falls, choreographing a controlled descent, or standing up afterward. Consequently, humanoid robots lack integrated strategies for impact mitigation and prompt recovery when real falls defy these scripts. We aim to go beyond keeping balance to make the entire fall-and-recovery process safe and autonomous: prevent falls when possible, reduce impact when unavoidable, and stand up when fallen. By fusing sparse human demonstrations with reinforcement learning and an adaptive diffusion-based memory of safe reactions, we learn adaptive whole-body behaviors that unify fall prevention, impact mitigation, and rapid recovery in one policy. Experiments in simulation and on a Unitree G1 demonstrate robust sim-to-real transfer, lower impact forces, and consistently fast recovery across diverse disturbances, pointing towards safer, more resilient humanoids in real environments.

Recent generative modeling approaches have attempted to capture progression by mapping images into a latent representational space and then controlling and guiding the representations to generate follow-up images from a baseline image. However, existing approaches impose constraints on distribution learning, leading to latent spaces with limited controllability to generate follow-up images without explicit supervision from subject-specific longitudinal images. In order to enable controlled movements in the latent representational space and generate progression images from a baseline image in an unsupervised manner, we introduce a conditionable Diffusion Auto-encoder framework. The explicit encoding mechanism of image-diffusion auto-encoders forms a compact latent space capturing high-level semantics, providing means to disentangle information relevant for progression. Our approach leverages this latent space to condition and apply controlled shifts to baseline representations for generating follow-up. Controllability is induced by restricting these shifts to a subspace, thereby isolating progression-related factors from subject identity-preserving components. The shifts are implicitly guided by correlating with progression attributes, without requiring subject-specific longitudinal supervision. We validate the generations through image quality metrics, volumetric progression analysis, and downstream classification in Alzheimer's disease datasets from two different sources and disease categories. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach for Alzheimer's progression modeling and longitudinal image generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u7eb5\u5411\u8fdb\u5c55\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u8fdb\u5c55\u76f8\u5173\u56e0\u7d20\u4e0e\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u7559\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u7eb5\u5411\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u6765\u6e90\u548c\u75be\u75c5\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u3001\u4f53\u79ef\u8fdb\u5c55\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u7c7b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the practical deployment of existing methods is hindered by two key challenges: the prohibitive computational cost of over-parameterized models and the suboptimal performance of conventional loss functions on the highly skewed distribution of urban flows. To address these challenges, we propose a unified solution that synergizes architectural efficiency with adaptive optimization. Specifically, we first introduce PLGF, a lightweight yet powerful architecture that employs a Progressive Local-Global Fusion strategy to effectively capture both fine-grained details and global contextual dependencies. Second, we propose DualFocal Loss, a novel function that integrates dual-space supervision with a difficulty-aware focusing mechanism, enabling the model to adaptively concentrate on hard-to-predict regions. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world scenarios validate the effectiveness and scalability of our method. Notably, while achieving state-of-the-art performance, PLGF reduces the model size by up to 97% compared to current high-performing methods. Furthermore, under comparable parameter budgets, our model yields an accuracy improvement of over 10% against strong baselines.

Existing OVSGG methods always adopt a two-stage pipeline: 1) \\textit{Infusing knowledge} into large-scale models via pre-training on large datasets; 2) \\textit{Transferring knowledge} from pre-trained models with fully annotated scene graphs during supervised fine-tuning. However, due to a lack of explicit interaction modeling, these methods struggle to distinguish between interacting and non-interacting instances of the same object category. This limitation induces critical issues in both stages of OVSGG: it generates noisy pseudo-supervision from mismatched objects during knowledge infusion, and causes ambiguous query matching during knowledge transfer. To this end, in this paper, we propose an inter\\textbf{AC}tion-\\textbf{C}entric end-to-end OVSGG framework (\\textbf{ACC}) in an interaction-driven paradigm to minimize these mismatches. For \\textit{interaction-centric knowledge infusion}, ACC employs a bidirectional interaction prompt for robust pseudo-supervision generation to enhance the model's interaction knowledge. For \\textit{interaction-centric knowledge transfer}, ACC first adopts interaction-guided query selection that prioritizes pairing interacting objects to reduce interference from non-interacting ones. Then, it integrates interaction-consistent knowledge distillation to bolster robustness by pushing relational foreground away from the background while retaining general knowledge.

While there are extensive researches on detecting model generated text, we find that these existing methods are not applicable to time series data due to the fundamental modality difference, as time series usually have lower information density and smoother probability distributions than text data, which limit the discriminative power of token-based detectors. To address this issue, we examine the subtle distributional differences between real and model-generated time series and propose the contraction hypothesis, which states that model-generated time series, unlike real ones, exhibit progressively decreasing uncertainty under recursive forecasting. We formally prove this hypothesis under theoretical assumptions on model behavior and time series structure. Model-generated time series exhibit progressively concentrated distributions under recursive forecasting, leading to uncertainty contraction. We provide empirical validation of the hypothesis across diverse datasets. Building on this insight, we introduce the Uncertainty Contraction Estimator (UCE), a white-box detector that aggregates uncertainty metrics over successive prefixes to identify TSLM-generated time series.

PhysWorld addresses this limitation by coupling video generation with physical world reconstruction. Given a single image and a task command, our method generates task-conditioned videos and reconstructs the underlying physical world from the videos, and the generated video motions are grounded into physically accurate actions through object-centric residual reinforcement learning with the physical world model. This synergy transforms implicit visual guidance into physically executable robotic trajectories, eliminating the need for real robot data collection and enabling zero-shot generalizable robotic manipulation.

Although facial expression recognition algorithms demonstrate impressive performance on high-resolution images, their effectiveness tends to degrade when confronted with low-resolution images. We find it is because: 1) low-resolution images lack detail information; 2) current methods complete weak global modeling, which make it difficult to extract discriminative features. To alleviate the above issues, we proposed a novel global multiple extraction network (GME-Net) for low-resolution facial expression recognition, which incorporates 1) a hybrid attention-based local feature extraction module with attention similarity knowledge distillation to learn image details from high-resolution network; 2) a multi-scale global feature extraction module with quasi-symmetric structure to mitigate the influence of local image noise and facilitate capturing global image features. As a result, our GME-Net is capable of extracting expression-related discriminative features.

Current alignment efforts primarily target explicit risks such as bias, hate speech, and violence. However, they often fail to address deeper, domain-specific implicit risks and lack a flexible, generalizable framework applicable across diverse specialized fields. Hence, we proposed MENTOR: A MEtacognition-driveN self-evoluTion framework for uncOvering and mitigating implicit Risks in LLMs on Domain Tasks. To address the limitations of labor-intensive human evaluation, we introduce a novel metacognitive self-assessment tool. This enables LLMs to reflect on potential value misalignments in their responses using strategies like perspective-taking and consequential thinking. We also release a supporting dataset of 9,000 risk queries spanning education, finance, and management to enhance domain-specific risk identification. Subsequently, based on the outcomes of metacognitive reflection, the framework dynamically generates supplementary rule knowledge graphs that extend predefined static rule trees. This enables models to actively apply validated rules to future similar challenges, establishing a continuous self-evolution cycle that enhances generalization by reducing maintenance costs and inflexibility of static systems. Finally, we employ activation steering during inference to guide LLMs in following the rules, a cost-effective method to robustly enhance enforcement across diverse contexts. Experimental results show MENTOR's effectiveness: In defensive testing across three vertical domains, the framework substantially reduces semantic attack success rates, enabling a new level of implicit risk mitigation for LLMs. Furthermore, metacognitive assessment not only aligns closely with baseline human evaluators but also delivers more thorough and insightful analysis of LLMs value alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "MENTOR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5219\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3LLMs\u5728\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u663e\u6027\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u3002MENTOR\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89d2\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u601d\u8003\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u8865\u5145\u89c4\u5219\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMENTOR\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u5206\u6790\u66f4\u4e3a\u6df1\u5165\u3002", "conclusion": "MENTOR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5219\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

This non-invasive method has gained traction across diverse domains, including telemedicine, affective computing, driver fatigue detection, and health monitoring, owing to its scalability and convenience. Despite significant progress in remote physiological signal measurement, a crucial characteristic - the intrinsic periodicity - has often been underexplored or insufficiently modeled in previous approaches, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained temporal dynamics under real-world conditions. To bridge this gap, we propose Reperio-rPPG, a novel framework that strategically integrates Relational Convolutional Networks with a Graph Transformer to effectively capture the periodic structure inherent in physiological signals. Additionally, recognizing the limited diversity of existing rPPG datasets, we further introduce a tailored CutMix augmentation to enhance the model's generalizability. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely used benchmark datasets - PURE, UBFC-rPPG, and MMPD - demonstrate that Reperio-rPPG not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also exhibits remarkable robustness under various motion (e.g., stationary, rotation, talking, walking) and illumination conditions (e.g., nature, low LED, high LED).

The input signals, grouped by predicted class, are clustered under three distinct configurations. The centroids of the final set of clusters are provided as input to an LLM for symbolic approximation and fuzzy knowledge graph matching to discover the underlying subclasses of the original multiclass problem.

In this work, we investigate how contextual cues combined with visual scene and facial information can be effectively utilized to predict and interpret social gaze patterns during conversational interactions. We introduce CSGaze, a context aware multimodal approach that leverages facial, scene information as complementary inputs to enhance social gaze pattern prediction from multi-person images. The model also incorporates a fine-grained attention mechanism centered on the principal speaker, which helps in better modeling social gaze dynamics. Experimental results show that CSGaze performs competitively with state-of-the-art methods on GP-Static, UCO-LAEO and AVA-LAEO.

The core challenge of AHT is to develop an ego agent that can predict and adapt to unknown teammates on the fly. Conventional RL-based approaches optimize a single expected return, which often causes policies to collapse into a single dominant behavior, thus failing to capture the multimodal cooperation patterns inherent in AHT. In this work, we introduce PADiff, a diffusion-based approach that captures agent's multimodal behaviors, unlocking its diverse cooperation modes with teammates. However, standard diffusion models lack the ability to predict and adapt in highly non-stationary AHT scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel diffusion-based policy that integrates critical predictive information about teammates into the denoising process. Extensive experiments across three cooperation environments demonstrate that PADiff outperforms existing AHT methods significantly.", "AI": {"tldr": "PADiff\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u961f\u53cb\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u591a\u5408\u4f5c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u5355\u4e00\u9884\u671f\u56de\u62a5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b56\u7565\u9677\u5165\u5355\u4e00\u4e3b\u5bfc\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349AHT\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5408\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b56\u7565PADiff\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u961f\u53cb\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u5408\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPADiff\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684AHT\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PADiff\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u961f\u53cb\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\u5230\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u975e\u7a33\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5408\u4f5c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709AHT\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The framework integrates structured debate, retrieval-augmented method memory, and ensemble-guided evolutionary search, enabling the agents to generate and assess new hypotheses about architectures and optimization procedures. Across physics-informed learning and operator learning tasks, the framework discovers solution methods that outperform single-agent and human-designed baselines by up to four orders of magnitude in error reduction.

In few-shot settings, insufficient training samples often fail to cover the diverse patterns present in test samples. This challenge can be mitigated by extracting structural commonality from a small number of training samples. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot unsupervised multimodal industrial anomaly detection method based on structural commonality, CIF (Commonality In Few). To extract intra-class structural information, we employ hypergraphs, which are capable of modeling higher-order correlations, to capture the structural commonality within training samples, and use a memory bank to store this intra-class structural prior. Firstly, we design a semantic-aware hypergraph construction module tailored for single-semantic industrial images, from which we extract common structures to guide the construction of the memory bank. Secondly, we use a training-free hypergraph message passing module to update the visual features of test samples, reducing the distribution gap between test features and features in the memory bank. We further propose a hyperedge-guided memory search module, which utilizes structural information to assist the memory search process and reduce the false positive rate. Experimental results on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset and the Eyecandies dataset show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in few-shot settings.

While prior work has focused on detection accuracy, it overlooks the importance of helping users understand the reasoning behind factual judgments and develop future resilience. The debate transcripts generated during MAD offer a rich but underutilized resource for transparent reasoning. In this study, we introduce ED2D, an evidence-based MAD framework that extends previous approach by incorporating factual evidence retrieval. More importantly, ED2D is designed not only as a detection framework but also as a persuasive multi-agent system aimed at correcting user beliefs and discouraging misinformation sharing. We compare the persuasive effects of ED2D-generated debunking transcripts with those authored by human experts. Results demonstrate that ED2D outperforms existing baselines across three misinformation detection benchmarks. When ED2D generates correct predictions, its debunking transcripts exhibit persuasive effects comparable to those of human experts; However, when ED2D misclassifies, its accompanying explanations may inadvertently reinforce users'misconceptions, even when presented alongside accurate human explanations.

Artificial intelligence may aid in pre-screening. Purpose: To evaluate the DINOv2-based Medical Slice Transformer (MST) for ruling out significant findings (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System [BI-RADS] >=4) in contrast-enhanced and non-contrast-enhanced abbreviated breast MRI. Materials and Methods: This institutional review board approved retrospective study included 1,847 single-breast MRI examinations (377 BI-RADS >=4) from an in-house dataset and 924 from an external validation dataset (Duke). Four abbreviated protocols were tested: T1-weighted early subtraction (T1sub), diffusion-weighted imaging with b=1500 s/mm2 (DWI1500), DWI1500+T2-weighted (T2w), and T1sub+T2w. Performance was assessed at 90%, 95%, and 97.5% sensitivity using five-fold cross-validation and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. AUC differences were compared with the DeLong test. False negatives were characterized, and attention maps of true positives were rated in the external dataset. Results: A total of 1,448 female patients (mean age, 49 +/- 12 years) were included. T1sub+T2w achieved an AUC of 0.77 +/- 0.04; DWI1500+T2w, 0.74 +/- 0.04 (p=0.15). At 97.5% sensitivity, T1sub+T2w had the highest specificity (19% +/- 7%), followed by DWI1500+T2w (17% +/- 11%). Missed lesions had a mean diameter <10 mm at 95% and 97.5% thresholds for both T1sub and DWI1500, predominantly non-mass enhancements.

However, existing approaches rely on a mono-contextual paradigm that accumulates all information in a single, expanding context window, leading to context suffocation and noise contamination that limit their effectiveness on long-horizon tasks. We introduce IterResearch, a novel iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates long-horizon research as a Markov Decision Process with strategic workspace reconstruction. By maintaining an evolving report as memory and periodically synthesizing insights, our approach preserves consistent reasoning capacity across arbitrary exploration depths. We further develop Efficiency-Aware Policy Optimization (EAPO), a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes efficient exploration through geometric reward discounting and enables stable distributed training via adaptive downsampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IterResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing open-source agents with average +14.5pp across six benchmarks and narrows the gap with frontier proprietary systems. Remarkably, our paradigm exhibits unprecedented interaction scaling, extending to 2048 interactions with dramatic performance gains (from 3.5\\% to 42.5\\%), and serves as an effective prompting strategy, improving frontier models by up to 19.2pp over ReAct on long-horizon tasks.

To address these challenges, we propose the DiA-gnostic VLVAE, which achieves robust radiology reporting through Disentangled Alignment. Our framework is designed to be resilient to missing modalities by disentangling shared and modality-specific features using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) based Vision-Language Variational Autoencoder (VLVAE). A constrained optimization objective enforces orthogonality and alignment between these latent representations to prevent suboptimal fusion. A compact LLaMA-X decoder then uses these disentangled representations to generate reports efficiently.

However, most existing synthetic personas remain shallow and simplistic, capturing minimal attributes and failing to reflect the rich complexity and diversity of real human identities. We introduce DEEPPERSONA, a scalable generative engine for synthesizing narrative-complete synthetic personas through a two-stage, taxonomy-guided method. First, we algorithmically construct the largest-ever human-attribute taxonomy, comprising over hundreds of hierarchically organized attributes, by mining thousands of real user-ChatGPT conversations. Second, we progressively sample attributes from this taxonomy, conditionally generating coherent and realistic personas that average hundreds of structured attributes and roughly 1 MB of narrative text, two orders of magnitude deeper than prior works. Intrinsic evaluations confirm significant improvements in attribute diversity (32 percent higher coverage) and profile uniqueness (44 percent greater) compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

One of the main challenges is to stitch together multiple images into a single high-resolution image that covers a large area. Featurebased image stitching algorithms are commonly used but can suffer from errors and ambiguities in feature detection and matching. To address this, several approaches have been proposed, including using bundle adjustment techniques or direct image alignment. In this paper, we present a novel method that uses a combination of IMU data and computer vision techniques for stitching images captured by a UAV. Our method involves several steps such as estimating the displacement and rotation of the UAV between consecutive images, correcting for perspective distortion, and computing a homography matrix. We then use a standard image stitching algorithm to align and blend the images together. Our proposed method leverages the additional information provided by the IMU data, corrects for various sources of distortion, and can be easily integrated into existing UAV workflows. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, outperforming some of the existing feature-based image stitching algorithms in terms of accuracy and reliability, particularly in challenging scenarios such as large displacements, rotations, and variations in camera pose.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408IMU\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u6280\u672f\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u62fc\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u62fc\u63a5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u822a\u62cd\u548c\u9065\u611f\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u62fc\u63a5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5339\u914d\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408IMU\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u62fc\u63a5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408IMU\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u6280\u672f\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f30\u8ba1\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u56fe\u50cf\u95f4\u7684\u4f4d\u79fb\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u6821\u6b63\u900f\u89c6\u7578\u53d8\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5355\u5e94\u6027\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u56fe\u50cf\u62fc\u63a5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u62fc\u63a5\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5927\u4f4d\u79fb\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ed3\u5408IMU\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u6280\u672f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u62fc\u63a5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u62fc\u63a5\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While recent transformer-based approaches like TULIP show promise, they remain limited to spatial-domain processing with restricted receptive fields. We introduce FLASH (Frequency-aware LiDAR Adaptive Super-resolution with Hierarchical fusion), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations through dual-domain processing. FLASH integrates two key innovations: (i) Frequency-Aware Window Attention that combines local spatial attention with global frequency-domain analysis via FFT, capturing both fine-grained geometry and periodic scanning patterns at log-linear complexity. (ii) Adaptive Multi-Scale Fusion that replaces conventional skip connections with learned position-specific feature aggregation, enhanced by CBAM attention for dynamic feature selection. Extensive experiments on KITTI demonstrate that FLASH achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics, surpassing even uncertainty-enhanced baselines that require multiple forward passes. Notably, FLASH outperforms TULIP with Monte Carlo Dropout while maintaining single-pass efficiency, which enables real-time deployment.

To overcome these drawbacks, we suggest a flexible, conditional Denoising Diffusion Model that combines an enhanced UNet-based generative decoder with a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder for global feature extraction. We introduce three primary innovations: 1) an Adaptive Conditioning Bridge (ACB) for efficient, multi-scale fusion of semantic features; 2) a novel Topological Denoising Consistency (TDC) loss component that regularizes training by penalizing structural inconsistencies during denoising; and 3) a dual-head architecture that leverages the denoising objective as a powerful regularizer, enabling a lightweight auxiliary head to perform rapid and accurate inference on smaller datasets and a noise prediction head. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art on public breast ultrasound datasets, achieving Dice scores of 0.96 on BUSI, 0.90 on BrEaST and 0.97 on BUS-UCLM. Comprehensive ablation studies empirically validate that the model components are critical for achieving these results and for producing segmentations that are not only accurate but also anatomically plausible.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ViT\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548cUNet\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u5347\u4e73\u817a\u8d85\u58f0\u75c5\u7076\u5206\u5272\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u89e3\u5256\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e73\u817a\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4f4e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u3001\u6591\u70b9\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u8fb9\u754c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u5377\u79ef\u67b6\u6784\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u679c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6761\u4ef6\u6865\uff08ACB\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u62d3\u6251\u53bb\u566a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08TDC\uff09\u635f\u5931\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u53cc\u5934\u67b6\u6784\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5171\u4e73\u817a\u8d85\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0cBUSI\u3001BrEaST\u548cBUS-UCLM\u7684Dice\u5206\u6570\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.96\u30010.90\u548c0.97\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408Vision Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u6539\u8fdbUNet\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e73\u817a\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u75c5\u7076\u5206\u5272\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002"}}

However, safety regulations and operational constraints in operating rooms (ORs) limit embodied agents from freely perceiving and interacting in realistic settings. Digital twins provide high-fidelity, risk-free environments for exploration and training. How we may create photorealistic and dynamic digital representations of ORs that capture relevant spatial, visual, and behavioral complexity remains unclear. We introduce TwinOR, a framework for constructing photorealistic, dynamic digital twins of ORs for embodied AI research. The system reconstructs static geometry from pre-scan videos and continuously models human and equipment motion through multi-view perception of OR activities. The static and dynamic components are fused into an immersive 3D environment that supports controllable simulation and embodied exploration. The proposed framework reconstructs complete OR geometry with centimeter level accuracy while preserving dynamic interaction across surgical workflows, enabling realistic renderings and a virtual playground for embodied AI systems. In our experiments, TwinOR simulates stereo and monocular sensor streams for geometry understanding and visual localization tasks. Models such as FoundationStereo and ORB-SLAM3 on TwinOR-synthesized data achieve performance within their reported accuracy on real indoor datasets, demonstrating that TwinOR provides sensor-level realism sufficient for perception and localization challenges. By establishing a real-to-sim pipeline for constructing dynamic, photorealistic digital twins of OR environments, TwinOR enables the safe, scalable, and data-efficient development and benchmarking of embodied AI, ultimately accelerating the deployment of embodied AI from sim-to-real.", "AI": {"tldr": "TwinOR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u624b\u672f\u5ba4\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u672f\u5ba4\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u9650\u5236\u4e86AI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u611f\u77e5\u91cd\u5efa\u9759\u6001\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u4e3a\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f3D\u73af\u5883\u3002", "result": "TwinOR\u5408\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "TwinOR\u901a\u8fc7\u771f\u5b9e\u5230\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u52a0\u901fAI\u4ece\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

However, compared to rigid objects, pose tracking for articulated objects remains an underexplored problem due to their inherent kinematic constraints. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel point-pair-based pose tracking framework, termed \\textbf{PPF-Tracker}. The proposed framework first performs quasi-canonicalization of point clouds in the SE(3) Lie group space, and then models articulated objects using Point Pair Features (PPF) to predict pose voting parameters by leveraging the invariance properties of SE(3). Finally, semantic information of joint axes is incorporated to impose unified kinematic constraints across all parts of the articulated object. PPF-Tracker is systematically evaluated on both synthetic datasets and real-world scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse and challenging environments. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of PPF-Tracker in multi-frame pose tracking of articulated objects.

Unintended subjects often appear outside the layouts, generated images can be out-of-distribution and contain unnatural artifacts, or attributes bleed across subjects, leading to incorrect visual outputs. In this work, we propose MALeR, a method that addresses each of these challenges. Given a text prompt and corresponding layouts, our method prevents subjects from appearing outside the given layouts while being in-distribution. Additionally, we propose a masked, attribute-aware binding mechanism that prevents attribute leakage, enabling accurate rendering of subjects with multiple attributes, even in complex compositional scenes.

Unlike humans, who interpret images through contextual and social cues, VLMs process them through statistical associations, often leading to reasoning that diverges from human reasoning. By analyzing how a VLM reasons, we can understand how inherent biases are perpetuated and can adversely affect downstream performance.

Over the past decade, dominant VPR methods (e.g., NetVLAD) have followed a paradigm that first extracts the patch features/tokens of the input image using a backbone, and then aggregates these patch features into a global descriptor via an aggregator. This backbone-plus-aggregator paradigm has achieved overwhelming dominance in the CNN era and remains widely used in transformer-based models. In this paper, however, we argue that a dedicated aggregator is not necessary in the transformer era, that is, we can obtain robust global descriptors only with the backbone. Specifically, we introduce some learnable aggregation tokens, which are prepended to the patch tokens before a particular transformer block. All these tokens will be jointly processed and interact globally via the intrinsic self-attention mechanism, implicitly aggregating useful information within the patch tokens to the aggregation tokens. Finally, we only take these aggregation tokens from the last output tokens and concatenate them as the global representation. Although implicit aggregation can provide robust global descriptors in an extremely simple manner, where and how to insert additional tokens, as well as the initialization of tokens, remains an open issue worthy of further exploration. To this end, we also propose the optimal token insertion strategy and token initialization method derived from empirical studies.

Code will be released at https://www.github.com/kkkzh/StreamSTGS", "summary": "Streaming free-viewpoint video~(FVV) in real-time still faces significant challenges, particularly in training, rendering, and transmission efficiency. Harnessing superior performance of 3D Gaussian Splatting~(3DGS), recent 3DGS-based FVV methods have achieved notable breakthroughs in both training and rendering. However, the storage requirements of these methods can reach up to $10$MB per frame, making stream FVV in real-time impossible. To address this problem, we propose a novel FVV representation, dubbed StreamSTGS, designed for real-time streaming. StreamSTGS represents a dynamic scene using canonical 3D Gaussians, temporal features, and a deformation field. For high compression efficiency, we encode canonical Gaussian attributes as 2D images and temporal features as a video. This design not only enables real-time streaming, but also inherently supports adaptive bitrate control based on network condition without any extra training. Moreover, we propose a sliding window scheme to aggregate adjacent temporal features to learn local motions, and then introduce a transformer-guided auxiliary training module to learn global motions. On diverse FVV benchmarks, StreamSTGS demonstrates competitive performance on all metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, StreamSTGS increases the PSNR by an average of $1$dB while reducing the average frame size to just $170$KB.

Differing from existing transformer-based offline text-to-video generation models, Neodragon is the first to have been specifically optimised for mobile hardware to achieve efficient and high-fidelity video synthesis. We achieve this through four key technical contributions: (1) Replacing the original large 4.762B T5xxl Text-Encoder with a much smaller 0.2B DT5 (DistilT5) with minimal quality loss, enabled through a novel Text-Encoder Distillation procedure. (2) Proposing an Asymmetric Decoder Distillation approach allowing us to replace the native codec-latent-VAE decoder with a more efficient one, without disturbing the generative latent-space of the generation pipeline. (3) Pruning of MMDiT blocks within the denoiser backbone based on their relative importance, with recovery of original performance through a two-stage distillation process. (4) Reducing the NFE (Neural Functional Evaluation) requirement of the denoiser by performing step distillation using DMD adapted for pyramidal flow-matching, thereby substantially accelerating video generation. When paired with an optimised SSD1B first-frame image generator and QuickSRNet for 2x super-resolution, our end-to-end Neodragon system becomes a highly parameter (4.945B full model), memory (3.5GB peak RAM usage), and runtime (6.7s E2E latency) efficient mobile-friendly model, while achieving a VBench total score of 81.61. By enabling low-cost, private, and on-device text-to-video synthesis, Neodragon democratizes AI-based video content creation, empowering creators to generate high-quality videos without reliance on cloud services.

While supervised learning has achieved significant progress in this area, it relies heavily on large-scale labeled datasets, which are difficult to obtain in practical scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a pseudo label-based unsupervised method called LoopExpose for arbitrary-length exposure correction. A nested loop optimization strategy is proposed to address the exposure correction problem, where the correction model and pseudo-supervised information are jointly optimized in a two-level framework. Specifically, the upper-level trains a correction model using pseudo-labels generated through multi-exposure fusion at the lower level. A feedback mechanism is introduced where corrected images are fed back into the fusion process to refine the pseudo-labels, creating a self-reinforcing learning loop. Considering the dominant role of luminance calibration in exposure correction, a Luminance Ranking Loss is introduced to leverage the relative luminance ordering across the input sequence as a self-supervised constraint. Extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets demonstrate that LoopExpose achieves superior exposure correction and fusion performance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.

Conventional deblurring approaches are often inadequate in handling spatially varying blur and typically fall short in modeling the long-range dependencies necessary for restoring textual clarity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a hybrid deep learning framework that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with vision transformers (ViTs), thereby leveraging both local feature extraction and global contextual reasoning. The architecture employs a CNN-based encoder-decoder to preserve structural details, while a transformer module enhances global awareness through self-attention. Training is conducted on a curated dataset derived from TextOCR, where sharp scene-text samples are paired with synthetically blurred versions generated using realistic motion-blur kernels of multiple sizes and orientations. Model optimization is guided by a composite loss that incorporates mean absolute error (MAE), squared error (MSE), perceptual similarity, and structural similarity (SSIM).

However, current flow-based inverse solvers face two primary limitations: (i) they operate directly in pixel space, which demands heavy computational resources for training and restricts scalability to high-resolution images, and (ii) they employ guidance strategies with prior-agnostic posterior covariances, which can weaken alignment with the generative trajectory and degrade posterior coverage. In this paper, we propose LFlow (Latent Refinement via Flows), a training-free framework for solving linear inverse problems via pretrained latent flow priors. LFlow leverages the efficiency of flow matching to perform ODE sampling in latent space along an optimal path. This latent formulation further allows us to introduce a theoretically grounded posterior covariance, derived from the optimal vector field, enabling effective flow guidance.

However, processing high-resolution imagery in real time presents significant challenges due to the computational demands of feature extraction, matching, and bundle adjustment (BA). Conventional BA methods either downsample images, sacrificing important details, or require extensive processing time, making them unsuitable for time-critical missions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel real-time BA framework that operates directly on fullresolution UAV imagery without downsampling. Our lightweight, onboard-compatible approach divides each image into user-defined patches (e.g., NxN grids, default 150x150 pixels) and dynamically tracks them across frames using UAV GNSS/IMU data and a coarse, globally available digital surface model (DSM). This ensures spatial consistency for robust feature extraction and matching between patches. Overlapping relationships between images are determined in real time using UAV navigation system, enabling the rapid selection of relevant neighbouring images for localized BA. By limiting optimization to a sliding cluster of overlapping images, including those from adjacent flight strips, the method achieves real-time performance while preserving the accuracy of global BA. The proposed algorithm is designed for seamless integration into the DLR Modular Aerial Camera System (MACS), supporting largearea mapping in real time for disaster response, infrastructure monitoring, and coastal protection. Validation on MACS datasets with 50MP images demonstrates that the method maintains precise camera orientations and high-fidelity mapping across multiple strips, running full bundle adjustment in under 2 seconds without GPU acceleration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u65f6BA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u5168\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5f71\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u533a\u5757\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u57282\u79d2\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u5168\u5c40BA\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u707e\u5bb3\u54cd\u5e94\u7b49\u7d27\u6025\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5f71\u50cf\u5728\u707e\u5bb3\u54cd\u5e94\u7b49\u7d27\u6025\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edfBA\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u6bcf\u5f20\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u533a\u5757\uff08\u5982150x150\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u7f51\u683c\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u4eba\u673aGNSS/IMU\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5168\u5c40DSM\u52a8\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u533a\u5757\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u786e\u5b9a\u5f71\u50cf\u95f4\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u76f8\u90bb\u5f71\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8BA\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728DLR MACS\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u57282\u79d2\u5185\u5b8c\u621050MP\u5f71\u50cf\u7684\u5168\u5c40BA\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u5b9a\u5411\u548c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6BA\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5728\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5904\u7406\u4e86\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5f71\u50cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57282\u79d2\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u5168\u5c40BA\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u707e\u5bb3\u54cd\u5e94\u7b49\u7d27\u6025\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

However, early filming equipment limitations have degraded videos of last-century performances by renowned artists (e.g., low frame rates and resolution), hindering archival efforts. Although space-time video super-resolution (STVSR) has advanced significantly, applying it directly to opera videos remains challenging. The scarcity of datasets impedes the recovery of high frequency details, and existing STVSR methods lack global modeling capabilities, compromising visual quality when handling opera's characteristic large motions. To address these challenges, we pioneer a large scale Chinese Opera Video Clip (COVC) dataset and propose the Mamba-based multiscale fusion network for space-time Opera Video Super-Resolution (MambaOVSR). Specifically, MambaOVSR involves three novel components: the Global Fusion Module (GFM) for motion modeling through a multiscale alternating scanning mechanism, and the Multiscale Synergistic Mamba Module (MSMM) for alignment across different sequence lengths.

In real-world scenarios, however, modalities may be missing due to privacy constraints, collection difficulties, or resource limitations. While previous approaches have addressed this challenge using prompt learning techniques, they fail to capture the cross-modal relationships necessary for effective multimodal visual recognition and suffer from inevitable computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that explicitly models cross-modal interactions while maintaining modality-specific adaptations. MoRA introduces modality-common parameters between text and vision encoders, enabling bidirectional knowledge transfer. Additionally, combined with the modality-specific parameters, MoRA allows the backbone model to maintain inter-modality interaction and enable intra-modality flexibility. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that MoRA achieves an average performance improvement in missing-modality scenarios by 5.24% and uses only 25.90% of the inference time compared to the SOTA method while requiring only 0.11% of trainable parameters compared to full fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoRA\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5728\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6a21\u6001\u53ef\u80fd\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u83b7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3002", "method": "MoRA\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u6001\u5171\u4eab\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "result": "MoRA\u5728\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53475.24%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4ec5\u9700SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u768425.90%\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u4ec5\u4e3a\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u76840.11%\u3002", "conclusion": "MoRA\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u3002"}}

While existing methods rely on specialized architectures or resource-intensive training, the potential of leveraging modern Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) pretrained on image data remains under-explored for event-based vision. To address this, we propose Temporal-Guided VFM (TGVFM), a novel framework that integrates VFMs with our temporal context fusion block seamlessly to bridge this gap. Our temporal block introduces three key components: (1) Long-Range Temporal Attention to model global temporal dependencies, (2) Dual Spatiotemporal Attention for multi-scale frame correlation, and (3) Deep Feature Guidance Mechanism to fuse semantic-temporal features. By retraining event-to-video models on real-world data and leveraging transformer-based VFMs, TGVFM preserves spatiotemporal dynamics while harnessing pretrained representations.

While deep learning-based motion deblurring methods have achieved remarkable progress, existing approaches face fundamental challenges in capturing the long-range spatial dependencies inherent in motion blur patterns. Traditional convolutional methods rely on limited receptive fields and require extremely deep networks to model global spatial relationships. These limitations motivate the need for alternative approaches that incorporate physical priors to guide feature evolution during restoration. In this paper, we propose a progressive training framework that integrates physics-informed PDE dynamics into state-of-the-art restoration architectures. By leveraging advection-diffusion equations to model feature evolution, our approach naturally captures the directional flow characteristics of motion blur while enabling principled global spatial modeling. Our PDE-enhanced deblurring models achieve superior restoration quality with minimal overhead, adding only approximately 1\\% to inference GMACs while providing consistent improvements in perceptual quality across multiple state-of-the-art architectures. Comprehensive experiments on standard motion deblurring benchmarks demonstrate that our physics-informed approach improves PSNR and SSIM significantly across four diverse architectures, including FFTformer, NAFNet, Restormer, and Stripformer.

We propose Targeted Manifold Manipulation-Nearest Neighbour (TMM-NN), which reconceptualises retrieval by assessing how readily each sample can be nudged into a designated region of the feature manifold; neighbourhoods are defined by a sample's responsiveness to a targeted perturbation rather than absolute geometric distance. TMM-NN implements this through a lightweight, query-specific trigger patch. The patch is added to the query image, and the network is weakly ``backdoored'' so that any input with the patch is steered toward a dummy class. Images similar to the query need only a slight shift and are classified as the dummy class with high probability, while dissimilar ones are less affected. By ranking candidates by this confidence, TMM-NN retrieves the most semantically related neighbours.

To address these challenges, we propose $C^3$, a data augmentation framework that enhances cross-modal retrieval performance by improving the completeness and consistency of LLM-generated descriptions. $C^3$ introduces a completeness evaluation module to assess semantic coverage using both visual cues and language-model outputs. Furthermore, to mitigate factual inconsistencies, we formulate a Markov Decision Process to supervise Chain-of-Thought reasoning, guiding consistency evaluation through adaptive query control.

Mainstream text-to-video (T2V) models lack fine-grained lighting control due to text's inherent limitation in describing lighting details and insufficient pre-training on lighting-related prompts. Additionally, constructing high-quality relighting training data is challenging, as real-world controllable lighting data is scarce. To address these issues, we propose RelightMaster, a novel framework for accurate and controllable video relighting. First, we build RelightVideo, the first dataset with identical dynamic content under varying precise lighting conditions based on the Unreal Engine. Then, we introduce Multi-plane Light Image (MPLI), a novel visual prompt inspired by Multi-Plane Image (MPI). MPLI models lighting via K depth-aligned planes, representing 3D light source positions, intensities, and colors while supporting multi-source scenarios and generalizing to unseen light setups. Third, we design a Light Image Adapter that seamlessly injects MPLI into pre-trained Video Diffusion Transformers (DiT): it compresses MPLI via a pre-trained Video VAE and injects latent light features into DiT blocks, leveraging the base model's generative prior without catastrophic forgetting.

However, these methods often lack spatial reasoning and struggle with occluded or invisible centerlines. Generative approaches, despite their potential, remain underexplored in this domain. We introduce LaneDiffusion, a novel generative paradigm for centerline graph learning. LaneDiffusion innovatively employs diffusion models to generate lane centerline priors at the Bird's Eye View (BEV) feature level, instead of directly predicting vectorized centerlines. Our method integrates a Lane Prior Injection Module (LPIM) and a Lane Prior Diffusion Module (LPDM) to effectively construct diffusion targets and manage the diffusion process. Furthermore, vectorized centerlines and topologies are then decoded from these prior-injected BEV features. Extensive evaluations on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that LaneDiffusion significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving improvements of 4.2%, 4.6%, 4.7%, 6.4% and 1.8% on fine-grained point-level metrics (GEO F1, TOPO F1, JTOPO F1, APLS and SDA) and 2.3%, 6.4%, 6.8% and 2.1% on segment-level metrics (IoU, mAP_cf, DET_l and TOP_ll).

This work investigates a pivotal question: Can the rich, intrinsic information within videos be harnessed to self-generate high-quality, verifiable training data? To investigate this, we introduce three self-supervised pretext tasks: Anomaly Grounding, Object Counting, and Temporal Jigsaw. We construct the Video Intrinsic Understanding Benchmark (VIUBench) to validate their difficulty, revealing that current state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle significantly on these tasks. Building upon these pretext tasks, we develop the VideoSSR-30K dataset and propose VideoSSR, a novel video self-supervised reinforcement learning framework for RLVR. Extensive experiments across 17 benchmarks, spanning four major video domains (General Video QA, Long Video QA, Temporal Grounding, and Complex Reasoning), demonstrate that VideoSSR consistently enhances model performance, yielding an average improvement of over 5\\%.

Concurrently, deep learning (DL) models have demonstrated promise in image-based ovarian lesion characterization. This study evaluates radiologist performance applying O-RADS v2022, compares it to leading convolutional neural network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models, and investigates the diagnostic gains achieved by hybrid human-AI frameworks. Methods: In this single-center, retrospective cohort study, a total of 512 adnexal mass images from 227 patients (110 with at least one malignant cyst) were included. Sixteen DL models, including DenseNets, EfficientNets, ResNets, VGGs, Xception, and ViTs, were trained and validated. A hybrid model integrating radiologist O-RADS scores with DL-predicted probabilities was also built for each scheme. Results: Radiologist-only O-RADS assessment achieved an AUC of 0.683 and an overall accuracy of 68.0%. CNN models yielded AUCs of 0.620 to 0.908 and accuracies of 59.2% to 86.4%, while ViT16-384 reached the best performance, with an AUC of 0.941 and an accuracy of 87.4%. Hybrid human-AI frameworks further significantly enhanced the performance of CNN models; however, the improvement for ViT models was not statistically significant (P-value >0.05).

Current approaches that directly adopt standard VLMs for chemical tasks suffer from two primary issues: (i) computational inefficiency of processing entire chemical images with non-informative backgrounds. (ii) a narrow scope on molecular-level tasks that restricts progress in chemical reasoning. In this work, we propose \\textbf{TinyChemVL}, an efficient and powerful chemical VLM that leverages visual token reduction and reaction-level tasks to improve model efficiency and reasoning capacity. Also, we propose \\textbf{ChemRxn-V}, a reaction-level benchmark for assessing vision-based reaction recognition and prediction tasks. Directly predicting reaction products from molecular images poses a non-trivial challenge, as it requires models to integrate both recognition and reasoning capacities. Our results demonstrate that with only 4B parameters, TinyChemVL achieves superior performance on both molecular and reaction tasks while demonstrating faster inference and training speeds compared to existing models. Notably, TinyChemVL outperforms ChemVLM while utilizing only 1/16th of the visual tokens.

However, by observing the MMD posts, we hold that the text modality may be much more informative than the image modality because the text generally describes the whole event/story of the current post but the image often presents partial scenes only. Our preliminary empirical results indicate that the image modality exactly contributes less to MMD. Upon this idea, we propose a new MMD method named RETSIMD. Specifically, we suppose that each text can be divided into several segments, and each text segment describes a partial scene that can be presented by an image. Accordingly, we split the text into a sequence of segments, and feed these segments into a pre-trained text-to-image generator to augment a sequence of images. We further incorporate two auxiliary objectives concerning text-image and image-label mutual information, and further post-train the generator over an auxiliary text-to-image generation benchmark dataset. Additionally, we propose a graph structure by defining three heuristic relationships between images, and use a graph neural network to generate the fused features.

We utilized YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 architectures, enhanced through Optuna driven hyperparameter optimization and spatial post processing. An innovative pallet hole mapping module converts the detections into actionable spatial representations, enabling accurate pallet and pallet hole association for forklift operation.

In this work, we propose a novel Spatial and Frequency Feature Reconstruction method (SFFR) method, which leverages the spatial-frequency feature representation mechanisms of the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to reconstruct complementary representations in both spatial and frequency domains prior to feature fusion. The core components of SFFR are the proposed Frequency Component Exchange KAN (FCEKAN) module and Multi-Scale Gaussian KAN (MSGKAN) module. The FCEKAN introduces an innovative selective frequency component exchange strategy that effectively enhances the complementarity and consistency of cross-modal features based on the frequency feature of RGB and IR images. The MSGKAN module demonstrates excellent nonlinear feature modeling capability in the spatial domain. By leveraging multi-scale Gaussian basis functions, it effectively captures the feature variations caused by scale changes at different UAV flight altitudes, significantly enhancing the model's adaptability and robustness to scale variations. It is experimentally validated that our proposed FCEKAN and MSGKAN modules are complementary and can effectively capture the frequency and spatial semantic features respectively for better feature fusion. Extensive experiments on the SeaDroneSee, DroneVehicle and DVTOD datasets demonstrate the superior performance and significant advantages of the proposed method in UAV multispectral object perception task.

However, purely data-driven 3DGS often struggles to capture the diverse physics-driven motion patterns in dynamic scenes. To fill this gap, we propose Physics-Informed Deformable Gaussian Splatting (PIDG), which treats each Gaussian particle as a Lagrangian material point with time-varying constitutive parameters and is supervised by 2D optical flow via motion projection. Specifically, we adopt static-dynamic decoupled 4D decomposed hash encoding to reconstruct geometry and motion efficiently. Subsequently, we impose the Cauchy momentum residual as a physics constraint, enabling independent prediction of each particle's velocity and constitutive stress via a time-evolving material field. Finally, we further supervise data fitting by matching Lagrangian particle flow to camera-compensated optical flow, which accelerates convergence and improves generalization.

Existing generative-model-based approaches, particularly diffusion-model approaches that directly learn the posterior, may suffer from inflexibility -- they require conditioning signals during training, support only a fixed number of input views, and need complete retraining for different measurements. Recent diffusion-based methods have attempted to address this by combining prior models with likelihood updates, but they rely on heuristic fixed step sizes for the likelihood update that lead to slow convergence and suboptimal reconstruction quality. We advance this line of approach by integrating our novel Forward Curvature-Matching (FCM) update method with diffusion sampling. Our method dynamically determines optimal step sizes using only forward automatic differentiation and finite-difference curvature estimates, enabling precise optimization of the likelihood update. This formulation enables high-fidelity reconstruction from both single-view and multi-view inputs, and supports various input modalities through simple operator substitution -- all without retraining. Experiments on ShapeNet and CO3D datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior reconstruction quality at matched or lower NFEs, yielding higher F-score and lower CD and EMD, validating its efficiency and adaptability for practical applications.

We introduce CINEMAE, a novel paradigm for AIGC image detection that adapts the core principles of text detection methods to the visual domain. Our key insight is that Masked AutoEncoder (MAE), trained to reconstruct masked patches conditioned on visible context, naturally encodes semantic consistency expectations. We formalize this reconstruction process probabilistically, computing conditional Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL, p(masked | visible)) to quantify local semantic anomalies. By aggregating these patch-level statistics with global MAE features through learned fusion, CINEMAE achieves strong cross-generator generalization. Trained exclusively on Stable Diffusion v1.4, our method achieves over 95% accuracy on all eight unseen generators in the GenImage benchmark, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art detectors.

However, imbalanced unimodal performance often leads to suboptimal fused representations. Existing approaches typically adopt fixed primary modality strategies to maximize dominant modality advantages, yet fail to adapt to dynamic variations in modality importance across different samples. Moreover, non-language modalities suffer from sequential redundancy and noise, degrading model performance when they serve as primary inputs. To address these issues, this paper proposes a modality optimization and dynamic primary modality selection framework (MODS). First, a Graph-based Dynamic Sequence Compressor (GDC) is constructed, which employs capsule networks and graph convolution to reduce sequential redundancy in acoustic/visual modalities. Then, we develop a sample-adaptive Primary Modality Selector (MSelector) for dynamic dominance determination. Finally, a Primary-modality-Centric Cross-Attention (PCCA) module is designed to enhance dominant modalities while facilitating cross-modal interaction.

Point clouds from airborne and ground-based laser scanning are currently the most suitable data source to rapidly derive such information at scale. Recent advancements in deep learning improved segmenting and classifying individual trees and identifying semantic tree components. However, deep learning models typically require large amounts of annotated training data which limits further improvement. Producing dense, high-quality annotations for 3D point clouds, especially in complex forests, is labor-intensive and challenging to scale. We explore strategies to reduce dependence on large annotated datasets using self-supervised and transfer learning architectures.

Our findings indicate that combining self-supervised learning with domain adaptation significantly enhances instance segmentation compared to training from scratch (AP50 +16.98%), self-supervised learning suffices for semantic segmentation (mIoU +1.79%), and hierarchical transfer learning enables accurate classification of unseen species (Jaccard +6.07%).

Specifically, BuildingWorld provides about five million LOD2 building models collected from diverse sources, accompanied by real and simulated airborne LiDAR point clouds. This enables comprehensive research on 3D building reconstruction, detection and segmentation. Cyber City, a virtual city model, is introduced to enable the generation of unlimited training data with customized and structurally diverse point cloud distributions. Furthermore, we provide standardized evaluation metrics tailored for building reconstruction, aiming to facilitate the training, evaluation, and comparison of large-scale vision models and foundation models in structured 3D urban environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "BuildingWorld \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u76843D\u5efa\u7b51\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u57ce\u5e02\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5168\u7403\u5efa\u7b51\u6a21\u578b\u548cLiDAR\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u865a\u62df\u57ce\u5e02\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76843D\u57ce\u5e02\u5efa\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u4e86\u6765\u81ea\u5168\u7403\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u7406\u548c\u5efa\u7b51\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u7ea6\u4e94\u767e\u4e07\u4e2aLOD2\u5efa\u7b51\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8f85\u4ee5\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u673a\u8f7dLiDAR\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u865a\u62df\u57ce\u5e02\u6a21\u578bCyber City\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "BuildingWorld \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u7403\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5efa\u7b51\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u5272\u7b49\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "BuildingWorld \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5efa\u7b51\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u57ce\u5e02\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u6bd4\u8f83\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

While other transformer-based methods exist for gaze analysis, GazeVLM represents, to our knowledge, the first application of a VLM to these combined tasks, allowing for selective execution of each task. Through the integration of visual (RGB and depth) and textual modalities, our ablation study on visual input combinations revealed that a fusion of RGB images with HHA-encoded depth maps, guided by text prompts, yields superior performance.

However, existing methods often suffer from content leakage, where the undesired semantic content of the style image mistakenly appears in the stylized output. In this paper, we propose V-Shuffle, a zero-shot style transfer method that leverages multiple style images from the same style domain to effectively navigate the trade-off between content preservation and style fidelity. V-Shuffle implicitly disrupts the semantic content of the style images by shuffling the value features within the self-attention layers of the diffusion model, thereby preserving low-level style representations.

Despite excelling on natural images, VLMs often struggle with stylized line art, onomatopoeia, and densely packed multi-panel layouts. To address this gap, we introduce AI4VA-FG, the first fine-grained and comprehensive benchmark for VLM-based comic understanding. It spans tasks from foundational recognition and detection to high-level character reasoning and narrative construction, supported by dense annotations for characters, poses, and depth. Beyond that, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary models, including GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5, and open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL, revealing substantial performance deficits across core tasks of our benchmarks and underscoring that comic understanding remains an unsolved challenge. To enhance VLMs' capabilities in this domain, we systematically investigate post-training strategies, including supervised fine-tuning on solutions (SFT-S), supervised fine-tuning on reasoning trajectories (SFT-R), and reinforcement learning (RL). Beyond that, inspired by the emerging \"Thinking with Images\" paradigm, we propose Region-Aware Reinforcement Learning (RARL) for VLMs, which trains models to dynamically attend to relevant regions through zoom-in operations.

To address these issues, we propose Vision-only Dynamic NeRF (VDNeRF), a method that accurately recovers camera trajectories and learns spatiotemporal representations for dynamic urban scenes without requiring additional camera pose information or expensive sensor data. VDNeRF employs two separate NeRF models to jointly reconstruct the scene. The static NeRF model optimizes camera poses and static background, while the dynamic NeRF model incorporates the 3D scene flow to ensure accurate and consistent reconstruction of dynamic objects. To address the ambiguity between camera motion and independent object motion, we design an effective and powerful training framework to achieve robust camera pose estimation and self-supervised decomposition of static and dynamic elements in a scene.

However, in GNSS-denied environments, localization schemes that rely solely on satellite signals are prone to failure. Cross-view image retrieval-based localization is a promising alternative, yet substantial geometric and appearance domain gaps exist between oblique UAV views and nadir satellite orthophotos. Moreover, conventional approaches often depend on complex network architectures, text prompts, or large amounts of annotation, which hinders generalization. To address these issues, we propose DiffusionUavLoc, a cross-view localization framework that is image-prompted, text-free, diffusion-centric, and employs a VAE for unified representation. We first use training-free geometric rendering to synthesize pseudo-satellite images from UAV imagery as structural prompts. We then design a text-free conditional diffusion model that fuses multimodal structural cues to learn features robust to viewpoint changes. At inference, descriptors are computed at a fixed time step t and compared using cosine similarity. On University-1652 and SUES-200, the method performs competitively for cross-view localization, especially for satellite-to-drone in University-1652.Our data and code will be published at the following URL: https://github.com/liutao23/DiffusionUavLoc.git.", "AI": {"tldr": "DiffusionUavLoc\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u4f2a\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3GNSS\u62d2\u7edd\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9GNSS\u62d2\u7edd\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u536b\u661f\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6848\u6613\u5931\u6548\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5916\u89c2\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\u5927\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6e32\u67d3\u5408\u6210\u4f2a\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6587\u672c\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65t\u8ba1\u7b97\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5728University-1652\u548cSUES-200\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cDiffusionUavLoc\u5728\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728University-1652\u7684\u536b\u661f\u5230\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "DiffusionUavLoc \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u6587\u672c\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86GNSS\u62d2\u7edd\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u5728University-1652\u548cSUES-200\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Recently, to improve its performance and make it work more like a pathologist, several MIL approaches based on the use of multiple-resolution images have been proposed, delivering often higher performance than those that use single-resolution images. Despite impressive recent developments of multiple-resolution MIL, previous approaches only focus on improving performance, thereby lacking research on well-calibrated MIL that clinical experts can rely on for trustworthy diagnostic results. In this study, we propose Uncertainty-Focused Calibrated MIL (UFC-MIL), which more closely mimics the pathologists' examination behaviors while providing calibrated diagnostic predictions, using multiple images with different resolutions. UFC-MIL includes a novel patch-wise loss that learns the latent patterns of instances and expresses their uncertainty for classification. Also, the attention-based architecture with a neighbor patch aggregation module collects features for the classifier. In addition, aggregated predictions are calibrated through patch-level uncertainty without requiring multiple iterative inferences, which is a key practical advantage. Against challenging public datasets, UFC-MIL shows superior performance in model calibration while achieving classification accuracy comparable to that of state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "UFC-MIL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387MIL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7patch-wise\u635f\u5931\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u6821\u51c6\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u4f46\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387MIL\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6821\u51c6MIL\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u800c\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e13\u5bb6\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "UFC-MIL\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u57fa\u4e8epatch\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u8868\u8fbe\u5176\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5e26\u6709\u90bb\u5c45patch\u805a\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6536\u96c6\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cUFC-MIL\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "UFC-MIL\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e13\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Applications like human action anticipation that require fusing multifarious sensor data are hindered by both feature and modality collapse. However, existing methods attempt to counter feature collapse and modality collapse separately. This is because there is no unifying framework that efficiently addresses feature and modality collapse in conjunction. In this paper, we posit the utility of effective rank as an informative measure that can be utilized to quantify and counter both the representation collapses. We propose \\textit{Rank-enhancing Token Fuser}, a theoretically grounded fusion framework that selectively blends less informative features from one modality with complementary features from another modality. We show that our method increases the effective rank of the fused representation. To address modality collapse, we evaluate modality combinations that mutually increase each others' effective rank. We show that depth maintains representational balance when fused with RGB, avoiding modality collapse. We validate our method on action anticipation, where we present \\texttt{R3D}, a depth-informed fusion framework. Extensive experiments on NTURGBD, UTKinect, and DARai demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by up to 3.74\\%.

The framework introduces an agentic reasoning process that emulates clinical diagnostic thinking-first perceiving pulmonary findings, then reasoning through established medical knowledge, and finally deriving a cardiovascular judgment with explanatory rationale. It integrates three synergistic components: a pulmonary perception module that summarizes lung abnormalities, a knowledge-guided reasoning module that infers their cardiovascular implications, and a cardiac representation module that encodes structural biomarkers. Their outputs are fused to produce a holistic cardiovascular risk prediction that is both accurate and physiologically grounded. Experiments on the NLST cohort demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for CVD screening and mortality prediction, outperforming single-disease and purely image-based baselines. Beyond quantitative gains, the framework provides human-verifiable reasoning that aligns with cardiological understanding, revealing coherent links between pulmonary abnormalities and cardiac stress mechanisms.

Although ground-level images from social networks provide a valuable source to fill this gap, a large pixel-level annotated dataset for this task is still unavailable. We introduce EIDSeg, the first large-scale semantic segmentation dataset specifically for post-earthquake social media imagery. The dataset comprises 3,266 images from nine major earthquakes (2008-2023), annotated across five classes of infrastructure damage: Undamaged Building, Damaged Building, Destroyed Building, Undamaged Road, and Damaged Road. We propose a practical three-phase cross-disciplinary annotation protocol with labeling guidelines that enables consistent segmentation by non-expert annotators, achieving over 70% inter-annotator agreement. We benchmark several state-of-the-art segmentation models, identifying Encoder-only Mask Transformer (EoMT) as the top-performing method with a Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 80.8%. By unlocking social networks' rich ground-level perspective, our work paves the way for a faster, finer-grained damage assessment in the post-earthquake scenario.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86EIDSeg\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u56fe\u50cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5730\u9707\u540e\u635f\u5bb3\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578bEoMT\u7684mIoU\u8fbe80.8%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u5730\u9707\u540e\u635f\u5bb3\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u6551\u63f4\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u89c4\u5212\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9065\u611f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u822a\u7a7a\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u4e8c\u503c\u635f\u5bb3\u5730\u56fe\u7528\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u5730\u9762\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u81ea\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7528\u4e8e\u6b64\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u6807\u6ce8\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6807\u6ce8\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u4f7f\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8d85\u8fc770%\u3002\u5e76\u5bf9\u51e0\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86Encoder-only Mask Transformer (EoMT)\u4e3a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u5e73\u5747\u4ea4\u5e76\u6bd4(mIoU)\u8fbe\u523080.8%\u3002", "result": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86EIDSeg\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u5730\u9707\u540e\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6765\u81ea9\u6b21\u5927\u5730\u9707\uff082008-2023\u5e74\uff09\u76843,266\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6807\u6ce8\u4e86\u4e94\u7c7b\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u635f\u5bb3\uff1a\u672a\u53d7\u635f\u5efa\u7b51\u3001\u53d7\u635f\u5efa\u7b51\u3001\u6bc1\u574f\u5efa\u7b51\u3001\u672a\u53d7\u635f\u9053\u8def\u548c\u53d7\u635f\u9053\u8def\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u9501\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5730\u9762\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5730\u9707\u540e\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u635f\u5bb3\u8bc4\u4f30\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

The subtle distinguishing patterns, handling new species and the inherent open-set nature make the problem even harder. To address these complexities, foundation models trained on labeled, large-scale and multi-species animal Re-ID datasets have recently been introduced to enable zero-shot Re-ID. However, our benchmarking reveals significant gaps in their zero-shot Re-ID performance for both known and unknown species. While this highlights the need for collecting labeled data in new domains, exhaustive annotation for Re-ID is laborious and requires domain expertise. Our analyses show that existing unsupervised (USL) and AL Re-ID methods underperform for animal Re-ID. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel AL Re-ID framework that leverages complementary clustering methods to uncover and target structurally ambiguous regions in the embedding space for mining pairs of samples that are both informative and broadly representative. Oracle feedback on these pairs, in the form of must-link and cannot-link constraints, facilitates a simple annotation interface, which naturally integrates with existing USL methods through our proposed constrained clustering refinement algorithm. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that, by utilizing only 0.033% of all annotations, our approach consistently outperforms existing foundational, USL and AL baselines. Specifically, we report an average improvement of 10.49%, 11.19% and 3.99% (mAP) on 13 wildlife datasets over foundational, USL and AL methods, respectively, while attaining state-of-the-art performance on each dataset.

This is primarily due to three key challenges: (i) identifying target objects in the 3D field of 360\u00b0 environments, (ii) dealing with severe occlusions in multi-object scenes, which makes it hard to define regions to inpaint, and (iii) maintaining consistent and high-quality appearance across views effectively. To tackle these challenges, we propose Inpaint360GS, a flexible 360\u00b0 editing framework based on 3DGS that supports multi-object removal and high-fidelity inpainting in 3D space. By distilling 2D segmentation into 3D and leveraging virtual camera views for contextual guidance, our method enables accurate object-level editing and consistent scene completion. We further introduce a new dataset tailored for 360\u00b0 inpainting, addressing the lack of ground truth object-free scenes.

Preprint", "summary": "Video large language models (Video LLMs) have recently achieved strong performance on tasks such as captioning, summarization, and question answering. Many models and training methods explicitly encourage continuity across events to enhance narrative coherence. While this improves fluency, it also introduces an inductive bias that prioritizes storyline consistency over strict grounding in visual evidence. We identify this bias, which we call narrative prior, as a key driver of two errors: hallucinations, where non-existent events are introduced or existing ones are misinterpreted, and omissions, where factual events are suppressed because they are misaligned with surrounding context. To systematically evaluate narrative prior-induced errors, we introduce NOAH, a large-scale benchmark that constructs composite videos by inserting clips from other sources into target videos. By varying semantic similarity and insertion position, our benchmark enables controlled and scalable analysis of narrative priors. We design one captioning task with tailored metrics and three QA tasks - Existence, Temporal, and Narrative - yielding more than 60K evaluation samples. Extensive experiments yield three key findings: (i) most Video LLMs exhibit hallucinations and omissions driven by narrative priors, (ii) the patterns of these errors vary across architectures and depend on event similarity and insertion position, and (iii) reliance on narrative priors intensifies under sampling with fewer frames, amplifying errors when event continuity is weak. We establish NOAH as the first standardized evaluation of narrative prior-induced hallucination and omission in Video LLMs, providing a foundation for developing more reliable and trustworthy models.

To succeed, models must master three critical capabilities: perceiving nuanced visual details, applying abstract sport rule knowledge, and grounding that knowledge in specific visual evidence. Current sports benchmarks either cover single sports or lack the detailed reasoning chains and precise visual grounding needed to robustly evaluate these core capabilities in a multi-sport context. To address this gap, we introduce SportR, the first multi-sports large-scale benchmark designed to train and evaluate MLLMs on the fundamental reasoning required for sports intelligence. Our benchmark provides a dataset of 5,017 images and 2,101 videos. To enable granular evaluation, we structure our benchmark around a progressive hierarchy of question-answer (QA) pairs designed to probe reasoning at increasing depths - from simple infraction identification to complex penalty prediction. For the most advanced tasks requiring multi-step reasoning, such as determining penalties or explaining tactics, we provide 7,118 high-quality, human-authored Chain of Thought (CoT) annotations. In addition, our benchmark incorporates both image and video modalities and provides manual bounding box annotations to test visual grounding in the image part directly. Extensive experiments demonstrate the profound difficulty of our benchmark. State-of-the-art baseline models perform poorly on our most challenging tasks. While training on our data via Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning improves these scores, they remain relatively low, highlighting a significant gap in current model capabilities.

Developing such systems often requires large, well-annotated datasets, but existing resources often address isolated tasks, neglect temporal dependencies, or lack multi-center variability. We present the Surgical Procedure Phase, Keypoint, and Instrument Recognition (PhaKIR) dataset, comprising eight complete laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos recorded at three medical centers. The dataset provides frame-level annotations for three interconnected tasks: surgical phase recognition (485,875 frames), instrument keypoint estimation (19,435 frames), and instrument instance segmentation (19,435 frames).

Building on the success of Deepseek-R1, researchers extended multimodal reasoning to post-training paradigms based on reinforcement learning (RL), focusing predominantly on mathematical datasets. However, existing post-training paradigms tend to neglect two critical aspects: (1) The lack of quantifiable difficulty metrics capable of strategically screening samples for post-training optimization. (2) Suboptimal post-training paradigms that fail to jointly optimize perception and reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we propose two novel difficulty-aware sampling strategies: Progressive Image Semantic Masking (PISM) quantifies sample hardness through systematic image degradation, while Cross-Modality Attention Balance (CMAB) assesses cross-modal interaction complexity via attention distribution analysis. Leveraging these metrics, we design a hierarchical training framework that incorporates both GRPO-only and SFT+GRPO hybrid training paradigms, and evaluate them across six benchmark datasets. Experiments demonstrate consistent superiority of GRPO applied to difficulty-stratified samples compared to conventional SFT+GRPO pipelines, indicating that strategic data sampling can obviate the need for supervised fine-tuning while improving model accuracy.

More modifications may be performed", "summary": "Multi-Modal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary image information from different modalities to produce informative images. Previous deep learning-based MMIF methods generally adopt Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Transformers for feature extraction. However, these methods deliver unsatisfactory performances due to the limited receptive field of CNNs and the high computational cost of Transformers. Recently, Mamba has demonstrated a powerful potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, providing a promising solution to MMIF. Unfortunately, Mamba lacks full spatial and frequency perceptions, which are very important for MMIF. Moreover, employing Image Reconstruction (IR) as an auxiliary task has been proven beneficial for MMIF. However, a primary challenge is how to leverage IR efficiently and effectively. To address the above issues, we propose a novel framework named Spatial-Frequency Enhanced Mamba Fusion (SFMFusion) for MMIF. More specifically, we first propose a three-branch structure to couple MMIF and IR, which can retain complete contents from source images. Then, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Enhanced Mamba Block (SFMB), which can enhance Mamba in both spatial and frequency domains for comprehensive feature extraction. Finally, we propose the Dynamic Fusion Mamba Block (DFMB), which can be deployed across different branches for dynamic feature fusion.

Yet, dense disparity supervision is nearly impossible due to anatomical constraints, typically limiting annotations to only a few image-level labels acquired before the endoscope enters deep body cavities. Teacher-Student Learning (TSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging a teacher trained on sparse labels to generate pseudo labels and associated confidence maps from abundant unlabeled surgical videos. However, existing TSL methods are confined to image-level supervision, providing only spatial confidence and lacking temporal consistency estimation. This absence of spatio-temporal reliability results in unstable disparity predictions and severe flickering artifacts across video frames. To overcome these challenges, we propose TiS-TSL, a novel time-switchable teacher-student learning framework for video stereo matching under minimal supervision. At its core is a unified model that operates in three distinct modes: Image-Prediction (IP), Forward Video-Prediction (FVP), and Backward Video-Prediction (BVP), enabling flexible temporal modeling within a single architecture. Enabled by this unified model, TiS-TSL adopts a two-stage learning strategy. The Image-to-Video (I2V) stage transfers sparse image-level knowledge to initialize temporal modeling. The subsequent Video-to-Video (V2V) stage refines temporal disparity predictions by comparing forward and backward predictions to calculate bidirectional spatio-temporal consistency. This consistency identifies unreliable regions across frames, filters noisy video-level pseudo labels, and enforces temporal coherence.

Current approaches, however, remain constrained by the scarcity of high-quality stimulus-brain response pairs and the inherent semantic mismatch between neural representations and visual content. Inspired by perceptual variability and co-adaptive strategy of the biological systems, we propose a novel self-supervised architecture, named NeuroBridge, which integrates Cognitive Prior Augmentation (CPA) with Shared Semantic Projector (SSP) to promote effective cross-modality alignment. Specifically, CPA simulates perceptual variability by applying asymmetric, modality-specific transformations to both EEG signals and images, enhancing semantic diversity. Unlike previous approaches, SSP establishes a bidirectional alignment process through a co-adaptive strategy, which mutually aligns features from two modalities into a shared semantic space for effective cross-modal learning. NeuroBridge surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods under both intra-subject and inter-subject settings. In the intra-subject scenario, it achieves the improvements of 12.3% in top-1 accuracy and 10.2% in top-5 accuracy, reaching 63.2% and 89.9% respectively on a 200-way zero-shot retrieval task.

However, existing trait maps remain limited by the high cost and sparse geographic coverage of field-based measurements. Citizen science initiatives offer a largely untapped resource to overcome these limitations, with over 50 million geotagged plant photographs worldwide capturing valuable visual information on plant morphology and physiology. In this study, we introduce PlantTraitNet, a multi-modal, multi-task uncertainty-aware deep learning framework that predictsfour key plant traits (plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area, and nitrogen content) from citizen science photos using weak supervision. By aggregating individual trait predictions across space, we generate global maps of trait distributions. We validate these maps against independent vegetation survey data (sPlotOpen) and benchmark them against leading global trait products. Our results show that PlantTraitNet consistently outperforms existing trait maps across all evaluated traits, demonstrating that citizen science imagery, when integrated with computer vision and geospatial AI, enables not only scalable but also more accurate global trait mapping.

Existing methods typically treat anomaly detection and classification as separate tasks, thereby neglecting their inherent correlation, limiting information sharing, and resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose UniADC, a unified anomaly detection and classification model that can effectively perform both tasks with only a few or even no anomaly images. Specifically, UniADC consists of two key components: a training-free controllable inpainting network and a multi-task discriminator. The inpainting network can synthesize anomaly images of specific categories by repainting normal regions guided by anomaly priors, and can also repaint few-shot anomaly samples to augment the available anomaly data. The multi-task discriminator is then trained on these synthesized samples, enabling precise anomaly detection and classification by aligning fine-grained image features with anomaly-category embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments on three anomaly detection and classification datasets, including MVTec-FS, MTD, and WFDD, and the results demonstrate that UniADC consistently outperforms existing methods in anomaly detection, localization, and classification.

However, most approaches rely on external annotations or heuristic-based segmentation to supervise model explanations, which can be noisy, imprecise and difficult to scale. In this work, we provide both empirical and theoretical evidence that low-quality supervision signals can degrade model performance rather than improve it. In response, we propose ALIGN, a novel framework that jointly trains a classifier and a masker in an iterative manner. The masker learns to produce soft, task-relevant masks that highlight informative regions, while the classifier is optimized for both prediction accuracy and alignment between its saliency maps and the learned masks.

While recent approaches leverage a limited amount of labeled target-domain data to improve performance, the severe imbalance between abundant source data and scarce target data remains a critical challenge for effective representation learning. We present the first frequency-space perspective to analyze this issue and identify two key challenges: (1) models are easily biased toward source-specific knowledge encoded in the low-frequency components of source data, and (2) the sparsity of target data hinders the learning of high-frequency, domain-generalizable features. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{FreqGRL}, a novel CD-FSL framework that mitigates the impact of data imbalance in the frequency space. Specifically, we introduce a Low-Frequency Replacement (LFR) module that substitutes the low-frequency components of source tasks with those from the target domain to create new source tasks that better align with target characteristics, thus reducing source-specific biases and promoting generalizable representation learning. We further design a High-Frequency Enhancement (HFE) module that filters out low-frequency components and performs learning directly on high-frequency features in the frequency space to improve cross-domain generalization. Additionally, a Global Frequency Filter (GFF) is incorporated to suppress noisy or irrelevant frequencies and emphasize informative ones, mitigating overfitting risks under limited target supervision.

However, such a CLIP-based metric is vulnerable for its delicate multimodal alignment. In this work, we propose \\textbf{FoCLIP}, a feature-space misalignment framework for fooling CLIP-based image quality metric. Based on the stochastic gradient descent technique, FoCLIP integrates three key components to construct fooling examples: feature alignment as the core module to reduce image-text modality gaps, the score distribution balance module and pixel-guard regularization, which collectively optimize multimodal output equilibrium between CLIPscore performance and image quality. Such a design can be engineered to maximize the CLIPscore predictions across diverse input prompts, despite exhibiting either visual unrecognizability or semantic incongruence with the corresponding adversarial prompts from human perceptual perspectives. Experiments on ten artistic masterpiece prompts and ImageNet subsets demonstrate that optimized images can achieve significant improvement in CLIPscore while preserving high visual fidelity. In addition, we found that grayscale conversion induces significant feature degradation in fooling images, exhibiting noticeable CLIPscore reduction while preserving statistical consistency with original images. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a color channel sensitivity-driven tampering detection mechanism that achieves 91% accuracy on standard benchmarks.

One of the key issues pertains to limited real-world annotated data to facilitate generalizable models. The common practice to tackle this issue is to simulate new data. Although synthetic datasets offer scalability and perfect labels, their designer-crafted scenes fail to capture real-world complexity and sensor noise, resulting in a synthetic-to-real domain gap. Moreover, no benchmark provides synchronized real and simulated point clouds for segmentation-oriented domain shift analysis. We introduce TrueCity, the first urban semantic segmentation benchmark with cm-accurate annotated real-world point clouds, semantic 3D city models, and annotated simulated point clouds representing the same city. TrueCity proposes segmentation classes aligned with international 3D city modeling standards, enabling consistent evaluation of synthetic-to-real gap.

However, these models often treat text as flat sequences, limiting their ability to handle complex, compositional, and long-form descriptions. In particular, they fail to capture two essential properties of language: semantic hierarchy, which reflects the multi-level compositional structure of text, and semantic monotonicity, where richer descriptions should result in stronger alignment with visual content.To address these limitations, we propose HiMo-CLIP, a representation-level framework that enhances CLIP-style models without modifying the encoder architecture. HiMo-CLIP introduces two key components: a hierarchical decomposition (HiDe) module that extracts latent semantic components from long-form text via in-batch PCA, enabling flexible, batch-aware alignment across different semantic granularities, and a monotonicity-aware contrastive loss (MoLo) that jointly aligns global and component-level representations, encouraging the model to internalize semantic ordering and alignment strength as a function of textual completeness.These components work in concert to produce structured, cognitively-aligned cross-modal representations. Experiments on multiple image-text retrieval benchmarks show that HiMo-CLIP consistently outperforms strong baselines, particularly under long or compositional descriptions.

However, current research tends to focus narrowly on single-object prompts with limited contextual diversity. In reality, each object or attribute within a prompt can contribute to bias. For example, the prompt \"an assistant wearing a pink hat\" may reflect female-inclined biases associated with a pink hat. The neglected joint effects of the semantic binding in the prompts cause significant failures in current debiasing approaches. This work initiates a preliminary investigation on how bias manifests under semantic binding, where contextual associations between objects and attributes influence generative outcomes. We demonstrate that the underlying bias distribution can be amplified based on these associations. Therefore, we introduce a bias adherence score that quantifies how specific object-attribute bindings activate bias. To delve deeper, we develop a training-free context-bias control framework to explore how token decoupling can facilitate the debiasing of semantic bindings. This framework achieves over 10% debiasing improvement in compositional generation tasks. Our analysis of bias scores across various attribute-object bindings and token decorrelation highlights a fundamental challenge: reducing bias without disrupting essential semantic relationships.

This limitation has driven the adoption of sensor fusion, among which camera-radar fusion stands out as a promising solution due to their complementary strengths. However, the sparsity and noise of the radar data limits its effectiveness, leading to suboptimal fusion performance. In this paper, we propose REOcc, a novel camera-radar fusion network designed to enrich radar feature representations for 3D occupancy prediction. Our approach introduces two main components, a Radar Densifier and a Radar Amplifier, which refine radar features by integrating spatial and contextual information, effectively enhancing spatial density and quality.

However, generative modeling for HSIs presents several challenges. Due to their high spectral dimensionality, HSIs are too memory-intensive for direct input into conventional diffusion models. Furthermore, general generative models lack an understanding of the topological and geometric structures of ground objects in remote sensing imagery. In addition, most diffusion models optimize loss functions at the noise level, leading to a non-intuitive convergence behavior and suboptimal generation quality for complex data. To address these challenges, we propose a Geometric Enhanced Wavelet-based Diffusion Model (GEWDiff), a novel framework for reconstructing hyperspectral images at 4-times super-resolution. A wavelet-based encoder-decoder is introduced that efficiently compresses HSIs into a latent space while preserving spectral-spatial information. To avoid distortion during generation, we incorporate a geometry-enhanced diffusion process that preserves the geometric features. Furthermore, a multi-level loss function was designed to guide the diffusion process, promoting stable convergence and improved reconstruction fidelity.

However, existing methods typically suffer from at least one of the following limitations, hindering their practical deployment: (1) lack of visual realism in generated anomalies; (2) dependence on large amounts of real images; and (3) use of memory-intensive, heavyweight model architectures. To overcome these limitations, we propose AnoStyler, a lightweight yet effective method that frames zero-shot anomaly generation as text-guided style transfer. Given a single normal image along with its category label and expected defect type, an anomaly mask indicating the localized anomaly regions and two-class text prompts representing the normal and anomaly states are generated using generalizable category-agnostic procedures.

Although this decoupling strategy simplifies the learning process, it inherently ignores the geometric collaborative constraints between different attributes, resulting in the lack of geometric consistency prior, thereby leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose novel Spatial-Projection Alignment (SPAN) with two pivotal components: (i). Spatial Point Alignment enforces an explicit global spatial constraint between the predicted and ground-truth 3D bounding boxes, thereby rectifying spatial drift caused by decoupled attribute regression. (ii). 3D-2D Projection Alignment ensures that the projected 3D box is aligned tightly within its corresponding 2D detection bounding box on the image plane, mitigating projection misalignment overlooked in previous works. To ensure training stability, we further introduce a Hierarchical Task Learning strategy that progressively incorporates spatial-projection alignment as 3D attribute predictions refine, preventing early stage error propagation across attributes.

We hypothesize that incorporating these linguistic cues can be especially beneficial in the complex contexts found in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.\n  To this end, we present a novel approach that trains a Text-Driven OOD Segmentation model to learn a semantically diverse set of objects in the vision-language space. Concretely, our approach combines a vision-language model's encoder with a transformer decoder, employs Distance-Based OOD prompts located at varying semantic distances from in-distribution (ID) classes, and utilizes OOD Semantic Augmentation for OOD representations. By aligning visual and textual information, our approach effectively generalizes to unseen objects and provides robust OOD segmentation in diverse driving environments.\n  We conduct extensive experiments on publicly available OOD segmentation datasets such as Fishyscapes, Segment-Me-If-You-Can, and Road Anomaly datasets, demonstrating that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across both pixel-level and object-level evaluations.

However, most existing methods compress images into 2-D latent spaces via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Swin Transformers, which tend to retain substantial spatial redundancy, thereby limiting overall compression performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Mixed RWKV-Transformer (MRT) architecture that encodes images into more compact 1-D latent representations by synergistically integrating the complementary strengths of linear-attention-based RWKV and self-attention-based Transformer models. Specifically, MRT partitions each image into fixed-size windows, utilizing RWKV modules to capture global dependencies across windows and Transformer blocks to model local redundancies within each window. The hierarchical attention mechanism enables more efficient and compact representation learning in the 1-D domain. To further enhance compression efficiency, we introduce a dedicated RWKV Compression Model (RCM) tailored to the structure characteristics of the intermediate 1-D latent features in MRT. Extensive experiments on standard image compression benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. The proposed MRT framework consistently achieves superior reconstruction quality at bitrates below 0.02 bits per pixel (bpp). Quantitative results based on the DISTS metric show that MRT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art 2-D architecture GLC, achieving bitrate savings of 43.75%, 30.59% on the Kodak and CLIC2020 test datasets, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMRT\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408RWKV\u548cTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a1D\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7CNNs\u6216Swin Transformers\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u52302D\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u76841D\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6df7\u5408RWKV-Transformer\uff08MRT\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u540c\u6574\u5408\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529bRWKV\u548c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529bTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u76841D\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u7528\u7684RWKV\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\uff08RCM\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "MRT\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u8282\u7701\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MRT\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\uff08\u4f4e\u4e8e0.02 bpp\uff09\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u67092D\u67b6\u6784GLC\uff0c\u5728Kodak\u548cCLIC2020\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8643.75%\u548c30.59%\u7684\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u8282\u7701\u3002"}}

Despite extensive research on OOD detection in 2D images, direct transfer to 3D LiDAR point clouds has been proven ineffective. Current LiDAR OOD methods struggle to distinguish rare anomalies from common classes, leading to high false-positive rates and overconfident errors in safety-critical settings. We propose Relative Energy Learning (REL), a simple yet effective framework for OOD detection in LiDAR point clouds. REL leverages the energy gap between positive (in-distribution) and negative logits as a relative scoring function, mitigating calibration issues in raw energy values and improving robustness across various scenes. To address the absence of OOD samples during training, we propose a lightweight data synthesis strategy called Point Raise, which perturbs existing point clouds to generate auxiliary anomalies without altering the inlier semantics. Evaluated on SemanticKITTI and the Spotting the Unexpected (STU) benchmark, REL consistently outperforms existing methods by a large margin.

Existing methods struggle with stylized avatars due to the lack of diverse multi-style datasets and challenges in maintaining geometric consistency in non-standard textures. To address these limitations, AvatarTex introduces a novel three-stage diffusion-to-GAN pipeline. Our key insight is that while diffusion models excel at generating diversified textures, they lack explicit UV constraints, whereas GANs provide a well-structured latent space that ensures style and topology consistency. By integrating these strengths, AvatarTex achieves high-quality topology-aligned texture synthesis with both artistic and geometric coherence. Specifically, our three-stage pipeline first completes missing texture regions via diffusion-based inpainting, refines style and structure consistency using GAN-based latent optimization, and enhances fine details through diffusion-based repainting. To address the need for a stylized texture dataset, we introduce TexHub, a high-resolution collection of 20,000 multi-style UV textures with precise UV-aligned layouts. By leveraging TexHub and our structured diffusion-to-GAN pipeline, AvatarTex establishes a new state-of-the-art in multi-style facial texture reconstruction.

Extended version with full Appendix", "summary": "Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) aims to adapt a source-pretrained object detector to a target domain without access to source data. However, existing SFOD methods predominantly rely on internal knowledge from the source model, which limits their capacity to generalize across domains and often results in biased pseudo-labels, thereby hindering both transferability and discriminability. In contrast, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pretrained on massive and diverse data, exhibit strong perception capabilities and broad generalization, yet their potential remains largely untapped in the SFOD setting. In this paper, we propose a novel SFOD framework that leverages VFMs as external knowledge sources to jointly enhance feature alignment and label quality. Specifically, we design three VFM-based modules: (1) Patch-weighted Global Feature Alignment (PGFA) distills global features from VFMs using patch-similarity-based weighting to enhance global feature transferability; (2) Prototype-based Instance Feature Alignment (PIFA) performs instance-level contrastive learning guided by momentum-updated VFM prototypes; and (3) Dual-source Enhanced Pseudo-label Fusion (DEPF) fuses predictions from detection VFMs and teacher models via an entropy-aware strategy to yield more reliable supervision.

Yet, developing downstream vision models for infrared applications is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data, due to the specialized expertise required for infrared annotation. While synthetic infrared image generation has the potential to accelerate model development by providing large-scale, diverse training data, training foundation-level generative diffusion models in the infrared domain has remained elusive due to limited datasets. In light of such data constraints, we explore an inference-time scaling approach using a domain-adapted CLIP-based verifier for enhanced infrared image generation quality. We adapt FLUX.1-dev, a state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model, to the infrared domain by finetuning it on a small sample of infrared images using parameter-efficient techniques. The trained verifier is then employed during inference to guide the diffusion sampling process toward higher quality infrared generations that better align with input text prompts. Empirically, we find that our approach leads to consistent improvements in generation quality, reducing FID scores on the KAIST Multispectral Pedestrian Detection Benchmark dataset by 10% compared to unguided baseline samples.

Existing datasets often overlook two critical characteristics of real rainy 3D scenes: the viewpoint-dependent variation in the appearance of rain streaks caused by their projection onto 2D images, and the reduction in ambient brightness resulting from cloud coverage during rainfall. To improve data realism, we construct a new dataset named OmniRain3D that incorporates perspective heterogeneity and brightness dynamicity, enabling more faithful simulation of rain degradation in 3D scenes. Based on this dataset, we propose an end-to-end reconstruction framework named REVR-GSNet (Rain Elimination and Visibility Recovery for 3D Gaussian Splatting).

Existing spatial MLLMs often rely on explicit 3D inputs or architecture-specific modifications, and remain constrained by large-scale datasets or sparse supervision. To address these limitations, we introduce SpatialThinker, a 3D-aware MLLM trained with RL to integrate structured spatial grounding with multi-step reasoning. The model simulates human-like spatial perception by constructing a scene graph of task-relevant objects and spatial relations, and reasoning towards an answer via dense spatial rewards. SpatialThinker consists of two key contributions: (1) a data synthesis pipeline that generates STVQA-7K, a high-quality spatial VQA dataset, and (2) online RL with a multi-objective dense spatial reward enforcing spatial grounding. SpatialThinker-7B outperforms supervised fine-tuning and the sparse RL baseline on spatial understanding and real-world VQA benchmarks, nearly doubling the base-model gain compared to sparse RL, and surpassing GPT-4o.

However, without a global understanding of both subjects and background, recognizing actions in such samples remains challenging because of the background distractions. Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), which learns interaction between various dimensions, shows promise for global modeling. While directly applying RWKV to wide-angle FSAR may fail to highlight subjects due to excessive background information. Additionally, temporal relation degraded by frames with similar backgrounds is difficult to reconstruct, further impacting performance. Therefore, we design the CompOund SegmenTation and Temporal REconstructing RWKV (Otter). Specifically, the Compound Segmentation Module~(CSM) is devised to segment and emphasize key patches in each frame, effectively highlighting subjects against background information. The Temporal Reconstruction Module (TRM) is incorporated into the temporal-enhanced prototype construction to enable bidirectional scanning, allowing better reconstruct temporal relation. Furthermore, a regular prototype is combined with the temporal-enhanced prototype to simultaneously enhance subject emphasis and temporal modeling, improving wide-angle FSAR performance. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as SSv2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51 demonstrate that Otter achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Recently, the integration of flow matching generative models into image restoration has garnered significant attention, owing to their powerful prior modeling capabilities. In this work, we incorporate such generative priors into a Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework based on proximal splitting, where the proximal operator associated with the regularizer is replaced by a time-dependent denoiser derived from the generative model. While existing PnP methods have achieved notable success in inverse problems with smooth squared $\\ell_2$ data fidelity--typically associated with Gaussian noise--their applicability to more general data fidelity terms remains underexplored. To address this, we propose a general and efficient PnP algorithm inspired by the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method. Our approach is computationally efficient, memory-friendly, and accommodates a wide range of fidelity terms. In particular, it supports both $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ norm-based losses, enabling robustness to non-Gaussian noise types such as Poisson and impulse noise. We validate our method on several image restoration tasks, including denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting, and demonstrate that $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ fidelity terms outperform the conventional squared $\\ell_2$ loss in the presence of non-Gaussian noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8ePDHG\u7684PnP\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u21131\u548c\u21132\u8303\u6570\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709PnP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5176\u5bf9\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u9879\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb-\u5bf9\u5076\u6df7\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\uff08PDHG\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684PnP\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5165PnP\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u21131\u548c\u21132\u8303\u6570\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u3001\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u21131\u548c\u21132\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u9879\u5728\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5e73\u65b9\u21132\u635f\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb-\u5bf9\u5076\u6df7\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\uff08PDHG\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684PnP\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\uff08\u5982\u6cca\u677e\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u8109\u51b2\u566a\u58f0\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5e73\u65b9\u21132\u635f\u5931\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To address this issue, we propose a novel network built upon decoupled HSV Look-Up Tables (LUTs). The method aims to simplify color correction by adjusting the Hue (H), Saturation (S), and Value (V) components independently. This approach resolves the inherent color coupling problems in traditional methods. Our model adopts a two-stage architecture: First, a Chroma-Aware Spectral Tokenizer (CAST) converts the input image from RGB space to HSV space and independently encodes the Hue (H) and Value (V) channels into a set of semantic tokens describing the Purple flare status; second, the HSV-LUT module takes these tokens as input and dynamically generates independent correction curves (1D-LUTs) for the three channels H, S, and V. To effectively train and validate our model, we built the first large-scale purple flare dataset with diverse scenes.

This issue stems from cloning-based densification, which propagates Gaussians along existing geometry, limiting exploration and requiring many primitives to adequately cover the scene. We present ConeGS, an image-space-informed densification framework that is independent of existing scene geometry state. ConeGS first creates a fast Instant Neural Graphics Primitives (iNGP) reconstruction as a geometric proxy to estimate per-pixel depth. During the subsequent 3DGS optimization, it identifies high-error pixels and inserts new Gaussians along the corresponding viewing cones at the predicted depth values, initializing their size according to the cone diameter. A pre-activation opacity penalty rapidly removes redundant Gaussians, while a primitive budgeting strategy controls the total number of primitives, either by a fixed budget or by adapting to scene complexity, ensuring high reconstruction quality.

Recently, denoisers induced by generative priors have been successfully integrated into regularized optimization methods for image restoration under Gaussian noise. However, their application to non-Gaussian noise--such as impulse noise--remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play image restoration framework based on generative diffusion priors for robust removal of general noise types, including impulse noise. Within the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation framework, the data fidelity term is adapted to the specific noise model. Departing from the conventional least-squares loss used for Gaussian noise, we introduce a generalized Gaussian scale mixture-based loss, which approximates a wide range of noise distributions and leads to an $\\ell_q$-norm ($0<q\\leq2$) fidelity term. This optimization problem is addressed using an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approach, wherein the proximal step involving the generative prior is efficiently performed via a diffusion-based denoiser.

To address this issue, we first propose a unified multi-distance subjective quality assessment method that closely mimics human viewing behavior for objects reconstructed with GS-based methods in actual applications, thereby better collecting perceptual experiences. Based on it, we also construct a novel GS quality assessment dataset named MUGSQA, which is constructed considering multiple uncertainties of the input data. These uncertainties include the quantity and resolution of input views, the view distance, and the accuracy of the initial point cloud.

Second, we present an \\textbf{Audio-to-Intensity (A2I) model} obtained through multimodal teacher-student knowledge distillation. By transforming audio and facial velocity features into a frame-wise intensity sequence, the A2I model enables joint modeling of audio and visual motion, resulting in more natural dynamics.

Third, we introduce a \\textbf{diffusion noise initialization strategy (IC-Init)}. By enforcing explicit constraints on background coherence and motion continuity during inference-time noise search, we achieve better identity preservation and refine motion dynamics compared to the current autoregressive strategy.

Recent approaches have relied on fully differentiable Material Point Method (MPM) and rendering for simultaneous optimization of these properties.

Submitted version", "summary": "While feature-based knowledge distillation has proven highly effective for compressing CNNs, these techniques unexpectedly fail when applied to Vision Transformers (ViTs), often performing worse than simple logit-based distillation. We provide the first comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon through a novel analytical framework termed as ``distillation dynamics\", combining frequency spectrum analysis, information entropy metrics, and activation magnitude tracking. Our investigation reveals that ViTs exhibit a distinctive U-shaped information processing pattern: initial compression followed by expansion. We identify the root cause of negative transfer in feature distillation: a fundamental representational paradigm mismatch between teacher and student models. Through frequency-domain analysis, we show that teacher models employ distributed, high-dimensional encoding strategies in later layers that smaller student models cannot replicate due to limited channel capacity. This mismatch causes late-layer feature alignment to actively harm student performance. Our findings reveal that successful knowledge transfer in ViTs requires moving beyond naive feature mimicry to methods that respect these fundamental representational constraints, providing essential theoretical guidance for designing effective ViTs compression strategies.

To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose Ambiguity-aware Truncated Flow Matching (ATFM), which introduces a novel inference paradigm and dedicated model components. Firstly, we propose Data-Hierarchical Inference, a redefinition of AMIS-specific inference paradigm, which enhances accuracy and diversity at data-distribution and data-sample level, respectively, for an effective disentanglement. Secondly, Gaussian Truncation Representation (GTR) is introduced to enhance both fidelity of predictions and reliability of truncation distribution, by explicitly modeling it as a Gaussian distribution at $T_{\\text{trunc}}$ instead of using sampling-based approximations.Thirdly, Segmentation Flow Matching (SFM) is proposed to enhance the plausibility of diverse predictions by extending semantic-aware flow transformation in Flow Matching (FM).

Yet, most models are trained to map short prompts into detailed images, creating a gap between sparse textual input and rich visual outputs. This mismatch reduces controllability, as models often fill in missing details arbitrarily, biasing toward average user preferences and limiting precision for professional use. We address this limitation by training the first open-source text-to-image model on long structured captions, where every training sample is annotated with the same set of fine-grained attributes. This design maximizes expressive coverage and enables disentangled control over visual factors. To process long captions efficiently, we propose DimFusion, a fusion mechanism that integrates intermediate tokens from a lightweight LLM without increasing token length. We also introduce the Text-as-a-Bottleneck Reconstruction (TaBR) evaluation protocol. By assessing how well real images can be reconstructed through a captioning-generation loop, TaBR directly measures controllability and expressiveness, even for very long captions where existing evaluation methods fail. Finally, we demonstrate our contributions by training the large-scale model FIBO, achieving state-of-the-art prompt alignment among open-source models.

However, their reliance on fixed-size rectangular patches often influences the integrity of complex vascular structures, leading to suboptimal segmentation accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose the adaptive Morph Patch Transformer (MPT), a novel architecture specifically designed for aortic vascular segmentation. Specifically, MPT introduces an adaptive patch partitioning strategy that dynamically generates morphology-aware patches aligned with complex vascular structures. This strategy can preserve semantic integrity of complex vascular structures within individual patches. Moreover, a Semantic Clustering Attention (SCA) method is proposed to dynamically aggregate features from various patches with similar semantic characteristics. This method enhances the model's capability to segment vessels of varying sizes, preserving the integrity of vascular structures.

In this experiment, we classify colorless microplastic particles (50-300 $\u03bc$m) by illuminating them with linearly polarized laser light and capturing their reflected signals using a polarization-sensitive camera. This reflection-based technique successfully circumvents the transmission-based interference issues that plague many conventional methods when applied in water. Using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for image-based classification, we successfully identified three common polymer types, high-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, and polypropylene, achieving a peak mean classification accuracy of 80% on the test dataset. A subsequent feature hierarchy analysis demonstrated that the CNN's decision-making process relies mainly on the microstructural integrity and internal texture (polarization patterns) of the particle rather than its macroshape. Critically, we found that the Angle of Linear Polarization (AOLP) signal is significantly more robust against contextual noise than the Degree of Linear Polarization (DOLP) signal. While the AOLP-based classification achieved superior overall performance, its strength lies in distinguishing between the two polyethylene plastics, showing a lower confusion rate between high-density and low-density polyethylene. Conversely, the DOLP signal demonstrated slightly worse overall classification results but excels at accurately identifying the polypropylene class, which it isolated with greater success than AOLP.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5c04\u5f0f\u504f\u632f\u5149\u6563\u5c04\u548cCNN\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6c34\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fae\u5851\u6599\u7684\u539f\u4f4d\u8bc6\u522b\uff0cAOLP\u548cDOLP\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u805a\u5408\u7269\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5404\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e94\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5fae\u5851\u6599\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6c34\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u504f\u632f\u6fc0\u5149\u7167\u5c04\u65e0\u8272\u5fae\u5851\u6599\u9897\u7c92\uff0850-300 \u03bcm\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u504f\u632f\u654f\u611f\u76f8\u673a\u6355\u6349\u53cd\u5c04\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CNN\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u805a\u4e59\u70ef\u3001\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u805a\u4e59\u70ef\u548c\u805a\u4e19\u70ef\u4e09\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u805a\u5408\u7269\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523080%\u3002AOLP\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u800cDOLP\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u805a\u4e19\u70ef\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u66f4\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5c04\u5f0f\u504f\u632f\u5149\u6563\u5c04\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6c34\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fae\u5851\u6599\u7684\u539f\u4f4d\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u900f\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eAOLP\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5728\u533a\u5206\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u805a\u4e59\u70ef\u548c\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u805a\u4e59\u70ef\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u800cDOLP\u4fe1\u53f7\u5219\u5728\u805a\u4e19\u70ef\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\u3002"}}

However, existing methods face two key limitations. Firstly, they often over-rely on high-certainty keywords that explicitly identify the target object while neglecting critical spatial descriptions. Secondly, generalized textual features contain both 2D and 3D descriptive information, thereby capturing an additional dimension of details compared to singular 2D or 3D visual features. This characteristic leads to cross-dimensional interference when refining visual features under text guidance. To overcome these challenges, we propose Mono3DVG-EnSD, a novel framework that integrates two key components: the CLIP-Guided Lexical Certainty Adapter (CLIP-LCA) and the Dimension-Decoupled Module (D2M). The CLIP-LCA dynamically masks high-certainty keywords while retaining low-certainty implicit spatial descriptions, thereby forcing the model to develop a deeper understanding of spatial relationships in captions for object localization. Meanwhile, the D2M decouples dimension-specific (2D/3D) textual features from generalized textual features to guide corresponding visual features at same dimension, which mitigates cross-dimensional interference by ensuring dimensionally-consistent cross-modal interactions.

In this study, we propose a novel CT-free solution to attenuation correction in cardiac SPECT. Specifically, we introduce Physics-aware Attenuation Correction Diffusion Model (PADM), a diffusion-based generative method that incorporates explicit physics priors via a teacher--student distillation mechanism. This approach enables attenuation artifact correction using only Non-Attenuation-Corrected (NAC) input, while still benefiting from physics-informed supervision during training. To support this work, we also introduce CardiAC, a comprehensive dataset comprising 424 patient studies with paired NAC and Attenuation-Corrected (AC) reconstructions, alongside high-resolution CT-based attenuation maps.

In this paper, we specifically target the perceptual enhancement of 3DGS-based video compression, based on the assumption that artifacts from 3DGS rendering and quantization resemble noisy latents sampled during diffusion training.

Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) with Vision Transformer backbones have recently shown strong potential for histopathology representation learning. However, conventional random patch sampling during MAE pretraining often includes irrelevant or noisy regions, limiting the model's ability to capture meaningful tissue patterns. In this paper, we present a lightweight and domain-adapted framework that brings structure and biological relevance into MAE-based learning through a wavelet-informed patch selection strategy.

However, recent studies reveal that point cloud classifiers are vulnerable to structured adversarial perturbations and geometric corruptions, posing risks to their deployment in safety-critical scenarios. Existing certified defenses limit point-wise perturbations but overlook subtle geometric distortions that preserve individual points yet alter the overall structure, potentially leading to misclassification. In this work, we propose FreqCert, a novel certification framework that departs from conventional spatial domain defenses by shifting robustness analysis to the frequency domain, enabling structured certification against global L2-bounded perturbations. FreqCert first transforms the input point cloud via the graph Fourier transform (GFT), then applies structured frequency-aware subsampling to generate multiple sub-point clouds. Each sub-cloud is independently classified by a standard model, and the final prediction is obtained through majority voting, where sub-clouds are constructed based on spectral similarity rather than spatial proximity, making the partitioning more stable under L2 perturbations and better aligned with the object's intrinsic structure. We derive a closed-form lower bound on the certified L2 robustness radius and prove its tightness under minimal and interpretable assumptions, establishing a theoretical foundation for frequency domain certification. Extensive experiments on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets demonstrate that FreqCert consistently achieves higher certified accuracy and empirical accuracy under strong perturbations.

Conventional defense mechanisms struggle to address the evolving landscape of multifaceted attack patterns. Through systematic analysis of existing defenses, we identify that their unsatisfactory performance primarily originates from an entangled feature space, where adversarial attacks can be performed easily. To this end, we present 3D-ANC, a novel approach that capitalizes on the Neural Collapse (NC) mechanism to orchestrate discriminative feature learning. In particular, NC depicts where last-layer features and classifier weights jointly evolve into a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF) arrangement, establishing maximally separable class prototypes. However, leveraging this advantage in 3D recognition confronts two substantial challenges: (1) prevalent class imbalance in point cloud datasets, and (2) complex geometric similarities between object categories. To tackle these obstacles, our solution combines an ETF-aligned classification module with an adaptive training framework consisting of representation-balanced learning (RBL) and dynamic feature direction loss (FDL). 3D-ANC seamlessly empowers existing models to develop disentangled feature spaces despite the complexity in 3D data distribution. Comprehensive evaluations state that 3D-ANC significantly improves the robustness of models with various structures on two datasets.

However, the open accessibility of VFMs also introduces critical security risks, as adversaries can exploit full knowledge of the VFMs to launch potent attacks. This paper investigates a novel and practical adversarial threat scenario: attacking downstream models or MLLMs fine-tuned from open-source VFMs, without requiring access to the victim task, training data, model query, and architecture. In contrast to conventional transfer-based attacks that rely on task-aligned surrogate models, we demonstrate that adversarial vulnerabilities can be exploited directly from the VFMs. To this end, we propose the Transferable Video Attack (TVA), a temporal-aware adversarial attack method that leverages the temporal representation dynamics of VFMs to craft effective perturbations. TVA integrates a bidirectional contrastive learning mechanism to maximize the discrepancy between the clean and adversarial features, and introduces a temporal consistency loss that exploits motion cues to enhance the sequential impact of perturbations. TVA avoids the need to train expensive surrogate models or access to domain-specific data, thereby offering a more practical and efficient attack strategy.

Data augmentation via synthetic fake face generation effectively enhances generalization, yet current SoTA methods rely on fixed strategies-raising a key question: Is a single static augmentation sufficient, or does the diversity of forgery features demand dynamic approaches? We argue existing methods overlook the evolving complexity of real-world forgeries (e.g., facial warping, expression manipulation), which fixed policies cannot fully simulate. To address this, we propose CRDA (Curriculum Reinforcement-Learning Data Augmentation), a novel framework guiding detectors to progressively master multi-domain forgery features from simple to complex. CRDA synthesizes augmented samples via a configurable pool of forgery operations and dynamically generates adversarial samples tailored to the detector's current learning state. Central to our approach is integrating reinforcement learning (RL) and causal inference. An RL agent dynamically selects augmentation actions based on detector performance to efficiently explore the vast augmentation space, adapting to increasingly challenging forgeries. Simultaneously, the agent introduces action space variations to generate heterogeneous forgery patterns, guided by causal inference to mitigate spurious correlations-suppressing task-irrelevant biases and focusing on causally invariant features.

However, its utility is significantly limited by the sparsity and low resolution of radar point clouds, which poses challenges for tasks requiring dense and accurate 3D perception. Despite that recent efforts have shown great potential by exploring generative approaches to address this issue, they often rely on dense voxel representations that are inefficient and struggle to preserve structural detail. To fill this gap, we make the key observation that latent diffusion models (LDMs), though successful in other modalities, have not been effectively leveraged for radar-based 3D generation due to a lack of compatible representations and conditioning strategies. We introduce RaLD, a framework that bridges this gap by integrating scene-level frustum-based LiDAR autoencoding, order-invariant latent representations, and direct radar spectrum conditioning.

These fixed label names can be unavailable, unreliable at scale, or become less relevant due to in-distribution shifts after deployment. Towards truly unsupervised OOD detection, we utilize widely available text corpora for positive label mining, bypassing the need for positives.

Current popular strategies adopt multilayer perceptron (MLP) as the backbone, supplemented by additional modules to enhance the network ability to handle context information, which is a known limitation of MLPs. In contrast, we introduce a novel perspective for capturing correspondence context information without extra design modules. To this end, we design a two-view correspondence pruning network called LeCoT, which can naturally leverage global context information at different stages. Specifically, the core design of LeCoT is the Spatial-Channel Fusion Transformer block, a newly proposed component that efficiently utilizes both spatial and channel global context information among sparse correspondences. In addition, we integrate the proposed prediction block that utilizes correspondence features from intermediate stages to generate a probability set, which acts as guiding information for subsequent learning phases, allowing the network to more effectively capture robust global context information.

While large image encoders, high-resolution images, and long-term temporal inputs can significantly enhance feature quality and deliver remarkable performance gains, these techniques are often incompatible in both training and inference due to computational resource constraints. Moreover, different tasks favor distinct feature representations, making it difficult for a single model to perform end-to-end inference across multiple tasks while maintaining accuracy comparable to that of single-task models. To alleviate these issues, we present the HENet and HENet++ framework for multi-task 3D perception and end-to-end autonomous driving. Specifically, we propose a hybrid image encoding network that uses a large image encoder for short-term frames and a small one for long-term frames. Furthermore, our framework simultaneously extracts both dense and sparse features, providing more suitable representations for different tasks, reducing cumulative errors, and delivering more comprehensive information to the planning module. The proposed architecture maintains compatibility with various existing 3D feature extraction methods and supports multimodal inputs.

Evaluating whether a painting faithfully reflects the music that inspired it poses a challenging perceptual assessment task. Existing methods primarily rely on emotion recognition models to assess the similarity between music and painting, but such models introduce considerable noise and overlook broader perceptual cues beyond emotion. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for music induced painting assessment that directly models perceptual coherence between music and visual art. We introduce MPD, the first large scale dataset of music painting pairs annotated by domain experts based on perceptual coherence. To better handle ambiguous cases, we further collect pairwise preference annotations. Building on this dataset, we present MPJudge, a model that integrates music features into a visual encoder via a modulation based fusion mechanism.

Inspired by the prevalent use of procedural generators in production 3D applications, we propose a sequentialized, graph-based procedural graph representation for 3D assets. We use this to learn to approximate the landscape of a procedural generator for image-based 3D reconstruction. We employ edge-based tokenization to encode the procedural graphs, and train a transformer prior to predict the next token conditioned on an input RGB image. Crucially, to enable better alignment of our generated outputs to an input image, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) guided sampling into our generation process, steering output procedural graphs towards more image-faithful reconstructions.

This highlights the urgent need for continuously updating AI-generated image detectors to adapt to new generators. To overcome low efficiency and catastrophic forgetting in detector updates, we propose LiteUpdate, a lightweight framework for updating AI-generated image detectors. LiteUpdate employs a representative sample selection module that leverages image confidence and gradient-based discriminative features to precisely select boundary samples. This approach improves learning and detection accuracy on new distributions with limited generated images, significantly enhancing detector update efficiency. Additionally, LiteUpdate incorporates a model merging module that fuses weights from multiple fine-tuning trajectories, including pre-trained, representative, and random updates. This balances the adaptability to new generators and mitigates the catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge. Experiments demonstrate that LiteUpdate substantially boosts detection performance in various detectors.

A critical flaw in existing methods is that the poison rate required for a successful attack induces a proportional, and thus noticeable, drop in Clean Accuracy (CA), undermining their stealthiness. This paper presents a new paradigm for clean-image attacks that minimizes this accuracy degradation by optimizing the trigger itself. We introduce Generative Clean-Image Backdoors (GCB), a framework that uses a conditional InfoGAN to identify naturally occurring image features that can serve as potent and stealthy triggers. By ensuring these triggers are easily separable from benign task-related features, GCB enables a victim model to learn the backdoor from an extremely small set of poisoned examples, resulting in a CA drop of less than 1%. Our experiments demonstrate GCB's remarkable versatility, successfully adapting to six datasets, five architectures, and four tasks, including the first demonstration of clean-image backdoors in regression and segmentation.

Trained with a two-stage strategy, Omni-View achieves a state-of-the-art score of 55.4 on the VSI-Bench benchmark, outperforming existing specialized 3D understanding models, while simultaneously delivering strong performance in both novel view synthesis and 3D scene generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Omni-View\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a213D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5728VSI-Bench\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22'\u751f\u6210\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7406\u89e3'\u7684\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5230\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "Omni-View\u7531\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u5757\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7eb9\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728VSI-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523055.4\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u4e13\u75283D\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u548c3D\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5f3a\u52b2\u3002", "conclusion": "Omni-View\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a213D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5168\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

This study introduces a remote sensing-driven framework to quantify WASH accessibility-specifically to water pumps, latrines, and bathing cubicles-in the Rohingya camps of Cox's Bazar, one of the world's most densely populated displacement settings. Detecting refugee shelters in such emergent camps presents substantial challenges, primarily due to their dense spatial configuration and irregular geometric patterns. Using sub-meter satellite images, we develop a semi-supervised segmentation framework that achieves an F1-score of 76.4% in detecting individual refugee shelters. Applying the framework across multi-year data reveals declining WASH accessibility, driven by rapid refugee population growth and reduced facility availability, rising from 25 people per facility in 2022 to 29.4 in 2025. Gender-disaggregated analysis further shows that women and girls experience reduced accessibility, in scenarios with inadequate safety-related segregation in WASH facilities. These findings suggest the importance of demand-responsive allocation strategies that can identify areas with under-served populations-such as women and girls-and ensure that limited infrastructure serves the greatest number of people in settings with fixed or shrinking budgets.

As collecting representative examples of all possible anomalies is infeasible, we tackle structural anomaly detection using a self-supervised autoencoder that learns to repair corrupted inputs. To this end, we introduce a corruption model that injects artificial disruptions into training images to mimic structural defects. While reminiscent of denoising autoencoders, our approach differs in two key aspects. First, instead of unstructured i.i.d.\\ noise, we apply structured, spatially coherent perturbations that make the task a hybrid of segmentation and inpainting. Second, and counterintuitively, we add and preserve Gaussian noise on top of the occlusions, which acts as a Tikhonov regularizer anchoring the Jacobian of the reconstruction function toward identity. This identity-anchored regularization stabilizes reconstruction and further improves both detection and segmentation accuracy.

However, current Video-LLMs still face challenges with long real-world videos. Recent methods have introduced a retrieval mechanism that retrieves query-relevant KV caches for question answering, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of long real-world videos. However, the compression and retrieval of KV caches are still not fully explored. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{StreamKV}, a training-free framework that seamlessly equips Video-LLMs with advanced KV cache retrieval and compression. Compared to previous methods that used uniform partitioning, StreamKV dynamically partitions video streams into semantic segments, which better preserves semantic information. For KV cache retrieval, StreamKV calculates a summary vector for each segment to retain segment-level information essential for retrieval. For KV cache compression, StreamKV introduces a guidance prompt designed to capture the key semantic elements within each segment, ensuring only the most informative KV caches are retained for answering questions.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is sensitive to acute ischemic stroke and is a common diagnostic method for stroke. However, manual lesion segmentation performed by experts is tedious, time-consuming, and prone to observer inconsistency. Automatic medical image analysis methods have been proposed to overcome this challenge. However, previous approaches have relied on hand-crafted features that may not capture the irregular and physiologically complex shapes of ischemic stroke lesions. In this study, we present a novel framework for quickly and automatically segmenting ischemic stroke lesions on various MRI sequences, including T1-weighted, T2-weighted, DWI, and FLAIR. The proposed methodology is validated on the ISLES 2015 Brain Stroke sequence dataset, where we trained our model using the Res-Unet architecture twice: first, with pre-existing weights, and then without, to explore the benefits of transfer learning. Evaluation metrics, including the Dice score and sensitivity, were computed across 3D volumes. Finally, a Majority Voting Classifier was integrated to amalgamate the outcomes from each axis, resulting in a comprehensive segmentation method.

However, existing approaches often neglect the deeper causal relationships and interactions between objects, which are critical for understanding anomalous behaviors. In this paper, we propose VADER, an LLM-driven framework for Video Anomaly unDErstanding, which integrates keyframe object Relation features with visual cues to enhance anomaly comprehension from video. Specifically, VADER first applies an Anomaly Scorer to assign per-frame anomaly scores, followed by a Context-AwarE Sampling (CAES) strategy to capture the causal context of each anomalous event. A Relation Feature Extractor and a COntrastive Relation Encoder (CORE) jointly model dynamic object interactions, producing compact relational representations for downstream reasoning. These visual and relational cues are integrated with LLMs to generate detailed, causally grounded descriptions and support robust anomaly-related question answering. Experiments on multiple real-world VAU benchmarks demonstrate that VADER achieves strong results across anomaly description, explanation, and causal reasoning tasks, advancing the frontier of explainable video anomaly analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "VADER\u662f\u4e00\u4e2aLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u7406\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u8c61\u5173\u7cfb\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5bf9\u8c61\u95f4\u6df1\u5c42\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u5f02\u5e38\u884c\u4e3a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002VADER\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "VADER\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u5f02\u5e38\u8bc4\u5206\u5668\u4e3a\u6bcf\u5e27\u5206\u914d\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u91c7\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u91c7\u6837(CAES)\u7b56\u7565\u6355\u83b7\u5f02\u5e38\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u7cfb\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5173\u7cfb\u7f16\u7801\u5668(CORE)\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u8c61\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u4e0eLLM\u96c6\u6210\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cVAU\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cVADER\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u6790\u7684\u524d\u6cbf\u3002", "conclusion": "VADER\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u5bf9\u8c61\u5173\u7cfb\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u751f\u6210\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We present YoNoSplat, a feedforward model that reconstructs high-quality 3D Gaussian Splatting representations from an arbitrary number of images. Our model is highly versatile, operating effectively with both posed and unposed, calibrated and uncalibrated inputs. YoNoSplat predicts local Gaussians and camera poses for each view, which are aggregated into a global representation using either predicted or provided poses. To overcome the inherent difficulty of jointly learning 3D Gaussians and camera parameters, we introduce a novel mixing training strategy. This approach mitigates the entanglement between the two tasks by initially using ground-truth poses to aggregate local Gaussians and gradually transitioning to a mix of predicted and ground-truth poses, which prevents both training instability and exposure bias. We further resolve the scale ambiguity problem by a novel pairwise camera-distance normalization scheme and by embedding camera intrinsics into the network. Moreover, YoNoSplat also predicts intrinsic parameters, making it feasible for uncalibrated inputs. YoNoSplat demonstrates exceptional efficiency, reconstructing a scene from 100 views (at 280x518 resolution) in just 2.69 seconds on an NVIDIA GH200 GPU.

The system can quickly detect and monitor dumped waste using a street-level camera and object detection algorithm. Data was collected from the Sangareddy district in Telangana, India. A series of comprehensive experiments was carried out using the proposed dataset to assess the accuracy and overall performance of various object detection models. Specifically, we performed an in-depth evaluation of YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLO11m, and RT-DETR on our dataset. Among these models, YOLO11m achieved the highest accuracy of 92.39\\% in waste detection, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting waste.

Previous image-based streaming diffusion models have powered efficient and creative live streaming products but have hit limits on temporal consistency due to the foundation of image-based designs. Recent advances in video diffusion have markedly improved temporal consistency and sampling efficiency for offline generation. However, offline generation systems primarily optimize throughput by batching large workloads. In contrast, live online streaming operates under strict service-level objectives (SLOs): time-to-first-frame must be minimal, and every frame must meet a per-frame deadline with low jitter. Besides, scalable multi-GPU serving for real-time streams remains largely unresolved so far. To address this, we present StreamDiffusionV2, a training-free pipeline for interactive live streaming with video diffusion models. StreamDiffusionV2 integrates an SLO-aware batching scheduler and a block scheduler, together with a sink-token--guided rolling KV cache, a motion-aware noise controller, and other system-level optimizations. Moreover, we introduce a scalable pipeline orchestration that parallelizes the diffusion process across denoising steps and network layers, achieving near-linear FPS scaling without violating latency guarantees. The system scales seamlessly across heterogeneous GPU environments and supports flexible denoising steps (e.g., 1--4), enabling both ultra-low-latency and higher-quality modes. Without TensorRT or quantization, StreamDiffusionV2 renders the first frame within 0.5s and attains 58.28 FPS with a 14B-parameter model and 64.52 FPS with a 1.3B-parameter model on four H100 GPUs, making state-of-the-art generative live streaming practical and accessible--from individual creators to enterprise-scale platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "StreamDiffusionV2\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u76f4\u64ad\u6d41\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7f16\u6392\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u76f4\u64ad\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76f4\u64ad\u6d41\u4e2d\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u79bb\u7ebf\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u76f4\u64ad\u6d41\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "StreamDiffusionV2\u96c6\u6210\u4e86SLO\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6279\u5904\u7406\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u3001\u5757\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u3001sink-token\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6eda\u52a8KV\u7f13\u5b58\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u566a\u58f0\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7b49\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\u7f16\u6392\uff0c\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5c42\u95f4\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u3002", "result": "StreamDiffusionV2\u5728\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528TensorRT\u6216\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u9996\u5e27\u6e32\u67d3\u65f6\u95f4\u5c0f\u4e8e0.5\u79d2\uff0c14B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u523058.28 FPS\uff0c1.3B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u523064.52 FPS\uff08\u56db\u5757H100 GPU\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "StreamDiffusionV2\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\u7f16\u6392\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u76f4\u64ad\u6d41\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ece\u4e2a\u4eba\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u5230\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u5e73\u53f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u6613\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The core idea of our work is to leverage the rich priors in well-trained video models to extract the common motion patterns and then embed them into a shared low-dimensional latent space. Specifically, we first generate multiple videos of the same object with diverse motions. We then embed each motion into a latent vector and train a shared motion decoder to learn the distribution of motions represented by a structured and compact motion representation, i.e., neural key point trajectories. The canonical 3D Gaussians are then driven by these key points and fused to model the geometry and appearance. During inference time with learned latent space, we can instantly sample diverse 3D motions in a single-forward pass and support several interesting applications including 3D motion interpolation and language-guided motion generation.
