But unfortunately, no fast algorithms are currently known for exact max-flow in several standard models of computation, such as the cut-query model and the fully-dynamic model.\n  Our main technical contribution is a sparsifier that preserves all minimum $s,t$-cuts in an unweighted graph, and can be constructed using only approximate max-flow computations. We then use this sparsifier to devise new algorithms for APMC in unweighted graphs in several computational models: (i) a randomized algorithm that makes $\\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$ cut queries to the input graph; (ii) a deterministic fully-dynamic algorithm with $n^{3/2+o(1)}$ worst-case update time; and (iii) a randomized two-pass streaming algorithm with space requirement $\\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$.

Here we consider a generalization of the well-known \\textsc{Cluster Deletion} problem, named \\textsc{Hedge Cluster Deletion}. The task is to compute the minimum number of hedges of a hedge graph so that their removal results in a graph that is isomorphic to a disjoint union of cliques. We show that for graphs that contain bounded size of vertex-disjoint 3-vertex-paths as subgraphs, \\textsc{Hedge Cluster Deletion} can be solved in polynomial time. Regarding its approximability, we prove that the problem is tightly connected to the related complexity of the \\textsc{Min Horn Deletion} problem, a well-known boolean CSP problem. Our connection shows that it is NP-hard to approximate \\textsc{Hedge Cluster Deletion} within factor $2^{O(\\log^{1-ε} r)}$ for any $ε>0$, where $r$ is the number of hedges in a given hedge graph.\n  Based on its classified (in)approximability and the difficulty imposed by the structure of almost all non-trivial graphs, we consider the hedge underlying structure. We give a polynomial-time algorithm with constant approximation ratio for \\textsc{Hedge Cluster Deletion} whenever each triangle of the input graph is covered by at most two hedges. On the way to this result, an interesting ingredient that we solved efficiently is a variant of the \\textsc{Vertex Cover} problem in which apart from the desired vertex set that covers the edge set, a given set of vertex-constraints should also be included in the solution. Moreover, as a possible workaround for the existence of efficient exact algorithms, we propose the hedge intersection graph which is the intersection graph spanned by the hedges. Towards this direction, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for \\textsc{Hedge Cluster Deletion} whenever the hedge intersection graph is acyclic."}

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate software development, most studies focus on isolated, single-agent function-level generation. This work examines how process structure and role specialization shape multi-agent LLM workflows for class-level code generation. We simulate a Waterfall-style development cycle covering Requirement, Design, Implementation, and Testing using three LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-Chat, and Claude-3.5-Haiku) on 100 Python tasks from the ClassEval benchmark. Our findings show that multi-agent workflows reorganize, rather than consistently enhance, model performance. Waterfall-style collaboration produces cleaner and more maintainable code but often reduces functional correctness (-37.8\\% for GPT-4o-mini and -39.8\\% for DeepSeek-Chat), with Claude-3.5-Haiku as a notable exception (+9.5\\%). Importantly, process constraints shift failure characteristics: structural issues such as missing code decrease, while semantic and validation errors become more frequent. Among all stages, Testing exerts the strongest influence by improving verification coverage but also introducing new reasoning failures, whereas Requirement and Design have comparatively modest effects. Overall, this study provides empirical evidence that software process structure fundamentally alters how LLMs reason, collaborate, and fail, revealing inherent trade-offs between rigid workflow discipline and flexible problem-solving in multi-agent code generation."}

Many indoor settings, however, include naturally occurring specular surfaces such as glass, glossy metal panels, and signage, that reflect both light and mmWave signals. Exploiting this dual reflectivity, we propose See and Beam, a low-cost framework that combines LiDAR sensing with passive specular reflectors to enhance mmWave connectivity under non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions. In this paper, as a proof of concept, we deploy three types of reflectors, glossy, smooth, and matte (non-specular), to evaluate joint LiDAR/mmWave reflection in an indoor scenario. We demonstrate that using LiDAR-mmWave co-reflective surfaces enables a co-located LiDAR sensor to map the NLoS environment, localize NLoS users, and identify viable communication reflection points. Experimental results at 60 GHz show that LiDAR-guided beam steering with co-reflective surfaces improves the minimum received signal strength by over 20 dB in deep NLoS regions. Moreover, LiDAR-derived angle-of-departure steering achieves performance comparable to exhaustive NLoS beam search. This low cost, and scalable framework serves as an effective alternative to configurable reflecting surfaces and enables robust mmWave connectivity in future 6G and beyond networks."}

To address these limitations, we propose the ScaleADFG framework, which consists of a fully automated dataset construction pipeline and a lightweight grasp generation network. Our dataset introduce an affordance-based algorithm to synthesize diverse tool-use grasp configurations without expert demonstrations, allowing flexible object-hand size ratios and enabling large robotic hands (compared to human hands) to grasp everyday objects effectively. Additionally, we leverage pre-trained models to generate extensive 3D assets and facilitate efficient retrieval of object affordances.

On top of this dataset, we train a lightweight, single-stage grasp generation network with a notably simple loss design, eliminating the need for post-refinement. This demonstrates the critical importance of large-scale datasets and multi-scale object variant for effective training. Extensive experiments in simulation and on real robot confirm that the ScaleADFG framework exhibits strong adaptability to objects of varying scales, enhancing functional grasp stability, diversity, and generalizability.

However, many existing approaches primarily focus on feature space consistency and classification personalization during local training, often neglecting the local adaptability of the extractor and the global generalization of the classifier. This oversight results in insufficient coordination and weak coupling between the components, ultimately degrading the overall model performance. To address this challenge, we propose FedeCouple, a federated learning method that balances global generalization and local adaptability at a fine-grained level. Our approach jointly learns global and local feature representations while employing dynamic knowledge distillation to enhance the generalization of personalized classifiers. We further introduce anchors to refine the feature space; their strict locality and non-transmission inherently preserve privacy and reduce communication overhead. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis proving that FedeCouple converges for nonconvex objectives, with iterates approaching a stationary point as the number of communication rounds increases. Extensive experiments conducted on five image-classification datasets demonstrate that FedeCouple consistently outperforms nine baseline methods in effectiveness, stability, scalability, and security. Notably, in experiments evaluating effectiveness, FedeCouple surpasses the best baseline by a significant margin of 4.3%."}

Previous studies introduced an exact mixed-integer programming (MIP) solver, along with datasets and a Gurobi implementation, showing that while the exact approach guarantees optimality, it becomes computationally inefficient for large-scale instances. To overcome this limitation, heuristic methods based on merging algorithms and shaking procedures were proposed, achieving solutions within approximately 1% deviation from the optimum. This work presents a novel and more efficient approach that attains high-accuracy, near-optimal solutions for large-scale JRA problems. The proposed method introduces a Partial Path Reconstructon (PPR) solver that first identifies key item-placeholder pairs to form a reduced subproblem, which is solved efficiently to refine the global solution. Using this PJAR framework, the initial heuristic merging solutions can be further improved, reducing the deviation by half. Moreover, the solution can be iteratively polished with PPR based solver along the optimization path to yield highly accurate tours. Additionally, a global Large-α constraint is incorporated into the JRA model to further enhance solution optimality. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets with n = 300, 500, and 1000 demonstrate that the proposed method consistently delivers almost optimal solutions, achieving an average deviation of 0.00% from the ground truth while maintaining high computational efficiency. Beyond the JRA problem, the proposed framework and methodologies exhibit strong potential for broader applications. The Framework can be applied to TSP and related optimization problems."}

In this area, Czumaj and Sohler (FOCS'19) proved that H-freeness (i.e. the property of excluding the graph H as a subgraph) can be tested with constant queries on planar graphs as well as on graph classes excluding a minor.\n  Using results from the sparsity toolkit, we propose a simpler alternative to the proof of Czumaj and Sohler, for a statement generalized to the broader notion of bounded expansion. That is, we prove that for any class C with bounded expansion and any graph H, testing H-freeness can be done with constant query complexity on any graph G in C, where the constant depends on H and C, but is independent of G.\n  While classes excluding a minor are prime examples of classes with bounded expansion, so are, for example, cubic graphs, graph classes with bounded maximum degree, graphs of bounded book thickness, or random graphs of bounded average degree."}

This paper investigates reinforcement learning (RL) solutions to optimize Wi-Fi's medium access control (MAC). In particular, a multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework is proposed for dynamic channel access (including both the primary channel and channel width) and contention window (CW) adjustment. In this setting, we study relevant learning design principles such as adopting joint or factorial action spaces (handled by a single agent (SA) and multiple agents (MA), respectively) and the importance of incorporating contextual information. Our simulation results show that cooperative MA architectures converge faster than their SA counterparts, as agents operate over smaller action spaces. Another key insight is that contextual MAB algorithms consistently outperform non-contextual ones, highlighting the value of leveraging side information in action selection. Moreover, in multi-player settings, results demonstrate that decentralized learners can achieve implicit coordination, although their greediness may degrade coexisting networks' performance and induce policy-chasing dynamics. Overall, these findings demonstrate that (contextual) MAB-based learning offers a practical and adaptive alternative to static IEEE 802.11 protocols, enabling more efficient and intelligent spectrum utilization."}

Evaluation of AI agents typically involves using a fixed set of benchmarks and computing multiple evaluation metrics for the agent. While sufficient for simple coding tasks, these benchmarks fall short for enterprise-scale agents, where services and requirements evolve continuously and ground-truth examples are sparse. We propose a process of benchmark generation that helps evolve the benchmarks as the requirements change and perform robust evaluation of evolving AI agents. We instantiate this approach for a case study of service migration from one deployment platform to another at a large public enterprise. Our approach relies on semi-structured documents where developers express the high-level intent, and uses state-of-the-art LLMs to generate benchmarks from just a small number of such documents. Overall, this process results in a maintainable evaluation framework, enabling rapid feedback on agent performance and facilitating targeted improvements."}

Among its mechanisms, TSN can coordinate transmission times network-wide to minimize queueing, ensuring low latency and bounded delay. This coordination is computed offline and yields a network-wide schedule. The Time-Aware Shaper (TAS), implemented in TSN bridges, protects high-priority scheduled traffic from lower-priority (best-effort) flows by periodically opening and closing priority queues according to this schedule. Deterministic Networking (DetNet), standardized by the IETF, provides similar guarantees at Layer 3 and can leverage TSN mechanisms such as TAS for that purpose. Commercially available TSN-capable switches typically implement TAS in hardware but rarely disclose internal processing delays such as queue opening latency. Such information is essential for precise scheduling but largely unavailable to system designers. In this work, we present P4-TAS, a P4-based implementation of the TAS on a hardware switching ASIC. Our design introduces a novel approach for periodic queue control using a continuous stream of internally generated TAS control frames. We identify and quantify three sources of internal delay on a nanosecond scale which also exist in other implementations that directly affect the precision of executed schedules, providing transparency for future implementations and scheduling algorithms. Moreover, we provide an MPLS/TSN translation layer that enables P4-TAS to operate within DetNet environments, allowing TSN time-based traffic shaping to be carried over high-speed 400 Gb/s forwarding. Finally, we evaluate the scalability of P4-TAS and compare it to available TAS implementations."}

The agent learns self-touch and hand regard behaviors through intrinsic rewards that mimic an infant's curiosity-driven exploration of its own body. For self-touch, high-dimensional tactile inputs are transformed into compact, meaningful representations, enabling efficient learning. The agent then discovers new tactile contacts through intrinsic rewards and curriculum learning that encourage broad body coverage, balance, and generalization. For hand regard, visual features of the hands, such as skin-color and shape, are learned through motor babbling. Then, intrinsic rewards encourage the agent to perform novel hand motions, and follow its hands with its gaze. A curriculum learning setup from single-hand to dual-hand training allows the agent to reach complex visual-motor coordination. The results of this work demonstrate that purely curiosity-based signals, with no external supervision, can drive coordinated multimodal learning, imitating an infant's progression from random motor babbling to purposeful behaviors."}

To address these gaps, we propose MoFa, a novel pretraining performance modeling framework that unifies multi-dimensional optimization features and fault tolerance. MoFa incorporates an enhanced cost model to accurately capture the effects of key optimizations and integrates a fault tolerance model based on historical cluster reliability data. Besides, a MoFa-based tuning system is developed to explore optimal pretraining performance and potential bottlenecks in various scenarios. Extensive modeling evaluations demonstrate that MoFa can achieve high prediction accuracy across various scenarios. In addition, through comprehensive tuning experiments, our framework systematically reveals the key factors influencing pretraining performance under different configurations, which provides solid a priori guidance for LLM pretraining system design and deployment."}

PriVi contains 424 hours of curated video, combining 174 hours from behavioral research across 11 settings with 250 hours of diverse web-sourced footage, assembled through a scalable data curation pipeline. We pretrain V-JEPA on PriVi to learn primate-specific representations and evaluate it using a lightweight frozen classifier. Across four benchmark datasets, ChimpACT, BaboonLand, PanAf500, and ChimpBehave, our approach consistently outperforms prior work, including fully finetuned baselines, and scales favorably with fewer labels.

To address these challenges, we introduce SynthTools, a flexible and scalable framework for generating synthetic tool ecosystems. Our framework consists of three core components: Tool Generation for automatic and scalable creation of diverse tools, Tool Simulation to emulate realistic tool behaviors, and Tool Audit to ensure correctness and consistency of tool simulation. To illustrate its scalability, we show that SynthTools can readily produce toolsets that span twice as many domains and twice as many tools per domain as prior work.

However, while these models often generate functionally correct outputs, we still lack a systematic understanding and evaluation of their non-functional qualities. Existing studies focus mainly on whether generated code passes the tests rather than whether it passes with quality. Guided by the ISO/IEC 25010 quality model, this study conducted three complementary investigations: a systematic review of 108 papers, two industry workshops with practitioners from multiple organizations, and an empirical analysis of patching real-world software issues using three LLMs. Motivated by insights from both the literature and practitioners, the empirical study examined the quality of generated patches on security, maintainability, and performance efficiency. Across the literature, we found that security and performance efficiency dominate academic attention, while maintainability and other qualities are understudied. In contrast, industry experts prioritize maintainability and readability, warning that generated code may accelerate the accumulation of technical debt. In our evaluation of functionally correct patches generated by three LLMs, improvements in one quality dimension often come at the cost of others. Runtime and memory results further show high variance across models and optimization strategies. Overall, our findings reveal a mismatch between academic focus, industry priorities, and model performance, highlighting the urgent need to integrate quality assurance mechanisms into LLM code generation pipelines to ensure that future generated code not only passes tests but truly passes with quality."}

Our core insight is that measurement expertise follows predictable compositional patterns that can be systematically automated. ArachNet operates through four specialized agents that mirror expert workflow, from problem decomposition to solution implementation. We validate ArachNet with progressively challenging Internet resilience scenarios. The system independently generates workflows that match expert-level reasoning and produce analytical outputs similar to specialist solutions. Generated workflows handle complex multi-framework integration that traditionally requires days of manual coordination. ArachNet lowers barriers to measurement workflow composition by automating the systematic reasoning process that experts use, enabling broader access to sophisticated measurement capabilities while maintaining the technical rigor required for research-quality analysis."}

We propose a novel task-level robust control architecture, L1-augmented Dynamical Systems (L1-DS), that explicitly handles the task-execution mismatch in tracking a nominal motion plan generated by any DS-based LfD scheme. Our framework augments any DS-based LfD model with a nominal stabilizing controller and an L1 adaptive controller.

Despite being highly performant, GPU systems suffer from performance variation at the node and cluster levels. Such performance variation significantly impacts both high-performance computing and artificial intelligence workloads, such as cutting-edge large language models (LLMs). We analyze the performance of a single-node multi-GPU system running LLM training, and observe that the kernel-level performance variation is highly correlated with concurrent computation communication (C3), a technique to overlap computation and communication across GPUs for performance gains. We then take a further step to reason that thermally induced straggling coupling with C3 impacts performance variation, coined as the Lit Silicon effect. Lit Silicon describes that in a multi-GPU node, thermal imbalance across GPUs introduces node-level straggler GPUs, which in turn slow down the leader GPUs. Lit Silicon leads to node-level performance variation and inefficiency, impacting the entire datacenter from the bottom up. We propose analytical performance and power models for Lit Silicon, to understand the potential system-level gains. We further design simple detection and mitigation techniques to effectively address the Lit Silicon problem, and evaluate three different power management solutions, including power optimization under GPU thermal design power, performance optimization under node-level GPU power capping, and performance optimization under node-level CPU power sloshing. We conduct experiments on two workloads on two AMD InstinctTM MI300X GPU systems under two LLM training frameworks, and observe up to 6% performance and 4% power improvements, potentially saving hundreds of millions of dollars in datacenters. Our solution is almost free lunch and can be effortlessly adopted in datacenters as a new node-level power management layer."}

In this work, we present the first method for automatically classifying phonotrauma severity from vocal fold images. To account for the ordinal nature of the labels, we adopt a widely used ordinal regression framework. To account for label uncertainty, we propose a novel modification to ordinal regression loss functions that enables them to operate on soft labels reflecting annotator rating distributions. Our proposed soft ordinal regression method achieves predictive performance approaching that of clinical experts, while producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. By providing an automated tool for phonotrauma severity assessment, our work can enable large-scale studies of phonotrauma, ultimately leading to improved clinical understanding and patient care."}

Traditionally, AI has addressed reasoning in the context of logic-based representations of knowledge.

Still, despite ongoing discussions about what reasoning is in language models, it is still not easy to articulate to what extent these models are actually capable of reasoning.\n  The goal of this workshop is to create a platform for researchers from different disciplines and/or AI perspectives to explore approaches and techniques with the aim to reconcile reasoning between language models using transformers and logic-based representations. The specific objectives include analysing the reasoning abilities of language models measured alongside KR methods, injecting KR-style reasoning abilities into language models (including by neuro-symbolic means), and formalising the kind of reasoning language models carry out. This exploration aims to uncover how language models can effectively integrate and leverage knowledge and reasoning with it, thus improving their application and utility in areas where precision and reliability are key requirements."}

Analyzing these warnings and training machine learning models to identify and filter them requires substantial datasets, which are currently scarce, particularly for Java. This scarcity impedes efforts to improve the accuracy and usability of SCA tools and mitigate the effects of alert fatigue. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a novel methodology for collecting and categorizing SCA warnings, effectively distinguishing actionable from non-actionable ones. We further leverage this methodology to generate a large-scale dataset of over 1 million entries of Java source code warnings, named NASCAR: (Non-)Actionable Static Code Analysis Reports.

Results show that MO-HAN consistently outperforms static and fair-distribution baselines by lowering mean and tail latencies, while reducing handovers by nearly 50% compared to pure opportunistic selection. These gains arise without intrusive instrumentation or heavy learning infrastructure, making MO-HAN practical for resource-constrained embedded devices."}

Planning informative and safe trajectories in such settings is challenging because information decays when regions are not revisited. Most existing planners model information as static or uniformly decaying, ignoring environments where the decay rate varies spatially; those that model non-uniform decay often overlook how it evolves along the robot's motion, and almost all treat safety as a soft penalty. In this paper, we address these challenges. We model uncertainty in the environment using clarity, a normalized representation of differential entropy from our earlier work that captures how information improves through new measurements and decays over time when regions are not revisited. Building on this, we present Stein Variational Clarity-Aware Informative Planning, a framework that embeds clarity dynamics within trajectory optimization and enforces safety through a low-level filtering mechanism based on our earlier gatekeeper framework for safety verification. The planner performs Bayesian inference-based learning via Stein variational inference, refining a distribution over informative trajectories while filtering each nominal Stein informative trajectory to ensure safety. Hardware experiments and simulations across environments with varying decay rates and obstacles demonstrate consistent safety and reduced information deficits."}

We introduce SliderEdit, a framework for continuous image editing with fine-grained, interpretable instruction control. Given a multi-part edit instruction, SliderEdit disentangles the individual instructions and exposes each as a globally trained slider, allowing smooth adjustment of its strength. Unlike prior works that introduced slider-based attribute controls in text-to-image generation, typically requiring separate training or fine-tuning for each attribute or concept, our method learns a single set of low-rank adaptation matrices that generalize across diverse edits, attributes, and compositional instructions. This enables continuous interpolation along individual edit dimensions while preserving both spatial locality and global semantic consistency. We apply SliderEdit to state-of-the-art image editing models, including FLUX-Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit, and observe substantial improvements in edit controllability, visual consistency, and user steerability.

Generating diverse SMT solutions helps uncover faults and detect safety violations during the verification and testing process, resulting in the SMT sampling problem, i.e., constructing a small number of solutions while achieving comprehensive coverage of the constraint space. While high coverage is crucial for exploring system behaviors, reducing the number of solutions is of great importance, as excessive solutions increase testing time and resource usage, undermining efficiency. In this work, we introduce PanSampler, a novel SMT sampler that achieves high coverage with a small number of solutions. It incorporates three novel techniques, i.e., diversity-aware SMT algorithm, abstract syntax tree (AST)-guided scoring function and post-sampling optimization technology, enhancing its practical performance. It iteratively samples solutions, evaluates candidates, and employs local search to refine solutions, ensuring high coverage with a small number of samples. Extensive experiments on practical benchmarks demonstrate that PanSampler exhibits a significantly stronger capability to reach high target coverage, while requiring fewer solutions than current samplers to achieve the same coverage level. Furthermore, our empirical evaluation on practical subjects, which are collected from real-world software systems, shows that PanSampler achieves higher fault detection capability and reduces the number of required test cases from 32.6\\% to 76.4\\% to reach the same fault detection effectiveness, leading to a substantial improvement in testing efficiency.

The transformation enables a volume change from 255.00 cm3 to 423.75 cm3, modulating the buoyant force to counteract a downward force of 3.237 N due to 330 g mass of the robot. A bell-crank linkage is integrated with the scissor-lift mechanism, which adjusts the servo-actuated limbs by 90 degrees, allowing a seamless transition between crawling and swimming modes. The robot is fully waterproof, using thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) fabric to ensure functionality in aquatic environments. The robot can operate untethered for two hours with an onboard battery of 1000 mA h. Our experimental results demonstrate multi-environment locomotion, including crawling on the land, crawling on the underwater floor, swimming on the water surface, and bimodal buoyancy adjustment to submerge underwater or resurface. These findings show the potential of shape morphing to create versatile and energy efficient robotic platforms suitable for diverse environments."}

This paper proposes a lightweight server-selection method for edge applications that fuses latency prediction with adaptive reliability and hysteresis-based handover. Using passive measurements (arrival rate, utilization, payload size) and an exponentially modulated rational delay model, the proposed Moderate Handover (MO-HAN) method computes a score that balances predicted latency and reliability to ensure handovers occur only when the expected gain is meaningful and maintain reduced end-to-end latency. Results show that MO-HAN consistently outperforms static and fair-distribution baselines by lowering mean and tail latencies, while reducing handovers by nearly 50% compared to pure opportunistic selection. These gains arise without intrusive instrumentation or heavy learning infrastructure, making MO-HAN practical for resource-constrained embedded devices."}

A regression branch is incorporated into the model for precise feature extraction, while a consolidation mechanism combines these maps based on similarity scores to produce a robust final result. An event-driven sampling technique, utilizing the Farneback optical flow algorithm, is introduced to selectively capture frames showing significant crowd movements, reducing computational load and storage by focusing on critical crowd dynamics. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, including overlay plots and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the model demonstrates its ability to effectively capture crowd dynamics in both dense and sparse settings. The efficiency of the sampling method is further assessed, showcasing its capability to decrease frame counts while maintaining essential crowd events. By addressing the temporal challenges unique to video analysis, this work offers a scalable and efficient framework for real-time crowd monitoring in applications such as public safety, disaster response, and event management."}

Thus Audio Reasoning Models (ARMs), i.e., audio LMs that can reason, are becoming increasingly popular. However, no work has studied the safety of ARMs against jailbreak attacks that aim to elicit harmful responses from target models. To this end, first, we show that standard RT with appropriate safety reasoning data can protect ARMs from vanilla audio jailbreaks, but cannot protect them against our proposed simple yet effective jailbreaks. We show that this is because of the significant representation drift between vanilla and advanced jailbreaks which forces the target ARMs to emit harmful responses. Based on this observation, we propose Rebellion, a robust RT that trains ARMs to be robust to the worst-case representation drift. All our results are on Qwen2-Audio; they demonstrate that Rebellion: 1) can protect against advanced audio jailbreaks without compromising performance on benign tasks, and 2) significantly improves accuracy-safety trade-off over standard RT method."}

Finally, we construct downstream tasks from the generated tools that even state-of-the-art models struggle to complete.

To address this, we investigate the performance of policies trained by existing methods across different scene layout factors via automate the data generation for those factors that significantly impact generalization. We have created a more extensively randomized dataset that can be efficiently and automatically generated with only a small amount of human demonstration. The dataset covers five types of manipulators and two types of grippers, incorporating extensive randomization factors such as camera pose, lighting conditions, tabletop texture, and table height across six manipulation tasks. We found that all of these factors influence the generalization ability of the policy. Applying any form of randomization enhances policy generalization, with diverse trajectories particularly effective in bridging visual gap.

We investigate one such failure, echoing, where agents abandon their assigned roles and instead mirror their conversational partners, undermining their intended objectives.

However, vision-only VLA models create fundamental limitations, particularly in perceiving interactive and manipulation dynamic processes. This paper proposes Audio-VLA, a multimodal manipulation policy that leverages contact audio to perceive contact events and dynamic process feedback. Audio-VLA overcomes the vision-only constraints of VLA models. Additionally, this paper introduces the Task Completion Rate (TCR) metric to systematically evaluate dynamic operational processes. Audio-VLA employs pre-trained DINOv2 and SigLIP as visual encoders, AudioCLIP as the audio encoder, and Llama2 as the large language model backbone. We apply LoRA fine-tuning to these pre-trained modules to achieve robust cross-modal understanding of both visual and acoustic inputs. A multimodal projection layer aligns features from different modalities into the same feature space. Moreover RLBench and LIBERO simulation environments are enhanced by adding collision-based audio generation to provide realistic sound feedback during object interactions. Since current robotic manipulation evaluations focus on final outcomes rather than providing systematic assessment of dynamic operational processes, the proposed TCR metric measures how well robots perceive dynamic processes during manipulation, creating a more comprehensive evaluation metric. Extensive experiments on LIBERO, RLBench, and two real-world tasks demonstrate Audio-VLA's superior performance over vision-only comparative methods, while the TCR metric effectively quantifies dynamic process perception capabilities."}

Deep learning models have recently achieved promising results by implicitly learning such patterns from 2D trajectory data. However, most approaches treat pedestrians as point entities, ignoring the physical space that each person occupies. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel deep learning model that enhances the Social LSTM with a new Dynamic Occupied Space loss function. This loss function guides Social LSTM in learning to avoid realistic collisions without increasing displacement error across different crowd densities, ranging from low to high, in both homogeneous and heterogeneous density settings. Such a function achieves this by combining the average displacement error with a new collision penalty that is sensitive to scene density and individual spatial occupancy. For efficient training and evaluation, five datasets were generated from real pedestrian trajectories recorded during the Festival of Lights in Lyon 2022. Four datasets represent homogeneous crowd conditions -- low, medium, high, and very high density -- while the fifth corresponds to a heterogeneous density distribution. The experimental findings indicate that the proposed model not only lowers collision rates but also enhances displacement prediction accuracy in each dataset. Specifically, the model achieves up to a 31% reduction in the collision rate and reduces the average displacement error and the final displacement error by 5% and 6%, respectively, on average across all datasets compared to the baseline. Moreover, the proposed model consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art deep learning models across most test sets."}

Instead, it may be easier to directly describe algorithmic bias through ad-hoc assumptions specific to a particular real-world task, e.g., based on background information on systemic biases in its context. Such assumptions can, in turn, be used to mitigate this bias during training. Yet, a framework for incorporating such assumptions that is simultaneously principled, flexible, and interpretable is currently lacking.\n  Our approach is to formalize bias assumptions as programs in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language that allows for the description of probabilistic causal relationships through logic. Neurosymbolic extensions of ProbLog then allow for easy integration of these assumptions in a neural network's training process. We propose a set of templates to express different types of bias and show the versatility of our approach on synthetic tabular datasets with known biases. Using estimates of the bias distortions present, we also succeed in mitigating algorithmic bias in real-world tabular and image data. We conclude that ProbLog4Fairness outperforms baselines due to its ability to flexibly model the relevant bias assumptions, where other methods typically uphold a fixed bias type or notion of fairness."}

It remains unclear how pre-training domain (medical vs. general), paradigm (e.g., text-guided), and architecture influence embedding quality, hindering the selection of optimal encoders for specific radiology tasks. To address this, we evaluate vision encoders from eight medical and general-domain FMs for chest X-ray analysis. We benchmark classification (pneumothorax, cardiomegaly) and segmentation (pneumothorax, cardiac boundary) using linear probing and fine-tuning. Our results show that domain-specific pre-training provides a significant advantage; medical FMs consistently outperformed general-domain models in linear probing, establishing superior initial feature quality. However, feature utility is highly task-dependent. Pre-trained embeddings were strong for global classification and segmenting salient anatomy (e.g., heart). In contrast, for segmenting complex, subtle pathologies (e.g., pneumothorax), all FMs performed poorly without significant fine-tuning, revealing a critical gap in localizing subtle disease. Subgroup analysis showed FMs use confounding shortcuts (e.g., chest tubes for pneumothorax) for classification, a strategy that fails for precise segmentation. We also found that expensive text-image alignment is not a prerequisite; image-only (RAD-DINO) and label-supervised (Ark+) FMs were among top performers. Notably, a supervised, end-to-end baseline remained highly competitive, matching or exceeding the best FMs on segmentation tasks. These findings show that while medical pre-training is beneficial, architectural choices (e.g., multi-scale) are critical, and pre-trained features are not universally effective, especially for complex localization tasks where supervised models remain a strong alternative."}

Traditional static friction models (such as the Stribeck model) are widely used due to their simple forms; however, they typically require predefined functional assumptions, which poses significant challenges when dealing with unknown functional structures. To address this issue, this paper proposes a physics-inspired machine learning approach based on the Kolmogorov Arnold Network (KAN) for static friction modeling of robotic joints. The method integrates spline activation functions with a symbolic regression mechanism, enabling model simplification and physical expression extraction through pruning and attribute scoring, while maintaining both high prediction accuracy and interpretability. We first validate the method's capability to accurately identify key parameters under known functional models, and further demonstrate its robustness and generalization ability under conditions with unknown functional structures and noisy data. Experiments conducted on both synthetic data and real friction data collected from a six-degree-of-freedom industrial manipulator show that the proposed method achieves a coefficient of determination greater than 0.95 across various tasks and successfully extracts concise and physically meaningful friction expressions. This study provides a new perspective for interpretable and data-driven robotic friction modeling with promising engineering applicability."}

Because of the rich texture of iris images, which spans a wide range of spatial frequencies, synthesizing same-identity iris images while controlling specific attributes remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a new iris image augmentation strategy by traversing a generative model's latent space toward latent codes that represent same-identity samples but with some desired iris image properties manipulated. The latent space traversal is guided by a gradient of specific geometrical, textural, or quality-related iris image features (e.g., sharpness, pupil size, iris size, or pupil-to-iris ratio) and preserves the identity represented by the image being manipulated. The proposed approach can be easily extended to manipulate any attribute for which a differentiable loss term can be formulated. Additionally, our approach can use either randomly generated images using either a pre-train GAN model or real-world iris images. We can utilize GAN inversion to project any given iris image into the latent space and obtain its corresponding latent code."}

To address these limitations, we introduce SlideBot - a modular, multi-agent slide generation framework that integrates LLMs with retrieval, structured planning, and code generation. SlideBot is organized around three pillars: informativeness, ensuring deep and contextually grounded content; reliability, achieved by incorporating external sources through retrieval; and practicality, which enables customization and iterative feedback through instructor collaboration. It incorporates evidence-based instructional design principles from Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML), using structured planning to manage intrinsic load and consistent visual macros to reduce extraneous load and enhance dual-channel learning. Within the system, specialized agents collaboratively retrieve information, summarize content, generate figures, and format slides using LaTeX, aligning outputs with instructor preferences through interactive refinement. Evaluations from domain experts and students in AI and biomedical education show that SlideBot consistently enhances conceptual accuracy, clarity, and instructional value. These findings demonstrate SlideBot's potential to streamline slide preparation while ensuring accuracy, relevance, and adaptability in higher education."}

However, existing approaches typically rely on a manually annotated segmentation mask of the target in the first frame, which is labor-intensive and leads to reduced performance when faced with occlusions or rapid movement. To address these limi- tations, we propose STORM (Segment, Track, and Object Re-localization from a single 3D Model), an open-source robust real-time 6D pose estimation system that requires no manual annotation. STORM employs a novel three-stage pipeline combining vision-language understanding with self-supervised feature matching: contextual object descriptions guide localization, self-cross-attention mechanisms identify candidate regions, and a segmentation model produces precise masks for accurate pose estimation. Another key innovation is our automatic re-registration mechanism that detects tracking failures through feature similarity monitoring and recovers from severe occlusions or rapid motion. STORM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging industrial datasets featuring multi-object occlusions, high-speed motion, and varying illumination, while operating at real-time speeds without additional training. This annotation-free approach significantly reduces deployment overhead, providing a practical solution for modern applications, such as flexible manufacturing and intelligent quality control."}

We investigate two fundamental priors for improving learning efficiency: decomposing manipulation trajectories into sequential alignment and interaction phases, and retrieval-based generalisation. Through 3,450 real-world rollouts, we systematically study this decomposition. We compare different design choices for the alignment and interaction phases, and examine generalisation and scaling trends relative to today's dominant paradigm of behavioural cloning with a single-phase monolithic policy. In the few-demonstrations-per-task regime (<10 demonstrations), decomposition achieves an order of magnitude improvement in data efficiency over single-phase learning, with retrieval consistently outperforming behavioural cloning for both alignment and interaction. Building on these insights, we develop Multi-Task Trajectory Transfer (MT3), an imitation learning method based on decomposition and retrieval. MT3 learns everyday manipulation tasks from as little as a single demonstration each, whilst also generalising to novel object instances. This efficiency enables us to teach a robot 1,000 distinct everyday tasks in under 24 hours of human demonstrator time. Through 2,200 additional real-world rollouts, we reveal MT3's capabilities and limitations across different task families.

While pre-trained models (PTMs) are increasingly leveraged for EFCL, existing methods often overlook the inherent imbalance of real-world data distributions. We discovered that real-world data streams commonly exhibit dual-level imbalances, dataset-level distributions combined with extreme or reversed skews within individual tasks, creating both intra-task and inter-task disparities that hinder effective learning and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose PANDA, a Patch-and-Distribution-Aware Augmentation framework that integrates seamlessly with existing PTM-based EFCL methods. PANDA amplifies low-frequency classes by using a CLIP encoder to identify representative regions and transplanting those into frequent-class samples within each task. Furthermore, PANDA incorporates an adaptive balancing strategy that leverages prior task distributions to smooth inter-task imbalances, reducing the overall gap between average samples across tasks and enabling fairer learning with frozen PTMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate PANDA's capability to work with existing PTM-based CL methods, improving accuracy and reducing catastrophic forgetting."}

In this work, we introduce Spectrum-Aware Test-Time Steering (STS), a lightweight adaptation framework that extracts a spectral subspace from the textual embeddings to define principal semantic directions and learns to steer latent representations in a spectrum-aware manner by adapting a small number of per-sample shift parameters to minimize entropy across augmented views. STS operates entirely at inference in the latent space, without backpropagation through or modification of the frozen encoders. Building on standard evaluation protocols, our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that STS largely surpasses or compares favorably against state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods, while introducing only a handful of additional parameters and achieving inference speeds up to 8x faster with a 12x smaller memory footprint than conventional test-time prompt tuning.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that our reactive agent model produces more realistic, diverse, and human-like traffic behaviors, leading to a benchmark environment that better reflects real-world interactive driving.

Trained once on a single dataset, Lumos3D performs inference in a purely feed- forward manner, directly restoring illumination and structure from unposed, low-light multi-view images without any per- scene training or optimization. Built upon a geometry-grounded backbone, Lumos3D reconstructs a normal-light 3D Gaussian representation that restores illumination while faithfully pre- serving structural details. During training, a cross-illumination distillation scheme is employed, where the teacher network is distilled on normal-light ground truth to transfer accurate geometric information, such as depth, to the student model. A dedicated Lumos loss is further introduced to promote photomet- ric consistency within the reconstructed 3D space.

By representing humans and scenes as Gaussians, our approach allows for geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of humans interacting with 3D scenes. Our key insight is that the rendering can be decoupled from the motion synthesis and each sub-problem can be addressed independently, without the need for paired human-scene data. Central to our method is a Gaussian-aligned motion module that synthesizes motion without explicit scene geometry, using opacity-based cues and projected Gaussian structures to guide human placement and pose alignment. To ensure natural interactions, we further propose a human-scene Gaussian refinement optimization that enforces realistic contact and navigation. We evaluate our approach on scenes from Scannet++ and the SuperSplat library, and on avatars reconstructed from sparse and dense multi-view human capture. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework allows for novel applications such as geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of edited monocular RGB videos with new animated humans, showcasing the unique advantage of 3DGS for monocular video-based human animation."}

Frontier AI systems may be deployed in safety-critical settings, including to help ensure the safety of future systems. Unfortunately, frontier and future systems may not be sufficiently trustworthy, and there is evidence that these systems may even be misaligned with their developers or users. Therefore, we investigate the capabilities of AI agents to act against the interests of their users when conducting ML engineering, by sabotaging ML models, sandbagging their performance, and subverting oversight mechanisms. First, we extend MLE-Bench, a benchmark for realistic ML tasks, with code-sabotage tasks such as implanting backdoors and purposefully causing generalisation failures. Frontier agents make meaningful progress on our sabotage tasks. In addition, we study agent capabilities to sandbag on MLE-Bench. Agents can calibrate their performance to specified target levels below their actual capability. To mitigate sabotage, we use LM monitors to detect suspicious agent behaviour, and we measure model capability to sabotage and sandbag without being detected by these monitors. Overall, monitors are capable at detecting code-sabotage attempts but our results suggest that detecting sandbagging is more difficult. Additionally, aggregating multiple monitor predictions works well, but monitoring may not be sufficiently reliable to mitigate sabotage in high-stakes domains. Our benchmark is implemented in the UK AISI's Inspect framework and we make our code publicly available at https://github.com/samm393/mlebench-subversion"}

These properties make origami increasingly valuable in robotic and deployable systems. However, accurately simulating their folding behavior and interactions with the environment remains challenging. To address this, we present a design framework for origami mechanism simulation that utilizes MuJoCo's deformable-body capabilities. In our approach, origami sheets are represented as graphs of interconnected deformable elements with user-specified constraints such as creases and actuation, defined through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). This framework allows users to generate physically consistent simulations that capture both the geometric structure of origami mechanisms and their interactions with external objects and surfaces. We demonstrate our method's utility through a case study on an origami catapult, where design parameters are optimized in simulation using the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) and validated experimentally on physical prototypes. The optimized structure achieves improved throwing performance, illustrating how our system enables rapid, simulation-driven origami design, optimization, and analysis."}

These attacks can be physically deployed, posing serious risks to real-world applications. In this paper, we propose CertMask, a certifiably robust defense that constructs a provably sufficient set of binary masks to neutralize patch effects with strong theoretical guarantees. While the state-of-the-art approach (PatchCleanser) requires two rounds of masking and incurs $O(n^2)$ inference cost, CertMask performs only a single round of masking with $O(n)$ time complexity, where $n$ is the cardinality of the mask set to cover an input image. Our proposed mask set is computed using a mathematically rigorous coverage strategy that ensures each possible patch location is covered at least $k$ times, providing both efficiency and robustness. We offer a theoretical analysis of the coverage condition and prove its sufficiency for certification. Experiments on ImageNet, ImageNette, and CIFAR-10 show that CertMask improves certified robust accuracy by up to +13.4\\% over PatchCleanser, while maintaining clean accuracy nearly identical to the vanilla model."}

However, existing approaches face several challenges: (i) indiscriminate generation that ignores the solver's ability and yields low-value problems, or reliance on complex data pipelines to balance problem difficulty; and (ii) a lack of reasoning in problem generation, leading to shallow problem variants. In this paper, we develop a problem generator that reasons explicitly to plan problem directions before synthesis and adapts difficulty to the solver's ability. Specifically, we construct related problem pairs and augment them with intermediate problem-design CoT produced by a reasoning model. These data bootstrap problem-design strategies from the generator. Then, we treat the solver's feedback on synthetic problems as a reward signal, enabling the generator to calibrate difficulty and produce complementary problems near the edge of the solver's competence. Extensive experiments on 10 mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that our method achieves an average improvement of 2.5% and generalizes to both language and vision-language models. Moreover, a solver trained on the synthesized data provides improved rewards for continued generator training, enabling co-evolution and yielding a further 0.7% performance gain.

Major space weather contributors are the solar wind and coronal mass ejections whose variable density, speed, temperature, and magnetic field make the automated classification of those structures challenging. In this work, we adapt a foundation model for solar physics, originally trained on Solar Dynamics Observatory imagery, to create embeddings suitable for solar wind structure analysis. These embeddings are concatenated with the spacecraft position and solar magnetic connectivity encoded using Fourier features which generates a neural field-based model. The full deep learning architecture is fine-tuned bridging the gap between remote sensing and in situ observations. Labels are derived from Parker Solar Probe measurements, forming a downstream classification task that maps plasma properties to solar wind structures. Although overall classification performance is modest, likely due to coarse labeling, class imbalance, and limited transferability of the pretrained model, this study demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging foundation model embeddings for in situ solar wind tasks. As a first proof-of-concept, it lays the groundwork for future improvements toward more reliable space weather predictions.

Analyzing how these interconnected systems simultaneously failed to protect public health requires innovative analytic approaches for exploring the vast amounts of data and documents disclosed in the UCSF-JHU Opioid Industry Documents Archive (OIDA). The complexity, multimodal nature, and specialized characteristics of these healthcare-related legal and corporate documents necessitate more advanced methods and models tailored to specific data types and detailed annotations, ensuring the precision and professionalism in the analysis. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by organizing the original dataset according to document attributes and constructing a benchmark with 400k training documents and 10k for testing. From each document, we extract rich multimodal information-including textual content, visual elements, and layout structures-to capture a comprehensive range of features. Using multiple AI models, we then generate a large-scale dataset comprising 360k training QA pairs and 10k testing QA pairs. Building on this foundation, we develop domain-specific multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) and explore the impact of multimodal inputs on task performance. To further enhance response accuracy, we incorporate historical QA pairs as contextual grounding for answering current queries. Additionally, we incorporate page references within the answers and introduce an importance-based page classifier, further improving the precision and relevance of the information provided.

To this end, we propose a robot agnostic reward function that balances the achievement of a desired end pose with impact minimization and the protection of critical robot parts during reinforcement learning. To make the policy robust to a broad range of initial falling conditions and to enable the specification of an arbitrary and unseen end pose at inference time, we introduce a simulation-based sampling strategy of initial and end poses.

Achieving these tasks requires accurately separating albedo from shade. However, performing this separation on point clouds presents two key challenges: (1) the non-grid structure of point clouds makes conventional image-based decomposition models ineffective, and (2) point-cloud models designed for other tasks do not explicitly consider global-light direction, resulting in inaccurate shade. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{Intrinsic Point-Cloud Decomposition (IPCD)}, which extends image decomposition to the direct decomposition of colored point clouds into albedo and shade. To overcome challenge (1), we propose \\textbf{IPCD-Net} that extends image-based model with point-wise feature aggregation for non-grid data processing. For challenge (2), we introduce \\textbf{Projection-based Luminance Distribution (PLD)} with a hierarchical feature refinement, capturing global-light ques via multi-view projection. For comprehensive evaluation, we create a synthetic outdoor-scene dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that IPCD-Net reduces cast shadows in albedo and enhances color accuracy in shade.

Hyperbolic space, characterized by its negative curvature, has demonstrated strong potential in such tasks due to its capacity to embed hierarchical structures with minimal distortion. Previous evidence indicates that the hyperbolic representation capacity can be further enhanced through kernel methods. However, existing hyperbolic kernels still suffer from mild geometric distortion or lack adaptability. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a curvature-aware de Branges-Rovnyak space, a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that is isometric to a Poincare ball. We design an adjustable multiplier to select the appropriate RKHS corresponding to the hyperbolic space with any curvature adaptively. Building on this foundation, we further construct a family of adaptive hyperbolic kernels, including the novel adaptive hyperbolic radial kernel, whose learnable parameters modulate hyperbolic features in a task-aware manner. Extensive experiments on visual and language benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed kernels outperform existing hyperbolic kernels in modeling hierarchical dependencies."}

However, they still face critical challenges in modeling long-range dependencies under the usage of Rotary Positional Encoding (ROPE). Although it can facilitate precise modeling of token positions, it induces progressive attention decay as token distance increases, especially with progressive attention decay over distant token pairs, which severely impairs the model's ability to remember global context. To alleviate this issue, we propose inference-only Three-step Decay Resilience Strategies (T-DRS), comprising (1) Semantic-Driven DRS (SD-DRS), amplifying semantically meaningful but distant signals via content-aware residuals, (2) Distance-aware Control DRS (DC-DRS), which can purify attention by smoothly modulating weights based on positional distances, suppressing noise while preserving locality, and (3) re-Reinforce Distant DRS (reRD-DRS), consolidating the remaining informative remote dependencies to maintain global coherence. Together, the T-DRS recover suppressed long-range token pairs without harming local inductive biases. Extensive experiments on Vision Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks demonstrate that T-DRS can consistently improve performance in a training-free manner.

SPAN features ten cross-calendar temporal reasoning directions, two reasoning types, and two question formats across six calendars.

We conduct extensive experiments on both open- and closed-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs over a range of dates spanning 100 years from 1960 to 2060. Our evaluations show that these LLMs achieve an average accuracy of only 34.5%, with none exceeding 80%, indicating that this task remains challenging. Through in-depth analysis of reasoning types, question formats, and temporal reasoning directions, we identify two key obstacles for LLMs: Future-Date Degradation and Calendar Asymmetry Bias. To strengthen LLMs' cross-calendar temporal reasoning capability, we further develop an LLM-powered Time Agent that leverages tool-augmented code generation. Empirical results show that Time Agent achieves an average accuracy of 95.31%, outperforming several competitive baselines, highlighting the potential of tool-augmented code generation to advance cross-calendar temporal reasoning.

VISTA combines (i) a cross-attention fusion module that integrates long-horizon intent with past motion, (ii) a social-token attention mechanism for flexible interaction modeling across agents, and (iii) pairwise attention maps that make social influence patterns interpretable at inference time. Our model turns single-agent goal-conditioned prediction into a coherent multi-agent forecasting framework. Beyond standard displacement metrics, we evaluate trajectory collision rates as a measure of joint realism. On the high-density MADRAS benchmark and on SDD, VISTA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and substantially fewer collisions. On MADRAS, it reduces the average collision rate of strong baselines from 2.14 to 0.03 percent, and on SDD it attains zero collisions while improving ADE, FDE, and minFDE.

To address the limitations, we propose a novel method, namely Segment Anything Model with Depth-guided Adaptive Queries (SAM-DAQ), which adapts SAM2 to pop-out salient objects from videos by seamlessly integrating depth and temporal cues within a unified framework. Firstly, we deploy a parallel adapter-based multi-modal image encoder (PAMIE), which incorporates several depth-guided parallel adapters (DPAs) in a skip-connection way. Remarkably, we fine-tune the frozen SAM encoder under prompt-free conditions, where the DPA utilizes depth cues to facilitate the fusion of multi-modal features. Secondly, we deploy a query-driven temporal memory (QTM) module, which unifies the memory bank and prompt embeddings into a learnable pipeline. Concretely, by leveraging both frame-level queries and video-level queries simultaneously, the QTM module can not only selectively extract temporal consistency features but also iteratively update the temporal representations of the queries. Extensive experiments are conducted on three RGB-D VSOD datasets, and the results show that the proposed SAM-DAQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of all evaluation metrics."}

In this paper, we propose SemanticVLA, a novel VLA framework that performs Semantic-Aligned Sparsification and Enhancement for Efficient Robotic Manipulation. Specifically: 1) To sparsify redundant perception while preserving semantic alignment, Semantic-guided Dual Visual Pruner (SD-Pruner) performs: Instruction-driven Pruner (ID-Pruner) extracts global action cues and local semantic anchors in SigLIP; Spatial-aggregation Pruner (SA-Pruner) compacts geometry-rich features into task-adaptive tokens in DINOv2. 2) To exploit sparsified features and integrate semantics with spatial geometry, Semantic-complementary Hierarchical Fuser (SH-Fuser) fuses dense patches and sparse tokens across SigLIP and DINOv2 for coherent representation. 3) To enhance the transformation from perception to action, Semantic-conditioned Action Coupler (SA-Coupler) replaces the conventional observation-to-DoF approach, yielding more efficient and interpretable behavior modeling for manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on simulation and real-world tasks show that SemanticVLA sets a new SOTA in both performance and efficiency. SemanticVLA surpasses OpenVLA on LIBERO benchmark by 21.1% in success rate, while reducing training cost and inference latency by 3.0-fold and 2.7-fold.SemanticVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/SemanticVLA"}

Current 3D-VLMs directly embed the 3D point clouds into 3D tokens, following large 2D-VLMs with powerful reasoning capabilities. However, this framework has a great computational cost limiting its application, where we identify that the bottleneck lies in processing all 3D tokens in the Large Language Model (LLM) part. This raises the question: how can we reduce the computational overhead introduced by 3D tokens while preserving the integrity of their essential information? To address this question, we introduce Hierarchical Compensatory Compression (HCC-3D) to efficiently compress 3D tokens while maintaining critical detail retention. Specifically, we first propose a global structure compression (GSC), in which we design global queries to compress all 3D tokens into a few key tokens while keeping overall structural information. Then, to compensate for the information loss in GSC, we further propose an adaptive detail mining (ADM) module that selectively recompresses salient but under-attended features through complementary scoring. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HCC-3D not only achieves extreme compression ratios (approximately 98%) compared to previous 3D-VLMs, but also achieves new state-of-the-art performance, showing the great improvements on both efficiency and performance."}

Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a novel Hint-Practice Reasoning (HPR) framework that operationalizes this insight through two synergistic components: 1) a hinter (powerful LLM) that provides probabilistic guidance at critical decision points, and 2) a practitioner (efficient smaller model) that executes major reasoning steps. The framework's core innovation lies in Distributional Inconsistency Reduction (DIR), a theoretically-grounded metric that dynamically identifies intervention points by quantifying the divergence between practitioner's reasoning trajectory and hinter's expected distribution in a tree-structured probabilistic space. Through iterative tree updates guided by DIR, HPR reweights promising reasoning paths while deprioritizing low-probability branches. Experiments across arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate HPR's state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs: it achieves comparable performance to self-consistency and MCTS baselines while decoding only 1/5 tokens, and outperforms existing methods by at most 5.1% absolute accuracy while maintaining similar or lower FLOPs."}

One key reason is that tiny objects carry limited features that are inevitably degraded or lost during long-distance network propagation. Another is that smaller objects receive disproportionately greater regression penalties than larger ones during training. To tackle these issues, we propose a Scale-Aware Relay Layer (SARL) and a Scale-Adaptive Loss (SAL) for tiny object detection, both of which are seamlessly compatible with the top-performing frameworks. Specifically, SARL employs a cross-scale spatial-channel attention to progressively enrich the meaningful features of each layer and strengthen the cross-layer feature sharing. SAL reshapes the vanilla IoU-based losses so as to dynamically assign lower weights to larger objects. This loss is able to focus training on tiny objects while reducing the influence on large objects.

However, most existing medical report generation (MRG) systems treat reports as flat sequences, overlooking this hierarchical organization and leading to inconsistencies between descriptive and diagnostic content. To align model behavior with real-world reporting practices, we propose RadFlow, a hierarchical workflow-guided reinforcement optimization framework that explicitly models the structured nature of clinical reporting. RadFlow introduces a clinically grounded reward hierarchy that mirrors the organization of radiological reports. At the global level, the reward integrates linguistic fluency, medical-domain correctness, and cross-sectional consistency between Finding and Impression, promoting coherent and clinically faithful narratives. At the local level, a section-specific reward emphasizes Impression quality, reflecting its central role in diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, a critical-aware policy optimization mechanism adaptively regularizes learning for high-risk or clinically sensitive cases, emulating the cautious refinement behavior of radiologists when documenting critical findings. Together, these components translate the structured reporting paradigm into the reinforcement fine-tuning process, enabling the model to generate reports that are both linguistically consistent and clinically aligned. Experiments on chest X-ray and carotid ultrasound datasets demonstrate that RadFlow consistently improves diagnostic coherence and overall report quality compared with state-of-the-art baselines."}

However, they continue to underperform in real-world medical scenarios, which often demand stronger context-awareness, i.e., the ability to recognize missing or critical details (e.g., user identity, medical history, risk factors) and provide safe, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses. To address this issue, we propose Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a data-driven approach that enhances LLMs' context-awareness along three key facets (decision-making, communication, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement. Specifically, we first design a attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role, geographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity. An LLM then responds to these queries, self-evaluates its answers along three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet. Finally, the queries and refined responses are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce the model's context-awareness ability. Evaluation results on the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLM performance across multiple aspects, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis. Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation with the proposed method, the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B) surpasses its teacher model, achieving a new SOTA across all open-source LLMs on HealthBench (63.8%) and its hard subset (43.1%).

Existing methods for Single-DGOD typically rely on discrete data augmentation or static perturbation methods to expand data diversity, thereby mitigating the lack of access to target domain data. However, in real-world scenarios such as changes in weather or lighting conditions, domain shifts often occur continuously and gradually. Discrete augmentations and static perturbations fail to effectively capture the dynamic variation of feature distributions, thereby limiting the model's ability to perceive fine-grained cross-domain differences. To this end, we propose a new method, Liquid Temporal Feature Evolution, which simulates the progressive evolution of features from the source domain to simulated latent distributions by incorporating temporal modeling and liquid neural network-driven parameter adjustment. Specifically, we introduce controllable Gaussian noise injection and multi-scale Gaussian blurring to simulate initial feature perturbations, followed by temporal modeling and a liquid parameter adjustment mechanism to generate adaptive modulation parameters, enabling a smooth and continuous adaptation across domains. By capturing progressive cross-domain feature evolution and dynamically regulating adaptation paths, our method bridges the source-unknown domain distribution gap, significantly boosting generalization and robustness to unseen shifts.

Unlike existing foundation models (FMs), which specialize in pattern learning within specific domains such as language, vision, or time series, IFM aims to acquire the underlying mechanisms of intelligence by learning directly from diverse intelligent behaviors. Vision, language, and other cognitive abilities are manifestations of intelligent behavior; learning from this broad range of behaviors enables the system to internalize the general principles of intelligence. Based on the fact that intelligent behaviors emerge from the collective dynamics of biological neural systems, IFM consists of two core components: a novel network architecture, termed the state neural network, which captures neuron-like dynamic processes, and a new learning objective, neuron output prediction, which trains the system to predict neuronal outputs from collective dynamics. The state neural network emulates the temporal dynamics of biological neurons, allowing the system to store, integrate, and process information over time, while the neuron output prediction objective provides a unified computational principle for learning these structural dynamics from intelligent behaviors. Together, these innovations establish a biologically grounded and computationally scalable foundation for building systems capable of generalization, reasoning, and adaptive learning across domains, representing a step toward truly AGI."}

However, this approach is susceptible to distribution drift, caused by the sequential optimization of shared backbone parameters. This results in a mismatch between the distributions of the previously learned classes and that of the updater model, ultimately degrading the effectiveness of classifier performance over time. To address this issue, we introduce a latent space transition operator and propose Sequential Learning with Drift Compensation (SLDC). SLDC aims to align feature distributions across tasks to mitigate the impact of drift. First, we present a linear variant of SLDC, which learns a linear operator by solving a regularized least-squares problem that maps features before and after fine-tuning. Next, we extend this with a weakly nonlinear SLDC variant, which assumes that the ideal transition operator lies between purely linear and fully nonlinear transformations. This is implemented using learnable, weakly nonlinear mappings that balance flexibility and generalization. To further reduce representation drift, we apply knowledge distillation (KD) in both algorithmic variants. Extensive experiments on standard CIL benchmarks demonstrate that SLDC significantly improves the performance of SeqFT. Notably, by combining KD to address representation drift with SLDC to compensate distribution drift, SeqFT achieves performance comparable to joint training across all evaluated datasets.

However, existing defenses target only one path, leaving the other unprotected. We conduct a systematic exploration to assess the impact of protecting each path independently and find that joint protection is essential for effective defense.

Moreover, the several existing defenses for person ReID fail to address the inherent unique challenges of adversarially robust ReID. In this paper, we systematically identify the challenges of adversarial defense in person ReID into two key issues: model bias and composite generalization requirements. To address them, we propose a debiased dual-invariant defense framework composed of two main phases. In the data balancing phase, we mitigate model bias using a diffusion-model-based data resampling strategy that promotes fairness and diversity in training data. In the bi-adversarial self-meta defense phase, we introduce a novel metric adversarial training approach incorporating farthest negative extension softening to overcome the robustness degradation caused by the absence of classifier.

However, existing correction approaches often degrade performance or oversimplify the problem by altering the original data distribution. This leads to unrealistic scenarios and biased models, which is particularly problematic in contexts where interpretable AI models are employed, as their interpretability depends on the fidelity of the underlying data patterns. In this paper, we argue that defining noise independently of the solution may be ineffective, as its nature can vary significantly across tasks and datasets. Using a task-specific high quality solution as a reference can provide a more precise and adaptable noise definition.

Therefore, we propose a novel advanced black-box tuning method for LLMs with limited API calls. Our core strategy involves training a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model with \"LogitMap Pairs\" derived from querying the foundation model on a minimal but highly informative training subset. This surrogate can approximate the outputs of the foundation model to guide the training of the proxy model, thereby effectively reducing the need for direct queries to the foundation model. Extensive experiments verify that our approach elevates pre-trained language model accuracy from 55.92% to 86.85%, reducing the frequency of API queries to merely 1.38%. This significantly outperforms offline approaches that operate entirely without API access. Notably, our method also achieves comparable or superior accuracy to query-intensive approaches, while significantly reducing API costs. This offers a robust and high-efficiency paradigm for language model adaptation."}

In this work, we introduce a novel adaptive fusion framework that complements cosine similarity with a magnitude-aware quality cue. Specifically, we first extract the absolute CLIP image features and apply a Box-Cox transformation to statistically normalize the feature distribution and mitigate semantic sensitivity. The resulting scalar summary serves as a semantically-normalized auxiliary cue that complements cosine-based prompt matching. To integrate both cues effectively, we further design a confidence-guided fusion scheme that adaptively weighs each term according to its relative strength. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark IQA datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms standard CLIP-based IQA and state-of-the-art baselines, without any task-specific training."}

Most existing methods for traffic signal modeling often rely on the original data modality, i.e., numerical direct readings from the sensors in cities. However, this unimodal approach overlooks the semantic information existing in multimodal heterogeneous urban data in different perspectives, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of traffic signals and limits the accurate prediction of complex traffic dynamics. To address this problem, we propose a novel \\textit{M}ultimodal framework, \\textit{MTP}, for urban \\textit{T}raffic \\textit{P}rofiling, which learns multimodal features through numeric, visual, and textual perspectives. The three branches drive for a multimodal perspective of urban traffic signal learning in the frequency domain, while the frequency learning strategies delicately refine the information for extraction. Specifically, we first conduct the visual augmentation for the traffic signals, which transforms the original modality into frequency images and periodicity images for visual learning. Also, we augment descriptive texts for the traffic signals based on the specific topic, background information and item description for textual learning. To complement the numeric information, we utilize frequency multilayer perceptrons for learning on the original modality. We design a hierarchical contrastive learning on the three branches to fuse the spectrum of three modalities.

However, their detection latency and tendency to hallucinate predictions render them unsuitable for direct deployment. This work introduces a novel pipeline that addresses this challenge by leveraging VLMs to automatically generate pseudo-labels for training efficient, real-time object detectors. Our key innovation is a per-object co-teaching-based training strategy that mitigates the inherent noise in VLM-generated labels. The proposed per-object coteaching approach filters noisy bounding boxes from training instead of filtering the entire image. Specifically, two YOLO models learn collaboratively, filtering out unreliable boxes from each mini-batch based on their peers' per-object loss values. Overall, our pipeline provides an efficient, robust, and scalable approach to train high-performance object detectors for autonomous driving, significantly reducing reliance on costly human annotation. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms a baseline YOLOv5m model, achieving a significant mAP@0.5 boost ($31.12\\%$ to $46.61\\%$) while maintaining real-time detection latency. Furthermore, we show that supplementing our pseudo-labelled data with a small fraction of ground truth labels ($10\\%$) leads to further performance gains, reaching $57.97\\%$ mAP@0.5 on the KITTI dataset.

To bridge this generalization gap, we present Evolutionary Realistic Instance Synthesis (EvoReal), which leverages an evolutionary module guided by large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic instances characterized by diverse and realistic structural patterns. Specifically, the evolutionary module produces synthetic instances whose structural attributes statistically mimics those observed in authentic real-world instances.

Recently, KG-enhanced LLMs that integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) have been shown to improve reasoning performance, particularly for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks.

Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on LLMs to directly retrieve evidence from KGs, and to self-assess the sufficiency of this evidence, which often results in premature or incorrect reasoning. To address the retrieval and reasoning failures, we propose ProgRAG, a multi-hop knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) framework that decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, and progressively extends partial reasoning paths by answering each sub-question. At each step, external retrievers gather candidate evidence, which is then refined through uncertainty-aware pruning by the LLM. Finally, the context for LLM reasoning is optimized by organizing and rearranging the partial reasoning paths obtained from the sub-question answers. Experiments on three well-known datasets demonstrate that ProgRAG outperforms existing baselines in multi-hop KGQA, offering improved reliability and reasoning quality."}

This paper aims to robustly fine-tune these vision-language models on in-distribution (ID) data without compromising their generalization abilities in out-of-distribution (OOD) and zero-shot settings. Current robust fine-tuning methods tackle this challenge by reusing contrastive learning, which was used in pre-training, for fine-tuning. However, we found that these methods distort the geometric structure of the embeddings, which plays a crucial role in the generalization of vision-language models, resulting in limited OOD and zero-shot performance. To address this, we propose Difference Vector Equalization (DiVE), which preserves the geometric structure during fine-tuning. The idea behind DiVE is to constrain difference vectors, each of which is obtained by subtracting the embeddings extracted from the pre-trained and fine-tuning models for the same data sample. By constraining the difference vectors to be equal across various data samples, we effectively preserve the geometric structure. Therefore, we introduce two losses: average vector loss (AVL) and pairwise vector loss (PVL). AVL preserves the geometric structure globally by constraining difference vectors to be equal to their weighted average. PVL preserves the geometric structure locally by ensuring a consistent multimodal alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that DiVE effectively preserves the geometric structure, achieving strong results across ID, OOD, and zero-shot metrics."}

First, fine-tuning is computationally costly. Second, their complex latent representations hinder interpretability for domain experts. Additionally, many frameworks have been developed for specific types of peptide classification, lacking generalization. These limitations restrict the ability to connect model predictions to biologically relevant motifs and structural properties. To address these limitations, we present PepTriX, a novel framework that integrates one dimensional (1D) sequence embeddings and three-dimensional (3D) structural features via a graph attention network enhanced with contrastive training and cross-modal co-attention. PepTriX automatically adapts to diverse datasets, producing task-specific peptide vectors while retaining biological plausibility. After evaluation by domain experts, we found that PepTriX performs remarkably well across multiple peptide classification tasks and provides interpretable insights into the structural and biophysical motifs that drive predictions.

To address these challenges, we propose STELLAR (Scene Text Editor for Low-resource LAnguages and Real-world data). STELLAR enables reliable multilingual editing through a language-adaptive glyph encoder and a multi-stage training strategy that first pre-trains on synthetic data and then fine-tunes on real images.

However, these systems remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that embed hidden malicious behaviors during training. A key limitation of existing backdoor attacks is their lack of physical realizability, primarily due to the digital-to-physical domain gap. Digital triggers often fail in real-world settings because they overlook material-dependent LiDAR reflection properties. On the other hand, physically constructed triggers are often unoptimized, leading to low effectiveness or easy detectability.This paper introduces Material-Oriented Backdoor Attack (MOBA), a novel framework that bridges the digital-physical gap by explicitly modeling the material properties of real-world triggers. MOBA tackles two key challenges in physical backdoor design: 1) robustness of the trigger material under diverse environmental conditions, 2) alignment between the physical trigger's behavior and its digital simulation. First, we propose a systematic approach to selecting robust trigger materials, identifying titanium dioxide (TiO_2) for its high diffuse reflectivity and environmental resilience. Second, to ensure the digital trigger accurately mimics the physical behavior of the material-based trigger, we develop a novel simulation pipeline that features: (1) an angle-independent approximation of the Oren-Nayar BRDF model to generate realistic LiDAR intensities, and (2) a distance-aware scaling mechanism to maintain spatial consistency across varying depths. We conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LiDAR-based and Camera-LiDAR fusion models, showing that MOBA achieves a 93.50% attack success rate, outperforming prior methods by over 41%.

Stochastic CI properties take the given concrete probability distributions into account, while structural CI properties are viewed purely in terms of the graphical structure of the DBN. We show that deciding if a stochastic CI proposition eventually holds is at least as hard as the Skolem problem for linear recurrence sequences, a long-standing open problem in number theory. On the other hand, we show that verifying the evolution of structural CI propositions against LTL and NBA specifications is in PSPACE, and is NP- and coNP-hard.

Our CoT pipeline begins with an active perception stage, prompting the MLLM to select the most informative viewpoint based on the instruction, before proceeding with step-by-step reasoning to localize affordance elements and infer plausible interaction motions. Evaluated on the SceneFun3D dataset, AffordBot achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating strong generalization and physically grounded reasoning with only 3D point cloud input and MLLMs."}

However, as adversaries increasingly imitate the style of authentic news, the effectiveness of such approaches is gradually diminishing. Recent research has explored incorporating large language models (LLMs) to enhance fake news detection. Yet, despite their transformative potential, LLMs remain an untapped goldmine for fake news detection, with their real-world adoption hampered by shallow functionality exploration, ambiguous usability, and prohibitive inference costs. In this paper, we propose a novel fake news detection framework, dubbed FactGuard, that leverages LLMs to extract event-centric content, thereby reducing the impact of writing style on detection performance. Furthermore, our approach introduces a dynamic usability mechanism that identifies contradictions and ambiguous cases in factual reasoning, adaptively incorporating LLM advice to improve decision reliability. To ensure efficiency and practical deployment, we employ knowledge distillation to derive FactGuard-D, enabling the framework to operate effectively in cold-start and resource-constrained scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods in both robustness and accuracy, effectively addressing the challenges of style sensitivity and LLM usability in fake news detection."}

In this paper, we reveal a key property that is overlooked by existing methods: normal image patches across industrial products typically find many other similar patches, not only in 2D appearance but also in 3D shapes, while anomalies remain diverse and isolated. To explicitly leverage this discriminative property, we propose a Mutual Scoring framework (MuSc-V2) for zero-shot AC/AS, which flexibly supports single 2D/3D or multimodality. Specifically, our method begins by improving 3D representation through Iterative Point Grouping (IPG), which reduces false positives from discontinuous surfaces. Then we use Similarity Neighborhood Aggregation with Multi-Degrees (SNAMD) to fuse 2D/3D neighborhood cues into more discriminative multi-scale patch features for mutual scoring. The core comprises a Mutual Scoring Mechanism (MSM) that lets samples within each modality to assign score to each other, and Cross-modal Anomaly Enhancement (CAE) that fuses 2D and 3D scores to recover modality-specific missing anomalies. Finally, Re-scoring with Constrained Neighborhood (RsCon) suppresses false classification based on similarity to more representative samples. Our framework flexibly works on both the full dataset and smaller subsets with consistently robust performance, ensuring seamless adaptability across diverse product lines. In aid of the novel framework, MuSc-V2 achieves significant performance improvements: a $\\textbf{+23.7\\%}$ AP gain on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset and a $\\textbf{+19.3\\%}$ boost on the Eyecandies dataset, surpassing previous zero-shot benchmarks and even outperforming most few-shot methods.

In this paper, we revisit analogical inference from a foundational perspective. We first present a counterexample showing that existing generalization bounds fail even in the Boolean setting. We then introduce a unified framework for analogical reasoning in real-valued domains based on parameterized analogies defined via generalized means. This model subsumes both Boolean classification and regression, and supports analogical inference over continuous functions.

For data, we collect a comprehensive image screening dataset with over 128k samples, about 640k images. Each sample consists of an original image, four generated images. The dataset evaluates the image aesthetic reasoning ability under four aspects: appearance deformation, physical shadow, placement layout, and extension rationality. Regarding data annotation, we investigate multiple approaches, including purely manual, fully automated, and answer-driven annotations, to acquire high-quality chains of thought (CoT) data in the most cost-effective manner. Methodologically, we introduce a Hard Cases Mining (HCM) strategy with a Dynamic Proportional Accuracy (DPA) reward into the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework, called HCM-GRPO.

However, computing a step-wise explanation is computationally expensive, limiting the scope of problems for which it can be used. We investigate how we can use proofs generated by a constraint solver as a starting point for computing step-wise explanations, instead of computing them step-by-step. More specifically, we define a framework of abstract proofs, in which both proofs and step-wise explanations can be represented. We then propose several methods for converting a proof to a step-wise explanation sequence, with special attention to trimming and simplification techniques to keep the sequence and its individual steps small.

Experimental results reveal that MLLMs, such as Qwen2.5-Omni and Gemini 2.5, struggle to discriminate non-existent audio due to visually dominated reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we introduce RL-CoMM, a Reinforcement Learning-based Collaborative Multi-MLLM that is built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni foundation. RL-CoMM includes two stages: 1) To alleviate visually dominated ambiguities, we introduce an external model, a Large Audio Language Model (LALM), as the reference model to generate audio-only reasoning. Then, we design a Step-wise Reasoning Reward function that enables MLLMs to self-improve audio-visual reasoning with the audio-only reference. 2) To ensure an accurate answer prediction, we introduce Answer-centered Confidence Optimization to reduce the uncertainty of potential heterogeneous reasoning differences.

Each step consists of a set of constraints that derive an assignment to one or more decision variables. However, many candidate explanation steps exist, with different sets of constraints and different decisions they derive. To identify the most comprehensible one, a user-defined objective function is required to quantify the quality of each step. However, defining a good objective function is challenging. Here, interactive preference elicitation methods from the wider machine learning community can offer a way to learn user preferences from pairwise comparisons. We investigate the feasibility of this approach for step-wise explanations and address several limitations that distinguish it from elicitation for standard combinatorial problems. First, because the explanation quality is measured using multiple sub-objectives that can vary a lot in scale, we propose two dynamic normalization techniques to rescale these features and stabilize the learning process. We also observed that many generated comparisons involve similar explanations. For this reason, we introduce MACHOP (Multi-Armed CHOice Perceptron), a novel query generation strategy that integrates non-domination constraints with upper confidence bound-based diversification. We evaluate the elicitation techniques on Sudokus and Logic-Grid puzzles using artificial users, and validate them with a real-user evaluation.

Such approaches are designed to operate upon graph-structured data, and have been shown to be a very powerful tool for performing tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Next, we review the domain of Reinforcement Learning (RL), and in particular that of Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL). Following, we describe existing relevant game theoretic solution concepts and consider properties such as fairness and stability. Our review comes complete with a note on the literature that utilizes PTM in domains other than that of document analysis and classification. The capability of PTM to estimate unknown underlying distributions can help with tackling heterogeneity and unknown agent beliefs. Finally, we identify certain open challenges specifically, the need to (i) fit non-stationary environments, (ii) balance the degrees of stability and adaptation, (iii) tackle uncertainty and heterogeneity, (iv) guarantee scalability and solution tractability."}

Existing generative methods typically operate on local joint rotations, which are defined hierarchically based on the skeleton structure. This leads to cumulative errors during generation, manifesting as unstable and implausible motions at end-effectors. In this work, we propose GlobalDiff, a diffusion-based framework that operates directly in the space of global joint rotations for the first time, fundamentally decoupling each joint's prediction from upstream dependencies and alleviating hierarchical error accumulation. To compensate for the absence of structural priors in global rotation space, we introduce a multi-level constraint scheme. Specifically, a joint structure constraint introduces virtual anchor points around each joint to better capture fine-grained orientation. A skeleton structure constraint enforces angular consistency across bones to maintain structural integrity. A temporal structure constraint utilizes a multi-scale variational encoder to align the generated motion with ground-truth temporal patterns. These constraints jointly regularize the global diffusion process and reinforce structural awareness. Extensive evaluations on standard co-speech benchmarks show that GlobalDiff generates smooth and accurate motions, improving the performance by 46.0 % compared to the current SOTA under multiple speaker identities."}

However, the large number of visual tokens introduces significant computational overhead. To address this issue, visual token pruning has emerged as a key technique for enhancing the efficiency of MLLMs. In cognitive science, humans tend to first determine which regions of a scene to attend to (\"where to look\") before deciding which specific elements within those regions to process in detail (\"what to select\"). This two-stage strategy enables the visual system to efficiently allocate attention at a coarse spatial level before performing fine-grained selection. However, existing pruning methods primarily focus on directly optimizing \"what to select\", typically using attention scores or similarity metrics. They rarely consider \"where to look\", which has been shown to lead to inefficient spatial allocation, positional bias, and the retention of irrelevant or redundant tokens. In this paper, we propose GridPrune, a method that replaces the global Top-K mechanism with a \"guide-globally, select-locally\" zonal selection system. GridPrune splits the pruning process into two steps: first, it uses text-conditional guidance to dynamically allocate a token budget across spatial zones; and then, it performs local selection within each budgeted zone. Experimental results demonstrate that GridPrune achieves superior performance across various MLLM architectures. On LLaVA-NeXT-7B, GridPrune retains 96.98% of the full performance while using 11.1% of the tokens, outperforming the best-performing baseline by 2.34% at the same pruning rate."}

However, most learning-based allocation frameworks either assume immediate feedback or ignore the complex interplay between individual characteristics and intervention dynamics. We propose a novel bi-level contextual bandit framework for individualized resource allocation under delayed feedback, designed to operate in real-world settings with dynamic populations, capacity constraints, and time-sensitive impact. At the meta level, the model optimizes subgroup-level budget allocations to satisfy fairness and operational constraints. At the base level, it identifies the most responsive individuals within each group using a neural network trained on observational data, while respecting cooldown windows and delayed treatment effects modeled via resource-specific delay kernels. By explicitly modeling temporal dynamics and feedback delays, the algorithm continually refines its policy as new data arrive, enabling more responsive and adaptive decision-making. We validate our approach on two real-world datasets from education and workforce development, showing that it achieves higher cumulative outcomes, better adapts to delay structures, and ensures equitable distribution across subgroups. Our results highlight the potential of delay-aware, data-driven decision-making systems to improve institutional policy and social welfare."}

To address these problems, we introduce a novel paradigm named learning Skeleton representation with visUal-motion knowledGe for Action Recognition (SUGAR). In our pipeline, we first utilize off-the-shelf large-scale video models as a knowledge base to generate visual, motion information related to actions. Then, we propose to supervise skeleton learning through this prior knowledge to yield discrete representations. Finally, we use the LLM with untouched pre-training weights to understand these representations and generate the desired action targets and descriptions.

It is minimal with only a few mechanisms, which makes it easy for automatic processing (by agents, analysis, optimization, etc.). The language is universal for the class of all finite turn-based games with imperfect information. Higher-level languages are introduced for game design (by humans or Procedural Content Generation), which are eventually translated to a low-level language.

However, the security vulnerabilities of LVLMs have become increasingly concerning, particularly their susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks focus on single-target attacks, i.e., targeting a single malicious output associated with a specific trigger. In this work, we uncover multi-target backdoor attacks, where multiple independent triggers corresponding to different attack targets are added in a single pass of training, posing a greater threat to LVLMs in real-world applications. Executing such attacks in LVLMs is challenging since there can be many incorrect trigger-target mappings due to severe feature interference among different triggers. To address this challenge, we propose MTAttack, the first multi-target backdoor attack framework for enforcing accurate multiple trigger-target mappings in LVLMs. The core of MTAttack is a novel optimization method with two constraints, namely Proxy Space Partitioning constraint and Trigger Prototype Anchoring constraint. It jointly optimizes multiple triggers in the latent space, with each trigger independently mapping clean images to a unique proxy class while at the same time guaranteeing their separability. Experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate a high success rate of MTAttack for multi-target attacks, substantially outperforming existing attack methods. Furthermore, our attack exhibits strong generalizability across datasets and robustness against backdoor defense strategies. These findings highlight the vulnerability of LVLMs to multi-target backdoor attacks and underscore the urgent need for mitigating such threats.

As a result, significant research efforts have been directed toward identifying failure scenarios within simulation environments. However, a critical question remains. Are the AV failure scenarios discovered in simulation reproducible on actual systems in the real world? The sim-to-real gap caused by differences between simulated and real sensor data means that failure scenarios identified in simulation might either be artifacts of synthetic sensor data or actual issues that also occur with real sensor data. To address this, an effective approach to validating simulated failure scenarios is to locate occurrences of these scenarios within real-world datasets and verify whether the failure persists on the datasets. To this end, we introduce a formal definition of how labeled time series sensor data can match an abstract scenario, represented as a scenario program using the Scenic probabilistic programming language. We present a querying algorithm that, given a scenario program and a labeled dataset, identifies the subset of data that matches the specified scenario. Our experiment shows that our algorithm is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster in querying scenarios than the state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, and can scale with the duration of queried time series data."}

In this paper, we propose RobIA, a novel Robust, Instance-Aware framework for Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) in stereo depth estimation. RobIA integrates two key components: (1) Attend-and-Excite Mixture-of-Experts (AttEx-MoE), a parameter-efficient module that dynamically routes input to frozen experts via lightweight self-attention mechanism tailored to epipolar geometry, and (2) Robust AdaptBN Teacher, a PEFT-based teacher model that provides dense pseudo-supervision by complementing sparse handcrafted labels.

To address this, we propose an explicit temporal-semantic modeling framework called Context-Aware Cross-Modal Interaction (CACMI), which leverages both latent temporal characteristics within videos and linguistic semantics from text corpus. Specifically, our model consists of two core components: Cross-modal Frame Aggregation aggregates relevant frames to extract temporally coherent, event-aligned textual features through cross-modal retrieval; and Context-aware Feature Enhancement utilizes query-guided attention to integrate visual dynamics with pseudo-event semantics. Extensive experiments on the ActivityNet Captions and YouCook2 datasets demonstrate that CACMI achieves the state-of-the-art performance on dense video captioning task."}

For self-touch, high-dimensional tactile inputs are transformed into compact, meaningful representations, enabling efficient learning. The agent then discovers new tactile contacts through intrinsic rewards and curriculum learning that encourage broad body coverage, balance, and generalization. For hand regard, visual features of the hands, such as skin-color and shape, are learned through motor babbling. Then, intrinsic rewards encourage the agent to perform novel hand motions, and follow its hands with its gaze. A curriculum learning setup from single-hand to dual-hand training allows the agent to reach complex visual-motor coordination. The results of this work demonstrate that purely curiosity-based signals, with no external supervision, can drive coordinated multimodal learning, imitating an infant's progression from random motor babbling to purposeful behaviors."}

This survey investigates this breakdown across three core primitives-negation, counting, and spatial relations. Our analysis reveals a dramatic performance collapse: models that are accurate on single primitives fail precipitously when these are combined, exposing severe interference. We trace this failure to three key factors. First, training data show a near-total absence of explicit negations. Second, continuous attention architectures are fundamentally unsuitable for discrete logic. Third, evaluation metrics reward visual plausibility over constraint satisfaction. By analyzing recent benchmarks and methods, we show that current solutions and simple scaling cannot bridge this gap.

Deep learning models have recently achieved promising results by implicitly learning such patterns from 2D trajectory data. However, most approaches treat pedestrians as point entities, ignoring the physical space that each person occupies. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel deep learning model that enhances the Social LSTM with a new Dynamic Occupied Space loss function. This loss function guides Social LSTM in learning to avoid realistic collisions without increasing displacement error across different crowd densities, ranging from low to high, in both homogeneous and heterogeneous density settings. Such a function achieves this by combining the average displacement error with a new collision penalty that is sensitive to scene density and individual spatial occupancy. For efficient training and evaluation, five datasets were generated from real pedestrian trajectories recorded during the Festival of Lights in Lyon 2022. Four datasets represent homogeneous crowd conditions -- low, medium, high, and very high density -- while the fifth corresponds to a heterogeneous density distribution. The experimental findings indicate that the proposed model not only lowers collision rates but also enhances displacement prediction accuracy in each dataset. Specifically, the model achieves up to a 31% reduction in the collision rate and reduces the average displacement error and the final displacement error by 5% and 6%, respectively, on average across all datasets compared to the baseline. Moreover, the proposed model consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art deep learning models across most test sets."}

While widening the MLP can linearly increase feature space dimensionality, it also leads to a quadratic growth in computational and memory costs. To address this limitation, we propose the split-layer, a novel reformulation of MLP construction. The split-layer divides each layer into multiple parallel branches and integrates their outputs via Hadamard product, effectively constructing a high-degree polynomial space. This approach significantly enhances INR's representational capacity by expanding the feature space dimensionality without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the split-layer substantially improves INR performance, surpassing existing methods across multiple tasks, including 2D image fitting, 2D CT reconstruction, 3D shape representation, and 5D novel view synthesis."}

It remains unclear how pre-training domain (medical vs. general), paradigm (e.g., text-guided), and architecture influence embedding quality, hindering the selection of optimal encoders for specific radiology tasks. To address this, we evaluate vision encoders from eight medical and general-domain FMs for chest X-ray analysis. We benchmark classification (pneumothorax, cardiomegaly) and segmentation (pneumothorax, cardiac boundary) using linear probing and fine-tuning. Our results show that domain-specific pre-training provides a significant advantage; medical FMs consistently outperformed general-domain models in linear probing, establishing superior initial feature quality. However, feature utility is highly task-dependent. Pre-trained embeddings were strong for global classification and segmenting salient anatomy (e.g., heart). In contrast, for segmenting complex, subtle pathologies (e.g., pneumothorax), all FMs performed poorly without significant fine-tuning, revealing a critical gap in localizing subtle disease. Subgroup analysis showed FMs use confounding shortcuts (e.g., chest tubes for pneumothorax) for classification, a strategy that fails for precise segmentation. We also found that expensive text-image alignment is not a prerequisite; image-only (RAD-DINO) and label-supervised (Ark+) FMs were among top performers. Notably, a supervised, end-to-end baseline remained highly competitive, matching or exceeding the best FMs on segmentation tasks. These findings show that while medical pre-training is beneficial, architectural choices (e.g., multi-scale) are critical, and pre-trained features are not universally effective, especially for complex localization tasks where supervised models remain a strong alternative."}

Ksurf, a state-of-the-art variance-minimizing estimator method ideal for highly variable cloud data, enables optimal resource estimation under conditions of high cloud variability.\n  This work evaluates the performance of Ksurf on estimation-based resource orchestration tasks involving highly variable workloads when employed as a contextual multi-armed bandit objective function model for cloud scenarios using Drone. Ksurf enables significantly lower latency variance of $41\\%$ at p95 and $47\\%$ at p99, demonstrates a $4\\%$ reduction in CPU usage and 7 MB reduction in master node memory usage on Kubernetes, resulting in a $7\\%$ cost savings in average worker pod count on VarBench Kubernetes benchmark."}

In real-world scenarios, images often contain multiple degradations simultaneously, such as rain, noise, and haze, requiring models capable of handling diverse degradation types. Moreover, methods that improve performance through module stacking often suffer from limited interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability-driven approach for multi-degradation image restoration, built upon a deep unfolding network that maps the iterative process of a mathematical optimization algorithm into a learnable network structure. Specifically, we employ an improved second-order semi-smooth Newton algorithm to ensure that each module maintains clear physical interpretability. To further enhance interpretability and adaptability, we design an explainable convolution module inspired by the human brain's flexible information processing and the intrinsic characteristics of images, allowing the network to flexibly leverage learned knowledge and autonomously adjust parameters for different input. The resulting tightly integrated architecture, named InterIR, demonstrates excellent performance in multi-degradation restoration while remaining highly competitive on single-degradation tasks."}

In this work, we introduce Spectrum-Aware Test-Time Steering (STS), a lightweight adaptation framework that extracts a spectral subspace from the textual embeddings to define principal semantic directions and learns to steer latent representations in a spectrum-aware manner by adapting a small number of per-sample shift parameters to minimize entropy across augmented views. STS operates entirely at inference in the latent space, without backpropagation through or modification of the frozen encoders. Building on standard evaluation protocols, our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that STS largely surpasses or compares favorably against state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods, while introducing only a handful of additional parameters and achieving inference speeds up to 8x faster with a 12x smaller memory footprint than conventional test-time prompt tuning.

One key reason is that tiny objects carry limited features that are inevitably degraded or lost during long-distance network propagation.

To tackle these issues, we propose a Scale-Aware Relay Layer (SARL) and a Scale-Adaptive Loss (SAL) for tiny object detection, both of which are seamlessly compatible with the top-performing frameworks. Specifically, SARL employs a cross-scale spatial-channel attention to progressively enrich the meaningful features of each layer and strengthen the cross-layer feature sharing. SAL reshapes the vanilla IoU-based losses so as to dynamically assign lower weights to larger objects. This loss is able to focus training on tiny objects while reducing the influence on large objects.

Previous methods have predominantly employed diffusion models for high-fidelity reconstruction. However, their multi-step iterative sampling incurs significant computational overhead, limiting its real-time applicability. To address this, we propose LiNeXt-a lightweight, non-diffusion network optimized for rapid and accurate point cloud completion. Specifically, LiNeXt first applies the Noise-to-Coarse (N2C) Module to denoise the input noisy point cloud in a single pass, thereby obviating the multi-step iterative sampling of diffusion-based methods. The Refine Module then takes the coarse point cloud and its intermediate features from the N2C Module to perform more precise refinement, further enhancing structural completeness. Furthermore, we observe that LiDAR point clouds exhibit a distance-dependent spatial distribution, being densely sampled at proximal ranges and sparsely sampled at distal ranges. Accordingly, we propose the Distance-aware Selected Repeat strategy to generate a more uniformly distributed noisy point cloud. On the SemanticKITTI dataset, LiNeXt achieves a 199.8x speedup in inference, reduces Chamfer Distance by 50.7%, and uses only 6.1% of the parameters compared with LiDiff.

However, this approach is susceptible to distribution drift, caused by the sequential optimization of shared backbone parameters. This results in a mismatch between the distributions of the previously learned classes and that of the updater model, ultimately degrading the effectiveness of classifier performance over time. To address this issue, we introduce a latent space transition operator and propose Sequential Learning with Drift Compensation (SLDC). SLDC aims to align feature distributions across tasks to mitigate the impact of drift. First, we present a linear variant of SLDC, which learns a linear operator by solving a regularized least-squares problem that maps features before and after fine-tuning. Next, we extend this with a weakly nonlinear SLDC variant, which assumes that the ideal transition operator lies between purely linear and fully nonlinear transformations. This is implemented using learnable, weakly nonlinear mappings that balance flexibility and generalization. To further reduce representation drift, we apply knowledge distillation (KD) in both algorithmic variants. Extensive experiments on standard CIL benchmarks demonstrate that SLDC significantly improves the performance of SeqFT. Notably, by combining KD to address representation drift with SLDC to compensate distribution drift, SeqFT achieves performance comparable to joint training across all evaluated datasets.

The former requires effective cross-agent feature alignment to mitigate heterogeneity loss, while the latter renders full-parameter training impractical, highlighting the importance of scalable adaptation. To address these issues, we propose Heterogeneous Adaptation (HeatV2X), a scalable collaborative framework.

In this work, we introduce a novel adaptive fusion framework that complements cosine similarity with a magnitude-aware quality cue. Specifically, we first extract the absolute CLIP image features and apply a Box-Cox transformation to statistically normalize the feature distribution and mitigate semantic sensitivity. The resulting scalar summary serves as a semantically-normalized auxiliary cue that complements cosine-based prompt matching.

Current robust fine-tuning methods tackle this challenge by reusing contrastive learning, which was used in pre-training, for fine-tuning. However, we found that these methods distort the geometric structure of the embeddings, which plays a crucial role in the generalization of vision-language models, resulting in limited OOD and zero-shot performance. To address this, we propose Difference Vector Equalization (DiVE), which preserves the geometric structure during fine-tuning. The idea behind DiVE is to constrain difference vectors, each of which is obtained by subtracting the embeddings extracted from the pre-trained and fine-tuning models for the same data sample. By constraining the difference vectors to be equal across various data samples, we effectively preserve the geometric structure. Therefore, we introduce two losses: average vector loss (AVL) and pairwise vector loss (PVL). AVL preserves the geometric structure globally by constraining difference vectors to be equal to their weighted average. PVL preserves the geometric structure locally by ensuring a consistent multimodal alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that DiVE effectively preserves the geometric structure, achieving strong results across ID, OOD, and zero-shot metrics."}

This multi-modality integration allows VLA models to interpret complex, real-world environments using diverse sensor data streams. Given the fact that VLA-based systems heavily rely on the sensory input, the security of VLA models against physical-world sensor attacks remains critically underexplored.\n  To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of physical sensor attacks against VLAs, quantifying the influence of sensor attacks and investigating the defenses for VLA models. We introduce a novel ``Real-Sim-Real'' framework that automatically simulates physics-based sensor attack vectors, including six attacks targeting cameras and two targeting microphones, and validates them on real robotic systems. Through large-scale evaluations across various VLA architectures and tasks under varying attack parameters, we demonstrate significant vulnerabilities, with susceptibility patterns that reveal critical dependencies on task types and model designs. We further develop an adversarial-training-based defense that enhances VLA robustness against out-of-distribution physical perturbations caused by sensor attacks while preserving model performance.

Existing approaches typically rely on feature-selection mechanisms or region-proposal strategies to localize discriminative regions for semantic analysis.

To address these limitations, we propose H3Former, a novel token-to-region framework that leverages high-order semantic relations to aggregate local fine-grained representations with structured region-level modeling. Specifically, we propose the Semantic-Aware Aggregation Module (SAAM), which exploits multi-scale contextual cues to dynamically construct a weighted hypergraph among tokens. By applying hypergraph convolution, SAAM captures high-order semantic dependencies and progressively aggregates token features into compact region-level representations. Furthermore, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Loss (HHCL), which enforces hierarchical semantic constraints in a non-Euclidean embedding space. The HHCL enhances inter-class separability and intra-class consistency while preserving the intrinsic hierarchical relationships among fine-grained categories. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four standard FGVC benchmarks validate the superiority of our H3Former framework."}

Existing inference-time interventions to mitigate this issue present a challenging trade-off: while methods that steer internal states or adjust output logits can be effective, they often incur substantial computational overhead, typically requiring extra forward passes. This efficiency bottleneck can limit their practicality for real-world, latency-sensitive deployments. In this work, we aim to address this trade-off with Residual-Update Directed DEcoding Regulation (RUDDER), a low-overhead framework that steers LVLMs towards visually-grounded generation. RUDDER is built on two key innovations: (1) Contextual Activation Residual Direction (CARD) vector, a per-sample visual evidence vector extracted from the residual update of a self-attention layer during a single, standard forward pass. (2) A Bayesian-inspired adaptive gate that performs token-wise injection, applying a corrective signal whose strength is conditioned on the model's deviation from the visual context. Extensive experiments on key hallucination benchmarks, including POPE and CHAIR, indicate that RUDDER achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while introducing negligible computational latency, validating RUDDER as a pragmatic and effective approach for improving LVLMs' reliability without a significant compromise on efficiency."}

We trace this failure to three key factors. First, training data show a near-total absence of explicit negations. Second, continuous attention architectures are fundamentally unsuitable for discrete logic. Third, evaluation metrics reward visual plausibility over constraint satisfaction. By analyzing recent benchmarks and methods, we show that current solutions and simple scaling cannot bridge this gap.

To address these limitations, we propose the Generation-Enhanced Alignment (GEA) from a generative perspective. GEA contains two parallel modules: (1) Text-Guided Token Enhancement (TGTE), which introduces diffusion-generated images as intermediate semantic representations to bridge the gap between text and visual patterns. These generated images enrich the semantic representation of text and facilitate cross-modal alignment. (2) Generative Intermediate Fusion (GIF), which combines cross-attention between generated images, original images, and text features to generate a unified representation optimized by triplet alignment loss.

Then, the IFE is proposed to rectify the feature embeddings of infrared images using the generated text semantics. This process injects id-related semantics into the shared image encoder, enhancing its adaptability to the infrared modality.

Our approach comprises two core components: (1) Depth-of-field Supervision employs a scale-recovered monocular depth estimator (e.g., Metric3D) to generate depth priors, leverages defocus convolution to synthesize physically accurate defocused images, and enforces geometric consistency through a novel depth-of-field loss, thereby enhancing depth fidelity in both far-field and near-field regions; (2) Multi-View Consistency Supervision employing LoFTR-based semi-dense feature matching to minimize cross-view geometric errors and enforce depth consistency via least squares optimization of reliable matched points.

Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Semantic Alignment Network (DSANet) to explicitly separate abnormal and normal features from coarse-grained and fine-grained aspects, enhancing the distinguishability. Specifically, at the coarse-grained level, we introduce a self-guided normality modeling branch that reconstructs input video features under the guidance of learned normal prototypes, encouraging the model to exploit normality cues inherent in the video, thereby improving the temporal separation of normal patterns and anomalous events. At the fine-grained level, we present a decoupled contrastive semantic alignment mechanism, which first temporally decomposes each video into event-centric and background-centric components using frame-level anomaly scores and then applies visual-language contrastive learning to enhance class-discriminative representations.

Existing approaches typically rely on feature-selection mechanisms or region-proposal strategies to localize discriminative regions for semantic analysis. However, these methods often fail to capture discriminative cues comprehensively while introducing substantial category-agnostic redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose H3Former, a novel token-to-region framework that leverages high-order semantic relations to aggregate local fine-grained representations with structured region-level modeling. Specifically, we propose the Semantic-Aware Aggregation Module (SAAM), which exploits multi-scale contextual cues to dynamically construct a weighted hypergraph among tokens. By applying hypergraph convolution, SAAM captures high-order semantic dependencies and progressively aggregates token features into compact region-level representations. Furthermore, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Loss (HHCL), which enforces hierarchical semantic constraints in a non-Euclidean embedding space. The HHCL enhances inter-class separability and intra-class consistency while preserving the intrinsic hierarchical relationships among fine-grained categories. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four standard FGVC benchmarks validate the superiority of our H3Former framework."}

However, while these models often generate functionally correct outputs, we still lack a systematic understanding and evaluation of their non-functional qualities. Existing studies focus mainly on whether generated code passes the tests rather than whether it passes with quality. Guided by the ISO/IEC 25010 quality model, this study conducted three complementary investigations: a systematic review of 108 papers, two industry workshops with practitioners from multiple organizations, and an empirical analysis of patching real-world software issues using three LLMs. Motivated by insights from both the literature and practitioners, the empirical study examined the quality of generated patches on security, maintainability, and performance efficiency. Across the literature, we found that security and performance efficiency dominate academic attention, while maintainability and other qualities are understudied. In contrast, industry experts prioritize maintainability and readability, warning that generated code may accelerate the accumulation of technical debt. In our evaluation of functionally correct patches generated by three LLMs, improvements in one quality dimension often come at the cost of others. Runtime and memory results further show high variance across models and optimization strategies. Overall, our findings reveal a mismatch between academic focus, industry priorities, and model performance, highlighting the urgent need to integrate quality assurance mechanisms into LLM code generation pipelines to ensure that future generated code not only passes tests but truly passes with quality."}

Built on M3DSG, we propose MSGNav, a zero-shot navigation system that includes a Key Subgraph Selection module for efficient reasoning, an Adaptive Vocabulary Update module for open vocabulary support, and a Closed-Loop Reasoning module for accurate exploration reasoning. Additionally, we further identify the last-mile problem in zero-shot navigation - determining the feasible target location with a suitable final viewpoint, and propose a Visibility-based Viewpoint Decision module to explicitly resolve it.

Recent defense mechanisms like Anti-DreamBooth attempt to mitigate this risk by injecting adversarial perturbations into user photos to prevent successful personalization. However, we identify two critical yet overlooked limitations of these methods. First, the adversarial examples often exhibit perceptible artifacts such as conspicuous patterns or stripes, making them easily detectable as manipulated content. Second, the perturbations are highly fragile, as even a simple, non-learned filter can effectively remove them, thereby restoring the model's ability to memorize and reproduce user identity. To investigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel evaluation framework, AntiDB_Purify, to systematically evaluate existing defenses under realistic purification threats, including both traditional image filters and adversarial purification. Results reveal that none of the current methods maintains their protective effectiveness under such threats. These findings highlight that current defenses offer a false sense of security and underscore the urgent need for more imperceptible and robust protections to safeguard user identity in personalized generation."}

Existing inference-time interventions to mitigate this issue present a challenging trade-off: while methods that steer internal states or adjust output logits can be effective, they often incur substantial computational overhead, typically requiring extra forward passes. This efficiency bottleneck can limit their practicality for real-world, latency-sensitive deployments. In this work, we aim to address this trade-off with Residual-Update Directed DEcoding Regulation (RUDDER), a low-overhead framework that steers LVLMs towards visually-grounded generation. RUDDER is built on two key innovations: (1) Contextual Activation Residual Direction (CARD) vector, a per-sample visual evidence vector extracted from the residual update of a self-attention layer during a single, standard forward pass. (2) A Bayesian-inspired adaptive gate that performs token-wise injection, applying a corrective signal whose strength is conditioned on the model's deviation from the visual context. Extensive experiments on key hallucination benchmarks, including POPE and CHAIR, indicate that RUDDER achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while introducing negligible computational latency, validating RUDDER as a pragmatic and effective approach for improving LVLMs' reliability without a significant compromise on efficiency."}

In this paper, we propose a Spatial Attention Mutual Information Regularization with a pre-trained model as an Oracle, called SAMIRO. SAMIRO enhances lane detection performance by transferring knowledge from a pretrained model while preserving domain-agnostic spatial information. Leveraging SAMIRO's plug-and-play characteristic, we integrate it into various state-of-the-art lane detection approaches and conduct extensive experiments on major benchmarks such as CULane, Tusimple, and LLAMAS.

To this end, we present LLaViT - Large Language Models as extended Vision Transformers - which enables the LLM to simultaneously function as a vision encoder through three key modifications: (1) learning separate QKV projections for vision modality, (2) enabling bidirectional attention on visual tokens, and (3) incorporating both global and local visual representations.

This paper proposes a novel computational framework that integrates depth-of-field supervision and multi-view consistency supervision to advance 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach comprises two core components: (1) Depth-of-field Supervision employs a scale-recovered monocular depth estimator (e.g., Metric3D) to generate depth priors, leverages defocus convolution to synthesize physically accurate defocused images, and enforces geometric consistency through a novel depth-of-field loss, thereby enhancing depth fidelity in both far-field and near-field regions; (2) Multi-View Consistency Supervision employing LoFTR-based semi-dense feature matching to minimize cross-view geometric errors and enforce depth consistency via least squares optimization of reliable matched points. By unifying defocus physics with multi-view geometric constraints, our method achieves superior depth fidelity, demonstrating a 0.8 dB PSNR improvement over the state-of-the-art method on the Waymo Open Dataset.

Our core insight is that measurement expertise follows predictable compositional patterns that can be systematically automated.

In our framework, a GeoAdapter is proposed to encode depth and camera intrinsics/extrinsics into a spatial foundation model. It employs zero-initialized convolutions to progressively inject geometric information without disrupting the foundation model's representation space. This design ensures stable optimization with negligible overhead, maintaining inference speed comparable to VGGT even with multiple additional inputs.

This enables an arbitrary number of modality inputs during testing and promotes learning robust spatial representations instead of overfitting to auxiliary cues. Comprehensive experiments on monocular/multi-view depth estimation, multi-view stereo, and camera pose estimation demonstrate that OmniVGGT outperforms prior methods with auxiliary inputs and achieves state-of-the-art results even with RGB-only input.

Alternatively, 3D reasoning approaches introduce complex architectures that require more DBT training data. Tackling these drawbacks, we propose M&M-3D, an architecture that enables learnable 3D reasoning while remaining parameter-free relative to its FFDM counterpart, M&M.

A shared Swin-style backbone with scale-specific pixel-shuffle heads supports 2x and 4x factors and remains compatible with image-space SR baselines, achieving comparable perceptual quality with nearly 3x lower decoding and upscaling time (adding only +0.42 s for 1024 px generation from 512 px, compared to 1.87 s for pixel-space SR using the same SwinIR architecture). Furthermore, LUA shows strong generalization across the latent spaces of different VAEs, making it easy to deploy without retraining from scratch for each new decoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LUA closely matches the fidelity of native high-resolution generation while offering a practical and efficient path to scalable, high-fidelity image synthesis in modern diffusion pipelines."}

In pursuit of minimal modeling, DA3 yields two key insights: a single plain transformer (e.g., vanilla DINO encoder) is sufficient as a backbone without architectural specialization, and a singular depth-ray prediction target obviates the need for complex multi-task learning. Through our teacher-student training paradigm, the model achieves a level of detail and generalization on par with Depth Anything 2 (DA2). We establish a new visual geometry benchmark covering camera pose estimation, any-view geometry and visual rendering. On this benchmark, DA3 sets a new state-of-the-art across all tasks, surpassing prior SOTA VGGT by an average of 44.3% in camera pose accuracy and 25.1% in geometric accuracy. Moreover, it outperforms DA2 in monocular depth estimation. All models are trained exclusively on public academic datasets."}

In the multiple-choice setting - a dominant format for multimodal reasoning benchmarks - the paradigm faces a significant yet often overlooked obstacle: unfaithful trajectories that guess the correct option after a faulty chain of thought receive the same reward as genuine reasoning, which is a flaw that cannot be ignored. We propose Self-Consistency Sampling (SCS) to correct this issue. For each question, SCS (i) introduces small visual perturbations and (ii) performs repeated truncation and resampling of an initial trajectory; agreement among the resulting trajectories yields a differentiable consistency score that down-weights unreliable traces during policy updates. Based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, plugging SCS into RLOO, GRPO, and REINFORCE++ series improves accuracy by up to 7.7 percentage points on six multimodal benchmarks with negligible extra computation. SCS also yields notable gains on both Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct and InternVL3-8B, offering a simple, general remedy for outcome-reward RL in MLLMs."}

AI cognitive assistants, acting as virtual partners, have the potential to ease this burden by supporting real-time data collection and decision making. In pursuit of this vision, we introduce EgoEMS, the first end-to-end, high-fidelity, multimodal, multiperson dataset capturing over 20 hours of realistic, procedural EMS activities from an egocentric view in 233 simulated emergency scenarios performed by 62 participants, including 46 EMS professionals. Developed in collaboration with EMS experts and aligned with national standards, EgoEMS is captured using an open-source, low-cost, and replicable data collection system and is annotated with keysteps, timestamped audio transcripts with speaker diarization, action quality metrics, and bounding boxes with segmentation masks. Emphasizing realism, the dataset includes responder-patient interactions reflecting real-world emergency dynamics. We also present a suite of benchmarks for real-time multimodal keystep recognition and action quality estimation, essential for developing AI support tools for EMS. We hope EgoEMS inspires the research community to push the boundaries of intelligent EMS systems and ultimately contribute to improved patient outcomes."}

However, existing approaches face several challenges: (i) indiscriminate generation that ignores the solver's ability and yields low-value problems, or reliance on complex data pipelines to balance problem difficulty; and (ii) a lack of reasoning in problem generation, leading to shallow problem variants. In this paper, we develop a problem generator that reasons explicitly to plan problem directions before synthesis and adapts difficulty to the solver's ability. Specifically, we construct related problem pairs and augment them with intermediate problem-design CoT produced by a reasoning model. These data bootstrap problem-design strategies from the generator. Then, we treat the solver's feedback on synthetic problems as a reward signal, enabling the generator to calibrate difficulty and produce complementary problems near the edge of the solver's competence. Extensive experiments on 10 mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that our method achieves an average improvement of 2.5% and generalizes to both language and vision-language models. Moreover, a solver trained on the synthesized data provides improved rewards for continued generator training, enabling co-evolution and yielding a further 0.7% performance gain. Our code will be made publicly available here."}

As a result, significant research efforts have been directed toward identifying failure scenarios within simulation environments. However, a critical question remains. Are the AV failure scenarios discovered in simulation reproducible on actual systems in the real world? The sim-to-real gap caused by differences between simulated and real sensor data means that failure scenarios identified in simulation might either be artifacts of synthetic sensor data or actual issues that also occur with real sensor data. To address this, an effective approach to validating simulated failure scenarios is to locate occurrences of these scenarios within real-world datasets and verify whether the failure persists on the datasets. To this end, we introduce a formal definition of how labeled time series sensor data can match an abstract scenario, represented as a scenario program using the Scenic probabilistic programming language. We present a querying algorithm that, given a scenario program and a labeled dataset, identifies the subset of data that matches the specified scenario. Our experiment shows that our algorithm is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster in querying scenarios than the state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, and can scale with the duration of queried time series data."}
