However, UAV-based Air-to-Ground (A2G) channels are highly dependent on height and urban geometry. This paper proposes an ABS height-dependent mmWave channel model and investigates whether urban geometry, beyond the standard built-up parameters, significantly affects LoS probability (PLoS) and Large-Scale Fading (LSF). Using MATLAB ray tracing at 26 GHz, we simulate approximately 10K city realizations for four urban layouts that share identical built-up parameters but differ in their spatial organization. We extract elevation-based PLoS using a sigmoid model and derive height-dependent Path-Loss Exponents (PLEs) and shadow-fading trends using exponential fits. Results show that PLE for Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) decreases toward 2.5-3 at high altitudes, Line-of-Sight (LoS) PLE remains near 2, and shadow fading reduces with height. We also find that geometric layout introduces a modest but consistent change in PLE (+/- 0.2), even when built-up parameters are fixed. The proposed unified model aligns well with ray-tracing statistics and offers a practical, height-dependent LSF model suitable for ABS planning in complex urban scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u4fe1\u9053\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u57ce\u5e02\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7a7a\u4e2d\u57fa\u7ad9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u51e0\u4f55\u5e03\u5c40\u5bf9PLE\u6709\u8f7b\u5fae\u4f46\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a7a\u4e2d\u57fa\u7ad9\uff08ABS\uff09\u57286G\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u8986\u76d6\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u9ad8\u5ea6\u548c\u57ce\u5e02\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u7a7a\u5bf9\u5730\uff08A2G\uff09\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u89c6\u8ddd\u6982\u7387\uff08PLoS\uff09\u548c\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8870\u843d\uff08LSF\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528MATLAB\u5c04\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u572826 GHz\u9891\u7387\u4e0b\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u7ea610,000\u4e2a\u57ce\u5e02\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4f46\u5efa\u7b51\u53c2\u6570\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u5e03\u5c40\u3002\u901a\u8fc7sigmoid\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7684\u89c6\u8ddd\u6982\u7387\uff08PLoS\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6307\u6570\u62df\u5408\u63a8\u5bfc\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u635f\u8017\u6307\u6570\uff08PLEs\uff09\u548c\u9634\u5f71\u8870\u843d\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u975e\u89c6\u8ddd\uff08NLoS\uff09\u7684PLE\u5728\u9ad8\u6d77\u62d4\u65f6\u964d\u81f32.5-3\uff0c\u89c6\u8ddd\uff08LoS\uff09\u7684PLE\u4fdd\u6301\u57282\u9644\u8fd1\uff0c\u9634\u5f71\u8870\u843d\u968f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u3002\u51e0\u4f55\u5e03\u5c40\u5373\u4f7f\u5efa\u7b51\u53c2\u6570\u56fa\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5bf9PLE\u4ea7\u751f\u5c0f\u5e45\u4f46\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff08+/- 0.2\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5c04\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u543b\u5408\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u57ce\u5e02\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u57fa\u7ad9\uff08ABS\uff09\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8870\u843d\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

They are expected to play a crucial role in shaping sixth-generation (6G) systems and the ongoing standardization process. The concept of non-public networks (NPNs) introduced in fifth-generation (5G) will be enhanced by nomadic non-public networks (NNPNs), extending mobility and adaptability beyond fixed locations. These networks help overcome the limitations of traditional static infrastructures, making them applicable to areas such as emergency response, transportation, agriculture, and others. This paper examines the transition from NPNs to NNPNs, highlighting key technical aspects such as network architecture, dynamic resource allocation, and wireless backhauling. Several use cases illustrate how NNPNs improve connectivity in environments where traditional networks are limited. Additionally, the study defines Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to evaluate NNPN applications and establishes a framework for categorizing them based on mobility and operational requirements. Despite their advantages, NNPNs introduce architectural, regulatory, and security challenges such as new approaches for handovers, spectrum policies or cross-border functionality, and trust mechanisms to maintain reliable operations. By identifying use cases, defining evaluation criteria, and addressing technical and regulatory challenges, this paper provides insights into integrating NNPNs into future 6G networks.

The attacker strategically removes up to $k$ edges from a flow network to maximally disrupt flow between a source $s$ and a sink $t$, after which the defender optimally reroutes the remaining flow. To capture this attacker--defender interaction, we introduce a new mathematical model of discounted cuts, in which the cost of a cut is evaluated by excluding its $k$ most expensive edges. This model generalizes the Most Vital Links problem and uncovers novel algorithmic and complexity-theoretic properties.\n  We develop a unified algorithmic framework for analyzing various forms of discounted cut problems, including minimizing or maximizing the cost of a cut under discount mechanisms that exclude either the $k$ most expensive or the $k$ cheapest edges. While most variants are NP-complete on general graphs, our main result establishes polynomial-time solvability for all discounted cut problems in our framework when the input is restricted to bounded-genus graphs, a relevant class that includes many real-world networks such as transportation and infrastructure networks. With this work, we aim to open collaborative bridges between artificial intelligence, algorithmic game theory, and operations research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6298\u6263\u5272\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u653b\u51fb\u8005-\u9632\u5fa1\u8005\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u6709\u754c\u4e8f\u683c\u56fe\u4e0a\u6240\u6709\u6298\u6263\u5272\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86AI\u3001\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u548c\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76Stackelberg\u53d8\u4f53\u7684Most Vital Links\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u79fb\u9664\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u8fb9\u6765\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7834\u574f\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9632\u5fa1\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u4f18\u5316\u5269\u4f59\u6d41\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6298\u6263\u5272\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5272\u7684\u6210\u672c\u901a\u8fc7\u6392\u9664\u5176k\u4e2a\u6700\u6602\u8d35\uff08\u6216\u6700\u4fbf\u5b9c\uff09\u7684\u8fb9\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6298\u6263\u5272\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u56fe\u4e0a\u5927\u591a\u6570\u53d8\u4f53\u662fNP\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6709\u754c\u4e8f\u683c\u56fe\u4e0a\u6240\u6709\u6298\u6263\u5272\u95ee\u9898\u5747\u53ef\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u5404\u79cd\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u6298\u6263\u5272\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u9650\u5b9a\u4e8e\u6709\u754c\u4e8f\u683c\u56fe\u65f6\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6298\u6263\u5272\u95ee\u9898\u5747\u53ef\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u548c\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u642d\u5efa\u4e86\u6865\u6881\u3002"}}

Advancements in deep learning and specialized hardware have driven the rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI systems. However, traditional GPU-centric architectures face scalability challenges for inference workloads due to limitations in memory capacity, bandwidth, and interconnect scaling. To address these issues, the FengHuang Platform, a disaggregated AI infrastructure platform, is proposed to overcome memory and communication scaling limits for AI inference. FengHuang features a multi-tier shared-memory architecture combining high-speed local memory with centralized disaggregated remote memory, enhanced by active tensor paging and near-memory compute for tensor operations. Simulations demonstrate that FengHuang achieves up to 93% local memory capacity reduction, 50% GPU compute savings, and 16x to 70x faster inter-GPU communication compared to conventional GPU scaling. Across workloads such as GPT-3, Grok-1, and QWEN3-235B, FengHuang enables up to 50% GPU reductions while maintaining end-user performance, offering a scalable, flexible, and cost-effective solution for AI inference infrastructure.

However, these powerful representations can encode a broad range of task-irrelevant scene information, making the resulting trained policies vulnerable to out-of-domain visual changes and distractors. In this work we address visuomotor policy feature pooling as a solution to the observed lack of robustness in perturbed scenes. We achieve this via Attentive Feature Aggregation (AFA), a lightweight, trainable pooling mechanism that learns to naturally attend to task-relevant visual cues, ignoring even semantically rich scene distractors. Through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that policies trained with AFA significantly outperform standard pooling approaches in the presence of visual perturbations, without requiring expensive dataset augmentation or fine-tuning of the PVR. Our findings show that ignoring extraneous visual information is a crucial step towards deploying robust and generalisable visuomotor policies.

This paper asks a precise, testable version of the \"runaway growth\" question: under what measurable conditions could capability escalate without bound in finite time, and under what conditions can that be ruled out? We develop an analytic framework for recursive self-improvement that links capability growth to resource build-out and deployment policies. Physical and information-theoretic limits from power, bandwidth, and memory define a service envelope that caps instantaneous improvement. An endogenous growth model couples capital to compute, data, and energy and defines a critical boundary separating superlinear from subcritical regimes. We derive decision rules that map observable series (facility power, IO bandwidth, training throughput, benchmark losses, and spending) into yes/no certificates for runaway versus nonsingular behavior. The framework yields falsifiable tests based on how fast improvement accelerates relative to its current level, and it provides safety controls that are directly implementable in practice, such as power caps, throughput throttling, and evaluation gates. Analytical case studies cover capped-power, saturating-data, and investment-amplified settings, illustrating when the envelope binds and when it does not. The approach is simulation-free and grounded in measurements engineers already collect. Limitations include dependence on the chosen capability metric and on regularity diagnostics; future work will address stochastic dynamics, multi-agent competition, and abrupt architectural shifts. Overall, the results replace speculation with testable conditions and deployable controls for certifying or precluding an AI singularity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1AI\u80fd\u529b\u65e0\u9650\u589e\u957f\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e86\u731c\u6d4b\u6027\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4f55\u79cd\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u9650\u589e\u957f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u4f55\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6392\u9664\u8fd9\u79cd\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u66ff\u4ee3\u731c\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9012\u5f52\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u957f\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u7b56\u7565\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u9650\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u533a\u5206\u5931\u63a7\u4e0e\u975e\u5947\u5f02\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5185\u751f\u589e\u957f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6216\u6392\u9664AI\u5947\u70b9\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

HPCAgentTester employs a unique collaborative workflow where specialized LLM agents (Recipe Agent and Test Agent) iteratively generate and refine test cases through a critique loop. This architecture enables the generation of context-aware unit tests that specifically target parallel execution constructs, complex communication patterns, and hierarchical parallelism.

While effective GUI agents synergistically integrate planning and grounding capabilities, current methodologies exhibit two fundamental limitations: (1) insufficient exploitation of cross-model synergies, and (2) over-reliance on synthetic data generation without sufficient utilization. To address these challenges, we propose Co-EPG, a self-iterative training framework for Co-Evolution of Planning and Grounding. Co-EPG establishes an iterative positive feedback loop: through this loop, the planning model explores superior strategies under grounding-based reward guidance via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), generating diverse data to optimize the grounding model. Concurrently, the optimized Grounding model provides more effective rewards for subsequent GRPO training of the planning model, fostering continuous improvement. Co-EPG thus enables iterative enhancement of agent capabilities through self-play optimization and training data distillation. On the Multimodal-Mind2Web and AndroidControl benchmarks, our framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods after just three iterations without requiring external data. The agent consistently improves with each iteration, demonstrating robust self-enhancement capabilities.

Thirty-five students and staff interacted with the robot and provided structured feedback on safety, privacy, usability, accessibility, and transparency. The results show generally positive perceptions of physical safety, data protection, and ethical behavior, while also highlighting challenges related to accessibility, inclusiveness, and dynamic interaction. Beyond the empirical findings, the study demonstrates how theoretical frameworks for ethical and secure design can be implemented in real-world contexts through end-user evaluation.

Determining validity can require costly manual annotation. To reduce this cost, we introduce a human-in-the-loop approach to LLM-based patch validity judgment. Inspired by the observation that human judgment is better aligned when using a shared rubric, we first employ an LLM to generate a per-bug rubric, followed by a one-time human review and optional refinement to this rubric, and then employ an LLM to judge patches using the refined rubric. We apply this approach to assign binary validity labels to patches for issues found by Google sanitizer tools. Our results show that this approach yields substantial agreement with human consensus (Cohen's kappa 0.75), high recall (0.94) and high precision (0.80), when considering patches that have unanimous agreement from 3 human raters on the validity labels.

CAR-Scenes also provides attribute co-occurrence graphs and JSONL records that support semantic retrieval, dataset triage, and risk-aware scenario mining across sources. To calibrate task difficulty, we include reproducible, non-benchmark baselines, notably a LoRA-tuned Qwen2-VL-2B with deterministic decoding, evaluated via scalar accuracy, micro-averaged F1 for list attributes, and severity MAE/RMSE on a fixed validation split. We publicly release the annotation and analysis scripts, including graph construction and evaluation scripts, to enable explainable, data-centric workflows for future intelligent vehicles.

In this paper, we propose a new strategy with the potential to overcome the $3/2$ barrier. In doing so we are led to a number-theoretic conjecture, one form of which is that there are sets $S, T$ of cardinality $n^\u03b2$, consisting of positive integers of magnitude at most $\\exp(n^\u03b1)$, such that every integer $i \\in [n]$ divides $s-t$ for some $s \\in S, t \\in T$. Achieving $\u03b1+ \u03b2\\le 1 + o(1)$ is trivial; we show that achieving $\u03b1, \u03b2< 1/2$ (together with an assumption that $S, T$ are structured) implies an improvement to the exponent 3/2 for univariate polynomial factorization. Achieving $\u03b1= \u03b2= 1/3$ is best-possible and would imply an exponent 4/3 algorithm for univariate polynomial factorization. Interestingly, a second consequence would be a reduction of the current-best exponent for deterministic (exponential) algorithms for factoring integers, from $1/5$ to $1/6$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u7a81\u7834\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\u76843/2\u6307\u6570\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u8bba\u731c\u60f3\u6216\u5e26\u6765\u7b97\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\u7b97\u6cd5\u76843/2\u6307\u6570\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u56fa\u6709\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u7a81\u7834\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u96c6\u5408S\u548cT\u7684\u6570\u8bba\u731c\u60f3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u82e5\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u03b1+\u03b2\u22641+o(1)\u4e14\u03b1,\u03b2<1/2\uff0c\u6216\u5c06\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u6307\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u514b\u670d\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\u4e2d\u76843/2\u6307\u6570\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u8bba\u731c\u60f3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

The TaskConstellation continuously evolves as results stream in from distributed devices, enabling asynchronous execution, adaptive recovery, and dynamic optimization. A Constellation Orchestrator} executes tasks safely and asynchronously while applying dynamic DAG updates, and the Agent Interaction Protocol (AIP) provides persistent, low-latency channels for reliable task dispatch and result streaming. These designs dissolve the traditional boundaries between devices and platforms, allowing agents to collaborate seamlessly and amplify their collective intelligence.\n  We evaluate UFO$^3$ on NebulaBench, a benchmark of 55 cross-device tasks across 5 machines and 10 categories. UFO$^3$ achieves 83.3% subtask completion, 70.9% task success, exposes parallelism with an average width of 1.72, and reduces end-to-end latency by 31% relative to a sequential baseline. Fault-injection experiments demonstrate graceful degradation and recovery under transient and permanent agent failures.

To reduce the cognitive load on the decision maker, previous work has introduced the Pareto pruning problem, where the goal is to compute a fixed-size subset of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, as evaluated by a given quality measure. Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, we conduct an axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, uncovering several unintuitive behaviors. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new measure, directed coverage. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimizing various quality measures, identifying previously unknown boundaries between tractable and intractable cases depending on the number and structure of the objectives.

In many scenarios, such as Maritime SAR, expected survival times are short and optimal search could increase the likelihood of success. This optimization problem is complex for nontrivial problems given its probabilistic nature.\n  Stochastic optimization methods search large problems by nondeterministically sampling the space to reduce the effective size of the problem. This has been used in SAR planning to search otherwise intractably large problems but the stochastic nature provides no formal guarantees on the quality of solutions found in finite time.\n  This paper instead presents $\\rm{A}^{\\rm{SAR}}$, an $\\varepsilon$-optimal search algorithm for SAR planning.

This quantity, though less studied than total weight or length, plays a critical role in quantum fault tolerance because it directly impacts the overhead of lattice surgery procedures used to implement an almost universal quantum gate set. Building on a recursive algorithm of Freedman and Hastings, we introduce a family of load-aware heuristics that adaptively select vertices and edges to minimize edge participation throughout the cycle basis construction. Our approach improves empirical performance on random regular graphs and on graphs derived from small quantum codes. We further analyze a simplified balls-into-bins process to establish lower bounds on edge participation. While the model differs from the cycle basis algorithm on real graphs, it captures what can be proven for our heuristics without using complex graph theoretic properties related to the distribution of cycles in the graph. Our analysis suggests that the maximum load of our heuristics grows on the order of (log n)^2. Our results indicate that careful cycle basis construction can yield significant practical benefits in the design of fault-tolerant quantum systems.

It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties. We design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. Our reductions linearly preserve the clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions. We establish novel results for all argumentation semantics, including counting. Notably, the overhead caused by our DDG reductions cannot be significantly improved under reasonable assumptions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u56e2\u5bbd\u5ea6\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u56e2\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684DDG\u5f52\u7ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u62bd\u8c61\u8bba\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684(Q)SAT\u7f16\u7801\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u56e2\u5bbd\u5ea6\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u62bd\u8c61\u8bba\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u77db\u76fe\u8bba\u8bc1\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76f4\u63a5\u5206\u89e3\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08DDG\uff09\u7684\u5f52\u7ea6\uff0c\u5c06\u8bba\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a(Q)SAT\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ebf\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u56e2\u5bbd\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u6240\u6709\u8bba\u8bc1\u8bed\u4e49\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u8ba1\u6570\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86DDG\u5f52\u7ea6\u7684\u5f00\u9500\u5728\u5408\u7406\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4ece\u8bba\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\u5230(Q)SAT\u7684\u5f52\u7ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ebf\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u56e2\u5bbd\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u4e3a\u6240\u6709\u8bba\u8bc1\u8bed\u4e49\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u8ba1\u6570\uff09\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f52\u7ea6\u7684\u5f00\u9500\u5728\u5408\u7406\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Few platforms exist today for SAR, and fewer still have the ability to cover both tasks of terrain adaptability and high-force output when performing extraction. While legged robots offer significant ability to traverse uneven terrain, they typically are unable to incorporate mechanisms that provide variable high-force outputs, unlike traditional wheel-based drive trains. This work introduces a novel concept for a dynamically extensible and retractable robot leg. Leveraging a dynamically extensible and retractable five-bar linkage design, it allows for mechanically switching between height-advantaged and force-advantaged configurations via a geometric transformation. A testbed evaluated leg performance across linkage geometries and operating modes, with empirical and analytical analyses conducted on stride length, force output, and stability.

Repairing these bugs requires coordinated edits across multiple, disjoint code regions, posing substantially greater challenges. We present the first systematic study of LLM-driven coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini-cli, and Qwen Code) on this task. We evaluate these agents on 372 multi-hunk bugs from the Hunk4J dataset, analyzing 1,488 repair trajectories using fine-grained metrics that capture localization, repair accuracy, regression behavior, and operational dynamics. Results reveal substantial variation: repair accuracy ranges from 25.8% (Qwen Code) to 93.3% (Claude Code) and consistently declines with increasing bug dispersion and complexity. High-performing agents demonstrate superior semantic consistency, achieving positive regression reduction, whereas lower-performing agents often introduce new test failures. Notably, agents do not fail fast; failed repairs consume substantially more resources (39%-343% more tokens) and require longer execution time (43%-427%). Additionally, we developed Maple to provide agents with repository-level context. Empirical results show that Maple improves the repair accuracy of Gemini-cli by 30% through enhanced localization. By analyzing fine-grained metrics and trajectory-level analysis, this study moves beyond accuracy to explain how coding agents localize, reason, and act during multi-hunk repair.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u591a\u533a\u57df\u7f3a\u9677\u4fee\u590d\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0cClaude Code\u6700\u4f18\uff0cMaple\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u533a\u57df\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u533a\u57df\u7f3a\u9677\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e3a\u666e\u904d\u4e14\u4fee\u590d\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u8fd9\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u56db\u79cdLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\uff08Claude Code\u3001Codex\u3001Gemini-cli\u548cQwen Code\uff09\u5728Hunk4J\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684372\u4e2a\u591a\u533a\u57df\u7f3a\u9677\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5206\u67901,488\u4e2a\u4fee\u590d\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u6355\u6349\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u4fee\u590d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u56de\u5f52\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u4fee\u590d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4ece25.8%\uff08Qwen Code\uff09\u523093.3%\uff08Claude Code\uff09\u4e0d\u7b49\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u7f3a\u9677\u5206\u6563\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u5e38\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5931\u8d25\u3002Maple\u5c06Gemini-cli\u7684\u4fee\u590d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u4e8630%\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u591a\u533a\u57df\u7f3a\u9677\u4fee\u590d\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0cClaude Code\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u800cMaple\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ed3\u5e93\u7ea7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86Gemini-cli\u7684\u4fee\u590d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Video-based assessment (VBA) offers an opportunity to generate data-driven insights to reduce variability, optimize training, and improve surgical performance. However, existing tools for workflow analysis remain difficult to standardize and implement. This study aims to develop and validate a VBA tool for workflow analysis across minimally invasive colorectal procedures. A Delphi process was conducted to achieve consensus on generalizable workflow descriptors. The resulting framework informed the development of a new VBA tool, ColoWorkflow. Independent raters then applied ColoWorkflow to a multicentre video dataset of laparoscopic and robotic colorectal surgery (CRS). Applicability and inter-rater reliability were evaluated. Consensus was achieved for 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps describing CRS workflows. ColoWorkflow was developed and applied to 54 colorectal operative videos (left and right hemicolectomies, sigmoid and rectosigmoid resections, and total proctocolectomies) from five centres. The tool demonstrated broad applicability, with all but one label utilized. Inter-rater reliability was moderate, with mean Cohen's K of 0.71 for phases and 0.66 for steps. Most discrepancies arose at phase transitions and step boundary definitions.

Given the run-length encoded BWT (RLBWT) of $T$, r-enum runs in $O(n\\log\\log_{w}(n/r))$ time in addition to the time linear to the number of output strings, where $w=\u0398(\\log n)$ is the word size. In this paper, we improve the $O(n\\log\\log_{w}(n/r))$ term to $O(n)$. We also extend r-enum to compute other context-sensitive repeats such as near-supermaximal repeats (NSMRs) and supermaximal repeats, and the context diversity for every maximal repeat in the same complexities. Furthermore, we study the occurrences that witness NSMRs, which have recently attracted attention under the name of net occurrences: An occurrence of a repeat is called a net occurrence if it is not covered by another repeat, and the net frequency of a repeat is the number of its net occurrences. With this terminology, an NSMR is defined to be a repeat with a positive net frequency. Given the RLBWT of $T$, we show how to compute the set $S^{nsmr}$ of all NSMRs in $T$ together with their net frequency/occurrences in $O(n)$ time and $O(r)$ space. We also show that an $O(r)$-space data structure can be built from the RLBWT to support queries of computing the net frequency of any query pattern $P$ in $O(|P|)$ time. The data structure is built in $O(r)$ space and in $O(n)$ time with high probability or deterministic $O(n+|S^{nsmr}|\\log\\log\\min(\u03c3,|S^{nsmr}|))$ time, where $\u03c3\\le r$ is the alphabet size of $T$.

However, the resource limitations of such devices and unreliable network conditions necessitate error-resilient device-edge collaboration systems. Traditional approaches focus on bit-level transmission correctness, which can be inefficient under dynamic channel conditions. In contrast, we propose SemanticNN, a semantic codec that tolerates bit-level errors in pursuit of semantic-level correctness, enabling compressive and resilient collaborative inference offloading under strict computational and communication constraints. It incorporates a Bit Error Rate (BER)-aware decoder that adapts to dynamic channel conditions and a Soft Quantization (SQ)-based encoder to learn compact representations. Building on this architecture, we introduce Feature-augmentation Learning, a novel training strategy that enhances offloading efficiency. To address encoder-decoder capability mismatches from asymmetric resources, we propose XAI-based Asymmetry Compensation to enhance decoding semantic fidelity. We conduct extensive experiments on STM32 using three models and six datasets across image classification and object detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, under varying transmission error rates, SemanticNN significantly reduces feature transmission volume by 56.82-344.83x while maintaining superior inference accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "SemanticNN is a semantic codec for IoT devices that tolerates bit errors, enhances offloading efficiency, and maintains high accuracy despite resource constraints.", "motivation": "To address the inefficiency of traditional bit-level transmission correctness approaches in dynamic channel conditions and the challenges posed by resource limitations and unreliable networks in IoT devices.", "method": "SemanticNN, a semantic codec with BER-aware decoder and SQ-based encoder, incorporates Feature-augmentation Learning and XAI-based Asymmetry Compensation for efficient and resilient collaborative inference offloading.", "result": "SemanticNN maintains superior inference accuracy under varying transmission error rates while significantly reducing feature transmission volume.", "conclusion": "SemanticNN significantly reduces feature transmission volume by 56.82-344.83x while maintaining superior inference accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in resource-constrained IoT environments."}}

Moreover, most vision-language models (VLMs) usually describe surface materials in RS images using universal texts, lacking proprietary linguistic prior knowledge specific to different RS vision modalities. In this work, we formalize RS multimodality generalization (RSMG) as a learning paradigm, and propose a frequency-aware vision-language multimodality generalization network (FVMGN) for RS image classification. Specifically, a diffusion-based training-test-time augmentation (DTAug) strategy is designed to reconstruct multimodal land-cover distributions, enriching input information for FVMGN. Following that, to overcome multimodal heterogeneity, a multimodal wavelet disentanglement (MWDis) module is developed to learn cross-domain invariant features by resampling low and high frequency components in the frequency domain. Considering the characteristics of RS vision modalities, shared and proprietary class texts is designed as linguistic inputs for the transformer-based text encoder to extract diverse text features. For multimodal vision inputs, a spatial-frequency-aware image encoder (SFIE) is constructed to realize local-global feature reconstruction and representation. Finally, a multiscale spatial-frequency feature alignment (MSFFA) module is suggested to construct a unified semantic space, ensuring refined multiscale alignment of different text and vision features in spatial and frequency domains.

While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies. We conclude by identifying open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86LLM\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u8c03\u6574\u63a8\u7406\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u673a\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u5143\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

Based on prior work in simple orbits, our method produces a broad class of stable, periodic trajectories by stabilizing the system around a Lie group-based geometric embedding. Employing the Lie group SO(3), we generate a wider range of periodic curves than existing quaternion-based methods. Furthermore, we exploit SO(3) properties to eliminate the need for velocity inputs, allowing agents to receive only position inputs.

To address this gap, we present the Software Quality Dataset (SQuaD), a multi-dimensional, time-aware collection of software quality metrics extracted from 450 mature open-source projects across diverse ecosystems, including Apache, Mozilla, FFmpeg, and the Linux kernel. By integrating nine state-of-the-art static analysis tools, i.e., SonarQube, CodeScene, PMD, Understand, CK, JaSoMe, RefactoringMiner, RefactoringMiner++, and PyRef, our dataset unifies over 700 unique metrics at method, class, file, and project levels. Covering a total of 63,586 analyzed project releases, SQuaD also provides version control and issue-tracking histories, software vulnerability data (CVE/CWE), and process metrics proven to enhance Just-In-Time (JIT) defect prediction. The SQuaD enables empirical research on maintainability, technical debt, software evolution, and quality assessment at unprecedented scale. We also outline emerging research directions, including automated dataset updates and cross-project quality modeling to support the continuous evolution of software analytics.

We give a near-optimal algorithm for this problem; as a corollary, this leads to 2-approximation algorithms with the same additive error as the $5$-approximation algorithms of Alabi et al. for the Kemeny rank aggregation problem in both central and local models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6539\u8fdb\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u6392\u540d\u805a\u5408\u7684\u52a0\u6027\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u89e3\u51b3\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e0b\u7684footrule\u6392\u540d\u805a\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u6392\u540d\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u52a0\u6027\u8bef\u5dee\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5728\u6392\u540d\u805a\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848(PTAS)\u548c\u9488\u5bf9footrule\u6392\u540d\u805a\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e2d\u592e\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u52a0\u6027\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3afootrule\u6392\u540d\u805a\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3aKemeny\u6392\u540d\u805a\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e862-\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u4e2d\u592e\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5c0f\u52a0\u6027\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1(DP)\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848(PTAS)\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e0b\u7684footrule\u6392\u540d\u805a\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, the risks associated with SCR usage violations have become a growing concern. One particular type of SCR usage violation, known as a logic-level usage violation, is becoming especially harmful. This violation occurs when the SCR adheres to its specified usage rules but fails to align with the specific business logic of the current context, leading to significant vulnerabilities. Detecting such violations necessitates a deep semantic understanding of the contract's business logic, including the ability to extract implicit usage patterns and analyze fine-grained logical behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose SCRUTINEER, the first automated and practical system for detecting logic-level usage violations of SCRs. First, we design a composite feature extraction approach that produces three complementary feature representations, supporting subsequent analysis. We then introduce a Large Language Model-powered knowledge construction framework, which leverages comprehension-oriented prompts and domain-specific tools to extract logic-level usage and build the SCR knowledge base. Next, we develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-driven inspector, which combines a rapid retrieval strategy with both comprehensive and targeted analysis to identify potentially insecure logic-level usages. Finally, we implement a logic-level usage violation analysis engine that integrates a similarity-based checker and a snapshot-based inference conflict checker to enable accurate and robust detection. We evaluate SCRUTINEER from multiple perspectives on 3 ground-truth datasets.

CNN models have become larger-scale to improve accuracy and generalization performance. Research has been conducted on compressing pre-trained models for specific target applications in environments with limited computing resources. Among model compression techniques, methods using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), an explainable AI technique, have shown promise by achieving high pruning rates while preserving accuracy, even without fine-tuning. Because these methods do not require fine-tuning, they are suited to scenarios with limited data.

A relation-specific space weighting strategy dynamically selects optimal geometries for each relation type, while a multi-space consistency loss ensures coherent predictions across spaces. We evaluate HyperComplEx on computer science research knowledge graphs ranging from 1K papers (~25K triples) to 10M papers (~45M triples), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines. On the 10M-paper dataset, HyperComplEx achieves 0.612 MRR, a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline, while maintaining efficient training, achieving 85 ms inference per triple.

Prior approaches typically fall into two extremes -- either learning the entire task or relying on privileged information and hand-designed planners -- both of which struggle to handle diverse objects in long-horizon tasks. To address these challenges, we present a unified framework for collaborative multi-robot, multi-object non-prehensile manipulation that integrates flow-matching co-generation with anonymous multi-robot motion planning. Within this framework, a generative model co-generates contact formations and manipulation trajectories from visual observations, while a novel motion planner conveys robots at scale. Crucially, the same planner also supports coordination at the object level, assigning manipulated objects to larger target structures and thereby unifying robot- and object-level reasoning within a single algorithmic framework. Experiments in challenging simulated environments demonstrate that our approach outperforms baselines in both motion planning and manipulation tasks, highlighting the benefits of generative co-design and integrated planning for scaling collaborative manipulation to complex multi-agent, multi-object settings.

However, integrating Agile methods into safety-critical system development in the aerospace industry presents substantial challenges due to its strict compliance requirements, such as those outlined in the DO-178C standard. To achieve this vision, the flexibility of Agile must align with the rigorous certification guidelines, which emphasize documentation, traceability of requirements across different levels and disciplines, and comprehensive verification and validation (V&V) activities. The research work described in this paper proposes a way of using the strengths of the flexible nature of Agile methods to automate and manage change requests throughout the whole software development lifecycle, ensuring robust traceability, regulatory compliance and ultimately facilitating successful certification. This study proposes CertiA360, a tool designed to help teams improve requirement maturity, automate the changes in traceability, and align with the regulatory objectives. The tool was designed and validated in close collaboration with aerospace industry experts, using their feedback to ensure practical application and real-life effectiveness. The feedback collected demonstrated that the automation given by CertiA360 may reduce manual effort and allow response to changing requirements while ensuring compliance with DO-178C.

Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset.

Hawkes"], "title": "Terradynamics and design of tip-extending robotic anchors", "comment": null, "summary": "Most engineered pilings require substantially more force to be driven into the ground than they can resist during extraction. This requires relatively heavy equipment for insertion, which is problematic for anchoring in hard-to-access sites, including in extraterrestrial locations. In contrast, for tree roots, the external reaction force required to extract is much greater than required to insert--little more than the weight of the seed initiates insertion. This is partly due to the mechanism by which roots insert into the ground: tip extension. Proof-of-concept robotic prototypes have shown the benefits of using this mechanism, but a rigorous understanding of the underlying granular mechanics and how they inform the design of a robotic anchor is lacking. Here, we study the terradynamics of tip-extending anchors compared to traditional piling-like intruders, develop a set of design insights, and apply these to create a deployable robotic anchor. Specifically, we identify that to increase an anchor's ratio of extraction force to insertion force, it should: (i) extend beyond a critical depth; (ii) include hair-like protrusions; (iii) extend near-vertically, and (iv) incorporate multiple smaller anchors rather than a single large anchor. Synthesizing these insights, we developed a lightweight, soft robotic, root-inspired anchoring device that inserts into the ground with a reaction force less than its weight. We demonstrate that the 300 g device can deploy a series of temperature sensors 45 cm deep into loose Martian regolith simulant while anchoring with an average of 120 N, resulting in an anchoring-to-weight ratio of 40:1.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6811\u6839\u63d2\u5165\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u8f7b\u578b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u951a\uff0c\u63d2\u5165\u529b\u5c0f\u4e8e\u81ea\u8eab\u91cd\u91cf\uff0c\u951a\u56fa\u529b\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6869\u57fa\u5728\u96be\u4ee5\u5230\u8fbe\u5730\u70b9\uff08\u5982\u5916\u661f\u73af\u5883\uff09\u4e2d\u63d2\u5165\u529b\u5927\u3001\u8bbe\u5907\u91cd\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6a21\u4eff\u6811\u6839\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u5c16\u7aef\u5ef6\u4f38\u951a\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6869\u72b6\u4fb5\u5165\u7269\u7684\u5730\u9762\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u539f\u5219\u5f00\u53d1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u951a\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a300\u514b\u7684\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u951a\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u677e\u6563\u7684\u706b\u661f\u571f\u58e4\u6a21\u62df\u7269\u4e2d\u63d2\u516545\u5398\u7c73\uff0c\u951a\u56fa\u529b\u8fbe120N\uff0c\u951a\u56fa\u4e0e\u91cd\u91cf\u6bd4\u8fbe40:1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u5c16\u7aef\u5ef6\u4f38\u951a\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6869\u72b6\u4fb5\u5165\u7269\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u578b\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u951a\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u91cf\u8f7b\u3001\u53cd\u5e94\u529b\u5c0f\u7684\u951a\u56fa\u88c5\u7f6e\u3002"}}

However, existing methods often face three major challenges: unbalanced category distribution, the complexity of dynamic facial action unit time modeling, and the difficulty of feature fusion due to modal heterogeneity. With the explosive growth of multimodal data in social media scenarios, the need for building an efficient cross-modal fusion framework for emotion recognition is becoming increasingly urgent. To this end, this paper proposes Multimodal Cross-Attention Network and Contrastive Learning (MCN-CL) for multimodal emotion recognition. It uses a triple query mechanism and hard negative mining strategy to remove feature redundancy while preserving important emotional cues, effectively addressing the issues of modal heterogeneity and category imbalance.

To address this challenge, we present a hand-agnostic manipulation transfer system. It efficiently converts human hand manipulation sequences from demonstration videos into high-quality dexterous manipulation trajectories without requirements of massive training data. To tackle the multi-dimensional disparities between human hands and dexterous hands, as well as the challenges posed by high-degree-of-freedom coordinated control of dexterous hands, we design a progressive transfer framework: first, we establish primary control signals for dexterous hands based on kinematic matching; subsequently, we train residual policies with action space rescaling and thumb-guided initialization to dynamically optimize contact interactions under unified rewards; finally, we compute wrist control trajectories with the objective of preserving operational semantics. Using only human hand manipulation videos, our system automatically configures system parameters for different tasks, balancing kinematic matching and dynamic optimization across dexterous hands, object categories, and tasks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework can automatically generate smooth and semantically correct dexterous hand manipulation that faithfully reproduces human intentions, achieving high efficiency and strong generalizability with an average transfer success rate of 73%, providing an easily implementable and scalable method for collecting robot dexterous manipulation data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u624b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u8f6c\u79fb\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u624b\u90e8\u89c6\u9891\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6307\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u786c\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\u6536\u96c6\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u9650\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8f6c\u79fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5339\u914d\u5efa\u7acb\u521d\u6b65\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u62c7\u6307\u5f15\u5bfc\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b8b\u5dee\u7b56\u7565\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u63a5\u89e6\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u4fdd\u6301\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u624b\u8155\u63a7\u5236\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u7075\u5de7\u624b\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5fe0\u5b9e\u518d\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u8f6c\u79fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe\u523073%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u624b\u90e8\u64cd\u4f5c\u89c6\u9891\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u6307\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u64cd\u4f5c\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8673%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u8f6c\u79fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6536\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort. The new framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528LLMs\u4f18\u5316\u8111\u90e8\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u751f\u7269\u7ea6\u675f\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u8111\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u8111\u8fde\u63a5\u7ec4\u4f5c\u4e3a\u75be\u75c5\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u57fa\u8d28\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u75c5\u7406\u4f20\u64ad\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u5f53\u7ea6\u675f\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u6765\u7efc\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6837\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u4ece\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u89c2\u5bdf\u6784\u5efa\u957f\u671f\u75be\u75c5\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u751f\u7269\u7ea6\u675f\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u961f\u5217\u7684tau-PET\u6210\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u989d\u5916\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u533a\u57df\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u4ece\u975e\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u7eb5\u5411\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8d85\u51fa\u4f20\u7edf\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u989d\u5916\u75be\u75c5\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

Accepted for publication in the Journal of Information Systems Engineering and Management", "summary": "Object detection using images or videos captured by drones is a promising technology with significant potential across various industries. However, a major challenge is that drone images are typically taken from high altitudes, making object identification difficult. This paper proposes an effective solution to address this issue. The base model used in the experiments is YOLOv11, the latest object detection model, with a specific implementation based on YOLOv11n. The experimental data were sourced from the widely used and reliable VisDrone dataset, a standard benchmark in drone-based object detection. This paper introduces an enhancement to the Head network of the YOLOv11 algorithm, called the GhostHead Network. The model incorporating this improvement is named YOLO-Drone. Experimental results demonstrate that YOLO-Drone achieves significant improvements in key detection accuracy metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and mAP (0.5), compared to the original YOLOv11. Specifically, the proposed model recorded a 0.4% increase in Precision, a 0.6% increase in Recall, a 0.5% increase in F1-Score, and a 0.5% increase in mAP (0.5). Additionally, the Inference Speed metric, which measures image processing speed, also showed a notable improvement. These results indicate that YOLO-Drone is a high-performance model with enhanced accuracy and speed compared to YOLOv11. To further validate its reliability, comparative experiments were conducted against other high-performance object detection models, including YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLOv10.

While challenges remain in ambiguous scenarios, these results show that domain specialization and coordinated reasoning can meaningfully improve legal AI performance, providing a scalable and regulation-aware framework for trustworthy and interpretable automated compliance verification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6cd5\u5f8bAI\u5728\u5408\u89c4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u660e\u786e\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\uff08\u5982\u65e5\u672c\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u62a4\u6cd5APPI\uff09\u4e0b\uff0cAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u4e1a\u52a1\u80cc\u666f\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5408\u6210\u534f\u8bae\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728200\u4e2aAPPI\u7b2c16\u6761\u4fee\u6b63\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523072%\uff0c\u6bd4\u5355\u4ee3\u7406\u57fa\u7ebf\u9ad821\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5728\u660e\u786e\u5408\u89c4\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523090%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e3a16%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u660e\u663e\u8fdd\u89c4\u7684\u5b8c\u7f8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6cd5\u5f8bAI\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5408\u89c4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u6cd5\u89c4\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

In contrast, world models that capture environmental dynamics in latent space have opened up new perspectives for navigation tasks, enabling systems to move beyond traditional multi-module pipelines. However, world model often suffers from high computational costs in both training and inference. To address this, we propose LS-NWM - a lightweight latent space navigation world model that is trained and operates entirely in latent space, compared to the state-of-the-art baseline, our method reduces training time by approximately 3.2x and planning time by about 447x,while further improving navigation performance with a 35% higher SR and an 11% higher SPL. The key idea is that accurate pixel-wise environmental prediction is unnecessary for navigation. Instead, the model predicts future latent states based on current observational features and action inputs, then performs path planning and decision-making within this compact representation, significantly improving computational efficiency. By incorporating an autoregressive multi-frame prediction strategy during training, the model effectively captures long-term spatiotemporal dependencies, thereby enhancing navigation performance in complex scenarios.

Recent methods based on submodular subset selection have achieved high faithfulness, but their efficiency limitations hinder practical deployment in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose PhaseWin, a novel phase-window search algorithm that enables faithful region attribution with near-linear complexity. PhaseWin replaces traditional quadratic-cost greedy selection with a phased coarse-to-fine search, combining adaptive pruning, windowed fine-grained selection, and dynamic supervision mechanisms to closely approximate greedy behavior while dramatically reducing model evaluations. Theoretically, PhaseWin retains near-greedy approximation guarantees under mild monotone submodular assumptions. Empirically, PhaseWin achieves over 95% of greedy attribution faithfulness using only 20% of the computational budget, and consistently outperforms other attribution baselines across object detection and visual grounding tasks with Grounding DINO and Florence-2.

Despite extensive training, these systems will inevitably encounter scenarios where no available course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints (e.g., operating procedures, rules, laws, norms, and goals). To achieve goals in accordance with human expectations and values, agents must go beyond their trained policies and instead construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action. These processes require contextual \"knowledge\" that may lie outside prior (policy) training. This paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making in these contexts. It also identifies the types of knowledge agents require to make decisions robust to agent goals and aligned with human expectations.

Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable OOD detection performance by integrating both visual and textual modalities. In this context, negative prompts are introduced to emphasize the dissimilarity between image features and prompt content. However, these prompts often include a broad range of non-ID features, which may result in suboptimal outcomes due to the capture of overlapping or misleading information. To address this issue, we propose Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision, which encourages negative prompts to capture inter-class features and transfers this semantic knowledge to the visual modality to enhance OOD detection performance. Our method begins with class-specific positive and negative prompts initialized by large language models (LLMs). These prompts are subsequently optimized, with positive prompts focusing on features within each class, while negative prompts highlight features around category boundaries. Additionally, a graph-based architecture is employed to aggregate semantic-aware supervision from the optimized prompt representations and propagate it to the visual branch, thereby enhancing the performance of the energy-based OOD detector. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, across eight OOD datasets and five different LLMs, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6b63\u8d1f\u63d0\u793a\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u8d1f\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u6355\u6349\u91cd\u53e0\u6216\u8bef\u5bfc\u4fe1\u606f\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6b63\u8d1f\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u67b6\u6784\u805a\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4f20\u64ad\u81f3\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u652f\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u7684OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-100\u548cImageNet-1K\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8de8\u516b\u4e2aOOD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e94\u79cd\u4e0d\u540cLLM\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u8d1f\u63d0\u793a\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

This agent-based approach ensures semantic coherence, scalability, and high-quality output without relying on predefined schemas or handcrafted extraction rules. We evaluate the system on a real-world dataset of air conditioner product descriptions, demonstrating strong performance in both ontology generation and KG population.

However, enabling a unified framework that generalizes across different tasks, objects, and environments while seamlessly integrating non-prehensile and prehensile (P) actions remains challenging: robots must determine when to invoke NP skills, select the appropriate primitive for each context, and compose P and NP strategies into robust, multi-step plans. We introduce ApaptPNP, a vision-language model (VLM)-empowered task and motion planning framework that systematically selects and combines P and NP skills to accomplish diverse manipulation objectives. Our approach leverages a VLM to interpret visual scene observations and textual task descriptions, generating a high-level plan skeleton that prescribes the sequence and coordination of P and NP actions. A digital-twin based object-centric intermediate layer predicts desired object poses, enabling proactive mental rehearsal of manipulation sequences. Finally, a control module synthesizes low-level robot commands, with continuous execution feedback enabling online task plan refinement and adaptive replanning through the VLM. We evaluate ApaptPNP across representative P&NP hybrid manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world environments.

This study investigates the performance of two lightweight models, YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n, which are the nano variants of the latest official YOLO series, within a unified detection and classification framework for FER. Two benchmark classification datasets, FER2013 and KDEF, are converted into object detection format and model performance is evaluated using mAP 0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. Results show that YOLOv12n achieves the highest overall performance on the clean KDEF dataset with a mAP 0.5 of 95.6, and also outperforms YOLOv11n on the FER2013 dataset in terms of mAP 63.8, reflecting stronger sensitivity to varied expressions. In contrast, YOLOv11n demonstrates higher precision 65.2 on FER2013, indicating fewer false positives and better reliability in noisy, real-world conditions. On FER2013, both models show more confusion between visually similar expressions, while clearer class separation is observed on the cleaner KDEF dataset. These findings underscore the trade-off between sensitivity and precision, illustrating how lightweight YOLO models can effectively balance performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate adaptability across both controlled and real-world conditions, establishing these models as strong candidates for real-time, resource-constrained emotion-aware AI applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7YOLO\u6a21\u578b\uff08YOLOv11n\u548cYOLOv12n\uff09\u5728FER\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0cYOLOv12n\u5728\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u66f4\u654f\u611f\uff0cYOLOv11n\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\uff08FER\uff09\u5728\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982YOLO\u7cfb\u5217\uff09\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c06FER2013\u548cKDEF\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86YOLOv11n\u548cYOLOv12n\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528mAP 0.5\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c\u6df7\u6dc6\u77e9\u9635\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "YOLOv12n\u5728\u5e72\u51c0\u7684KDEF\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff08mAP 0.5\u4e3a95.6\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728FER2013\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eYOLOv11n\uff08mAP 63.8\uff09\u3002YOLOv11n\u5728FER2013\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\uff0865.2\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002\u4e24\u8005\u5728FER2013\u4e0a\u5bf9\u76f8\u4f3c\u8868\u60c5\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5b58\u5728\u6df7\u6dc6\uff0c\u800c\u5728KDEF\u4e0a\u5206\u7c7b\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7YOLO\u6a21\u578b\uff08YOLOv11n\u548cYOLOv12n\uff09\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002YOLOv12n\u5728\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u800cYOLOv11n\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002"}}

Using high-level modelling languages such as Essence, a modeller may express their problems in terms of abstract structures. These are structures not natively supported by the solvers, and so they have to be transformed into or represented as other structures before solving. For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to \"break\" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude. Most of these symmetry-breaking techniques involve placing some kind of ordering for the variables of the problem, and picking a particular member under the symmetries, usually the smallest. Unfortunately, applying this technique to abstract variables produces a very large number of complex constraints that perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a new incomplete method of breaking the symmetries of abstract structures by better exploiting their representations. We apply the method in breaking the symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects, a commonly occurring type of symmetry, and show that our method is faster than the previous methods proposed in (Akg\u00fcn et al. 2025).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6c42\u89e3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u6c42\u89e3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u62bd\u8c61\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\u6765\u6253\u7834\u5176\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u4e0d\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u8c61\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6253\u7834\u4e0d\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u8c61\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u65f6\uff0c\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6253\u7834\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u5176\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982Akg\u00fcn\u7b49\u4eba2025\u5e74\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002"}}

Yet the real world is dynamic, quasi-static interactions are insufficient to cope with the various environmental conditions. As a step toward more dynamic interaction scenario, we present a reinforcement-learning-based training pipeline that produces a unified whole-body controller for humanoid badminton, enabling coordinated lower-body footwork and upper-body striking without any motion priors or expert demonstrations. Training follows a three-stage curriculum: first footwork acquisition, then precision-guided racket swing generation, and finally task-focused refinement, yielding motions in which both legs and arms serve the hitting objective. For deployment, we incorporate an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate and predict shuttlecock trajectories for target striking. We also introduce a prediction-free variant that dispenses with EKF and explicit trajectory prediction. To validate the framework, we conduct five sets of experiment in both simulation and the real world. In simulation, two robots sustain a rally of 21 consecutive hits. Moreover, the prediction-free variant achieves successful hits with comparable performance relative to the target-known policy. In real-world tests, both the prediction and controller module exhibit high accuracy, and on-court hitting achieves an outgoing shuttle speed up to 10 m/s with a mean return landing distance of 3.5 m.

However, heterogeneous architecture distillation, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) to ResNet18, faces challenges due to differences in spatial feature representations.Traditional KD methods are mostly designed for homogeneous architectures and hence struggle to effectively address the disparity. Although heterogeneous KD approaches have been developed recently to solve these issues, they often incur high computational costs and complex designs, or overly rely on logit alignment, which limits their ability to leverage the complementary features. To overcome these limitations, we propose Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD),a simple yet effective framework that integrates complementary teacher and student features to align representations in shared logits.These logits are decomposed and constrained to facilitate diverse knowledge transfer to the student. Specifically, HCD processes the student's intermediate features through convolutional projector and adaptive pooling, concatenates them with teacher's feature from the penultimate layer and then maps them via the Complementary Feature Mapper (CFM) module, comprising fully connected layer,to produce shared logits.We further introduce Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) that partitions the shared logits into n sub-logits, which are fused with teacher's logits to rectify classification.To ensure sub-logit diversity and reduce redundant knowledge transfer, we propose an Orthogonality Loss (OL).By preserving student-specific strengths and leveraging teacher knowledge,HCD enhances robustness and generalization in students.Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100, Fine-grained (e.g., CUB200)and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that HCD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods,establishing it as an effective solution for heterogeneous KD.", "AI": {"tldr": "HCD\u63d0\u51fa\u5f02\u6784\u4e92\u8865\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eablogits\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e08\u751f\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SDD\u548cOL\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u751f\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f02\u6784\u67b6\u6784\u84b8\u998f\uff08\u5982ViT\u5230ResNet18\uff09\u56e0\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u5dee\u5f02\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5f02\u6784KD\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u4f34\u968f\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3001\u590d\u6742\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6216\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56logit\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4e92\u8865\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "HCD\u901a\u8fc7\u5377\u79ef\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6c60\u5316\u5904\u7406\u5b66\u751f\u4e2d\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e0e\u6559\u5e08\u7279\u5f81\u62fc\u63a5\u540e\u901a\u8fc7Complementary Feature Mapper\u6a21\u5757\u751f\u6210\u5171\u4eablogits\u3002SDD\u5c06\u5171\u4eablogits\u5206\u89e3\u4e3an\u4e2a\u5b50logits\u5e76\u4e0e\u6559\u5e08logits\u878d\u5408\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\uff0cOrthogonality Loss\u5219\u786e\u4fdd\u5b50logits\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-100\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5982CUB200\uff09\u548cImageNet-1K\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHCD\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709KD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784KD\u7684\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "HCD\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u5e08\u751f\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u5728\u5171\u4eablogits\u4e2d\u5bf9\u9f50\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation\u548cOrthogonality Loss\uff0cHCD\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Many existing works attempt to address this issue by leveraging model representations (e.g., mean feature vectors) to correct local training; however, they often face two key limitations: 1) Incomplete Contextual Representation Learning: Current approaches primarily focus on final-layer features, overlooking critical multi-level cues and thus diluting essential context for accurate segmentation. 2) Layerwise Style Bias Accumulation: Although utilizing representations can partially align global features, these methods neglect domain-specific biases within intermediate layers, allowing style discrepancies to build up and reduce model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose FedBCS to bridge feature representation gaps via domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment.

In autonomous driving, this is crucial to avoid collisions and navigate in complex, dense traffic scenarios. One way to plan is to search for the best action sequence. However, this is challenging when all necessary components - policy, next-state predictor, and critic - have to be learned. Here we propose Differentiable Simulation for Search (DSS), a framework that leverages the differentiable simulator Waymax as both a next state predictor and a critic. It relies on the simulator's hardcoded dynamics, making state predictions highly accurate, while utilizing the simulator's differentiability to effectively search across action sequences. Our DSS agent optimizes its actions using gradient descent over imagined future trajectories.

While ARC has inspired extensive research on abstract reasoning, most existing approaches rely on static input--output supervision, which limits insight into how reasoning unfolds over time. ARCTraj addresses this gap by recording temporally ordered, object-level actions that capture how humans iteratively transform inputs into outputs, revealing intermediate reasoning steps that conventional datasets overlook. Collected via the O2ARC web interface, it contains around 10,000 trajectories annotated with task identifiers, timestamps, and success labels across 400 training tasks from the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark.

Applying a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to this task enables spatio-temporal analysis of facial motion and provides interpretable descriptions. However, there are still two core challenges: (1) The entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion cues prevents the model from focusing on subtle motion; (2) Textual labels in existing MER datasets do not fully correspond to underlying facial muscle movements, creating a semantic gap between text supervision and physical motion. To address these issues, we propose DEFT-LLM, which achieves motion semantic alignment by multi-expert disentanglement. We first introduce Uni-MER, a motion-driven instruction dataset designed to align text with local facial motion. Its construction leverages dual constraints from optical flow and Action Unit (AU) labels to ensure spatio-temporal consistency and reasonable correspondence to the movements. We then design an architecture with three experts to decouple facial dynamics into independent and interpretable representations (structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics). By integrating the instruction-aligned knowledge from Uni-MER into DEFT-LLM, our method injects effective physical priors for micro expressions while also leveraging the cross modal reasoning ability of large language models, thus enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues.

In contrast, vision-based tactile sensors in robotics have been limited to simple planar geometries, with biomorphic designs remaining underexplored. To address this gap, we present SimTac, a physics-based simulation framework for the design and validation of biomorphic tactile sensors. SimTac consists of particle-based deformation modeling, light-field rendering for photorealistic tactile image generation, and a neural network for predicting mechanical responses, enabling accurate and efficient simulation across a wide range of geometries and materials. We demonstrate the versatility of SimTac by designing and validating physical sensor prototypes inspired by biological tactile structures and further demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple Sim2Real tactile tasks, including object classification, slip detection, and contact safety assessment. Our framework bridges the gap between bio-inspired design and practical realisation, expanding the design space of tactile sensors and paving the way for tactile sensing systems that integrate morphology and sensing to enable robust interaction in unstructured environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "SimTac\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u751f\u7269\u5f62\u6001\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53d8\u5f62\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u5149\u573a\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u7269\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u89e6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u5728\u751f\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u4e0e\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u5f62\u5f0f\u7d27\u5bc6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u5e73\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u751f\u7269\u5f62\u6001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "SimTac\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u5149\u573a\u6e32\u67d3\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u7684\u89e6\u89c9\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u673a\u68b0\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7SimTac\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53d7\u751f\u7269\u89e6\u89c9\u7ed3\u6784\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2aSim2Real\u89e6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SimTac\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u7269\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

However, existing methods face challenges in capturing global dependencies in video content and accommodating multimodal user customization. Moreover, temporal proximity between video frames does not always correspond to semantic proximity. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Language-guided Graph Representation Learning Network (LGRLN) for video summarization. Specifically, we introduce a video graph generator that converts video frames into a structured graph to preserve temporal order and contextual dependencies. By constructing forward, backward and undirected graphs, the video graph generator effectively preserves the sequentiality and contextual relationships of video content. We designed an intra-graph relational reasoning module with a dual-threshold graph convolution mechanism, which distinguishes semantically relevant frames from irrelevant ones between nodes. Additionally, our proposed language-guided cross-modal embedding module generates video summaries with specific textual descriptions. We model the summary generation output as a mixture of Bernoulli distribution and solve it with the EM algorithm. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks.

To bridge this gap, we propose that geometric construction provides an ideal testbed as it inherently demands a fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation. We introduce GGBench, a benchmark designed specifically to evaluate geometric generative reasoning. It provides a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing a model's ability to not only understand and reason but to actively construct a solution, thereby setting a more rigorous standard for the next generation of intelligent systems.

In these non-Markovian settings, key decision cues are often hidden in object-specific histories rather than the current scene. Without persistent memory of prior interactions (what has been interacted with, where it has been, or how it has changed) visuomotor policies may fail, repeat past actions, or overlook completed ones. To surface this challenge, we introduce LIBERO-Mem, a non-Markovian task suite for stress-testing robotic manipulation under object-level partial observability. It combines short- and long-horizon object tracking with temporally sequenced subgoals, requiring reasoning beyond the current frame. However, vision-language-action (VLA) models often struggle in such settings, with token scaling quickly becoming intractable even for tasks spanning just a few hundred frames. We propose Embodied-SlotSSM, a slot-centric VLA framework built for temporal scalability. It maintains spatio-temporally consistent slot identities and leverages them through two mechanisms: (1) slot-state-space modeling for reconstructing short-term history, and (2) a relational encoder to align the input tokens with action decoding.

A key challenge in DFER is the many-to-one labeling problem, where a video composed of numerous frames is assigned a single emotion label. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is to formulate DFER as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. However, MIL-based approaches inherently suffer from the visual diversity of emotional expressions and the complexity of temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose TG-DFER, a text-guided weakly supervised framework that enhances MIL-based DFER by incorporating semantic guidance and coherent temporal modeling. We incorporate a vision-language pre-trained (VLP) model is integrated to provide semantic guidance through fine-grained textual descriptions of emotional context. Furthermore, we introduce visual prompts, which align enriched textual emotion labels with visual instance features, enabling fine-grained reasoning and frame-level relevance estimation.

Although the Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) paradigm offers a promising solution by promoting consensus among multiple agents to enhance reliability, it relies on the unrealistic assumption that all debaters are rational and reflective, which is a condition that may not hold when agents themselves are prone to hallucinations. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol, inspired by social deduction games like \"Who is Undercover?\". MUG reframes MAD as a process of detecting \"undercover\" agents (those suffering from hallucinations) by employing multimodal counterfactual tests. Specifically, we modify reference images to introduce counterfactual evidence and observe whether agents can accurately identify these changes, providing ground-truth for identifying hallucinating agents and enabling robust, crowd-powered multimodal reasoning. MUG advances MAD protocols along three key dimensions: (1) enabling factual verification beyond statistical consensus through counterfactual testing; (2) introducing cross-evidence reasoning via dynamically modified evidence sources instead of relying on static inputs; and (3) fostering active reasoning, where agents engage in probing discussions rather than passively answering questions. Collectively, these innovations offer a more reliable and effective framework for multimodal reasoning in LLMs. The source code can be accessed at https://github.com/YongLD/MUG.git.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMUG\u7684\u65b0\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\uff08MAD\uff09\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u90fd\u662f\u7406\u6027\u4e14\u53cd\u601d\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u4ee3\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u5e7b\u89c9\u800c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0cMUG\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "MUG\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ee3\u7406\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8bc6\u522b\u5e7b\u89c9\u4ee3\u7406\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "MUG\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86MAD\u534f\u8bae\uff1a\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u8bc1\u636e\u6e90\u7684\u8de8\u8bc1\u636e\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "MUG\u4e3aLLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Standard solutions, such as auxiliary load-balancing losses, can reduce load disparities but often weaken expert specialization and hurt downstream performance. To address these issues, we propose ERMoE, a sparse MoE transformer that reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an \"Eigenbasis Score\", defined as the cosine similarity between input features and an expert's basis. This content-aware routing ties token assignments directly to experts' representation spaces, stabilizing utilization and promoting interpretable specialization without sacrificing sparsity. Crucially, ERMoE removes the need for explicit balancing losses and avoids the interfering gradients they introduce. We show that ERMoE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks (e.g., COCO, Flickr30K), while naturally producing flatter expert load distributions. Moreover, a 3D MRI variant (ERMoE-ba) improves brain age prediction accuracy by more than 7\\% and yields anatomically interpretable expert specializations.

While recent progress has shown promising results, they still suffer from two key limitations: (i) the reasoning processes lack the depth and iterative refinement characteristic of human cognition; and (ii) the reasoning processes exhibit instability, which compromises their reliability in downstream applications. In this work, we present STaR (slow-thinking for table reasoning), a new framework achieving cognitive table reasoning, in which LLMs are equipped with slow-thinking capabilities by explicitly modeling step-by-step thinking and uncertainty-aware inference. During training, STaR employs two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (DRL), progressively learning from simple to complex queries under a composite reward.

While recent advances in vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong generalization across domains, extending them to continual settings remains challenging. In particular, learning task-specific soft prompts for newly introduced classes often leads to severe classifier bias, as the text prototypes overfit to recent categories when prior data are unavailable. In this paper, we propose DMC, a simple yet effective two-stage framework for CLIP-based CIL that decouples the adaptation of the vision encoder and the optimization of textual soft prompts. Each stage is trained with the other frozen, allowing one modality to act as a stable semantic anchor for the other to preserve cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, current CLIP-based CIL approaches typically store class-wise Gaussian statistics for generative replay, yet they overlook the distributional drift that arises when the vision encoder is updated over time. To address this issue, we introduce DMC-OT, an enhanced version of DMC that incorporates an optimal-transport guided calibration strategy to align memory statistics across evolving encoders, along with a task-specific prompting design that enhances inter-task separability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101 demonstrate that both DMC and DMC-OT achieve state-of-the-art performance, with DMC-OT further improving accuracy by an average of 1.80%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDMC\u548cDMC-OT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86CLIP\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u5c55\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982CLIP\uff09\u5230\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u65f6\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "DMC\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u6587\u672c\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff1bDMC-OT\u52a0\u5165\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "DMC\u548cDMC-OT\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0cDMC-OT\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "DMC\u548cDMC-OT\u5728CIFAR-100\u3001Imagenet-R\u3001CUB-200\u548cUCF-101\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dDMC-OT\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e861.80%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002"}}

Workshop website: https://sites.google.com/rice.edu/parallelized-planning-control/", "summary": "Coverage motion planning is essential to a wide range of robotic tasks. Unlike conventional motion planning problems, which reason over temporal sequences of states, coverage motion planning requires reasoning over the spatial distribution of entire trajectories, making standard motion planning methods limited in computational efficiency and less amenable to modern parallelization frameworks. In this work, we formulate the coverage motion planning problem as a statistical inference problem from the perspective of flow matching, a generative modeling technique that has gained significant attention in recent years. The proposed formulation unifies commonly used statistical discrepancy measures, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence and Sinkhorn divergence, with a standard linear quadratic regulator problem. More importantly, it decouples the generation of trajectory gradients for coverage from the synthesis of control under nonlinear system dynamics, enabling significant acceleration through parallelization on modern computational architectures, particularly Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). This paper focuses on the advantages of this formulation in terms of scalability through parallelization, highlighting its computational benefits compared to conventional methods based on waypoint tracking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u5c06\u8986\u76d6\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8986\u76d6\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8986\u76d6\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5dee\u5f02\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08\u5982KL\u6563\u5ea6\u548cSinkhorn\u6563\u5ea6\uff09\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u4e8c\u6b21\u8c03\u8282\u5668\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u8026\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u5408\u6210\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u8fdc\u8d85\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u822a\u70b9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8986\u76d6\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u73b0\u4ee3\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5982GPU\uff09\u3002"}}

We trace this instability to the common extension of Rotary Position Embeddings to video through multimodal RoPE. The induced inverse Fourier time kernel exhibits frame-scale ripples that multiply adjacent frames by different factors, which perturbs attention that should otherwise be governed by the raw query key inner product. We present Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a simple, training-free mechanism that applies small opposed phase offsets across heads and then aggregates their outputs. PAS preserves the per-head spectrum magnitude, while the aggregation effectively smooths the temporal kernel and reduces phase sensitivity without changing the positional encoding structure. Our analysis shows that the RoPE rotated logit can be approximated as a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; smoothing this kernel yields Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts; multi phase averaging attenuates high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling.

Manually creating and populating simulation environments with assets for robotic manipulation has not addressed these issues, primarily due to the significant engineering effort required and the often substantial sim-to-real gap, both in terms of physics and rendering. In this paper, we explore the use of action-conditional video generation models as a scalable way to learn world models for policy evaluation. We demonstrate how to incorporate action conditioning into existing pre-trained video generation models. This allows leveraging internet-scale in-the-wild online videos during the pre-training stage, and alleviates the need for a large dataset of paired video-action data, which is expensive to collect for robotic manipulation.

We evaluate the workflow on referring expression grounding (REC), spatial reasoning (Spatial-Map, Spatial-Grid, Spatial-Maze), and BLINK-Jigsaw. Relative to answering open-ended queries directly, quantization to MCQ yields large gains, and True/False binarization provides a consistent additional boost. Across all tasks, the same workflow produces significant improvements, indicating generality.

There is a substantial risk that some of these decision induce harm to people, by infringing their well-being or their fundamental human rights. The state-of-the-art in AI systems makes little effort with respect to appropriate documentation of the decision process. This obstructs the ability to trace what went into a decision, which in turn is a prerequisite to any attempt of reconstructing a responsibility chain. Specifically, such traceability is linked to a documentation that will stand up in court when determining the cause of some AI-based decision that inadvertently or intentionally violates the law.\n  This paper takes a radical, yet practical, approach to this problem, by enforcing the documentation of each and every component that goes into the training or inference of an automated decision. As such, it presents the first running workflow supporting the generation of tamper-proof, verifiable and exhaustive traces of AI decisions. In doing so, we expand the DBOM concept into an effective running workflow leveraging confidential computing technology.

This work re-thinks this paradigm, introducing a framework built on hierarchical parallelism and progressive adaptation that re-establishes pure autoregression as a top-performing and practical solution. Our approach is embodied in the Hierarchical Parallel Autoregressive ConvNet (HPAC), an ultra-lightweight pre-trained model using a hierarchical factorized structure and content-aware convolutional gating to efficiently capture spatial dependencies. We introduce two key optimizations for practicality: Cache-then-Select Inference (CSI), which accelerates coding by eliminating redundant computations, and Adaptive Focus Coding (AFC), which efficiently extends the framework to high bit-depth images. Building on this efficient foundation, our progressive adaptation strategy is realized by Spatially-Aware Rate-Guided Progressive Fine-tuning (SARP-FT). This instance-level strategy fine-tunes the model for each test image by optimizing low-rank adapters on progressively larger, spatially-continuous regions selected via estimated information density. Experiments on diverse datasets (natural, satellite, medical) validate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art compression.

We develop an appropriate notion of contrastive explanations for the special case of ABox reasoning with description logic ontologies, and analyze the computational complexity for different variants under different optimality criteria, considering lightweight as well as more expressive description logics. We implemented a first method for computing one variant of contrastive explanations, and evaluated it on generated problems for realistic knowledge bases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027ABox\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u91ca\u2018\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48a\u662fC\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u800cb\u4e0d\u662f\u2019\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u80fd\u5355\u72ec\u89e3\u91ca\u6b63\u5411\u8574\u542b\uff08\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48C(a)\u7531\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u8574\u542b\uff09\u6216\u7f3a\u5931\u8574\u542b\uff08\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48C(b)\u4e0d\u88ab\u8574\u542b\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u4e24\u8005\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u91ca\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\u672c\u4f53\u8bbaABox\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u548c\u66f4\u5177\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u7684\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u6807\u51c6\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u7684\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027ABox\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u56de\u7b54\u2018\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48a\u662fC\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u800cb\u4e0d\u662f\u2019\u8fd9\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u6b63\u5411\u8574\u542b\u548c\u7f3a\u5931\u8574\u542b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u591f\u805a\u7126\u4e8ea\u548cb\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u5171\u6027\u4e0e\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u9488\u5bf9\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u7684ABox\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u6807\u51c6\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce a new ergodic control formulation that optimizes spatial coverage using a volumetric state representation. Our method preserves the asymptotic coverage guarantees of ergodic control, adds minimal computational overhead for real-time control, and supports arbitrary sample-based volumetric models. We evaluate our method across search and manipulation tasks -- with multiple robot dynamics and end-effector geometries or sensor models -- and show that it improves coverage efficiency by more than a factor of two while maintaining a 100% task completion rate across all experiments, outperforming the standard ergodic control method.

To overcome this challenge, a number of methods have been proposed, including the collection of prompt-image datasets and the integration of additional data modalities during training. Although these methods have shown promising results in general domains, they face limitations when applied to specialized fields such as medicine, where only limited types and insufficient amounts of data are available. We present CLUE (Controllable Latent space of Unprompted Embeddings), a generative model framework that achieves diverse generation while maintaining stability through fixed-format prompts without requiring any additional data. Based on the Stable Diffusion architecture, CLUE employs a Style Encoder that processes images and prompts to generate style embeddings, which are subsequently fed into a new second attention layer of the U-Net architecture. Through Kullback-Leibler divergence, the latent space achieves continuous representation of image features within Gaussian regions, independent of prompts. Performance was assessed on otitis media dataset. CLUE reduced FID to 9.30 (vs. 46.81) and improved recall to 70.29% (vs. 49.60%). A classifier trained on synthetic-only data at 1000% scale achieved an F1 score of 83.21% (vs. 73.83%). Combining synthetic data with equal amounts of real data achieved an F1 score of 94.76%, higher than when using only real data. On an external dataset, synthetic-only training achieved an F1 score of 76.77% (vs. 60.61%) at 1000% scale. The combined approach achieved an F1 score of 85.78%, higher than when using only the internal dataset.

Fundamentally, aligning LVLMs is not just a safety challenge but a problem of economic efficiency. Current alignment methods struggle with the trade-off between safety, utility, and operational costs. Critically, a focus solely on final outputs (process-blindness) wastes significant computational budget on unsafe deliberation. This flaw allows harmful reasoning to be disguised with benign justifications, thereby circumventing simple additive safety scores. To address this, we propose EcoAlign, an inference-time framework that reframes alignment as an economically rational search by treating the LVLM as a boundedly rational agent.

However, their effectiveness significantly declines in real-world situations where certain modalities are missing or unavailable. This degradation primarily stems from inconsistent representation learning between complete multimodal data and incomplete modality scenarios. Existing approaches typically address missing modalities through relatively simplistic generation methods, yet these approaches fail to adequately preserve cross-modal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework named PROMISE, a PROMpting-Attentive HIerarchical ContraStive LEarning approach designed explicitly for robust cross-modal representation under conditions of missing modalities. Specifically, PROMISE innovatively incorporates multimodal prompt learning into a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, equipped with a specially designed prompt-attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically generates robust and consistent representations for scenarios where particular modalities are absent, thereby effectively bridging the representational gap between complete and incomplete data. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, along with comprehensive ablation studies, clearly demonstrate the superior performance of PROMISE compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "PROMISE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u6301\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPROMISE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPROMISE\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PROMISE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space. A human-agent interaction experiment using an immersive VR-based setup demonstrates that RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further show the model's significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods.

Although emotion analysis has made progress in the visual domain, the video community lacks dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, particularly for stylized and non-realistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce EmoVid, the first multimodal, emotion-annotated video dataset specifically designed for creative media, which includes cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers. Each video is annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and text captions. Through systematic analysis, we uncover spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms. Building on these insights, we develop an emotion-conditioned video generation technique by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model. The results show a significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and the visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks.

Autonomous robots performing precise liquid manipulation tasks, such as dispensing, aspiration, and mixing, must handle containers in ways that inevitably induce these deformations, complicating accurate liquid state assessment. Current datasets lack comprehensive physics-informed simulation data representing realistic liquid behaviors under diverse dynamic scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Phys-Liquid, a physics-informed dataset comprising 97,200 simulation images and corresponding 3D meshes, capturing liquid dynamics across multiple laboratory scenes, lighting conditions, liquid colors, and container rotations. To validate the realism and effectiveness of Phys-Liquid, we propose a four-stage reconstruction and estimation pipeline involving liquid segmentation, multi-view mask generation, 3D mesh reconstruction, and real-world scaling. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy and consistency in reconstructing liquid geometry and volume, outperforming existing benchmarks.

However, existing MIL methods face critical limitations: (1) they rely on attention mechanisms that lack causal interpretability, and (2) they fail to integrate patient demographics (age, gender, race), leading to fairness concerns across diverse populations. These shortcomings hinder clinical translation, where algorithmic bias can exacerbate health disparities. We introduce \\textbf{MeCaMIL}, a causality-aware MIL framework that explicitly models demographic confounders through structured causal graphs. Unlike prior approaches treating demographics as auxiliary features, MeCaMIL employs principled causal inference -- leveraging do-calculus and collider structures -- to disentangle disease-relevant signals from spurious demographic correlations. Extensive evaluation on three benchmarks demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across CAMELYON16 (ACC/AUC/F1: 0.939/0.983/0.946), TCGA-Lung (0.935/0.979/0.931), and TCGA-Multi (0.977/0.993/0.970, five cancer types). Critically, MeCaMIL achieves superior fairness -- demographic disparity variance drops by over 65% relative reduction on average across attributes, with notable improvements for underserved populations. The framework generalizes to survival prediction (mean C-index: 0.653, +0.017 over best baseline across five cancer types). Ablation studies confirm causal graph structure is essential -- alternative designs yield 0.048 lower accuracy and 4.2x times worse fairness. These results establish MeCaMIL as a principled framework for fair, interpretable, and clinically actionable AI in digital pathology.

This paper focuses on 6D pose estimation of strawberries using purely synthetic data generated through a procedural pipeline for photorealistic rendering. We employ the YOLOX-6D-Pose algorithm, a single-shot approach that leverages the YOLOX backbone, known for its balance between speed and accuracy, and its support for edge inference. To address the lacking availability of training data, we introduce a robust and flexible pipeline for generating synthetic strawberry data from various 3D models via a procedural Blender pipeline, where we focus on enhancing the realism of the synthesized data in comparison to previous work to make it a valuable resource for training pose estimation algorithms. Quantitative evaluations indicate that our models achieve comparable accuracy on both the NVIDIA RTX 3090 and Jetson Orin Nano across several ADD-S metrics, with the RTX 3090 demonstrating superior processing speed. However, the Jetson Orin Nano is particularly suited for resource-constrained environments, making it an excellent choice for deployment in agricultural robotics.

This limitation highlights the absence of a quantitative measure of how much these models actually use visual information during reasoning. We propose Draft and Refine (DnR), an agent framework driven by a question-conditioned utilization metric. The metric quantifies the model's reliance on visual evidence by first constructing a query-conditioned relevance map to localize question-specific cues and then measuring dependence through relevance-guided probabilistic masking. Guided by this metric, the DnR agent refines its initial draft using targeted feedback from external visual experts. Each expert's output (such as boxes or masks) is rendered as visual cues on the image, and the model is re-queried to select the response that yields the largest improvement in utilization. This process strengthens visual grounding without retraining or architectural changes.

Physicians draw on these multimodal and temporal sources of EHR data to form a comprehensive view of a patient's health, which is crucial for informed therapeutic decision-making. Yet, most predictive models fail to fully capture the interactions, redundancies, and temporal patterns across multiple data modalities, often focusing on a single data type or overlooking these complexities. In this paper, we present CURENet, a multimodal model (Combining Unified Representations for Efficient chronic disease prediction) that integrates unstructured clinical notes, lab tests, and patients' time-series data by utilizing large language models (LLMs) for clinical text processing and textual lab tests, as well as transformer encoders for longitudinal sequential visits.

While systems that update and maintain a memory at inference time have been proposed, existing designs only steer the system by modifying textual input to a language model or agent, which means that they cannot change sampling parameters, remove tools, modify system prompts, or switch between agentic and workflow paradigms. On the other hand, systems that adapt more flexibly require offline optimization and remain static once deployed. We present Experience-Guided Reasoner (EGuR), which generates tailored strategies -- complete computational procedures involving LLM calls, tools, sampling parameters, and control logic -- dynamically at inference time based on accumulated experience. We achieve this using an LLM-based meta-strategy -- a strategy that outputs strategies -- enabling adaptation of all strategy components (prompts, sampling parameters, tool configurations, and control logic). EGuR operates through two components: a Guide generates multiple candidate strategies conditioned on the current problem and structured memory of past experiences, while a Consolidator integrates execution feedback to improve future strategy generation. This produces complete, ready-to-run strategies optimized for each problem, which can be cached, retrieved, and executed as needed without wasting resources. Across five challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, 3-SAT, and three Big Bench Extra Hard tasks), EGuR achieves up to 14% accuracy improvements over the strongest baselines while reducing computational costs by up to 111x, with both metrics improving as the system gains experience.", "AI": {"tldr": "EGuR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65e0\u6cd5\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u6574\u91c7\u6837\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u914d\u7f6e\u6216\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5143\u7b56\u7565\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u8ba1\u7b97\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5305\u62ecLLM\u8c03\u7528\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u3001\u91c7\u6837\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u903b\u8f91\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cEGuR\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe14%\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe111\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "EGuR\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

We present Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction (SUPER), which exploits the perfect reconstruction (PR) property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing (SS) redundant features. Free from rigid framelet constraints, SUPER serves as a plug-and-play decoder block for diverse U-Net variants, eliminating their intrinsic reconstruction bottlenecks and enhancing representational richness. Experiments across diverse crack benchmarks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrate the structural potential of the proposed SUPER Decoder Block. Maintaining comparable computational cost, SUPER enriches representational diversity through increased parameterization. In small-scale in-domain experiments on the CrackVision12K dataset, SUPER markedly improves thin-crack segmentation performance, particularly for cracks narrower than 4 px, underscoring its advantage in high-frequency dominant settings. In smartphone image denoising on SIDD, where low-frequency components prevail, SUPER still achieves a moderate gain in PSNR, confirming its robustness across low- and high-frequency regimes.

Agents trained solely to achieve their objectives may adopt harmful behavior, exposing a key trade-off between maximizing the reward function and maintaining the alignment. For the pre-trained agents, ensuring alignment is particularly challenging, as retraining can be a costly and slow process. This is further complicated by the diverse and potentially conflicting attributes representing the ethical values for alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a test-time alignment technique based on model-guided policy shaping. Our method allows precise control over individual behavioral attributes, generalizes across diverse reinforcement learning (RL) environments, and facilitates a principled trade-off between ethical alignment and reward maximization without requiring agent retraining. We evaluate our approach using the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, which comprises 134 text-based game environments and thousands of annotated scenarios involving ethical decisions. The RL agents are first trained to maximize the reward in their respective games.

However, such models must handle control conditions and content generation computational requirements, resulting in generally low generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) approach that reduces computational overhead by adopting cache strategies with different granularities at different computational stages. Specifically, (1) we use a coarse-grained cache (block-level) based on feature reuse to dynamically bypass redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks between each step of model reasoning. (2) We design a fine-grained cache (prompt-level) that acts within a module, where the fine-grained cache reuses cross-attention maps within consecutive reasoning steps and extends them to the corresponding module computations of adjacent steps. These caches of different granularities can be seamlessly integrated into each computational link of the controllable generation process. We verify the effectiveness of HGC on four benchmark datasets, especially its advantages in balancing generation efficiency and visual quality. For example, on the COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, our HGC significantly reduces the computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T), while keeping the loss of semantic fidelity (quantized performance degradation) within 1.5%.", "AI": {"tldr": "HGC\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u7c92\u5ea6\u7f13\u5b58\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c1163%\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e14\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u4f4e\u4e8e1.5%\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u5904\u7406\u63a7\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4f4e\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u7c92\u5ea6\u7f13\u5b58\uff08HGC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5757\u7ea7\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7f13\u5b58\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u7ea7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5757\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728COCO-Stuff\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cHGC\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff08MACs\uff09\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8663%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u63a7\u5236\u57281.5%\u4ee5\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "HGC\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

This paper has been accepted by IJCNN 2025 but not published", "summary": "Automatic segmentation methods of polyps is crucial for assisting doctors in colorectal polyp screening and cancer diagnosis. Despite the progress made by existing methods, polyp segmentation faces several challenges: (1) small-sized polyps are prone to being missed during identification, (2) the boundaries between polyps and the surrounding environment are often ambiguous, (3) noise in colonoscopy images, caused by uneven lighting and other factors, affects segmentation results. To address these challenges, this paper introduces coupling gates as components in specific modules to filter noise and perform feature importance selection. Three modules are proposed: the coupling gates multiscale feature extraction (CGMFE) module, which effectively extracts local features and suppresses noise; the windows cross attention (WCAD) decoder module, which restores details after capturing the precise location of polyps; and the decoder feature aggregation (DFA) module, which progressively aggregates features, further extracts them, and performs feature importance selection to reduce the loss of small-sized polyps. Experimental results demonstrate that MPCGNet outperforms recent networks, with mDice scores 2.20% and 0.68% higher than the second-best network on the ETIS-LaribPolypDB and CVC-ColonDB datasets, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMPCGNet\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b0\u6a21\u5757\u89e3\u51b3\u606f\u8089\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u606f\u8089\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5bf8\u606f\u8089\u6613\u88ab\u9057\u6f0f\u3001\u606f\u8089\u8fb9\u754c\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u7ed3\u80a0\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1aCGMFE\u6a21\u5757\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u53d6\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\uff0cWCAD\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u5757\u7528\u4e8e\u6062\u590d\u7ec6\u8282\uff0cDFA\u6a21\u5757\u7528\u4e8e\u9010\u6b65\u805a\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5bf8\u606f\u8089\u7684\u4e22\u5931\u3002", "result": "MPCGNet\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "MPCGNet\u5728ETIS-LaribPolypDB\u548cCVC-ColonDB\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7f51\u7edc\uff0cmDice\u5206\u6570\u5206\u522b\u9ad8\u51fa\u7b2c\u4e8c\u540d2.20%\u548c0.68%\u3002"}}

We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty. We also show cross-task transfer, where segmentation performance improves by 7 percent cIoU even when trained using classification-only data. Traditional models (ResNet-50 and U-Net) show modest gains, confirming the broad utility of the MAT framework, while multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization.

However, current methods face two major challenges: Hierarchy Representation Collapse (HRC) and Redundancy-Induced Saliency Dilution (RISD). HRC compresses abstract-to-specific and whole-to-part hierarchies in Euclidean embeddings, while RISD averages noisy fragments, obscuring critical semantic cues and diminishing the model's ability to distinguish hard negatives. To address these challenges, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Alignment Reasoning Network (H$^{2}$ARN) for text-3D retrieval. H$^{2}$ARN embeds both text and 3D data in a Lorentz-model hyperbolic space, where exponential volume growth inherently preserves hierarchical distances. A hierarchical ordering loss constructs a shrinking entailment cone around each text vector, ensuring that the matched 3D instance falls within the cone, while an instance-level contrastive loss jointly enforces separation from non-matching samples. To tackle RISD, we propose a contribution-aware hyperbolic aggregation module that leverages Lorentzian distance to assess the relevance of each local feature and applies contribution-weighted aggregation guided by hyperbolic geometry, enhancing discriminative regions while suppressing redundancy without additional supervision. We also release the expanded T3DR-HIT v2 benchmark, which contains 8,935 text-to-3D pairs, 2.6 times the original size, covering both fine-grained cultural artefacts and complex indoor scenes.

Supplementary material included after references. 27 pages, 21 figures, 11 tables", "summary": "4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a reliable, non-invasive approach for estimating blood flow velocities, vital for cardiovascular diagnostics. Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency. Experimental results on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and real 4D flow MRI datasets demonstrate that PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy.

However, existing methods rely on weight-based merging, where one LoRA often dominates the other, leading to interference and degraded fidelity. This interference is structural: separately trained LoRAs occupy low-rank high-dimensional subspaces, leading to non-orthogonal and overlapping representations. In this work, we analyze the internal structure of LoRAs and find their generative behavior is dominated by a few principal directions in the low-rank subspace, which should remain free from interference during fusion. To achieve this, we propose Null Space Projection LoRA (NP-LoRA), a projection-based framework for LoRA fusion that enforces subspace separation to prevent structural interference among principal directions. Specifically, we first extract principal style directions via singular value decomposition (SVD) and then project the subject LoRA into its orthogonal null space. Furthermore, we introduce a soft projection mechanism that enables smooth control over the trade-off between subject fidelity and style consistency.

Existing acceleration methods face a fundamental trade-off: dynamically estimating sparse attention patterns at each denoising step incurs high computational overhead and estimation errors, while static sparsity patterns remain fixed and often suboptimal throughout denoising. We identify a key structural property of diffusion attention, namely, its sparsity patterns exhibit strong temporal coherence across denoising steps. Tiles deemed non-essential at step $t$ typically remain so at step $t+\u03b4$. Leveraging this observation, we introduce LiteAttention, a method that exploits temporal coherence to enable evolutionary computation skips across the denoising sequence. By marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward, LiteAttention eliminates redundant attention computations without repeated profiling overheads, combining the adaptivity of dynamic methods with the efficiency of static ones. We implement a highly optimized LiteAttention kernel on top of FlashAttention and demonstrate substantial speedups on production video diffusion models, with no degradation in quality.

To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \\textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \\textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details.

For decades traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been state-of-the-art for precipitation forecasting. However, physically-parameterized models suffer from a few core limitations: first, solving PDEs to resolve atmospheric dynamics is computationally demanding, and second, these methods degrade in performance at nowcasting timescales (i.e., 0-4 hour lead-times). Motivated by these shortcomings, recent work proposes AI-weather prediction (AI-WP) alternatives that learn to emulate analysis data with neural networks. While these data-driven approaches have enjoyed enormous success across diverse spatial and temporal resolutions, applications of video-understanding architectures for weather forecasting remain underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose SaTformer: a video transformer built on full space-time attention that skillfully forecasts extreme precipitation from satellite radiances. Along with our novel architecture, we introduce techniques to tame long-tailed precipitation datasets. Namely, we reformulate precipitation regression into a classification problem, and employ a class-weighted loss to address label imbalances.

Under review for MIDL 2026", "summary": "Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events, with CT-based Agatston scoring widely regarded as the clinical gold standard. However, CT is costly and impractical for large-scale screening, while chest X-rays (CXRs) are inexpensive but lack reliable ground truth labels, constraining deep learning development. Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) offer a scalable alternative by projecting CT volumes into CXR-like images while inheriting precise labels. In this work, we provide the first systematic evaluation of DRRs as a surrogate training domain for CAC detection. Using 667 CT scans from the COCA dataset, we generate synthetic DRRs and assess model capacity, super-resolution fidelity enhancement, preprocessing, and training strategies.

These extracted features are subsequently utilized as input to support vector regression estimators, one for each class, trained on few labeled samples to estimate the proportions of healthy, attacked by bark beetle, and dead trees for each pixel.

It links two independently trained diffusion models (DMs) in the source and target domains by first adding noise to a source image to obtain a latent code, then denoising it in the target domain to generate the translated image. However, this method faces two key challenges: (1) low translation efficiency, and (2) translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel I2I translation framework, OT-ALD, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, which retains the strengths of DDIB-based approach. Specifically, we compute an OT map from the latent distribution of the source domain to that of the target domain, and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion process in the target domain. Our error analysis confirms that OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatches. Moreover, OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved image quality.

The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) improved the quality of photorealistic image generation. Diffusion models later brought a new era of generative media. These advances made it difficult to separate real and synthetic content. The rise of deepfakes demonstrated how these tools could be misused to spread misinformation, political conspiracies, privacy violations, and fraud. For this reason, many detection models have been developed. They often use deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models search for visual, spatial, or temporal anomalies. However, such approaches often fail to generalize across unseen data and struggle with content from different models. In addition, existing approaches are ineffective in multimodal data and highly modified content. This study reviews twenty-four recent works on AI-generated media detection. Each study was examined individually to identify its contributions and weaknesses, respectively. The review then summarizes the common limitations and key challenges faced by current approaches. Based on this analysis, a research direction is suggested with a focus on multimodal deep learning models. Such models have the potential to provide more robust and generalized detection.

To address this, we introduce AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework, in which diverse specialized VLM -- each following distinct prompting strategies -- generate candidate answers and then engage in two-stage interaction: generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate these proposals. This debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true predictive performance. We find that more calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences. Furthermore, we introduce a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function called aligncal designed to fine-tune the specialized agents by minimizing an upper bound on the calibration error. This objective explicitly improves the fidelity of each agent's confidence estimates. Empirical results across multiple benchmark VQA datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies. Furthermore, we propose a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss to fine-tune the specialized agents and improve the quality of their individual confidence estimates based on minimising upper bound calibration error.", "AI": {"tldr": "AlignVQA\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86VQA\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3VQA\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u533b\u7597\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u8fc7\u81ea\u4fe1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165AlignVQA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u548c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08\u6279\u5224\u3001\u7ec6\u5316\u548c\u805a\u5408\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u611f\u77e5\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570aligncal\u6765\u5fae\u8c03\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aVQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AlignVQA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u611f\u77e5\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86VQA\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Then we self-distill Hindsight-Zero into Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Generator and Knowledge Generator, enabling the generation of sequential steps and discrete facts.

Despite great efforts, it remains challenging to explicitly learn and predict latencies, the temporal delays with which agents respond to different trajectory-changing events and adjust their future paths, whether on their own or interactively. Different agents may exhibit distinct latency preferences for noticing, processing, and reacting to any specific trajectory-changing event. The lack of consideration of such latencies may undermine the causal continuity of the forecasting system and also lead to implausible or unintended trajectories. Inspired by the reverberation curves in acoustics, we propose a new reverberation transform and the corresponding Reverberation (short for Rev) trajectory prediction model, which simulates and predicts different latency preferences of each agent as well as their stochasticity by using two explicit and learnable reverberation kernels, allowing for the controllable trajectory prediction based on these forecasted latencies. Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrians or vehicles, demonstrate that Rev achieves competitive accuracy while revealing interpretable latency dynamics across agents and scenarios.

Generic augmentations show inconsistent gains under such shifts, whereas dataset-specific augmentations require expert knowledge and prior analysis. Moreover, prior studies show that neural networks adapt poorly to domain shifts because they exhibit a learning bias to domain-specific frequency components. Perturbing frequency values can mitigate such bias but overlooks pixel-level details, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these problems, we propose D-GAP (Dataset-agnostic and Gradient-guided augmentation in Amplitude and Pixel spaces), improving OOD robustness by introducing targeted augmentation in both the amplitude space (frequency space) and pixel space. Unlike conventional handcrafted augmentations, D-GAP computes sensitivity maps in the frequency space from task gradients, which reflect how strongly the model responds to different frequency components, and uses the maps to adaptively interpolate amplitudes between source and target samples. This way, D-GAP reduces the learning bias in frequency space, while a complementary pixel-space blending procedure restores fine spatial details.

Meanwhile, data serves as the fundamental infrastructure for modern autonomous driving AI. However, due to stringent data collection requirements, existing datasets focus primarily on ordinary traffic scenarios, constraining the benefits of cooperative perception. To address this challenge, we introduce CATS-V2V, the first-of-its-kind real-world dataset for V2V cooperative perception under complex adverse traffic scenarios. The dataset was collected by two hardware time-synchronized vehicles, covering 10 weather and lighting conditions across 10 diverse locations. The 100-clip dataset includes 60K frames of 10 Hz LiDAR point clouds and 1.26M multi-view 30 Hz camera images, along with 750K anonymized yet high-precision RTK-fixed GNSS and IMU records.

Such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content, raising significant data privacy concerns. Regulatory frameworks mandating the 'right to be forgotten' drive the need for machine unlearning. This technique allows for the removal of target data without resource-consuming retraining. However, while well-studied for text, visual concept unlearning in MLLMs remains underexplored. A primary challenge is precisely removing a target visual concept without disrupting model performance on related entities. To address this, we introduce AUVIC, a novel visual concept unlearning framework for MLLMs. AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise forgetting. This approach effectively isolates the target concept while avoiding unintended effects on similar entities. To evaluate our method, we construct VCUBench.

This refers to instances where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations, such as when a title recalls a familiar artwork or film scene. While prior research on memorization and unlearning emphasizes forgetting, we examine what is remembered and how, focusing on the balance between recognizing cultural references and reproducing them. We introduce an evaluation framework that separates recognition, whether a model identifies a reference, from realization, how it depicts it through replication or reinterpretation, quantified through measures capturing both dimensions. By evaluating five diffusion models across 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references spanning static and dynamic imagery, we show that our framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. To assess linguistic sensitivity, we conduct prompt perturbation experiments using synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions, finding that models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Finally, our analysis shows that cultural alignment correlates not only with training data frequency, but also textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date. Our work reveals that the value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u5316\u53c2\u8003\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8f6c\u6362\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u590d\u5236\u6587\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u66f4\u6ce8\u91cd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u6807\u6027\u8fd9\u4e00\u7279\u5b9a\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u5373\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5524\u8d77\u6587\u5316\u5171\u4eab\u5173\u8054\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8bc6\u522b\uff08\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u6587\u5316\u53c2\u8003\uff09\u4e0e\u5b9e\u73b0\uff08\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u5236\u6216\u91cd\u65b0\u8be0\u91ca\u6765\u63cf\u7ed8\u53c2\u8003\uff09\u5206\u5f00\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\u6355\u6349\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e94\u4e2a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728767\u4e2a\u6e90\u81eaWikidata\u7684\u6587\u5316\u53c2\u8003\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u533a\u5206\u590d\u5236\u4e0e\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u9762\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002\u6587\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9891\u7387\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u3001\u53c2\u8003\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u521b\u5efa\u65e5\u671f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u4e8e\u590d\u5236\u6587\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u66f4\u5728\u4e8e\u5982\u4f55\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bed\u5883\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u8d85\u8d8a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

While recent advances such as 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in dynamic scene reconstruction, they typically rely on the assumption that input video streams are temporally synchronized. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption often fails due to factors like camera trigger delays or independent recording setups, leading to temporal misalignment across views and reduced reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, a novel temporal alignment strategy is proposed for high-quality 4DGS reconstruction from unsynchronized multi-view videos. Our method features a coarse-to-fine alignment module that estimates and compensates for each camera's time shift. The method first determines a coarse, frame-level offset and then refines it to achieve sub-frame accuracy. This strategy can be integrated as a readily integrable module into existing 4DGS frameworks, enhancing their robustness when handling asynchronous data.

Although VLLMs excel in Visual Question Answering (VQA) on multi-page VRDs, their ability to detect unanswerable questions is still an open research question. Our research delves into the robustness of the VLLMs to plausible yet unanswerable questions, i.e., questions that appear valid but cannot be answered due to subtle corruptions caused by swaps between related concepts or plausible question formulations. Corruptions are generated by replacing the original natural language entities with other ones of the same type, belonging to different document elements, and in different layout positions or pages of the related document. To this end, we present VRD-UQA (VISUALLY RICH DOCUMENT UNANSWERABLE QUESTION ANSWERING), a benchmark for evaluating VLLMs' resilience to plausible yet unanswerable questions across multiple dimensions.

Most existing methods rely on Transformer-based cross-attention, whose quadratic complexity hinders efficiency. Moreover, small vision-language models often struggle to precisely capture fine-grained, task-relevant visual regions, leading to degraded performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks that limit their effectiveness in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics. To further enhance visual grounding, we propose a Token-Grid Correlation Module, which computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning. This enables the model to selectively emphasize visual regions relevant to the textual prompt while maintaining linear-time inference.

In this paper, we introduce ImAgent, a training-free unified multimodal agent that integrates reasoning, generation, and self-evaluation within a single framework for efficient test-time scaling. Guided by a policy controller, multiple generation actions dynamically interact and self-organize to enhance image fidelity and semantic alignment without relying on external models.

In this work, we show that in many hallucinatory predictions the LVLM effectively ignores the image and instead relies on previously generated output (prelim) tokens to infer new objects. We quantify this behavior via the mutual information between the image and the predicted object conditioned on the prelim, demonstrating that weak image dependence strongly correlates with hallucination. Building on this finding, we introduce the Prelim Attention Score (PAS), a lightweight, training-free signal computed from attention weights over prelim tokens.

We present the first large-scale, systematic study of VLM robustness to benign visual and textual perturbations: pixel-level shifts, light geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites that do not alter the underlying semantics of an image-question pair. Across a broad set of models and datasets, we find that modern VLMs are highly sensitive to such minor perturbations: a substantial fraction of samples change their predicted answer under at least one visual or textual modification. We characterize how this instability varies across perturbation types, question categories, and models, revealing that even state-of-the-art systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) frequently fail under shifts as small as a few pixels or harmless rephrasings. We further show that sample-level stability serves as a strong indicator of correctness: stable samples are consistently far more likely to be answered correctly. Leveraging this, we demonstrate that the stability patterns of small, accessible open-source models can be used to predict the correctness of much larger closed-source models with high precision.

However, existing backdoor attacks for 3D point clouds have been limited to a rigid one-to-one paradigm. To address this, we present the first one-to-N backdoor framework for 3D vision, based on a novel, configurable spherical trigger. Our key insight is to leverage the spatial properties of spheres as a parameter space, allowing a single trigger design to encode multiple target classes.

However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Instead of building separate models, we propose MAFM^3 (Modular Adaptation of Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Medical AI), a framework that enables a single foundation model to expand into diverse domains, tasks, and modalities through lightweight modular components. These components serve as specialized skill sets that allow the system to flexibly activate the appropriate capability at the inference time, depending on the input type or clinical objective. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat each new task or modality in isolation, MAFM^3 provides a unified and expandable framework for efficient multitask and multimodality adaptation. Empirically, we validate our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for classification into prognosis and segmentation modules. Our results show improved performance on both tasks. Furthermore, by incorporating PET scans, MAFM^3 achieved an improvement in the Dice score 5% compared to the respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models, when equipped with modular components, are not inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve into multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging.

However, when the input comprises sparse training views, 3DGS is prone to overfitting, primarily due to the lack of intermediate-view supervision. Inspired by the recent success of Video Diffusion Models (VDM), we propose a framework called Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) to extract the rich multi-view consistency priors from pretrained VDMs. Building on the insights from Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), GSD supervises rendered images from multiple neighboring views, guiding the Gaussian splatting representation towards the generative direction of VDM. However, the generative direction often involves object motion and random camera trajectories, making it challenging for direct supervision in the optimization process. To address this problem, we introduce an unified guidance form to correct the noise prediction result of VDM. Specifically, we incorporate both a depth warp guidance based on real depth maps and a guidance based on semantic image features, ensuring that the score update direction from VDM aligns with the correct camera pose and accurate geometry.

Point clouds collected from different sensors (e.g., LiDAR scans and mesh-derived point clouds) exhibit substantial discrepancies in density and noise distribution, resulting in negative transfer during multi-domain fusion. Most existing approaches focus exclusively on either domain-aware or domain-general features, overlooking the potential synergy between them. To address this, we propose DoReMi (Domain-Representation Mixture), a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that jointly models Domain-aware Experts branch and a unified Representation branch to enable cooperative learning between specialized and generalizable knowledge. DoReMi dynamically activates domain-aware expert branch via Domain-Guided Spatial Routing (DSR) for context-aware expert selection and employs Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation (EDA) for stable and efficient expert utilization, thereby adaptively modeling diverse domain distributions. Complemented by a frozen unified representation branch pretrained through robust multi-attribute self-supervised learning, DoReMi preserves cross-domain geometric and structural priors while maintaining global consistency.

However, general image editing models often fail to produce satisfactory results when confronted with new styles. The challenge lies in how to effectively fine-tune general image editing models to new styles using only a limited amount of paired data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot style editing framework. For this task, we construct a benchmark dataset that encompasses five distinct styles. Correspondingly, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms for jointly fine-tuning multiple styles. The style-specific routing ensures that different styles do not interfere with one another, while the style-shared routing adaptively allocates shared MoE LoRAs to learn common patterns. Our MoE LoRA can automatically determine the optimal ranks for each layer through a novel metric-guided approach that estimates the importance score of each single-rank component. Additionally, we explore the optimal location to insert LoRA within the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model and integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide the diffusion training process.

This failure stems from a dual-bottleneck: input-stage conflict between computationally exorbitant geometric-aware encoders and superficial 2D-only features, and output-stage misalignment where discrete tokenizers are structurally incapable of producing precise, continuous numerical values. To break this impasse, we introduce GEODE (Geometric-Output and Decoupled-Input Engine), a novel architecture that resolves this dual-bottleneck by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation. GEODE augments main VLM with two specialized, plug-and-play modules: Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) that acts as spatial co-processor, aligning explicit 3D data with 2D visual features via cross-attention and distilling spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic into injectable Rationale Tokens; and Direct Regression Head (DRH), an \"Embedding-as-Value\" paradigm which routes specialized control tokens to a lightweight MLP for precise, continuous regression of scalars and 3D bounding boxes.

Along this line, recent \"Mamba-for-vision\" variants largely explore multiple scan orders to relax strict causality for non-sequential signals (e.g., images). Rather than preserving cross-block memory, the conventional formulation of the selective-scan operation in Mamba reinitializes each block's state-space dynamics from zero, discarding the terminal state-space representation (SSR) from the previous block. Arcee, a cross-block recurrent state chain, reuses each block's terminal state-space representation as the initial condition for the next block. Handoff across blocks is constructed as a differentiable boundary map whose Jacobian enables end-to-end gradient flow across terminal boundaries. Key to practicality, Arcee is compatible with all prior \"vision-mamba\" variants, parameter-free, and incurs constant, negligible cost. As a modeling perspective, we view terminal SSR as a mild directional prior induced by a causal pass over the input, rather than an estimator of the non-sequential signal itself. To quantify the impact, for unconditional generation on CelebA-HQ (256$\\times$256) with Flow Matching, Arcee reduces FID$\\downarrow$ from $82.81$ to $15.33$ ($5.4\\times$ lower) on a single scan-order Zigzag Mamba baseline.

Interestingly, we found that these models are not entirely blind to numbers-they are implicitly aware of their own counting accuracy, as their internal signals shift in consistent ways depending on whether the output meets the specified count. This observation suggests that the model already encodes a latent notion of numerical correctness, which can be harnessed to guide generation more precisely. Building on this intuition, we introduce CountSteer, a training-free method that improves generation of specified object counts by steering the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference. In our experiments, CountSteer improved object-count accuracy by about 4% without compromising visual quality, demonstrating a simple yet effective step toward more controllable and semantically reliable text-to-image generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "CountSteer\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8c61\u8ba1\u6570\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9075\u5faa\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u6307\u4ee4\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u53f7\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5bf9\u8ba1\u6570\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e00\u7279\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165CountSteer\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCountSteer\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c06\u5bf9\u8c61\u8ba1\u6570\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ea64%\u3002", "conclusion": "CountSteer\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8c61\u8ba1\u6570\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

It is groups of tokens which describe different aspects of the scene. In this work, we propose a model which groups the caption tokens as part of its architecture in order to capture a fine-grained representation of the language. We expect our representations to be at the level of objects present in the image, and therefore align our representations with the output of an image encoder trained to discover objects.

In this work, we bridge this gap with a novel model-agnostic method that conditions language-based driving models on structured relational context in the form of traffic scene graphs. We serialize scene graphs at various abstraction levels and formats, and incorporate them into the models via structured prompt templates, enabling a systematic analysis of when and how relational supervision is most beneficial. Extensive evaluations on the public LangAuto benchmark show that scene graph conditioning of state-of-the-art approaches yields large and persistent improvement in driving performance. Notably, we observe up to a 15.6\\% increase in driving score for LMDrive and 17.5\\% for BEVDriver, indicating that models can better internalize and ground relational priors through scene graph-conditioned training, even without requiring scene graph input at test-time.

While recent methods have shown promise by contrasting spatial relationships between slices, they rely on hard binary thresholds to define positive and negative samples, thereby discarding valuable continuous information about anatomical similarity. Moreover, these methods overlook the global directional consistency of anatomical progression, resulting in distorted feature spaces that fail to capture the canonical anatomical manifold shared across patients. To address these limitations, we propose Coordinative Ordinal-Relational Anatomical Learning (CORAL) to capture both local and global structure in volumetric images. First, CORAL employs a contrastive ranking objective to leverage continuous anatomical similarity, ensuring relational feature distances between slices are proportional to their anatomical position differences. In addition, CORAL incorporates an ordinal objective to enforce global directional consistency, aligning the learned feature distribution with the canonical anatomical progression across patients.

While synthetic data has become fundamental in frame-based computer vision, event-based vision lacks comparable comprehensive resources. Addressing this gap, we present 50,000 event sequences of 34 ms duration each, synthesized from Physically Based Rendering (PBR) scenes of YCB-Video objects following the Benchmark for 6D Object Pose (BOP) methodology. Our generation framework employs simulated linear camera motion to ensure complete scene coverage, including background activity.\n  Through systematic evaluation of event representations for CNN-based inference, we demonstrate that time-surfaces with linear decay and dual-channel polarity encoding achieve superior pose estimation performance, outperforming exponential decay and single-channel alternatives by significant margins. Our analysis reveals that polarity information contributes most substantially to performance gains, while linear temporal encoding preserves critical motion information more effectively than exponential decay. The dataset is provided in a structured format with both raw event streams and precomputed optimal representations to facilitate immediate research use and reproducible benchmarking.\n  The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/paroj/ycbev_sd.", "AI": {"tldr": "YCB-Ev SD\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e6DoF\u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b50,000\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u6700\u4f18\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u9762\u7ebf\u6027\u8870\u51cf\u548c\u53cc\u901a\u9053\u6781\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u6570\u636e\u57286DoF\u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7PBR\u573a\u666f\u5408\u621050,000\u4e2a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5e8f\u5217\u6301\u7eed34\u6beb\u79d2\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u573a\u666f\u5168\u8986\u76d6\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9CNN\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u9762\u7ebf\u6027\u8870\u51cf\u548c\u53cc\u901a\u9053\u6781\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u5728\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u548c\u5355\u901a\u9053\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6781\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8d21\u732e\u6700\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "YCB-Ev SD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u6570\u636e\u57286DoF\u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Free3D introduces a Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ) that maps 2D motion sequences into 3D-consistent latent spaces, and a suite of 3D-free regularization objectives enforcing view consistency, orientation coherence, and physical plausibility. Trained entirely on 2D motion data, Free3D generates diverse, temporally coherent, and semantically aligned 3D motions, achieving performance comparable to or even surpassing fully 3D-supervised counterparts.

Different segmentation approaches have been extensively studied in the past to achieve this task, but were often lacking accuracy or speed. With the advent of machine learning, supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for different segmentation tasks. However, these models are often trained in a supervised manner, which requires large labeled datasets. Unsupervised approaches do not require ground-truth data for learning, but suffer from long segmentation times and often worse segmentation accuracy. Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) are an unsupervised segmentation approach that incorporates concepts of neighborhood and class distributions. We present a method that integrates HMRF theory and CNN segmentation, leveraging the advantages of both areas: unsupervised learning and fast segmentation times. We investigate the contribution of different neighborhood terms and components for the unsupervised HMRF loss. We demonstrate that the HMRF-UNet enables high segmentation accuracy without ground truth on a Micro-Computed Tomography ($\u03bc$CT) image dataset of Polyurethane (PU) foam structures.

Since the meaning of different emotional fluctuations may differ under different emotional contexts, the core limitation is the lack of a hierarchical structural mechanism to disentangle distinct affective components, i.e., emotional bases (the long-term emotional tone), and transient fluctuations (the short-term emotional fluctuations). To address this, we propose the Low-Rank Sparse Emotion Understanding Framework (LSEF), a unified model grounded in the Low-Rank Sparse Principle, which theoretically reframes affective dynamics as a hierarchical low-rank sparse compositional process. LSEF employs three plug-and-play modules, i.e., the Stability Encoding Module (SEM) captures low-rank emotional bases; the Dynamic Decoupling Module (DDM) isolates sparse transient signals; and the Consistency Integration Module (CIM) reconstructs multi-scale stability and reactivity coherence. This framework is optimized by a Rank Aware Optimization (RAO) strategy that adaptively balances gradient smoothness and sensitivity.

Nevertheless, their potential for Document Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Q-Doc, a three-tiered evaluation framework for systematically probing DIQA capabilities of MLLMs at coarse, middle, and fine granularity levels. a) At the coarse level, we instruct MLLMs to assign quality scores to document images and analyze their correlation with Quality Annotations. b) At the middle level, we design distortion-type identification tasks, including single-choice and multi-choice tests for multi-distortion scenarios. c) At the fine level, we introduce distortion-severity assessment where MLLMs classify distortion intensity against human-annotated references. Our evaluation demonstrates that while MLLMs possess nascent DIQA abilities, they exhibit critical limitations: inconsistent scoring, distortion misidentification, and severity misjudgment. Significantly, we show that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting substantially enhances performance across all levels.

Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace\" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features. This ensures stable knowledge accumulation without data replay. Furthermore, BOFA employs a cross-modal hybrid prototype that synergizes stable textual prototypes with visual counterparts derived from our stably adapted bridge-layer, enhancing classification performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that BOFA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "BOFA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684CIL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4\u4f4e\u79e9\u878d\u5408\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6df7\u5408\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86CLIP\u5728CIL\u4e2d\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u6574\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e94\u7528CLIP\u5230CIL\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "BOFA\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u6b63\u4ea4\u4f4e\u79e9\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u9650\u5236\u5728\u4f4e\u79e9\u201c\u5b89\u5168\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u201d\u5185\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6df7\u5408\u539f\u578b\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cBOFA\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "BOFA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u4e8eCLIP\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6865\u63a5\u5c42\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u6b63\u4ea4\u4f4e\u79e9\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86CIL\u4e2d\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We argue that the relationship between visual and brain modalities is fundamentally asymmetric, characterized by two critical gaps: a Fidelity Gap (stemming from EEG's inherent noise and signal degradation, vs. vision's high-fidelity features) and a Semantic Gap (arising from EEG's shallow conceptual representation, vs. vision's rich semantic depth). Previous methods often overlook this asymmetry, forcing alignment between the two modalities as if they were equal partners and thereby leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose the adaptive teaching paradigm. This paradigm empowers the ``teacher\" modality (vision) to dynamically shrink and adjust its knowledge structure under task guidance, tailoring its semantically dense features to match the ``student\" modality (EEG)'s capacity. We implement this paradigm with the ShrinkAdapter, a simple yet effective module featuring a residual-free design and a bottleneck structure. Through extensive experiments, we validate the underlying rationale and effectiveness of our paradigm. Our method achieves a top-1 accuracy of 60.2\\% on the zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 9.8\\%.

Research on the area remains predominantly English-centric, despite increasing global deployment demands. This work addresses multilingual REC through two main contributions. First, we construct a unified multilingual dataset spanning 10 languages, by systematically expanding 12 existing English REC benchmarks through machine translation and context-based translation enhancement. The resulting dataset comprises approximately 8 million multilingual referring expressions across 177,620 images, with 336,882 annotated objects. Second, we introduce an attention-anchored neural architecture that uses multilingual SigLIP2 encoders. Our attention-based approach generates coarse spatial anchors from attention distributions, which are subsequently refined through learned residuals.

WEAVEBench is a human-annotated benchmark with 100 tasks based on 480 images, featuring a hybrid VLM judger evaluation framework based on both the reference image and the combination of the original image with editing instructions that assesses models' abilities in multi-turn generation, visual memory, and world-knowledge reasoning across diverse domains. Experiments demonstrate that training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities. Furthermore, it facilitates UMMs to develop emergent visual-memory capabilities, while extensive evaluations on WEAVEBench expose the persistent limitations and challenges of current approaches in multi-turn, context-aware image generation and editing.

This overlooks the brain's hierarchical processing and blurs the roles of early, middle, and late visual areas. We propose Hi-DREAM, a brain-inspired conditional diffusion framework that makes the cortical organization explicit. A region-of-interest (ROI) adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams and converts them into a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with the U-Net depth (shallow scales preserve layout and edges; deeper scales emphasize objects and semantics). A lightweight, depth-matched ControlNet injects these scale-specific hints during denoising. The result is an efficient and interpretable decoder in which each signal plays a brain-like role, allowing the model not only to reconstruct images but also to illuminate functional contributions of different visual areas. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) show that Hi-DREAM attains state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity.

When querying specific regions or objects in an image, human users naturally use \"visual prompts\" (VPs), such as bounding boxes, to provide reference. However, no existing benchmark systematically evaluates the ability of MLLMs to interpret such VPs. This gap leaves it unclear whether current MLLMs can effectively recognize VPs, an intuitive prompting method for humans, and use them to solve problems. To address this limitation, we introduce VP-Bench, a benchmark for assessing MLLMs' capability in VP perception and utilization. VP-Bench employs a two-stage evaluation framework: Stage 1 examines models' ability to perceive VPs in natural scenes, using 30k visualized prompts spanning eight shapes and 355 attribute combinations. Stage 2 investigates the impact of VPs on downstream tasks, measuring their effectiveness in real-world problem-solving scenarios. Using VP-Bench, we evaluate 28 MLLMs, including proprietary systems (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL3 and Qwen2.5-VL), and provide a comprehensive analysis of factors that affect VP understanding, such as variations in VP attributes, question arrangement, and model scale.

However, this process is often prone to biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, resulting in overfitting and imbalanced performance. Although a few studies have tried to address this problem by generating synthetic data, they lacked control over distribution bias and annotation quality. To address these challenges, we redesign the fine-tuning process in two ways. First, we control the generation of data and its annotations, ensuring it is free from bias, distribution imbalance, and annotation errors. We automatically construct the dataset by comprehensively sampling objects' attributes, including color, shape, size, and position within the scene.

We conduct exhaustive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Existing two-stage adaptation methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training, limiting their generalization to real-world incompleteness. To overcome these issues, we propose a Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) framework that reformulates modality missing as a multi-task learning problem. MaMOL introduces a dual-routing mechanism: a task-oriented dynamic router that adaptively activates experts for different missing patterns, and a modality-specific-shared static router that maintains stable cross-modal knowledge sharing. Unlike prior methods that train separate networks for each missing configuration, MaMOL achieves parameter-efficient adaptation via lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate superior robustness and generalization under varying missing rates, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, transfer experiments on natural image datasets validate its scalability and cross-domain applicability, highlighting MaMOL as a general and efficient solution for incomplete multimodal learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "MaMOL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u56e0\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMissing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u5668\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u9759\u6001\u8def\u7531\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9065\u611f\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5c0f\uff1b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MaMOL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e13\u5bb6\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, existing methods face two key challenges: (1) the need for large-scale 3D city assets for supervised training, which are difficult and costly to obtain, and (2) reliance on semantic or height maps, which are used exclusively for generating buildings in virtual worlds and lack connection to real-world appearance, limiting the realism and generalizability of generated cities. To address these limitations, we propose Sat2RealCity, a geometry-aware and appearance-controllable framework for 3D urban generation from real-world satellite imagery. Unlike previous city-level generation methods, Sat2RealCity builds generation upon individual building entities, enabling the use of rich priors and pretrained knowledge from 3D object generation while substantially reducing dependence on large-scale 3D city assets. Specifically, (1) we introduce the OSM-based spatial priors strategy to achieve interpretable geometric generation from spatial topology to building instances; (2) we design an appearance-guided controllable modeling mechanism for fine-grained appearance realism and style control; and (3) we construct an MLLM-powered semantic-guided generation pipeline, bridging semantic interpretation and geometric reconstruction.

We present nnUNet-B: a Bayesian segmentation framework that infers PD-L1 expression directly from H&E-stained histology images using Multimodal Posterior Sampling (MPS). Built upon nnUNet-v2, our method samples diverse model checkpoints during cyclic training to approximate the posterior, enabling both accurate segmentation and epistemic uncertainty estimation via entropy and standard deviation.

However, US image interpretation remains highly operator-dependent and varies significantly across anatomical regions, acquisition protocols, and device types. These variations, along with unique challenges such as speckle, low contrast, and limited standardized annotations, hinder the development of generalizable, label-efficient ultrasound AI models. In this paper, we propose OpenUS, the first reproducible, open-source ultrasound foundation model built on a large collection of public data. OpenUS employs a vision Mamba backbone, capturing both local and global long-range dependencies across the image. To extract rich features during pre-training, we introduce a novel self-adaptive masking framework that combines contrastive learning with masked image modeling. This strategy integrates the teacher's attention map with student reconstruction loss, adaptively refining clinically-relevant masking to enhance pre-training effectiveness. OpenUS also applies a dynamic learning schedule to progressively adjust the difficulty of the pre-training process. To develop the foundation model, we compile the largest to-date public ultrasound dataset comprising over 308K images from 42 publicly available datasets, covering diverse anatomical regions, institutions, imaging devices, and disease types. Our pre-trained OpenUS model can be easily adapted to specific downstream tasks by serving as a backbone for label-efficient fine-tuning.

Our approach employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual layers to perform piece recognition from smartphone camera images. The system processes RGB images of a physical chess board through a multistep process: image preprocessing using the Hough Line Transform for edge detection, projective transform to achieve a top-down board alignment, segmentation into 64 individual squares, and piece classification into 13 classes (6 unique white pieces, 6 unique black pieces and an empty square) using the residual CNN. Residual connections help retain low-level visual features while enabling deeper feature extraction, improving accuracy and stability during training. We train and evaluate our model using the Chess Recognition Dataset (ChessReD), containing 10,800 annotated smartphone images captured under diverse lighting conditions and angles.

Existing approaches typically fuse either (a) early: by mixing tokens/features inside the encoders, or (b) late: by comparing pooled embeddings. Many methods also tie fusion to an autoregressive decoder. However, the hidden states of both modalities already carry rich, modality-specific structure (spatial layout in vision; syntax and semantics in text), so directly aligning these states is a natural way to match what the two modalities \"think\". We propose a lightweight fusion module: a few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects the vision and text encoder hidden-state sequences into a shared space, attends across modalities, and sends gated residual updates back, with simple stabilizers to improve alignment. The encoders remain non-causal and strong for understanding, while generation stays cleanly decoupled via an optional decoder.

To address this, we propose DocLens, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that effectively ``zooms in'' on evidence like a lens.

However, existing optimization-based reconstruction methods often require dense multi-view inputs and expensive per-instance optimization, limiting their scalability. Recent feedforward approaches offer faster alternatives but frequently produce coarse geometry, lack texture reconstruction, and rely on brittle, complex multi-stage pipelines. We introduce LARM, a unified feedforward framework that reconstructs 3D articulated objects from sparse-view images by jointly recovering detailed geometry, realistic textures, and accurate joint structures. LARM extends LVSM a recent novel view synthesis (NVS) approach for static 3D objects into the articulated setting by jointly reasoning over camera pose and articulation variation using a transformer-based architecture, enabling scalable and accurate novel view synthesis. In addition, LARM generates auxiliary outputs such as depth maps and part masks to facilitate explicit 3D mesh extraction and joint estimation. Our pipeline eliminates the need for dense supervision and supports high-fidelity reconstruction across diverse object categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LARM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both novel view and state synthesis as well as 3D articulated object reconstruction, generating high-quality meshes that closely adhere to the input images. project page: https://sylviayuan-sy.github.io/larm-site/", "AI": {"tldr": "LARM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u524d\u9988\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56fe\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u8054\u5408\u6062\u590d3D\u5173\u8282\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u5173\u8282\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bc6\u96c6\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u9010\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u524d\u9988\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u7c97\u7cd9\u51e0\u4f55\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7eb9\u7406\u91cd\u5efa\u3002LARM\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u524d\u9988\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "LARM\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u5173\u8282\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86LVSM\u7684\u9759\u60013D\u7269\u4f53\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u5173\u8282\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8054\u5408\u6062\u590d\u3002", "result": "LARM\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56fe\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u76843D\u5173\u8282\u7269\u4f53\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u9700\u5bc6\u96c6\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "LARM\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57283D\u5173\u8282\u7269\u4f53\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u7c7b\u522b\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u91cd\u5efa\u3002"}}
