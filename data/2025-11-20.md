  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在减少每像素信息存储和参数搜索空间，同时提高全息图重建的保真度和优化效率。

Method: 提出了一种基于结构化复值2D高斯基元的新全息图表示方法，开发了可微分的光栅化器，并与GPU优化的自由空间光传播内核集成。

Result: 实验表明，该方法实现了高达2.5倍的VRAM使用降低和50%的优化加速，同时产生了比现有方法更高保真度的重建。

Conclusion: 通过减少全息图参数搜索空间，我们的表示方法为下一代计算机生成全息系统提供了更具可扩展性的全息图估计。

Abstract: We propose a new hologram representation based on structured complex-valued 2D Gaussian primitives, which replaces per-pixel information storage and reduces the parameter search space by up to 10:1. To enable end-to-end training, we develop a differentiable rasterizer for our representation, integrated with a GPU-optimized light propagation kernel in free space. Our extensive experiments show that our method achieves up to 2.5x lower VRAM usage and 50% faster optimization while producing higher-fidelity reconstructions than existing methods. We further introduce a conversion procedure that adapts our representation to practical hologram formats, including smooth and random phase-only holograms. Our experiments show that this procedure can effectively suppress noise artifacts observed in previous methods. By reducing the hologram parameter search space, our representation enables a more scalable hologram estimation in the next-generation computer-generated holography systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在实现无需装备、跨类别的语义3D运动迁移，解决现有方法在运动保真度和结构一致性上的不足。

Abstract: We present Gaussian See, Gaussian Do, a novel approach for semantic 3D motion transfer from multiview video. Our method enables rig-free, cross-category motion transfer between objects with semantically meaningful correspondence. Building on implicit motion transfer techniques, we extract motion embeddings from source videos via condition inversion, apply them to rendered frames of static target shapes, and use the resulting videos to supervise dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Our approach introduces an anchor-based view-aware motion embedding mechanism, ensuring cross-view consistency and accelerating convergence, along with a robust 4D reconstruction pipeline that consolidates noisy supervision videos. We establish the first benchmark for semantic 3D motion transfer and demonstrate superior motion fidelity and structural consistency compared to adapted baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现CNN架构在牙龋分割任务中优于Transformer和Mamba，强调架构与任务对齐的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 牙龋在全景X光片中的准确识别和分割对早期诊断和治疗计划至关重要，但自动化分割因低对比度、形态变异性和有限标注数据而具有挑战性。

Method: 研究对12种最先进的架构（包括VMUnet、MambaUNet、VMUNetv2等）在相同配置下进行了训练和评估。

Result: 基于CNN的DoubleU-Net在所有性能指标中表现最佳，Dice系数为0.7345，mIoU为0.5978，精确度为0.8145，优于所有Transformer和Mamba变体。

Conclusion: 研究发现，尽管复杂注意力架构日益流行，但基于CNN的DoubleU-Net在牙龋分割任务中表现最佳，强调了架构与任务对齐的重要性，而非模型复杂性。

Abstract: Accurate identification and segmentation of dental caries in panoramic radiographs are critical for early diagnosis and effective treatment planning. Automated segmentation remains challenging due to low lesion contrast, morphological variability, and limited annotated data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive benchmarking of convolutional neural networks, vision transformers and state-space mamba architectures for automated dental caries segmentation on panoramic radiographs through a DC1000 dataset. Twelve state-of-the-art architectures, including VMUnet, MambaUNet, VMUNetv2, RMAMamba-S, TransNetR, PVTFormer, DoubleU-Net, and ResUNet++, were trained under identical configurations. Results reveal that, contrary to the growing trend toward complex attention based architectures, the CNN-based DoubleU-Net achieved the highest dice coefficient of 0.7345, mIoU of 0.5978, and precision of 0.8145, outperforming all transformer and Mamba variants. In the study, the top 3 results across all performance metrics were achieved by CNN-based architectures. Here, Mamba and transformer-based methods, despite their theoretical advantage in global context modeling, underperformed due to limited data and weaker spatial priors. These findings underscore the importance of architecture-task alignment in domain-specific medical image segmentation more than model complexity.

### [4] [B-Rep Distance Functions (BR-DF): How to Represent a B-Rep Model by Volumetric Distance Functions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14870)
*Fuyang Zhang,Pradeep Kumar Jayaraman,Xiang Xu,Yasutaka Furukawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BR-DF通过体积距离函数编码CAD几何，结合改进算法和扩散模型，实现了高效且100%成功的B-Rep模型生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统CAD边界表示（B-Rep）模型生成中的失败率问题，并提高几何编码的效率和准确性。

Method: 提出了基于体积距离函数的B-Rep距离函数（BR-DF）表示方法，包括SDF和UDF编码，并扩展了Marching Cubes算法以实现水密B-Rep模型的转换。采用多分支潜在扩散模型和3D U-Net架构联合生成SDF和UDF。

Conclusion: BR-DF方法通过体积距离函数实现了CAD边界表示的几何编码，达到了100%的成功率生成B-Rep模型，性能与现有最先进方法相当。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel geometric representation for CAD Boundary Representation (B-Rep) based on volumetric distance functions, dubbed B-Rep Distance Functions (BR-DF). BR-DF encodes the surface mesh geometry of a CAD model as signed distance function (SDF). B-Rep vertices, edges, faces and their topology information are encoded as per-face unsigned distance functions (UDFs). An extension of the Marching Cubes algorithm converts BR-DF directly into watertight CAD B-Rep model (strictly speaking a faceted B-Rep model). A surprising characteristic of BR-DF is that this conversion process never fails. Leveraging the volumetric nature of BR-DF, we propose a multi-branch latent diffusion with 3D U-Net backbone for jointly generating the SDF and per-face UDFs of a BR-DF model. Our approach achieves comparable CAD generation performance against SOTA methods while reaching the unprecedented 100% success rate in producing (faceted) B-Rep models.

### [5] [GeoSceneGraph: Geometric Scene Graph Diffusion Model for Text-guided 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14884)
*Antonio Ruiz,Tao Wu,Andrew Melnik,Qing Cheng,Xuqin Wang,Lu Liu,Yongliang Wang,Yanfeng Zhang,Helge Ritter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoSceneGraph是一种从文本提示合成3D场景的方法，利用图结构和几何对称性，无需预定义关系，性能媲美依赖真实关系的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在资源受限设备上部署的不足，以及忽略室内场景固有图结构导致场景连贯性和真实感受限的问题。

Method: 基于等变图神经网络（EGNNs），并提出了一种简单有效的策略将文本特征条件化到EGNNs上。

Conclusion: GeoSceneGraph通过利用3D场景的图结构和几何对称性，无需依赖预定义的关系类别，就能合成与依赖真实关系注释方法性能相当的3D场景。

Abstract: Methods that synthesize indoor 3D scenes from text prompts have wide-ranging applications in film production, interior design, video games, virtual reality, and synthetic data generation for training embodied agents. Existing approaches typically either train generative models from scratch or leverage vision-language models (VLMs). While VLMs achieve strong performance, particularly for complex or open-ended prompts, smaller task-specific models remain necessary for deployment on resource-constrained devices such as extended reality (XR) glasses or mobile phones. However, many generative approaches that train from scratch overlook the inherent graph structure of indoor scenes, which can limit scene coherence and realism. Conversely, methods that incorporate scene graphs either demand a user-provided semantic graph, which is generally inconvenient and restrictive, or rely on ground-truth relationship annotations, limiting their capacity to capture more varied object interactions. To address these challenges, we introduce GeoSceneGraph, a method that synthesizes 3D scenes from text prompts by leveraging the graph structure and geometric symmetries of 3D scenes, without relying on predefined relationship classes. Despite not using ground-truth relationships, GeoSceneGraph achieves performance comparable to methods that do. Our model is built on equivariant graph neural networks (EGNNs), but existing EGNN approaches are typically limited to low-dimensional conditioning and are not designed to handle complex modalities such as text. We propose a simple and effective strategy for conditioning EGNNs on text features, and we validate our design through ablation studies.

### [6] [HULFSynth : An INR based Super-Resolution and Ultra Low-Field MRI Synthesis via Contrast factor estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14897)
*Pranav Indrakanti,Ivor Simpson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种无监督单图像双向MRI合成器，基于物理学原理模拟HF和ULF MRI的转换，显著提升了图像对比度并展示了模型的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MRI合成模型未充分考虑HF和ULF MRI之间对比度变化的物理驱动因素，因此提出了一种基于物理学的无监督合成方法。

Method: 该方法基于物理学原理模拟HF到ULF的转换，通过估计组织类型信噪比（SNR）值。在超分辨率任务中，使用隐式神经表示（INR）网络合成HF图像，同时预测组织类型分割和图像强度。

Result: 合成ULF样图像的WM-GM对比度提升了52%，64mT图像提升了37%。敏感性实验证明了模型对目标对比度、噪声和初始种子的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的无监督单图像双向MRI合成器在合成超低场（ULF）和高场（HF）MRI图像方面表现出色，显著提升了WM-GM对比度，并展示了模型对目标对比度、噪声和初始种子的鲁棒性。

Abstract: We present an unsupervised single image bidirectional Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) synthesizer that synthesizes an Ultra-Low Field (ULF) like image from a High-Field (HF) magnitude image and vice-versa. Unlike existing MRI synthesis models, our approach is inspired by the physics that drives contrast changes between HF and ULF MRIs. Our forward model simulates a HF to ULF transformation by estimating the tissue-type Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) values based on target contrast values. For the Super-Resolution task, we used an Implicit Neural Representation (INR) network to synthesize HF image by simultaneously predicting tissue-type segmentations and image intensity without observed HF data. The proposed method is evaluated using synthetic ULF-like data from generated from standard 3T T$_1$-weighted images for qualitative assessments and paired 3T-64mT T$_1$-weighted images for validation experiments. WM-GM contrast improved by 52% in synthetic ULF-like images and 37% in 64mT images. Sensitivity experiments demonstrated the robustness of our forward model to variations in target contrast, noise and initial seeding.

### [7] [InstructMix2Mix: Consistent Sparse-View Editing Through Multi-View Model Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14899)
*Daniel Gilo,Or Litany*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: I-Mix2Mix框架通过蒸馏2D扩散模型到多视图扩散模型，提升多视图编辑的一致性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在多视图图像编辑中产生的伪影和不一致问题。

Method: 提出InstructMix2Mix框架，用多视图扩散学生替代传统的神经场整合器，并引入增量学生更新、专用教师噪声调度器和注意力修改。

Result: 实验表明，I-Mix2Mix在多视图一致性和单帧编辑质量上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: I-Mix2Mix通过将2D扩散模型的编辑能力蒸馏到预训练的多视图扩散模型中，显著提升了多视图一致性和单帧编辑质量。

Abstract: We address the task of multi-view image editing from sparse input views, where the inputs can be seen as a mix of images capturing the scene from different viewpoints. The goal is to modify the scene according to a textual instruction while preserving consistency across all views. Existing methods, based on per-scene neural fields or temporal attention mechanisms, struggle in this setting, often producing artifacts and incoherent edits. We propose InstructMix2Mix (I-Mix2Mix), a framework that distills the editing capabilities of a 2D diffusion model into a pretrained multi-view diffusion model, leveraging its data-driven 3D prior for cross-view consistency. A key contribution is replacing the conventional neural field consolidator in Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) with a multi-view diffusion student, which requires novel adaptations: incremental student updates across timesteps, a specialized teacher noise scheduler to prevent degeneration, and an attention modification that enhances cross-view coherence without additional cost. Experiments demonstrate that I-Mix2Mix significantly improves multi-view consistency while maintaining high per-frame edit quality.

### [8] [Skin-R1: Toward Trustworthy Clinical Reasoning for Dermatological Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14900)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkinR1是一种新型皮肤病视觉语言模型，通过教科书式推理和强化学习解决数据异质性和泛化问题，显著提升诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在临床诊断中受限于数据异质性、缺乏可靠推理监督和泛化能力不足，需要一种新方法提升其可信度和临床实用性。

Method: 提出SkinR1模型，结合教科书式推理生成器和强化学习范式，通过端到端框架实现监督微调和推理模式迁移。

Result: 在多个皮肤病数据集上的实验显示，SkinR1实现了卓越的诊断准确性，消融研究验证了监督微调对推理能力的重要性。

Conclusion: SkinR1通过结合教科书式推理和强化学习，成功解决了视觉语言模型在皮肤病诊断中的数据异质性、缺乏诊断理由和泛化能力有限的问题，显著提高了诊断准确性。

Abstract: The emergence of vision-language models (VLMs) has opened new possibilities for clinical reasoning and has shown promising performance in dermatological diagnosis. However, their trustworthiness and clinical utility are often limited by three major factors: (1) Data heterogeneity, where diverse datasets lack consistent diagnostic labels and clinical concept annotations; (2) Absence of grounded diagnostic rationales, leading to a scarcity of reliable reasoning supervision; and (3) Limited scalability and generalization, as models trained on small, densely annotated datasets struggle to transfer nuanced reasoning to large, sparsely-annotated ones.
  To address these limitations, we propose SkinR1, a novel dermatological VLM that combines deep, textbook-based reasoning with the broad generalization capabilities of reinforcement learning (RL). SkinR1 systematically resolves the key challenges through a unified, end-to-end framework. First, we design a textbook-based reasoning generator that synthesizes high-fidelity, hierarchy-aware, and differential-diagnosis (DDx)-informed trajectories, providing reliable expert-level supervision. Second, we leverage the constructed trajectories for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) empowering the model with grounded reasoning ability. Third, we develop a novel RL paradigm that, by incorporating the hierarchical structure of diseases, effectively transfers these grounded reasoning patterns to large-scale, sparse data. Extensive experiments on multiple dermatology datasets demonstrate that SkinR1 achieves superior diagnostic accuracy. The ablation study demonstrates the importance of the reasoning foundation instilled by SFT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FarSLIP通过多粒度数据集和局部-局部蒸馏方法，改进了遥感图像的细粒度对齐，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遥感特定CLIP变体在空间感知能力上存在局限，主要原因是数据集缺乏对象级监督，以及直接应用通用区域-文本对齐方法导致性能下降。

Method: FarSLIP采用局部到局部蒸馏方法对齐局部和全局视觉线索，并利用简单的CLS token进行区域-类别对齐，而非显式的补丁级对齐。

Result: FarSLIP在遥感开放词汇语义分割、零样本分类和图像-文本检索等任务上达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: FarSLIP通过改进细粒度视觉-语言对齐，在遥感领域实现了新的最先进性能，不仅在开放词汇语义分割上表现优异，还在零样本分类和图像-文本检索等任务上取得了显著成果。

Abstract: As CLIP's global alignment limits its ability to capture fine-grained details, recent efforts have focused on enhancing its region-text alignment. However, current remote sensing (RS)-specific CLIP variants still inherit this limited spatial awareness. We identify two key limitations behind this: (1) current RS image-text datasets generate global captions from object-level labels, leaving the original object-level supervision underutilized; (2) despite the success of region-text alignment methods in general domain, their direct application to RS data often leads to performance degradation. To address these, we construct the first multi-granularity RS image-text dataset, MGRS-200k, featuring rich object-level textual supervision for RS region-category alignment. We further investigate existing fine-grained CLIP tuning strategies and find that current explicit region-text alignment methods, whether in a direct or indirect way, underperform due to severe degradation of CLIP's semantic coherence. Building on these, we propose FarSLIP, a Fine-grained Aligned RS Language-Image Pretraining framework. Rather than the commonly used patch-to-CLS self-distillation, FarSLIP employs patch-to-patch distillation to align local and global visual cues, which improves feature discriminability while preserving semantic coherence. Additionally, to effectively utilize region-text supervision, it employs simple CLS token-based region-category alignment rather than explicit patch-level alignment, further enhancing spatial awareness. FarSLIP features improved fine-grained vision-language alignment in RS domain and sets a new state of the art not only on RS open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, but also on image-level tasks such as zero-shot classification and image-text retrieval. Our dataset, code, and models are available at https://github.com/NJU-LHRS/FarSLIP.

Conclusion: nnMIL提供了一个实用且通用的解决方案，将病理学基础模型转化为具有临床意义的预测，推动了可靠AI系统在现实世界中的开发与部署。

Abstract: Computational pathology holds substantial promise for improving diagnosis and guiding treatment decisions. Recent pathology foundation models enable the extraction of rich patch-level representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs), but current approaches for aggregating these features into slide-level predictions remain constrained by design limitations that hinder generalizability and reliability. Here, we developed nnMIL, a simple yet broadly applicable multiple-instance learning framework that connects patch-level foundation models to robust slide-level clinical inference. nnMIL introduces random sampling at both the patch and feature levels, enabling large-batch optimization, task-aware sampling strategies, and efficient and scalable training across datasets and model architectures. A lightweight aggregator performs sliding-window inference to generate ensemble slide-level predictions and supports principled uncertainty estimation. Across 40,000 WSIs encompassing 35 clinical tasks and four pathology foundation models, nnMIL consistently outperformed existing MIL methods for disease diagnosis, histologic subtyping, molecular biomarker detection, and pan- cancer prognosis prediction. It further demonstrated strong cross-model generalization, reliable uncertainty quantification, and robust survival stratification in multiple external cohorts. In conclusion, nnMIL offers a practical and generalizable solution for translating pathology foundation models into clinically meaningful predictions, advancing the development and deployment of reliable AI systems in real-world settings.

### [11] [X-WIN: Building Chest Radiograph World Model via Predictive Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14918)
*Zefan Yang,Ge Wang,James Hendler,Mannudeep K. Kalra,Pingkun Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-WIN通过从CT学习3D知识预测CXR投影，提升诊断效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CXR作为2D投影图像，无法捕捉3D解剖结构，限制了表示学习和疾病诊断的效果。

Method: 提出了一种名为X-WIN的CXR世界模型，通过学习预测3D空间中的2D投影，并引入亲和力引导的对比对齐损失和域分类器来优化模型。

Result: X-WIN在多种下游任务中表现优于现有基础模型，并展示了重建3D CT体积的能力。

Conclusion: X-WIN模型通过从CT中提取体积知识并在潜在空间中预测其2D投影，成功克服了CXR的结构叠加限制，提升了疾病诊断的准确性。

Abstract: Chest X-ray radiography (CXR) is an essential medical imaging technique for disease diagnosis. However, as 2D projectional images, CXRs are limited by structural superposition and hence fail to capture 3D anatomies. This limitation makes representation learning and disease diagnosis challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a novel CXR world model named X-WIN, which distills volumetric knowledge from chest computed tomography (CT) by learning to predict its 2D projections in latent space. The core idea is that a world model with internalized knowledge of 3D anatomical structure can predict CXRs under various transformations in 3D space. During projection prediction, we introduce an affinity-guided contrastive alignment loss that leverages mutual similarities to capture rich, correlated information across projections from the same volume. To improve model adaptability, we incorporate real CXRs into training through masked image modeling and employ a domain classifier to encourage statistically similar representations for real and simulated CXRs. Comprehensive experiments show that X-WIN outperforms existing foundation models on diverse downstream tasks using linear probing and few-shot fine-tuning. X-WIN also demonstrates the ability to render 2D projections for reconstructing a 3D CT volume.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CPSL是一种紧凑的2.5D视频表示方法，通过深度加权变形和前后alpha合成实现视差校正的新视图合成，显著降低成本并保持高质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的体积视频表示在捕获、计算和渲染方面成本高昂，限制了按需视频的可扩展性和实时通信的可行性。

Method: CPSL通过每帧深度和内容显著性引导，将每帧分解为一小组几何一致的层，配备软alpha带和边缘深度缓存，共同保留遮挡顺序和边界连续性。

Result: CPSL在多个基准测试中实现了比基于层和神经场基线更优的感知质量和边界保真度，同时将存储和渲染成本降低了几倍。

Conclusion: CPSL提供了一种从2D视频到可扩展的2.5D沉浸式媒体的实用路径，显著降低了存储和渲染成本。

Abstract: Volumetric video enables immersive and interactive visual experiences by supporting free viewpoint exploration and realistic motion parallax. However, existing volumetric representations from explicit point clouds to implicit neural fields, remain costly in capture, computation, and rendering, which limits their scalability for on-demand video and reduces their feasibility for real-time communication.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Content-Promoted Scene Layers (CPSL), a compact 2.5D video representation that brings the perceptual benefits of volumetric video to conventional 2D content. Guided by per-frame depth and content saliency, CPSL decomposes each frame into a small set of geometry-consistent layers equipped with soft alpha bands and an edge-depth cache that jointly preserve occlusion ordering and boundary continuity. These lightweight, 2D-encodable assets enable parallax-corrected novel-view synthesis via depth-weighted warping and front-to-back alpha compositing, bypassing expensive 3D reconstruction. Temporally, CPSL maintains inter-frame coherence using motion-guided propagation and per-layer encoding, supporting real-time playback with standard video codecs. Across multiple benchmarks, CPSL achieves superior perceptual quality and boundary fidelity compared with layer-based and neural-field baselines while reducing storage and rendering cost by several folds. Our approach offer a practical path from 2D video to scalable 2.5D immersive media.

Abstract: Periodic human activities with implicit workflows are common in manufacturing, sports, and daily life. While short-term periodic activities -- characterized by simple structures and high-contrast patterns -- have been widely studied, long-term periodic workflows with low-contrast patterns remain largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first benchmark comprising 580 multimodal human activity sequences featuring long-term periodic workflows. The benchmark supports three evaluation tasks aligned with real-world applications: unsupervised periodic workflow detection, task completion tracking, and procedural anomaly detection. We also propose a lightweight, training-free baseline for modeling diverse periodic workflow patterns. Experiments show that: (i) our benchmark presents significant challenges to both unsupervised periodic detection methods and zero-shot approaches based on powerful large language models (LLMs); (ii) our baseline outperforms competing methods by a substantial margin in all evaluation tasks; and (iii) in real-world applications, our baseline demonstrates deployment advantages on par with traditional supervised workflow detection approaches, eliminating the need for annotation and retraining.

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal alignment of multi-view video streams is essential for a wide range of dynamic-scene applications such as multi-view 3D reconstruction, pose estimation, and scene understanding. However, synchronizing multiple cameras remains a significant challenge, especially in heterogeneous setups combining professional and consumer-grade devices, visible and infrared sensors, or systems with and without audio, where common hardware synchronization capabilities are often unavailable. This limitation is particularly evident in real-world environments, where controlled capture conditions are not feasible. In this work, we present a low-cost, general-purpose synchronization method that achieves millisecond-level temporal alignment across diverse camera systems while supporting both visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) modalities. The proposed solution employs a custom-built \textit{LED Clock} that encodes time through red and infrared LEDs, allowing visual decoding of the exposure window (start and end times) from recorded frames for millisecond-level synchronization. We benchmark our method against hardware synchronization and achieve a residual error of 1.34~ms RMSE across multiple recordings. In further experiments, our method outperforms light-, audio-, and timecode-based synchronization approaches and directly improves downstream computer vision tasks, including multi-view pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. Finally, we validate the system in large-scale surgical recordings involving over 25 heterogeneous cameras spanning both IR and RGB modalities. This solution simplifies and streamlines the synchronization pipeline and expands access to advanced vision-based sensing in unconstrained environments, including industrial and clinical applications.

Abstract: This research addresses the significant challenges of energy consumption and environmental impact in laser cutting by proposing novel deep learning (DL) methodologies to achieve energy reduction. Recognizing the current lack of adaptive control and the open-loop nature of CO2 laser suction pumps, this study utilizes closed-loop configurations that dynamically adjust pump power based on both the material being cut and the smoke level generated. To implement this adaptive system, diverse material classification methods are introduced, including techniques leveraging lens-less speckle sensing with a customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and an approach using a USB camera with transfer learning via the pre-trained VGG16 CNN model. Furthermore, a separate DL model for smoke level detection is employed to simultaneously refine the pump's power output. This integration prompts the exhaust suction pump to automatically halt during inactive times and dynamically adjust power during operation, leading to experimentally proven and remarkable energy savings, with results showing a 20% to 50% reduction in the smoke suction pump's energy consumption, thereby contributing substantially to sustainable development in the manufacturing sector.

Conclusion: EGSA机制和渐进式训练策略显著提升了透明物体感知的鲁棒性，特别是在深度估计和语义分割任务中。

Abstract: Transparent object perception remains a major challenge in computer vision research, as transparency confounds both depth estimation and semantic segmentation. Recent work has explored multi-task learning frameworks to improve robustness, yet negative cross-task interactions often hinder performance. In this work, we introduce Edge-Guided Spatial Attention (EGSA), a fusion mechanism designed to mitigate destructive interactions by incorporating boundary information into the fusion between semantic and geometric features. On both Syn-TODD and ClearPose benchmarks, EGSA consistently improved depth accuracy over the current state of the art method (MODEST), while preserving competitive segmentation performance, with the largest improvements appearing in transparent regions. Besides our fusion design, our second contribution is a multi-modal progressive training strategy, where learning transitions from edges derived from RGB images to edges derived from predicted depth images. This approach allows the system to bootstrap learning from the rich textures contained in RGB images, and then switch to more relevant geometric content in depth maps, while it eliminates the need for ground-truth depth at training time. Together, these contributions highlight edge-guided fusion as a robust approach capable of improving transparent object perception.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) methods can transfer knowledge of a parameter-heavy teacher model to a light-weight student model. The status quo for feature KD methods is to utilize loss functions based on logits (i.e., pre-softmax class scores) and intermediate layer features (i.e., latent representations). Unlike previous approaches, we propose a feature KD framework for training the student's backbone using feature-based losses exclusively (i.e., without logit-based losses such as cross entropy). Leveraging recent discoveries about the geometry of latent representations, we introduce a knowledge quality metric for identifying which teacher layers provide the most effective knowledge for distillation. Experiments on three image classification datasets with four diverse student-teacher pairs, spanning convolutional neural networks and vision transformers, demonstrate our KD method achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering top-1 accuracy boosts of up to 15% over standard approaches. We publically share our code to facilitate future work at https://github.com/Thegolfingocto/KD_wo_CE.

Conclusion: FinCriticalED为金融及其他高精度关键领域提供了严格的视觉事实精确性评估基础，尽管最强专有模型达到了最高的事实准确性，但在视觉复杂的数值和时间上下文中仍存在显著错误。

Abstract: We introduce FinCriticalED (Financial Critical Error Detection), a visual benchmark for evaluating OCR and vision language models on financial documents at the fact level. Financial documents contain visually dense and table heavy layouts where numerical and temporal information is tightly coupled with structure. In high stakes settings, small OCR mistakes such as sign inversion or shifted dates can lead to materially different interpretations, while traditional OCR metrics like ROUGE and edit distance capture only surface level text similarity. \ficriticaled provides 500 image-HTML pairs with expert annotated financial facts covering over seven hundred numerical and temporal facts. It introduces three key contributions. First, it establishes the first fact level evaluation benchmark for financial document understanding, shifting evaluation from lexical overlap to domain critical factual correctness. Second, all annotations are created and verified by financial experts with strict quality control over signs, magnitudes, and temporal expressions. Third, we develop an LLM-as-Judge evaluation pipeline that performs structured fact extraction and contextual verification for visually complex financial documents. We benchmark OCR systems, open source vision language models, and proprietary models on FinCriticalED. Results show that although the strongest proprietary models achieve the highest factual accuracy, substantial errors remain in visually intricate numerical and temporal contexts. Through quantitative evaluation and expert case studies, FinCriticalED provides a rigorous foundation for advancing visual factual precision in financial and other precision critical domains.

Abstract: Lifelong person Re-IDentification (LReID) aims to match the same person employing continuously collected individual data from different scenarios. To achieve continuous all-day person matching across day and night, Visible-Infrared Lifelong person Re-IDentification (VI-LReID) focuses on sequential training on data from visible and infrared modalities and pursues average performance over all data. To this end, existing methods typically exploit cross-modal knowledge distillation to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge. However, these methods ignore the mutual interference of modality-specific knowledge acquisition and modality-common knowledge anti-forgetting, where conflicting knowledge leads to collaborative forgetting. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a Cross-modality Knowledge Disentanglement and Alignment method, called CKDA, which explicitly separates and preserves modality-specific knowledge and modality-common knowledge in a balanced way. Specifically, a Modality-Common Prompting (MCP) module and a Modality-Specific Prompting (MSP) module are proposed to explicitly disentangle and purify discriminative information that coexists and is specific to different modalities, avoiding the mutual interference between both knowledge. In addition, a Cross-modal Knowledge Alignment (CKA) module is designed to further align the disentangled new knowledge with the old one in two mutually independent inter- and intra-modality feature spaces based on dual-modality prototypes in a balanced manner. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness and superiority of our CKDA against state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Mathematical thinking is a fundamental aspect of human cognition. Cognitive scientists have investigated the mechanisms that underlie our ability to thinking geometrically and numerically, to take two prominent examples, and developmental scientists have documented the trajectories of these abilities over the lifespan. Prior research has shown that computer vision (CV) models trained on the unrelated task of image classification nevertheless learn latent representations of geometric and numerical concepts similar to those of adults. Building on this demonstrated cognitive alignment, the current study investigates whether CV models also show developmental alignment: whether their performance improvements across training to match the developmental progressions observed in children. In a detailed case study of the ResNet-50 model, we show that this is the case. For the case of geometry and topology, we find developmental alignment for some classes of concepts (Euclidean Geometry, Geometrical Figures, Metric Properties, Topology) but not others (Chiral Figures, Geometric Transformations, Symmetrical Figures). For the case of number, we find developmental alignment in the emergence of a human-like ``mental number line'' representation with experience. These findings show the promise of computer vision models for understanding the development of mathematical understanding in humans. They point the way to future research exploring additional model architectures and building larger benchmarks.

Abstract: In the field of human-object interaction (HOI), detection and generation are two dual tasks that have traditionally been addressed separately, hindering the development of comprehensive interaction understanding. To address this, we propose UniHOI, which jointly models HOI detection and generation via a unified token space, thereby effectively promoting knowledge sharing and enhancing generalization. Specifically, we introduce a symmetric interaction-aware attention module and a unified semi-supervised learning paradigm, enabling effective bidirectional mapping between images and interaction semantics even under limited annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniHOI achieves state-of-the-art performance in both HOI detection and generation. Specifically, UniHOI improves accuracy by 4.9% on long-tailed HOI detection and boosts interaction metrics by 42.0% on open-vocabulary generation tasks.

Conclusion: DLRRF模型通过将光谱变异性建模为光谱退化算子的变化，并利用低秩和残差分量恢复丢失的空间细节，有效解决了HSI和MSI融合中的图像间变异性问题，实验证明了其优越性能。

Abstract: The fusion of hyperspectral image (HSI) with multispectral image (MSI) provides an effective way to enhance the spatial resolution of HSI. However, due to different acquisition conditions, there may exist spectral variability and spatially localized changes between HSI and MSI, referred to as inter-image variability, which can significantly affect the fusion performance. Existing methods typically handle inter-image variability by applying direct transformations to the images themselves, which can exacerbate the ill-posedness of the fusion model. To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-based Low-Rank and Residual Fusion (DLRRF) model. First, we model the spectral variability as change in the spectral degradation operator. Second, to recover the lost spatial details caused by spatially localized changes, we decompose the target HSI into low rank and residual components, where the latter is used to capture the lost details. By exploiting the spectral correlation within the images, we perform dimensionality reduction on both components. Additionally, we introduce an implicit regularizer to utilize the spatial prior information from the images. The proposed DLRRF model is solved using the Proximal Alternating Optimization (PAO) algorithm within a Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework, where the subproblem regarding implicit regularizer is addressed by an external denoiser. We further provide a comprehensive convergence analysis of the algorithm. Finally, extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that DLRRF achieves superior performance in fusing HSI and MSI with inter-image variability.

Abstract: Shot assembly is a crucial step in film production and video editing, involving the sequencing and arrangement of shots to construct a narrative, convey information, or evoke emotions. Traditionally, this process has been manually executed by experienced editors. While current intelligent video editing technologies can handle some automated video editing tasks, they often fail to capture the creator's unique artistic expression in shot assembly. To address this challenge, we propose an energy-based optimization method for video shot assembly. Specifically, we first perform visual-semantic matching between the script generated by a large language model and a video library to obtain subsets of candidate shots aligned with the script semantics. Next, we segment and label the shots from reference videos, extracting attributes such as shot size, camera motion, and semantics. We then employ energy-based models to learn from these attributes, scoring candidate shot sequences based on their alignment with reference styles. Finally, we achieve shot assembly optimization by combining multiple syntax rules, producing videos that align with the assembly style of the reference videos. Our method not only automates the arrangement and combination of independent shots according to specific logic, narrative requirements, or artistic styles but also learns the assembly style of reference videos, creating a coherent visual sequence or holistic visual expression. With our system, even users with no prior video editing experience can create visually compelling videos. Project page: https://sobeymil.github.io/esa.com

Abstract: Accurate nuclei segmentation in microscopy whole slide images (WSIs) remains challenging due to variability in staining, imaging conditions, and tissue morphology. We propose CellGenNet, a knowledge distillation framework for robust cross-tissue cell segmentation under limited supervision. CellGenNet adopts a student-teacher architecture, where a capacity teacher is trained on sparse annotations and generates soft pseudo-labels for unlabeled regions. The student is optimized using a joint objective that integrates ground-truth labels, teacher-derived probabilistic targets, and a hybrid loss function combining binary cross-entropy and Tversky loss, enabling asymmetric penalties to mitigate class imbalance and better preserve minority nuclear structures. Consistency regularization and layerwise dropout further stabilize feature representations and promote reliable feature transfer. Experiments across diverse cancer tissue WSIs show that CellGenNet improves segmentation accuracy and generalization over supervised and semi-supervised baselines, supporting scalable and reproducible histopathology analysis.

Abstract: Existing approaches for the problem of ultrasound image segmentation, whether supervised or semi-supervised, are typically specialized for specific anatomical structures or tasks, limiting their practical utility in clinical settings. In this paper, we pioneer the task of universal semi-supervised ultrasound image segmentation and propose ProPL, a framework that can handle multiple organs and segmentation tasks while leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data. At its core, ProPL employs a shared vision encoder coupled with prompt-guided dual decoders, enabling flexible task adaptation through a prompting-upon-decoding mechanism and reliable self-training via an uncertainty-driven pseudo-label calibration (UPLC) module. To facilitate research in this direction, we introduce a comprehensive ultrasound dataset spanning 5 organs and 8 segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProPL outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various metrics, establishing a new benchmark for universal ultrasound image segmentation.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have seen rapid advances in recent years and are now being applied to visual document understanding tasks. They are expected to process a wide range of document images across languages, including Japanese. Understanding documents from images requires models to read what are written in them. Since some Japanese documents are written vertically, support for vertical writing is essential. However, research specifically focused on vertically written Japanese text remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the reading capability of existing MLLMs on vertically written Japanese text. First, we generate a synthetic Japanese OCR dataset by rendering Japanese texts into images, and use it for both model fine-tuning and evaluation. This dataset includes Japanese text in both horizontal and vertical writing. We also create an evaluation dataset sourced from the real-world document images containing vertically written Japanese text. Using these datasets, we demonstrate that the existing MLLMs perform worse on vertically written Japanese text than on horizontally written Japanese text. Furthermore, we show that training MLLMs on our synthesized Japanese OCR dataset results in improving the performance of models that previously could not handle vertical writing. The datasets and code are publicly available https://github.com/llm-jp/eval_vertical_ja.

Abstract: Video Models have achieved remarkable success in high-fidelity video generation with coherent motion dynamics. Analogous to the development from text generation to text-based reasoning in language modeling, the development of video models motivates us to ask: Can video models reason via video generation? Compared with the discrete text corpus, video grounds reasoning in explicit spatial layouts and temporal continuity, which serves as an ideal substrate for spatial reasoning. In this work, we explore the reasoning via video paradigm and introduce VR-Bench -- a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate video models' reasoning capabilities. Grounded in maze-solving tasks that inherently require spatial planning and multi-step reasoning, VR-Bench contains 7,920 procedurally generated videos across five maze types and diverse visual styles. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that SFT can efficiently elicit the reasoning ability of video model. Video models exhibit stronger spatial perception during reasoning, outperforming leading VLMs and generalizing well across diverse scenarios, tasks, and levels of complexity. We further discover a test-time scaling effect, where diverse sampling during inference improves reasoning reliability by 10--20%. These findings highlight the unique potential and scalability of reasoning via video for spatial reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 当前可控散景渲染方法依赖精确深度图，而生成式方法在可控性和效率上存在局限，因此需要一种无需深度输入且高效可控的解决方案。

Method: BokehFlow 采用跨注意力机制，直接从全聚焦图像合成逼真的散景效果，无需依赖深度输入。

Result: 实验表明，BokehFlow 能生成视觉吸引人的散景效果，并通过文本提示实现精确控制，在质量和效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BokehFlow 提出了一种无需深度输入的、基于流匹配的可控散景渲染框架，通过文本提示实现语义控制，在渲染质量和效率上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Bokeh rendering simulates the shallow depth-of-field effect in photography, enhancing visual aesthetics and guiding viewer attention to regions of interest. Although recent approaches perform well, rendering controllable bokeh without additional depth inputs remains a significant challenge. Existing classical and neural controllable methods rely on accurate depth maps, while generative approaches often struggle with limited controllability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose BokehFlow, a depth-free framework for controllable bokeh rendering based on flow matching. BokehFlow directly synthesizes photorealistic bokeh effects from all-in-focus images, eliminating the need for depth inputs. It employs a cross-attention mechanism to enable semantic control over both focus regions and blur intensity via text prompts. To support training and evaluation, we collect and synthesize four datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BokehFlow achieves visually compelling bokeh effects and offers precise control, outperforming existing depth-dependent and generative methods in both rendering quality and efficiency.

Motivation: 解决现有基于内存的跟踪器在LiDAR点云中因二次计算复杂度、时间冗余和几何先验利用不足而导致的问题。

Method: 提出了基于状态空间模型Mamba的MambaTrack3D框架，包含Mamba-based Inter-frame Propagation (MIP)模块和Grouped Feature Enhancement Module (GFEM)，分别用于高效帧间传播和通道级语义分离。

Result: 在KITTI-HTV和nuScenes-HTV基准测试中，MambaTrack3D显著优于HTV导向和常规场景跟踪器，成功率和精度分别提升6.5%和9.5%。在标准KITTI数据集上，与最先进的常规跟踪器竞争激烈。

Conclusion: MambaTrack3D 在动态户外高时变环境中表现出色，实现了精度与效率的优越平衡，并在专业HTV和常规跟踪场景中均展现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Dynamic outdoor environments with high temporal variation (HTV) pose significant challenges for 3D single object tracking in LiDAR point clouds. Existing memory-based trackers often suffer from quadratic computational complexity, temporal redundancy, and insufficient exploitation of geometric priors. To address these issues, we propose MambaTrack3D, a novel HTV-oriented tracking framework built upon the state space model Mamba. Specifically, we design a Mamba-based Inter-frame Propagation (MIP) module that replaces conventional single-frame feature extraction with efficient inter-frame propagation, achieving near-linear complexity while explicitly modeling spatial relations across historical frames. Furthermore, a Grouped Feature Enhancement Module (GFEM) is introduced to separate foreground and background semantics at the channel level, thereby mitigating temporal redundancy in the memory bank. Extensive experiments on KITTI-HTV and nuScenes-HTV benchmarks demonstrate that MambaTrack3D consistently outperforms both HTV-oriented and normal-scenario trackers, achieving improvements of up to 6.5 success and 9.5 precision over HVTrack under moderate temporal gaps. On the standard KITTI dataset, MambaTrack3D remains highly competitive with state-of-the-art normal-scenario trackers, confirming its strong generalization ability. Overall, MambaTrack3D achieves a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off, delivering robust performance across both specialized HTV and conventional tracking scenarios.

TL;DR: TiCAL通过动态评估样本一致性和双曲空间特征嵌入，有效解决了多模态情感识别中的模态间冲突问题，显著提升了性能。

Motivation: 现有的多模态情感识别方法通常依赖统一的情感标签进行监督训练，忽视了模态间情感冲突的问题，即同一样本中不同模态可能表达不同的情感倾向。

Method: 提出了一种基于典型性的一致性感知多模态情感识别框架（TiCAL），利用伪单模态情感标签和典型性估计动态评估样本一致性，并在双曲空间中嵌入特征以捕捉情感类别的细粒度差异。

Conclusion: TiCAL框架通过动态评估训练样本的一致性并利用双曲空间嵌入特征，有效缓解了多模态情感识别中的模态间情感冲突问题，显著提升了识别准确率。

Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) aims to accurately identify human emotional states by integrating heterogeneous modalities such as visual, auditory, and textual data. Existing approaches predominantly rely on unified emotion labels to supervise model training, often overlooking a critical challenge: inter-modal emotion conflicts, wherein different modalities within the same sample may express divergent emotional tendencies. In this work, we address this overlooked issue by proposing a novel framework, Typicality-based Consistent-aware Multimodal Emotion Recognition (TiCAL), inspired by the stage-wise nature of human emotion perception. TiCAL dynamically assesses the consistency of each training sample by leveraging pseudo unimodal emotion labels alongside a typicality estimation. To further enhance emotion representation, we embed features in a hyperbolic space, enabling the capture of fine-grained distinctions among emotional categories. By incorporating consistency estimates into the learning process, our method improves model performance, particularly on samples exhibiting high modality inconsistency. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, e.g, CMU-MOSEI and MER2023, validate the effectiveness of TiCAL in mitigating inter-modal emotional conflicts and enhancing overall recognition accuracy, e.g., with about 2.6% improvements over the state-of-the-art DMD.

Motivation: 单视角参考导致纹理不完整，且缺乏显式的跨视角交互，限制了姿态引导的人像生成效果。

Method: 提出了联合条件扩散模型（JCDM），包括外观先验模块（APM）和联合条件注入（JCI）机制，支持多视角参考并与标准扩散模型兼容。

Result: 实验表明JCDM在保真度和跨视角一致性上达到state-of-the-art水平。

Conclusion: JCDM通过APM和JCI机制有效解决了单视角纹理不完整和跨视角交互缺失的问题，实现了高保真度和跨视角一致性。

Abstract: Pose-guided human image generation is limited by incomplete textures from single reference views and the absence of explicit cross-view interaction. We present jointly conditioned diffusion model (JCDM), a jointly conditioned diffusion framework that exploits multi-view priors. The appearance prior module (APM) infers a holistic identity preserving prior from incomplete references, and the joint conditional injection (JCI) mechanism fuses multi-view cues and injects shared conditioning into the denoising backbone to align identity, color, and texture across poses. JCDM supports a variable number of reference views and integrates with standard diffusion backbones with minimal and targeted architectural modifications. Experiments demonstrate state of the art fidelity and cross-view consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有dMLLM在推理过程中因全序列注意力计算导致的高计算开销问题，尤其是针对模态特定的视觉令牌冗余。

Method: 通过全面研究不同dMLLM架构和任务中视觉令牌冗余的演变，以及视觉令牌修剪对dMLLM响应和效率的影响。

Result: 研究发现视觉冗余仅出现在从头训练的dMLLM中且处理长答案任务时，且视觉令牌修剪会引入不可忽视的信息损失，但仅从头训练的dMLLM能在后期去噪步骤中逐步恢复丢失的信息。

Conclusion: 本研究为多模态大语言模型的效率优化提供了新视角，显著提升了其在各种多模态理解任务中的适用性。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion-based multimodal large language models (dMLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive MLLMs thanks to their advantages in parallel decoding and bidirectional context modeling, but most existing dMLLMs incur significant computational overhead during inference due to the full-sequence attention computation in each denoising step. Pioneer studies attempt to resolve this issue from a modality-agnostic perspective via key-value cache optimization or efficient sampling but most of them overlook modality-specific visual token redundancy. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study on how visual token redundancy evolves with different dMLLM architectures and tasks and how visual token pruning affects dMLLM responses and efficiency. Specifically, our study reveals that visual redundancy emerges only in from-scratch dMLLMs while handling long-answer tasks. In addition, we validate that visual token pruning introduces non-negligible information loss in dMLLMs and only from-scratch dMLLMs can recover the lost information progressively during late denoising steps. Furthermore, our study shows that layer-skipping is promising for accelerating AR-to-diffusion dMLLMs, whereas progressive or late-step pruning is more effective for from-scratch dMLLMs. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on efficiency optimization for dMLLMs, greatly advancing their applicability across various multimodal understanding tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放集检测方法通常依赖单一不确定性评分和阈值处理，灵活性不足且易混淆未知物体与背景。

Method: 采用融合方案，通过多层感知机（MLP）聚合多个置信度估计和检测特征，结合不同logit变体以提升性能。

Result: 该方法在二分类和三分类任务中均优于基线，AUROC平均提升2.7%，封闭集mAP最高提升9个点（18%相对增益）。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种轻量级、模型无关的后处理框架，显著提升了无人机导航系统中开放集检测的性能，特别是在区分已知目标、未知物体和背景方面。

Abstract: Developing reliable UAV navigation systems requires robust air-to-air object detectors capable of distinguishing between objects seen during training and previously unseen objects. While many methods address closed-set detection and achieve high-confidence recognition of in-domain (ID) targets, they generally do not tackle open-set detection, which requires simultaneous handling of both ID and out-of-distribution (OOD) objects. Existing open-set approaches typically rely on a single uncertainty score with thresholding, limiting flexibility and often conflating OOD objects with background clutter. In contrast, we propose a lightweight, model-agnostic post-processing framework that explicitly separates background from unknown objects while preserving the base detector's performance. Our approach extends open-set detection beyond binary ID/OOD classification to real-time three-way classification among ID targets, OOD objects, and background. To this end, we employ a fusion scheme that aggregates multiple confidence estimates and per-detection features using a compact multilayer perceptron (MLP). Incorporating different logit variants into the MLP consistently enhances performance across both binary and three-class classification without compromising throughput. Extensive ablation and comparative experiments confirm that our method surpasses threshold-based baselines in two-class classification by an average of 2.7% AUROC, while retaining or improving open-set mAP. Furthermore, our study uniquely enables robust three-class classification, a critical capability for safe UAV navigation, where OOD objects must be actively avoided and background regions safely ignored. Comparative analysis highlights that our method surpasses competitive techniques in AUROC across datasets, while improving closed-set mAP by up to 9 points, an 18% relative gain.

TL;DR: Gaussian Blending 解决了 3DGS 在未见采样率下的视觉伪影问题，保持实时渲染且无需额外成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 3DGS 方法在训练未见采样率下存在模糊和阶梯状伪影，推测源于 alpha blending 的根本限制。

Method: 提出 Gaussian Blending，将 alpha 和透射率视为空间变化的分布，而非标量，从而允许附近背景 splats 对最终渲染的贡献。

Result: 实验表明，Gaussian Blending 在不同采样率下均能捕捉细节，性能优于现有新视图合成模型。

Conclusion: Gaussian Blending 作为一种替代传统 alpha blending 的方法，有效解决了 3DGS 在训练未见采样率下的视觉差异问题，同时保持了实时渲染速度和无额外内存成本的优势。

Abstract: The recent introduction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has significantly advanced novel view synthesis. Several studies have further improved the rendering quality of 3DGS, yet they still exhibit noticeable visual discrepancies when synthesizing views at sampling rates unseen during training. Specifically, they suffer from (i) erosion-induced blurring artifacts when zooming in and (ii) dilation-induced staircase artifacts when zooming out. We speculate that these artifacts arise from the fundamental limitation of the alpha blending adopted in 3DGS methods. Instead of the conventional alpha blending that computes alpha and transmittance as scalar quantities over a pixel, we propose to replace it with our novel Gaussian Blending that treats alpha and transmittance as spatially varying distributions. Thus, transmittances can be updated considering the spatial distribution of alpha values across the pixel area, allowing nearby background splats to contribute to the final rendering. Our Gaussian Blending maintains real-time rendering speed and requires no additional memory cost, while being easily integrated as a drop-in replacement into existing 3DGS-based or other NVS frameworks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Gaussian Blending effectively captures fine details at various sampling rates unseen during training, consistently outperforming existing novel view synthesis models across both unseen and seen sampling rates.

Conclusion: MambaIO通过分解IMU测量数据并采用Mamba架构，显著降低了定位误差，达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Inertial Odometry (IO) enables real-time localization using only acceleration and angular velocity measurements from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), making it a promising solution for localization in consumer-grade applications. Traditionally, IMU measurements in IO have been processed under two coordinate system paradigms: the body coordinate frame and the global coordinate frame, with the latter being widely adopted. However, recent studies in drone scenarios have demonstrated that the body frame can significantly improve localization accuracy, prompting a re-evaluation of the suitability of the global frame for pedestrian IO. To address this issue, this paper systematically evaluates the effectiveness of the global coordinate frame in pedestrian IO through theoretical analysis, qualitative inspection, and quantitative experiments. Building upon these findings, we further propose MambaIO, which decomposes IMU measurements into high-frequency and low-frequency components using a Laplacian pyramid. The low-frequency component is processed by a Mamba architecture to extract implicit contextual motion cues, while the high-frequency component is handled by a convolutional structure to capture fine-grained local motion details. Experiments on multiple public datasets show that MambaIO substantially reduces localization error and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of the Mamba architecture to the inertial odometry task.

Motivation: 现有的方法主要依赖从支持集中提取提示来激活SAM的泛化能力，这种方式在适应未知类别时容易导致解码过程偏差。因此，需要一种更全面的策略来同时利用支持和查询集的信息。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种与SAM集成的无偏语义解码（USD）策略，通过同时从支持和查询集中提取目标信息，在CLIP模型的语义指导下进行一致预测，有效激活了SAM的泛化能力并减少了解码过程中的偏差。

Abstract: Few-shot segmentation has garnered significant attention. Many recent approaches attempt to introduce the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to handle this task. With the strong generalization ability and rich object-specific extraction ability of the SAM model, such a solution shows great potential in few-shot segmentation. However, the decoding process of SAM highly relies on accurate and explicit prompts, making previous approaches mainly focus on extracting prompts from the support set, which is insufficient to activate the generalization ability of SAM, and this design is easy to result in a biased decoding process when adapting to the unknown classes. In this work, we propose an Unbiased Semantic Decoding (USD) strategy integrated with SAM, which extracts target information from both the support and query set simultaneously to perform consistent predictions guided by the semantics of the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model. Specifically, to enhance the unbiased semantic discrimination of SAM, we design two feature enhancement strategies that leverage the semantic alignment capability of CLIP to enrich the original SAM features, mainly including a global supplement at the image level to provide a generalize category indicate with support image and a local guidance at the pixel level to provide a useful target location with query image. Besides, to generate target-focused prompt embeddings, a learnable visual-text target prompt generator is proposed by interacting target text embeddings and clip visual features. Without requiring re-training of the vision foundation models, the features with semantic discrimination draw attention to the target region through the guidance of prompt with rich target information.

Abstract: Active learning reduces annotation costs in medical imaging by strategically selecting the most informative samples for labeling. However, individual acquisition strategies often exhibit inconsistent behavior across different stages of the active learning cycle. We propose Cyclical and Performance-Adaptive Multi-Strategy Active Learning (WaveFuse-AL), a novel framework that adaptively fuses multiple established acquisition strategies-BALD, BADGE, Entropy, and CoreSet throughout the learning process. WaveFuse-AL integrates cyclical (sinusoidal) temporal priors with performance-driven adaptation to dynamically adjust strategy importance over time. We evaluate WaveFuse-AL on three medical imaging benchmarks: APTOS-2019 (multi-class classification), RSNA Pneumonia Detection (binary classification), and ISIC-2018 (skin lesion segmentation). Experimental results demonstrate that WaveFuse-AL consistently outperforms both single-strategy and alternating-strategy baselines, achieving statistically significant performance improvements (on ten out of twelve metric measurements) while maximizing the utility of limited annotation budgets.

Abstract: High-dimensional neuroimaging analyses for clinical diagnosis are often constrained by compromises in spatiotemporal fidelity and by the limited adaptability of large-scale, general-purpose models. To address these challenges, we introduce Dynamic Curriculum Learning for Spatiotemporal Encoding (DCL-SE), an end-to-end framework centered on data-driven spatiotemporal encoding (DaSE). We leverage Approximate Rank Pooling (ARP) to efficiently encode three-dimensional volumetric brain data into information-rich, two-dimensional dynamic representations, and then employ a dynamic curriculum learning strategy, guided by a Dynamic Group Mechanism (DGM), to progressively train the decoder, refining feature extraction from global anatomical structures to fine pathological details. Evaluated across six publicly available datasets, including Alzheimer's disease and brain tumor classification, cerebral artery segmentation, and brain age prediction, DCL-SE consistently outperforms existing methods in accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. These findings underscore the critical importance of compact, task-specific architectures in the era of large-scale pretrained networks.

Abstract: Accurate, up-to-date High-Definition (HD) maps are critical for urban planning, infrastructure monitoring, and autonomous navigation. However, these maps quickly become outdated as environments evolve, creating a need for robust methods that not only detect changes but also incorporate them into updated 3D representations. While change detection techniques have advanced significantly, there remains a clear gap between detecting changes and actually updating 3D maps, particularly when relying on 2D image-based change detection. To address this gap, we introduce SceneEdited, the first city-scale dataset explicitly designed to support research on HD map maintenance through 3D point cloud updating. SceneEdited contains over 800 up-to-date scenes covering 73 km of driving and approximate 3 $\text{km}^2$ of urban area, with more than 23,000 synthesized object changes created both manually and automatically across 2000+ out-of-date versions, simulating realistic urban modifications such as missing roadside infrastructure, buildings, overpasses, and utility poles. Each scene includes calibrated RGB images, LiDAR scans, and detailed change masks for training and evaluation. We also provide baseline methods using a foundational image-based structure-from-motion pipeline for updating outdated scenes, as well as a comprehensive toolkit supporting scalability, trackability, and portability for future dataset expansion and unification of out-of-date object annotations. Both the dataset and the toolkit are publicly available at https://github.com/ChadLin9596/ScenePoint-ETK, establising a standardized benchmark for 3D map updating research.

Motivation: 自动化自然、类似训练者的反馈可以提供及时、可访问和一致的指导，但需要理解临床相关表示的模型。

Abstract: High-quality intraoperative feedback from a surgical trainer is pivotal for improving trainee performance and long-term skill acquisition. Automating natural, trainer-style feedback promises timely, accessible, and consistent guidance at scale but requires models that understand clinically relevant representations. We present a structure-aware pipeline that learns a surgical action ontology from real trainer-to-trainee transcripts (33 surgeries) and uses it to condition feedback generation. We contribute by (1) mining Instrument-Action-Target (IAT) triplets from real-world feedback text and clustering surface forms into normalized categories, (2) fine-tuning a video-to-IAT model that leverages the surgical procedure and task contexts as well as fine-grained temporal instrument motion, and (3) demonstrating how to effectively use IAT triplet representations to guide GPT-4o in generating clinically grounded, trainer-style feedback. We show that, on Task 1: Video-to-IAT recognition, our context injection and temporal tracking deliver consistent AUC gains (Instrument: 0.67 to 0.74; Action: 0.60 to 0.63; Tissue: 0.74 to 0.79). For Task 2: feedback text generation (rated on a 1-5 fidelity rubric where 1 = opposite/unsafe, 3 = admissible, and 5 = perfect match to a human trainer), GPT-4o from video alone scores 2.17, while IAT conditioning reaches 2.44 (+12.4%), doubling the share of admissible generations with score >= 3 from 21% to 42%. Traditional text-similarity metrics also improve: word error rate decreases by 15-31% and ROUGE (phrase/substring overlap) increases by 9-64%. Grounding generation in explicit IAT structure improves fidelity and yields clinician-verifiable rationales, supporting auditable use in surgical training.

Abstract: Multimodal continual instruction tuning enables multimodal large language models to sequentially adapt to new tasks while building upon previously acquired knowledge. However, this continual learning paradigm faces the significant challenge of catastrophic forgetting, where learning new tasks leads to performance degradation on previous ones. In this paper, we introduce a novel insight into catastrophic forgetting by conceptualizing it as a problem of missing gradients from old tasks during new task learning. Our approach approximates these missing gradients by leveraging the geometric properties of the parameter space, specifically using the directional vector between current parameters and previously optimal parameters as gradient guidance. This approximated gradient can be further integrated with real gradients from a limited replay buffer and regulated by a Bernoulli sampling strategy that dynamically balances model stability and plasticity. Extensive experiments on multimodal continual instruction tuning datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without model expansion, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting while maintaining a compact architecture.

Abstract: Self-supervised depth estimation has gained significant attention in autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing methods exhibit substantial performance degradation under adverse weather conditions such as rain and fog, where reduced visibility critically impairs depth prediction. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-evolution contrastive learning framework called SEC-Depth for self-supervised robust depth estimation tasks. Our approach leverages intermediate parameters generated during training to construct temporally evolving latency models. Using these, we design a self-evolution contrastive scheme to mitigate performance loss under challenging conditions. Concretely, we first design a dynamic update strategy of latency models for the depth estimation task to capture optimization states across training stages. To effectively leverage latency models, we introduce a self-evolution contrastive Loss (SECL) that treats outputs from historical latency models as negative samples. This mechanism adaptively adjusts learning objectives while implicitly sensing weather degradation severity, reducing the needs for manual intervention. Experiments show that our method integrates seamlessly into diverse baseline models and significantly enhances robustness in zero-shot evaluations.

Result: 实验验证了MMCM能够准确评分多模态预测，并且聚类产生了合理的模式定义。

Conclusion: MMCM作为一种新的度量标准，通过聚类模式有效评估了多模态预测的覆盖范围和有效性，实验验证了其准确性和实用性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel metric for Human Motion Prediction (HMP). Since a single past sequence can lead to multiple possible futures, a probabilistic HMP method predicts such multiple motions. While a single motion predicted by a deterministic method is evaluated only with the difference from its ground truth motion, multiple predicted motions should also be evaluated based on their distribution. For this evaluation, this paper focuses on the following two criteria. \textbf{(a) Coverage}: motions should be distributed among multiple motion modes to cover diverse possibilities. \textbf{(b) Validity}: motions should be kinematically valid as future motions observable from a given past motion. However, existing metrics simply appreciate widely distributed motions even if these motions are observed in a single mode and kinematically invalid. To resolve these disadvantages, this paper proposes a Multimodality-aware Metric using Clustering-based Modes (MMCM). For (a) coverage, MMCM divides a motion space into several clusters, each of which is regarded as a mode. These modes are used to explicitly evaluate whether predicted motions are distributed among multiple modes. For (b) validity, MMCM identifies valid modes by collecting possible future motions from a motion dataset. Our experiments validate that our clustering yields sensible mode definitions and that MMCM accurately scores multimodal predictions. Code: https://github.com/placerkyo/MMCM

Abstract: The applicability of current lesion segmentation models for chest X-rays (CXRs) has been limited both by a small number of target labels and the reliance on long, detailed expert-level text inputs, creating a barrier to practical use. To address these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm: instruction-guided lesion segmentation (ILS), which is designed to segment diverse lesion types based on simple, user-friendly instructions. Under this paradigm, we construct MIMIC-ILS, the first large-scale instruction-answer dataset for CXR lesion segmentation, using our fully automated multimodal pipeline that generates annotations from chest X-ray images and their corresponding reports. MIMIC-ILS contains 1.1M instruction-answer pairs derived from 192K images and 91K unique segmentation masks, covering seven major lesion types. To empirically demonstrate its utility, we introduce ROSALIA, a vision-language model fine-tuned on MIMIC-ILS. ROSALIA can segment diverse lesions and provide textual explanations in response to user instructions. The model achieves high segmentation and textual accuracy in our newly proposed task, highlighting the effectiveness of our pipeline and the value of MIMIC-ILS as a foundational resource for pixel-level CXR lesion grounding.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统回归和CNN方法存在手动特征工程、有限感受野和异质数据过拟合等问题，而纯Transformer模型需要大数据集和高计算成本。因此，需要一种兼顾全局与局部特征的混合方法。

Abstract: Accurate brain age estimation from structural MRI is a valuable biomarker for studying aging and neurodegeneration. Traditional regression and CNN-based methods face limitations such as manual feature engineering, limited receptive fields, and overfitting on heterogeneous data. Pure transformer models, while effective, require large datasets and high computational cost. We propose Brain ResNet over trained Vision Transformer (BrainRotViT), a hybrid architecture that combines the global context modeling of vision transformers (ViT) with the local refinement of residual CNNs. A ViT encoder is first trained on an auxiliary age and sex classification task to learn slice-level features. The frozen encoder is then applied to all sagittal slices to generate a 2D matrix of embedding vectors, which is fed into a residual CNN regressor that incorporates subject sex at the final fully-connected layer to estimate continuous brain age. Our method achieves an MAE of 3.34 years (Pearson $r=0.98$, Spearman $ρ=0.97$, $R^2=0.95$) on validation across 11 MRI datasets encompassing more than 130 acquisition sites, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art models. It also generalizes well across 4 independent cohorts with MAEs between 3.77 and 5.04 years. Analyses on the brain age gap (the difference between the predicted age and actual age) show that aging patterns are associated with Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment, and autism spectrum disorder. Model attention maps highlight aging-associated regions of the brain, notably the cerebellar vermis, precentral and postcentral gyri, temporal lobes, and medial superior frontal gyrus. Our results demonstrate that this method provides an efficient, interpretable, and generalizable framework for brain-age prediction, bridging the gap between CNN- and transformer-based approaches while opening new avenues for aging and neurodegeneration research.

Abstract: Reference-based object composition methods fail when inserting real-world objects into stylized domains. This under-explored problem is currently split between practical "blenders" that lack generative fidelity and "generators" that require impractical, per-subject online finetuning. In this work, we introduce Insert In Style, the first zero-shot generative framework that is both practical and high-fidelity. Our core contribution is a unified framework with two key innovations: (i) a novel multi-stage training protocol that disentangles representations for identity, style, and composition, and (ii) a specialized masked-attention architecture that surgically enforces this disentanglement during generation. This approach prevents the concept interference common in general-purpose, unified-attention models. Our framework is trained on a new 100k sample dataset, curated from a novel data pipeline. This pipeline couples large-scale generation with a rigorous, two-stage filtering process to ensure both high-fidelity semantic identity and style coherence. Unlike prior work, our model is truly zero-shot and requires no text prompts. We also introduce a new public benchmark for stylized composition. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods on both identity and style metrics, a result strongly corroborated by user studies.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of learning representations for recipes and food images in the cross-modal retrieval problem. As the relationship between a recipe and its cooked dish is cause-and-effect, treating a recipe as a text source describing the visual appearance of a dish for learning representation, as the existing approaches, will create bias misleading image-and-recipe similarity judgment. Specifically, a food image may not equally capture every detail in a recipe, due to factors such as the cooking process, dish presentation, and image-capturing conditions. The current representation learning tends to capture dominant visual-text alignment while overlooking subtle variations that determine retrieval relevance. In this paper, we model such bias in cross-modal representation learning using causal theory. The causal view of this problem suggests ingredients as one of the confounder sources and a simple backdoor adjustment can alleviate the bias. By causal intervention, we reformulate the conventional model for food-to-recipe retrieval with an additional term to remove the potential bias in similarity judgment. Based on this theory-informed formulation, we empirically prove the oracle performance of retrieval on the Recipe1M dataset to be MedR=1 across the testing data sizes of 1K, 10K, and even 50K. We also propose a plug-and-play neural module, which is essentially a multi-label ingredient classifier for debiasing. New state-of-the-art search performances are reported on the Recipe1M dataset.

Abstract: Current state of the art measures like BLEU, CIDEr, VQA score, SigLIP-2 and CLIPScore are often unable to capture semantic or structural accuracy, especially for domain-specific or context-dependent scenarios. For this, this paper proposes a Physics-Constrained Multimodal Data Evaluation (PCMDE) metric combining large language models with reasoning, knowledge based mapping and vision-language models to overcome these limitations. The architecture is comprised of three main stages: (1) feature extraction of spatial and semantic information with multimodal features through object detection and VLMs; (2) Confidence-Weighted Component Fusion for adaptive component-level validation; and (3) physics-guided reasoning using large language models for structural and relational constraints (e.g., alignment, position, consistency) enforcement.

Abstract: We present SkinGPT-R1, a dermatology focused vision language model that makes diagnostic chain of thought reasoning explicit, step by step, and verifiable. To support skin specific reasoning, we build DermCoT, a corpus of standardized dermatologic chain of thought narratives that combines 10,000 DermEval filtered training cases with 3,000 dermatologist scored certified cases, and we define DermEval as a physician aligned six dimensional evaluator and DermBench as the corresponding benchmark for dermatologic chain of thought quality. On DermBench, across 14 general, reasoning, and medical vision language models, SkinGPT-R1 achieves an average score of 4.031 out of 5 over the six clinician defined dimensions, ranks 1st among all systems, and improves the average score over Vision-R1 by about 41%. On three dermatology classification benchmarks, SkinGPT-R1 delivers stable accuracy gains over Vision-R1 and remains competitive among strong vision language models. Ablation results further show that DermCoT based chain of thought supervision provides substantial improvements over the base model and that adding dermatology aware visual distillation yields consistent additional gains in both narrative quality and recognition.

Result: SplitFlux在多样场景中均表现优异，实现了更好的内容保留和风格化质量。

Conclusion: SplitFlux通过LoRA微调单Dream块，有效分离内容和风格，并在实验中表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Disentangling image content and style is essential for customized image generation. Existing SDXL-based methods struggle to achieve high-quality results, while the recently proposed Flux model fails to achieve effective content-style separation due to its underexplored characteristics. To address these challenges, we conduct a systematic analysis of Flux and make two key observations: (1) Single Dream Blocks are essential for image generation; and (2) Early single stream blocks mainly control content, whereas later blocks govern style. Based on these insights, we propose SplitFlux, which disentangles content and style by fine-tuning the single dream blocks via LoRA, enabling the disentangled content to be re-embedded into new contexts. It includes two key components: (1) Rank-Constrained Adaptation. To preserve content identity and structure, we compress the rank and amplify the magnitude of updates within specific blocks, preventing content leakage into style blocks. (2) Visual-Gated LoRA. We split the content LoRA into two branches with different ranks, guided by image saliency. The high-rank branch preserves primary subject information, while the low-rank branch encodes residual details, mitigating content overfitting and enabling seamless re-embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SplitFlux consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior content preservation and stylization quality across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Object detection with 3D radar is essential for 360-degree automotive perception, but radar's long wavelengths produce sparse and irregular reflections that challenge traditional grid and sequence-based convolutional and transformer detectors. This paper introduces Graph Query Networks (GQN), an attention-based framework that models objects sensed by radar as graphs, to extract individualized relational and contextual features. GQN employs a novel concept of graph queries to dynamically attend over the bird's-eye view (BEV) space, constructing object-specific graphs processed by two novel modules: EdgeFocus for relational reasoning and DeepContext Pooling for contextual aggregation. On the NuScenes dataset, GQN improves relative mAP by up to +53%, including a +8.2% gain over the strongest prior radar method, while reducing peak graph construction overhead by 80% with moderate FLOPs cost.

Motivation: 现有方法通常采用对象中心的图神经网络，限制了关系表示仅能捕捉成对对象上下文，难以捕捉对关系预测至关重要的高阶关系依赖。

Method: LEO框架首先预测对象对之间的潜在链接以抑制无关边，然后将原始场景图转换为线图，应用线图神经网络进行边为中心的关系推理，最后将丰富的关系特征整合回原始对象中心图。

Result: 在3DSSG数据集上的实验表明，LEO框架与两种竞争基线相比，均取得了持续改进。

Conclusion: LEO框架通过边到对象的推理范式，显著提升了3D场景图预测的准确性，尤其在捕捉高阶关系依赖方面表现出色。

Abstract: 3D scene graph prediction aims to abstract complex 3D environments into structured graphs consisting of objects and their pairwise relationships. Existing approaches typically adopt object-centric graph neural networks, where relation edge features are iteratively updated by aggregating messages from connected object nodes. However, this design inherently restricts relation representations to pairwise object context, making it difficult to capture high-order relational dependencies that are essential for accurate relation prediction. To address this limitation, we propose a Link-guided Edge-centric relational reasoning framework with Object-aware fusion, namely LEO, which enables progressive reasoning from relation-level context to object-level understanding. Specifically, LEO first predicts potential links between object pairs to suppress irrelevant edges, and then transforms the original scene graph into a line graph where each relation is treated as a node. A line graph neural network is applied to perform edge-centric relational reasoning to capture inter-relation context. The enriched relation features are subsequently integrated into the original object-centric graph to enhance object-level reasoning and improve relation prediction. Our framework is model-agnostic and can be integrated with any existing object-centric method. Experiments on the 3DSSG dataset with two competitive baselines show consistent improvements, highlighting the effectiveness of our edge-to-object reasoning paradigm.

Abstract: Previous Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods for vision transformers rely on expensive retraining to recover accuracy loss in non-linear layer quantization, limiting their use in resource-constrained environments. In contrast, existing Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods either partially quantize non-linear functions or adjust activation distributions to maintain accuracy but fail to achieve fully integer-only inference. In this paper, we introduce IPTQ-ViT, a novel PTQ framework for fully integer-only vision transformers without retraining. We present approximation functions: a polynomial-based GELU optimized for vision data and a bit-shifting-based Softmax designed to improve approximation accuracy in PTQ. In addition, we propose a unified metric integrating quantization sensitivity, perturbation, and computational cost to select the optimal approximation function per activation layer. IPTQ-ViT outperforms previous PTQ methods, achieving up to 6.44\%p (avg. 1.78\%p) top-1 accuracy improvement for image classification, 1.0 mAP for object detection. IPTQ-ViT outperforms partial floating-point PTQ methods under W8A8 and W4A8, and achieves accuracy and latency comparable to integer-only QAT methods. We plan to release our code https://github.com/gihwan-kim/IPTQ-ViT.git.

Abstract: Training prohibited item detection models requires a large amount of X-ray security images, but collecting and annotating these images is time-consuming and laborious. To address data insufficiency, X-ray security image synthesis methods composite images to scale up datasets. However, previous methods primarily follow a two-stage pipeline, where they implement labor-intensive foreground extraction in the first stage and then composite images in the second stage. Such a pipeline introduces inevitable extra labor cost and is not efficient. In this paper, we propose a one-stage X-ray security image synthesis pipeline (Xsyn) based on text-to-image generation, which incorporates two effective strategies to improve the usability of synthetic images. The Cross-Attention Refinement (CAR) strategy leverages the cross-attention map from the diffusion model to refine the bounding box annotation. The Background Occlusion Modeling (BOM) strategy explicitly models background occlusion in the latent space to enhance imaging complexity. To the best of our knowledge, compared with previous methods, Xsyn is the first to achieve high-quality X-ray security image synthesis without extra labor cost. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms all previous methods with 1.2% mAP improvement, and the synthetic images generated by our method are beneficial to improve prohibited item detection performance across various X-ray security datasets and detectors.

Abstract: We tackle the problem of localizing 3D point cloud submaps using complex and diverse natural language descriptions, and present Text2Loc++, a novel neural network designed for effective cross-modal alignment between language and point clouds in a coarse-to-fine localization pipeline. To support benchmarking, we introduce a new city-scale dataset covering both color and non-color point clouds from diverse urban scenes, and organize location descriptions into three levels of linguistic complexity. In the global place recognition stage, Text2Loc++ combines a pretrained language model with a Hierarchical Transformer with Max pooling (HTM) for sentence-level semantics, and employs an attention-based point cloud encoder for spatial understanding. We further propose Masked Instance Training (MIT) to filter out non-aligned objects and improve multimodal robustness. To enhance the embedding space, we introduce Modality-aware Hierarchical Contrastive Learning (MHCL), incorporating cross-modal, submap-, text-, and instance-level losses. In the fine localization stage, we completely remove explicit text-instance matching and design a lightweight yet powerful framework based on Prototype-based Map Cloning (PMC) and a Cascaded Cross-Attention Transformer (CCAT). Extensive experiments on the KITTI360Pose dataset show that Text2Loc++ outperforms existing methods by up to 15%. In addition, the proposed model exhibits robust generalization when evaluated on the new dataset, effectively handling complex linguistic expressions and a wide variety of urban environments. The code and dataset will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注知识毒化攻击，而本文探索了仅通过视觉扰动攻击MRAG系统的可能性，填补了这一领域的空白。

Method: 提出了一种分层视觉攻击方法，通过两阶段策略优化扰动，先破坏跨模态对齐，再扰乱多模态语义对齐，从而误导生成器。

Result: 在OK-VQA和InfoSeek数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著降低了检索和生成性能，验证了视觉攻击的有效性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新颖的分层视觉攻击方法，通过仅对用户输入的图像添加不可察觉的扰动，成功扰乱了MRAG系统的检索和生成性能，证明了视觉攻击的有效性。

Abstract: Advanced multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) techniques have been widely applied to enhance the capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), but they also bring along novel safety issues. Existing adversarial research has revealed the vulnerability of MRAG systems to knowledge poisoning attacks, which fool the retriever into recalling injected poisoned contents. However, our work considers a different setting: visual attack of MRAG by solely adding imperceptible perturbations at the image inputs of users, without manipulating any other components. This is challenging due to the robustness of fine-tuned retrievers and large-scale generators, and the effect of visual perturbation may be further weakened by propagation through the RAG chain. We propose a novel Hierarchical Visual Attack that misaligns and disrupts the two inputs (the multimodal query and the augmented knowledge) of MRAG's generator to confuse its generation. We further design a hierarchical two-stage strategy to obtain misaligned augmented knowledge. We disrupt the image input of the retriever to make it recall irrelevant knowledge from the original database, by optimizing the perturbation which first breaks the cross-modal alignment and then disrupts the multimodal semantic alignment. We conduct extensive experiments on two widely-used MRAG datasets: OK-VQA and InfoSeek. We use CLIP-based retrievers and two LMMs BLIP-2 and LLaVA as generators. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our visual attack on MRAG through the significant decrease in both retrieval and generation performance.

Conclusion: Uni-Adapter通过动态原型学习和图标签平滑模块，显著提升了3D VLFMs在异构数据分布下的性能，无需重新训练即可实现最先进的性能。

Abstract: 3D Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLFMs) have shown strong generalization and zero-shot recognition capabilities in open-world point cloud processing tasks. However, these models often underperform in practical scenarios where data are noisy, incomplete, or drawn from a different distribution than the training data. To address this, we propose Uni-Adapter, a novel training-free online test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy for 3D VLFMs based on dynamic prototype learning. We define a 3D cache to store class-specific cluster centers as prototypes, which are continuously updated to capture intra-class variability in heterogeneous data distributions. These dynamic prototypes serve as anchors for cache-based logit computation via similarity scoring. Simultaneously, a graph-based label smoothing module captures inter-prototype similarities to enforce label consistency among similar prototypes. Finally, we unify predictions from the original 3D VLFM and the refined 3D cache using entropy-weighted aggregation for reliable adaptation. Without retraining, Uni-Adapter effectively mitigates distribution shifts, achieving state-of-the-art performance on diverse 3D benchmarks over different 3D VLFMs, improving ModelNet-40C by 10.55%, ScanObjectNN-C by 8.26%, and ShapeNet-C by 4.49% over the source 3D VLFMs.

Conclusion: 提出的RS-CA-HSICT框架在MPox检测中表现出色，分类准确率高达98.30%，F1分数为98.13%，优于现有的CNN和ViT模型。

Abstract: This work proposes a hybrid deep learning approach, namely Residual and Spatial Learning based Channel Augmented Integrated CNN-Transformer architecture, that leverages the strengths of CNN and Transformer towards enhanced MPox detection. The proposed RS-CA-HSICT framework is composed of an HSICT block, a residual CNN module, a spatial CNN block, and a CA, which enhances the diverse feature space, detailed lesion information, and long-range dependencies. The new HSICT module first integrates an abstract representation of the stem CNN and customized ICT blocks for efficient multihead attention and structured CNN layers with homogeneous (H) and structural (S) operations. The customized ICT blocks learn global contextual interactions and local texture extraction. Additionally, H and S layers learn spatial homogeneity and fine structural details by reducing noise and modeling complex morphological variations. Moreover, inverse residual learning enhances vanishing gradient, and stage-wise resolution reduction ensures scale invariance. Furthermore, the RS-CA-HSICT framework augments the learned HSICT channels with the TL-driven Residual and Spatial CNN maps for enhanced multiscale feature space capturing global and localized structural cues, subtle texture, and contrast variations. These channels, preceding augmentation, are refined through the Channel-Fusion-and-Attention block, which preserves discriminative channels while suppressing redundant ones, thereby enabling efficient computation. Finally, the spatial attention mechanism refines pixel selection to detect subtle patterns and intra-class contrast variations in Mpox. Experimental results on both the Kaggle benchmark and a diverse MPox dataset reported classification accuracy as high as 98.30% and an F1-score of 98.13%, which outperforms the existing CNNs and ViTs.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) detection and aerial object recognition are critical for modern surveillance and security, prompting a need for robust systems that overcome limitations of single-modality approaches. This research addresses these challenges by designing and rigorously evaluating a novel multimodal Transformer model that integrates diverse data streams: radar, visual band video (RGB), infrared (IR) video, and audio. The architecture effectively fuses distinct features from each modality, leveraging the Transformer's self-attention mechanisms to learn comprehensive, complementary, and highly discriminative representations for classification. The model demonstrated exceptional performance on an independent test set, achieving macro-averaged metrics of 0.9812 accuracy, 0.9873 recall, 0.9787 precision, 0.9826 F1-score, and 0.9954 specificity. Notably, it exhibited particularly high precision and recall in distinguishing drones from other aerial objects. Furthermore, computational analysis confirmed its efficiency, with 1.09 GFLOPs, 1.22 million parameters, and an inference speed of 41.11 FPS, highlighting its suitability for real-time applications. This study presents a significant advancement in aerial object classification, validating the efficacy of multimodal data fusion via a Transformer architecture for achieving state-of-the-art performance, thereby offering a highly accurate and resilient solution for UAV detection and monitoring in complex airspace.

Motivation: 解决现有低光增强方法因缺乏光照多样性数据而无法全面评估算法性能的问题。

Method: 引入了Multi-Illumination Low-Light (MILL)数据集，包含在不同光照强度下捕获的图像，并使用固定相机设置和精确照度测量。基于该数据集，对现有方法进行了基准测试，并提出了改进方案以增强算法在多样光照场景中的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 论文提出的改进方法在多样光照条件下显著提升了低光增强算法的性能，特别是在DSLR和智能手机图像上分别实现了10 dB和2 dB的PSNR提升。

Abstract: Imaging in low-light environments is challenging due to reduced scene radiance, which leads to elevated sensor noise and reduced color saturation. Most learning-based low-light enhancement methods rely on paired training data captured under a single low-light condition and a well-lit reference. The lack of radiance diversity limits our understanding of how enhancement techniques perform across varying illumination intensities. We introduce the Multi-Illumination Low-Light (MILL) dataset, containing images captured at diverse light intensities under controlled conditions with fixed camera settings and precise illuminance measurements. MILL enables comprehensive evaluation of enhancement algorithms across variable lighting conditions. We benchmark several state-of-the-art methods and reveal significant performance variations across intensity levels. Leveraging the unique multi-illumination structure of our dataset, we propose improvements that enhance robustness across diverse illumination scenarios. Our modifications achieve up to 10 dB PSNR improvement for DSLR and 2 dB for the smartphone on Full HD images.

Result: FIA-Flow在多种模型（AlexNet、ResNet、Swin Transformer、DINO和YOLO11）和层上实现了更高保真和语义对齐的特征反转。

Conclusion: FIA-Flow框架揭示了Split DNNs中比以往认知更严重的隐私威胁，通过高保真图像重建和新的量化指标，展示了中间特征的隐私泄露风险。

Abstract: Split DNNs enable edge devices by offloading intensive computation to a cloud server, but this paradigm exposes privacy vulnerabilities, as the intermediate features can be exploited to reconstruct the private inputs via Feature Inversion Attack (FIA). Existing FIA methods often produce limited reconstruction quality, making it difficult to assess the true extent of privacy leakage. To reveal the privacy risk of the leaked features, we introduce FIA-Flow, a black-box FIA framework that achieves high-fidelity image reconstruction from intermediate features. To exploit the semantic information within intermediate features, we design a Latent Feature Space Alignment Module (LFSAM) to bridge the semantic gap between the intermediate feature space and the latent space. Furthermore, to rectify distributional mismatch, we develop Deterministic Inversion Flow Matching (DIFM), which projects off-manifold features onto the target manifold with one-step inference. This decoupled design simplifies learning and enables effective training with few image-feature pairs. To quantify privacy leakage from a human perspective, we also propose two metrics based on a large vision-language model. Experiments show that FIA-Flow achieves more faithful and semantically aligned feature inversion across various models (AlexNet, ResNet, Swin Transformer, DINO, and YOLO11) and layers, revealing a more severe privacy threat in Split DNNs than previously recognized.

Abstract: Fingerprint liveness detection systems have been affected by spoofing, which is a severe threat for fingerprint-based biometric systems. Therefore, it is crucial to develop some techniques to distinguish the fake fingerprints from the real ones. The software based techniques can detect the fingerprint forgery automatically. Also, the scheme shall be resistant against various distortions such as noise contamination, pixel missing and block missing, so that the forgers cannot deceive the detector by adding some distortions to the faked fingerprint. In this paper, we propose a fingerprint forgery detection algorithm based on a suggested adaptive thresholding pattern. The anisotropic diffusion of the input image is passed through three levels of the wavelet transform. The coefficients of different layers are adaptively thresholded and concatenated to produce the feature vector which is classified using the SVM classifier. Another contribution of the paper is to investigate the effect of various distortions such as pixel missing, block missing, and noise contamination. Our suggested approach includes a novel method that exhibits improved resistance against a range of distortions caused by environmental phenomena or manipulations by malicious users. In quantitative comparisons, our proposed method outperforms its counterparts by approximately 8% and 5% in accuracy for missing pixel scenarios of 90% and block missing scenarios of size 70x70 , respectively. This highlights the novelty approach in addressing such challenges.

Conclusion: CompTrack通过SFP和IB-DTC模块有效解决了点云中的空间冗余和信息冗余问题，实现了实时高效的3D单目标跟踪。

Abstract: 3D single object tracking (SOT) in LiDAR point clouds is a critical task in computer vision and autonomous driving. Despite great success having been achieved, the inherent sparsity of point clouds introduces a dual-redundancy challenge that limits existing trackers: (1) vast spatial redundancy from background noise impairs accuracy, and (2) informational redundancy within the foreground hinders efficiency. To tackle these issues, we propose CompTrack, a novel end-to-end framework that systematically eliminates both forms of redundancy in point clouds. First, CompTrack incorporates a Spatial Foreground Predictor (SFP) module to filter out irrelevant background noise based on information entropy, addressing spatial redundancy. Subsequently, its core is an Information Bottleneck-guided Dynamic Token Compression (IB-DTC) module that eliminates the informational redundancy within the foreground. Theoretically grounded in low-rank approximation, this module leverages an online SVD analysis to adaptively compress the redundant foreground into a compact and highly informative set of proxy tokens. Extensive experiments on KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate that CompTrack achieves top-performing tracking performance with superior efficiency, running at a real-time 90 FPS on a single RTX 3090 GPU.

Conclusion: SA-FARI数据集为野生动物多动物跟踪（MAT）提供了首个大规模、高物种多样性和高质量时空标注的基准，推动了通用MAT模型的发展。

Abstract: Automated video analysis is critical for wildlife conservation. A foundational task in this domain is multi-animal tracking (MAT), which underpins applications such as individual re-identification and behavior recognition. However, existing datasets are limited in scale, constrained to a few species, or lack sufficient temporal and geographical diversity - leaving no suitable benchmark for training general-purpose MAT models applicable across wild animal populations. To address this, we introduce SA-FARI, the largest open-source MAT dataset for wild animals. It comprises 11,609 camera trap videos collected over approximately 10 years (2014-2024) from 741 locations across 4 continents, spanning 99 species categories. Each video is exhaustively annotated culminating in ~46 hours of densely annotated footage containing 16,224 masklet identities and 942,702 individual bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and species labels. Alongside the task-specific annotations, we publish anonymized camera trap locations for each video. Finally, we present comprehensive benchmarks on SA-FARI using state-of-the-art vision-language models for detection and tracking, including SAM 3, evaluated with both species-specific and generic animal prompts. We also compare against vision-only methods developed specifically for wildlife analysis. SA-FARI is the first large-scale dataset to combine high species diversity, multi-region coverage, and high-quality spatio-temporal annotations, offering a new foundation for advancing generalizable multianimal tracking in the wild.

Conclusion: ZOMG框架在无需任何标注或微调的情况下，成功实现了对运动序列的语义分割，并在多个数据集上展示了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Understanding complex human activities demands the ability to decompose motion into fine-grained, semantic-aligned sub-actions. This motion grounding process is crucial for behavior analysis, embodied AI and virtual reality. Yet, most existing methods rely on dense supervision with predefined action classes, which are infeasible in open-vocabulary, real-world settings. In this paper, we propose ZOMG, a zero-shot, open-vocabulary framework that segments motion sequences into semantically meaningful sub-actions without requiring any annotations or fine-tuning. Technically, ZOMG integrates (1) language semantic partition, which leverages large language models to decompose instructions into ordered sub-action units, and (2) soft masking optimization, which learns instance-specific temporal masks to focus on frames critical to sub-actions, while maintaining intra-segment continuity and enforcing inter-segment separation, all without altering the pretrained encoder. Experiments on three motion-language datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art effectiveness and efficiency of motion grounding performance, outperforming prior methods by +8.7\% mAP on HumanML3D benchmark. Meanwhile, significant improvements also exist in downstream retrieval, establishing a new paradigm for annotation-free motion understanding.

Motivation: 当前GeoFM评估缺乏标准化协议，GEO-Bench-2旨在填补这一空白，推动模型适应策略的研究。

Method: 通过19个开源数据集，GEO-Bench-2设计了分类、分割、回归、目标检测和实例分割的综合评估框架，并引入“能力”组对模型进行排名。

Result: 实验表明，不同任务需要不同的模型设计，EO专用模型在多光谱应用中表现更优，而自然图像预训练模型在高分辨率任务中领先。

Conclusion: GEO-Bench-2提供了一个标准化的评估框架，帮助用户根据不同任务需求选择最优的GeoFM模型，并揭示了单一通用模型的局限性，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Geospatial Foundation Models (GeoFMs) are transforming Earth Observation (EO), but evaluation lacks standardized protocols. GEO-Bench-2 addresses this with a comprehensive framework spanning classification, segmentation, regression, object detection, and instance segmentation across 19 permissively-licensed datasets. We introduce ''capability'' groups to rank models on datasets that share common characteristics (e.g., resolution, bands, temporality). This enables users to identify which models excel in each capability and determine which areas need improvement in future work. To support both fair comparison and methodological innovation, we define a prescriptive yet flexible evaluation protocol. This not only ensures consistency in benchmarking but also facilitates research into model adaptation strategies, a key and open challenge in advancing GeoFMs for downstream tasks.
  Our experiments show that no single model dominates across all tasks, confirming the specificity of the choices made during architecture design and pretraining. While models pretrained on natural images (ConvNext ImageNet, DINO V3) excel on high-resolution tasks, EO-specific models (TerraMind, Prithvi, and Clay) outperform them on multispectral applications such as agriculture and disaster response. These findings demonstrate that optimal model choice depends on task requirements, data modalities, and constraints. This shows that the goal of a single GeoFM model that performs well across all tasks remains open for future research. GEO-Bench-2 enables informed, reproducible GeoFM evaluation tailored to specific use cases. Code, data, and leaderboard for GEO-Bench-2 are publicly released under a permissive license.

Existing pruning methods (e.g., Wanda) tailored for LLMs rely heavily on manual design pruning algorithms, thereby leading to \textit{huge labor costs} and \textit{requires expert knowledge}. Furthermore, we are the first to identify the serious \textit{outlier value issue} behind dramatic performance degradation under high pruning ratios that are caused by uniform sparsity, raising an additional concern about how to design adaptive pruning sparsity ideal for LLMs. Can LLMs prune by themselves? In this work, we introduce an affirmative answer by proposing a novel pruning method called \textbf{AutoPrune}, which first overcomes expert knowledge limits by leveraging LLMs to design optimal pruning algorithms for themselves automatically without any expert knowledge. Specifically, to mitigate the black-box nature of LLMs, we propose a Graph-driven Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) to optimize prompts, significantly enhancing the reasoning process in learning the pruning algorithm and enabling us to generate pruning algorithms with superior performance and interpretability in the next generation. Finally, grounded in insights of outlier value issue, we introduce Skew-aware Dynamic Sparsity Allocation (SDSA) to overcome the outlier value issue, mitigating performance degradation under high pruning ratios. We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream LLMs benchmarks, demonstrating the superiority of AutoPrune, which consistently excels state-of-the-art competitors.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法依赖人工标注或任务特定启发式奖励，成本高且难以扩展。VisPlay 旨在利用大量未标注图像数据，实现视觉语言模型的自主能力提升。

Method: VisPlay 采用自进化强化学习框架，将基础视觉语言模型分为两个互动角色：图像条件提问者和多模态推理者，并通过 Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) 进行联合训练，结合多样性和难度奖励。

Result: 在 Qwen2.5-VL 和 MiMo-VL 模型上，VisPlay 在八个基准测试（如 MM-Vet 和 MMMU）中均表现出视觉推理、组合泛化和幻觉减少的持续改进。

Conclusion: VisPlay 提供了一种可扩展的自进化多模态智能路径，通过自我改进的强化学习框架显著提升了视觉语言模型在复杂推理任务上的表现。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a principled framework for improving Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. However, existing RL approaches often rely on human-annotated labels or task-specific heuristics to define verifiable rewards, both of which are costly and difficult to scale. We introduce VisPlay, a self-evolving RL framework that enables VLMs to autonomously improve their reasoning abilities using large amounts of unlabeled image data. Starting from a single base VLM, VisPlay assigns the model into two interacting roles: an Image-Conditioned Questioner that formulates challenging yet answerable visual questions, and a Multimodal Reasoner that generates silver responses. These roles are jointly trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which incorporates diversity and difficulty rewards to balance the complexity of generated questions with the quality of the silver answers. VisPlay scales efficiently across two model families. When trained on Qwen2.5-VL and MiMo-VL, VisPlay achieves consistent improvements in visual reasoning, compositional generalization, and hallucination reduction across eight benchmarks, including MM-Vet and MMMU, demonstrating a scalable path toward self-evolving multimodal intelligence.

TL;DR: ShelfOcc是一种纯视觉方法，通过视频生成高质量3D监督信号，无需LiDAR，显著提升弱/半监督占据估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的2D投影或基于渲染的监督方法存在几何不一致和深度渗漏问题，而基于LiDAR的方法依赖额外传感器或手动3D标注。ShelfOcc旨在克服这些限制，无需LiDAR即可实现真正的3D监督。

Method: ShelfOcc通过视频生成度量一致的语义体素标签，并设计专用框架过滤和累积静态几何信息，处理动态内容并传播语义信息到稳定的体素表示中。

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes基准测试中，ShelfOcc显著优于所有先前的弱/半监督方法（相对提升高达34%）。

Conclusion: ShelfOcc通过在原生3D空间中引入高质量的监督信号，显著提升了无LiDAR依赖的3D场景理解性能，为弱/半监督占据估计开辟了新的数据驱动方向。

Abstract: Recent progress in self- and weakly supervised occupancy estimation has largely relied on 2D projection or rendering-based supervision, which suffers from geometric inconsistencies and severe depth bleeding. We thus introduce ShelfOcc, a vision-only method that overcomes these limitations without relying on LiDAR. ShelfOcc brings supervision into native 3D space by generating metrically consistent semantic voxel labels from video, enabling true 3D supervision without any additional sensors or manual 3D annotations. While recent vision-based 3D geometry foundation models provide a promising source of prior knowledge, they do not work out of the box as a prediction due to sparse or noisy and inconsistent geometry, especially in dynamic driving scenes. Our method introduces a dedicated framework that mitigates these issues by filtering and accumulating static geometry consistently across frames, handling dynamic content and propagating semantic information into a stable voxel representation. This data-centric shift in supervision for weakly/shelf-supervised occupancy estimation allows the use of essentially any SOTA occupancy model architecture without relying on LiDAR data. We argue that such high-quality supervision is essential for robust occupancy learning and constitutes an important complementary avenue to architectural innovation. On the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, ShelfOcc substantially outperforms all previous weakly/shelf-supervised methods (up to a 34% relative improvement), establishing a new data-driven direction for LiDAR-free 3D scene understanding.

Motivation: 现有基于图的模型主要关注低频信息，存在局限性。本研究旨在通过多频信号整合提升抑郁症检测的准确性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出了一种多频图卷积网络（MF-GCN），包含新颖的多频滤波器组模块（MFFBM），能够同时利用低频和高频信号。

Result: 在二分类（抑郁与非抑郁）任务中，模型灵敏度达0.96，F2分数0.94；在三分类任务中，灵敏度0.79，特异性0.87。在CMDC数据集上验证了泛化性，灵敏度0.95，F2分数0.96。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的多频图卷积网络（MF-GCN）通过整合低频和高频信号，显著提升了抑郁症检测的准确性，并在跨模态交互中表现出色。

Abstract: Eye tracking data quantifies the attentional bias towards negative stimuli that is frequently observed in depressed groups. Audio and video data capture the affective flattening and psychomotor retardation characteristic of depression. Statistical validation confirmed their significant discriminative power in distinguishing depressed from non depressed groups. We address a critical limitation of existing graph-based models that focus on low-frequency information and propose a Multi-Frequency Graph Convolutional Network (MF-GCN). This framework consists of a novel Multi-Frequency Filter Bank Module (MFFBM), which can leverage both low and high frequency signals. Extensive evaluation against traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning frameworks demonstrates that MF-GCN consistently outperforms baselines. In binary (depressed and non depressed) classification, the model achieved a sensitivity of 0.96 and F2 score of 0.94. For the 3 class (no depression, mild to moderate depression and severe depression) classification task, the proposed method achieved a sensitivity of 0.79 and specificity of 0.87 and siginificantly suprassed other models. To validate generalizability, the model was also evaluated on the Chinese Multimodal Depression Corpus (CMDC) dataset and achieved a sensitivity of 0.95 and F2 score of 0.96. These results confirm that our trimodal, multi frequency framework effectively captures cross modal interaction for accurate depression detection.

Conclusion: 该框架通过后处理构建置信掩码，为临床决策提供统计保证，确保假阳性预测比例低于用户指定容忍度。

Abstract: Reliable semantic segmentation is essential for clinical decision making, yet deep models rarely provide explicit statistical guarantees on their errors. We introduce a simple post-hoc framework that constructs confidence masks with distribution-free, image-level control of false-positive predictions. Given any pretrained segmentation model, we define a nested family of shrunken masks obtained either by increasing the score threshold or by applying morphological erosion. A labeled calibration set is used to select a single shrink parameter via conformal prediction, ensuring that, for new images that are exchangeable with the calibration data, the proportion of false positives retained in the confidence mask stays below a user-specified tolerance with high probability. The method is model-agnostic, requires no retraining, and provides finite-sample guarantees regardless of the underlying predictor. Experiments on a polyp-segmentation benchmark demonstrate target-level empirical validity. Our framework enables practical, risk-aware segmentation in settings where over-segmentation can have clinical consequences. Code at https://github.com/deel-ai-papers/conseco.

Motivation: 现有方法将ARC-AGI视为纯文本推理任务，忽视了人类在解决此类问题时依赖视觉抽象的事实。初步实验显示，简单地将ARC-AGI网格渲染为图像会因规则执行不精确而降低性能。

Method: 提出了两种协同策略：(1) 视觉-语言协同推理（VLSR），将ARC-AGI分解为模态对齐的子任务；(2) 模态切换自我校正（MSSC），利用视觉验证基于文本的推理以实现内在错误校正。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个旗舰模型和ARC-AGI任务中比纯文本基线提高了4.33%。

Conclusion: 研究发现，将视觉抽象与语言推理相结合是实现未来基础模型中类似人类的通用智能的关键步骤。

Abstract: Abstract reasoning from minimal examples remains a core unsolved problem for frontier foundation models such as GPT-5 and Grok 4. These models still fail to infer structured transformation rules from a handful of examples, which is a key hallmark of human intelligence. The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) provides a rigorous testbed for this capability, demanding conceptual rule induction and transfer to novel tasks. Most existing methods treat ARC-AGI as a purely textual reasoning task, overlooking the fact that humans rely heavily on visual abstraction when solving such puzzles. However, our pilot experiments reveal a paradox: naively rendering ARC-AGI grids as images degrades performance due to imprecise rule execution. This leads to our central hypothesis that vision and language possess complementary strengths across distinct reasoning stages: vision supports global pattern abstraction and verification, whereas language specializes in symbolic rule formulation and precise execution. Building on this insight, we introduce two synergistic strategies: (1) Vision-Language Synergy Reasoning (VLSR), which decomposes ARC-AGI into modality-aligned subtasks; and (2) Modality-Switch Self-Correction (MSSC), which leverages vision to verify text-based reasoning for intrinsic error correction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach yields up to a 4.33% improvement over text-only baselines across diverse flagship models and multiple ARC-AGI tasks. Our findings suggest that unifying visual abstraction with linguistic reasoning is a crucial step toward achieving generalizable, human-like intelligence in future foundation models. Source code will be released soon.

TL;DR: D4C 是首个针对 CLIP 模型的数据无关量化框架，通过合成语义丰富且结构多样的伪图像，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 DFQ 技术直接应用于 CLIP 模型时性能下降严重，主要原因是合成样本的语义内容不足和图像内多样性低。

Method: D4C 框架包含三个关键组件：(1) 提示引导的语义注入；(2) 结构对比生成；(3) 扰动感知增强，以生成兼具语义信息和结构多样性的伪图像。

Result: 实验表明，D4C 在多种比特宽度和模型上显著提升了性能，例如在 W4A8 设置下，CLIP ResNet-50 和 ViT-B/32 在 CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100 和 ImageNet-1K 上的零样本分类准确率分别提高了 12.4%、18.9%、6.8%、19.7%、1.4% 和 5.7%。

Conclusion: D4C 框架通过合成语义丰富且结构多样的伪图像，显著提升了 CLIP 模型在数据无关量化（DFQ）中的性能，填补了现有技术的空白。

Abstract: Data-Free Quantization (DFQ) offers a practical solution for model compression without requiring access to real data, making it particularly attractive in privacy-sensitive scenarios. While DFQ has shown promise for unimodal models, its extension to Vision-Language Models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models remains underexplored. In this work, we reveal that directly applying existing DFQ techniques to CLIP results in substantial performance degradation due to two key limitations: insufficient semantic content and low intra-image diversity in synthesized samples. To tackle these challenges, we propose D4C, the first DFQ framework tailored for CLIP. D4C synthesizes semantically rich and structurally diverse pseudo images through three key components: (1) Prompt-Guided Semantic Injection aligns generated images with real-world semantics using text prompts; (2) Structural Contrastive Generation reproduces compositional structures of natural images by leveraging foreground-background contrastive synthesis; and (3) Perturbation-Aware Enhancement applies controlled perturbations to improve sample diversity and robustness. These components jointly empower D4C to synthesize images that are both semantically informative and structurally diverse, effectively bridging the performance gap of DFQ on CLIP. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of D4C, showing significant performance improvements on various bit-widths and models. For example, under the W4A8 setting with CLIP ResNet-50 and ViT-B/32, D4C achieves Top-1 accuracy improvement of 12.4% and 18.9% on CIFAR-10, 6.8% and 19.7% on CIFAR-100, and 1.4% and 5.7% on ImageNet-1K in zero-shot classification, respectively.

Abstract: We introduce WarNav, a novel real-world dataset constructed from images of the open-source DATTALION repository, specifically tailored to enable the development and benchmarking of semantic segmentation models for autonomous ground vehicle navigation in unstructured, conflict-affected environments. This dataset addresses a critical gap between conventional urban driving resources and the unique operational scenarios encountered by unmanned systems in hazardous and damaged war-zones. We detail the methodological challenges encountered, ranging from data heterogeneity to ethical considerations, providing guidance for future efforts that target extreme operational contexts. To establish performance references, we report baseline results on WarNav using several state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models trained on structured urban scenes. We further analyse the impact of training data environments and propose a first step towards effective navigability in challenging environments with the constraint of having no annotation of the targeted images. Our goal is to foster impactful research that enhances the robustness and safety of autonomous vehicles in high-risk scenarios while being frugal in annotated data.

Abstract: Multimodal object detection has attracted significant attention in both academia and industry for its enhanced robustness. Although numerous studies have focused on improving modality fusion strategies, most neglect fusion degradation, and none provide a theoretical analysis of its underlying causes. To fill this gap, this paper presents a systematic theoretical investigation of fusion degradation in multimodal detection and identifies two key optimization deficiencies: (1) the gradients of unimodal branch backbones are severely suppressed under multimodal architectures, resulting in under-optimization of the unimodal branches; (2) disparities in modality quality cause weaker modalities to experience stronger gradient suppression, which in turn results in imbalanced modality learning. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Representation Space Constrained Learning with Modality Decoupling (RSC-MD) method, which consists of two modules. The RSC module and the MD module are designed to respectively amplify the suppressed gradients and eliminate inter-modality coupling interference as well as modality imbalance, thereby enabling the comprehensive optimization of each modality-specific backbone. Extensive experiments conducted on the FLIR, LLVIP, M3FD, and MFAD datasets demonstrate that the proposed method effectively alleviates fusion degradation and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. The code and training procedures will be released at https://github.com/yikangshao/RSC-MD.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种对比正则化损失方法，有效提升了模型对未见过的齿轮箱组件的泛化能力。

Abstract: Remanufacturing describes a process where worn products are restored to like-new condition and it offers vast ecological and economic potentials. A key step is the quality inspection of disassembled components, which is mostly done manually due to the high variety of parts and defect patterns. Deep neural networks show great potential to automate such visual inspection tasks but struggle to generalize to new product variants, components, or defect patterns. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel image dataset depicting typical gearbox components in good and defective condition from two automotive transmissions. Depending on the train-test split of the data, different distribution shifts are generated to benchmark the generalization ability of a classification model. We evaluate different models using the dataset and propose a contrastive regularization loss to enhance model robustness. The results obtained demonstrate the ability of the loss to improve generalisation to unseen types of components.

Abstract: Object detection in autonomous driving suffers from motion blur and saturation under fast motion and extreme lighting. Spike cameras, offer microsecond latency and ultra high dynamic range for object detection by using per pixel asynchronous integrate and fire. However, their sparse, discrete output cannot be processed by standard image-based detectors, posing a critical challenge for end to end spike stream detection. We propose EASD, an end to end spike camera detector with a dual branch design: a Temporal Based Texture plus Feature Fusion branch for global cross slice semantics, and an Entropy Selective Attention branch for object centric details. To close the data gap, we introduce DSEC Spike, the first driving oriented simulated spike detection benchmark.

Conclusion: Sigmma框架通过多尺度对比对齐和图结构整合，显著提升了HE图像与空间转录组数据的跨模态表示学习效果，并在基因表达预测和跨模态检索任务中取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in computational pathology have leveraged vision-language models to learn joint representations of Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) images with spatial transcriptomic (ST) profiles. However, existing approaches typically align HE tiles with their corresponding ST profiles at a single scale, overlooking fine-grained cellular structures and their spatial organization. To address this, we propose Sigmma, a multi-modal contrastive alignment framework for learning hierarchical representations of HE images and spatial transcriptome profiles across multiple scales. Sigmma introduces multi-scale contrastive alignment, ensuring that representations learned at different scales remain coherent across modalities. Furthermore, by representing cell interactions as a graph and integrating inter- and intra-subgraph relationships, our approach effectively captures cell-cell interactions, ranging from fine to coarse, within the tissue microenvironment. We demonstrate that Sigmm learns representations that better capture cross-modal correspondences, leading to an improvement of avg. 9.78\% in the gene-expression prediction task and avg. 26.93\% in the cross-modal retrieval task across datasets. We further show that it learns meaningful multi-tissue organization in downstream analyses.

Abstract: Purse seiners play a crucial role in tuna fishing, as approximately 69% of the world's tropical tuna is caught using this gear. All tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations have established minimum standards to use electronic monitoring (EM) in fisheries in addition to traditional observers. The EM systems produce a massive amount of video data that human analysts must process. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into their workflow can decrease that workload and improve the accuracy of the reports. However, species identification still poses significant challenges for AI, as achieving balanced performance across all species requires appropriate training data. Here, we quantify the difficulty experts face to distinguish bigeye tuna (BET, Thunnus Obesus) from yellowfin tuna (YFT, Thunnus Albacares) using images captured by EM systems. We found inter-expert agreements of 42.9% $\pm$ 35.6% for BET and 57.1% $\pm$ 35.6% for YFT. We then present a multi-stage pipeline to estimate the species composition of the catches using a reliable ground-truth dataset based on identifications made by observers on board. Three segmentation approaches are compared: Mask R-CNN, a combination of DINOv2 with SAM2, and a integration of YOLOv9 with SAM2. We found that the latest performs the best, with a validation mean average precision of 0.66 $\pm$ 0.03 and a recall of 0.88 $\pm$ 0.03. Segmented individuals are tracked using ByteTrack. For classification, we evaluate a standard multiclass classification model and a hierarchical approach, finding a superior generalization by the hierarchical. All our models were cross-validated during training and tested on fishing operations with fully known catch composition. Combining YOLOv9-SAM2 with the hierarchical classification produced the best estimations, with 84.8% of the individuals being segmented and classified with a mean average error of 4.5%.

The dataset generates abstract, lung nodule-like shapes with controllable visual attributes such as roundness, margin sharpness, and spiculation. Target class is derived from a predefined attribute combination, allowing full control over the decision rule that links attributes to the diagnostic class. We demonstrate how FunnyNodules can be used in model-agnostic evaluations to assess whether models learn correct attribute-target relations, to interpret over- or underperformance in attribute prediction, and to analyze attention alignment with attribute-specific regions of interest. The framework is fully customizable, supporting variations in dataset complexity, target definitions, class balance, and beyond. With complete ground truth information, FunnyNodules provides a versatile foundation for developing, benchmarking, and conducting in-depth analyses of explainable AI methods in medical image analysis.

Motivation: 现有自回归模型在视觉生成中存在效率低下问题，受人类视觉系统中心-外围感知模式启发，寻求更高效的生成范式。

Method: 提出扩展自回归表示（EAR），采用螺旋展开策略和长度自适应解码，从中心向外逐步生成图像。

Result: 在ImageNet上的实验表明，EAR在单尺度自回归模型中实现了生成质量与效率的最佳权衡。

Conclusion: EAR通过仿生设计实现了高效并行的自回归图像生成，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升了效率，为可扩展且认知对齐的自回归模型设定了新方向。

Abstract: Autoregressive models have recently shown great promise in visual generation by leveraging discrete token sequences akin to language modeling. However, existing approaches often suffer from inefficiency, either due to token-by-token decoding or the complexity of multi-scale representations. In this work, we introduce Expanding Autoregressive Representation (EAR), a novel generation paradigm that emulates the human visual system's center-outward perception pattern. EAR unfolds image tokens in a spiral order from the center and progressively expands outward, preserving spatial continuity and enabling efficient parallel decoding. To further enhance flexibility and speed, we propose a length-adaptive decoding strategy that dynamically adjusts the number of tokens predicted at each step. This biologically inspired design not only reduces computational cost but also improves generation quality by aligning the generation order with perceptual relevance. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that EAR achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between fidelity and efficiency on single-scale autoregressive models, setting a new direction for scalable and cognitively aligned autoregressive image generation.

TL;DR: MTGNet通过多文本提示和跨模态优化，解决了少样本语义分割中单一文本描述不足和噪声干扰问题，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CLIP的少样本语义分割方法因单一文本提示无法捕捉复杂类别的语义多样性，导致目标区域激活不完整，且缺乏跨模态交互，易受噪声干扰。

Method: MTGNet采用双分支框架，包含多文本先验优化模块（MTPR）、文本锚点特征融合模块（TAFF）和前景置信度加权注意力模块（FCWA），分别用于增强文本先验、优化视觉先验并提升分割鲁棒性。

Result: 在1-shot设置下，MTGNet在PASCAL-5i和COCO-20i上分别达到76.8%和57.4%的mIoU，尤其在类内变异性高的数据上表现显著提升。

Conclusion: MTGNet通过融合多样化的文本提示和跨模态优化，显著提升了少样本语义分割的性能，尤其在处理高类内变异性数据时表现突出。

Abstract: Recent CLIP-based few-shot semantic segmentation methods introduce class-level textual priors to assist segmentation by typically using a single prompt (e.g., a photo of class). However, these approaches often result in incomplete activation of target regions, as a single textual description cannot fully capture the semantic diversity of complex categories. Moreover, they lack explicit cross-modal interaction and are vulnerable to noisy support features, further degrading visual prior quality. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-Text Guided Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation Network (MTGNet), a dual-branch framework that enhances segmentation performance by fusing diverse textual prompts to refine textual priors and guide the cross-modal optimization of visual priors. Specifically, we design a Multi-Textual Prior Refinement (MTPR) module that suppresses interference and aggregates complementary semantic cues to enhance foreground activation and expand semantic coverage for structurally complex objects. We introduce a Text Anchor Feature Fusion (TAFF) module, which leverages multi-text embeddings as semantic anchors to facilitate the transfer of discriminative local prototypes from support images to query images, thereby improving semantic consistency and alleviating intra-class variations. Furthermore, a Foreground Confidence-Weighted Attention (FCWA) module is presented to enhance visual prior robustness by leveraging internal self-similarity within support foreground features. It adaptively down-weights inconsistent regions and effectively suppresses interference in the query segmentation process. Extensive experiments on standard FSS benchmarks validate the effectiveness of MTGNet. In the 1-shot setting, it achieves 76.8% mIoU on PASCAL-5i and 57.4% on COCO-20i, with notable improvements in folds exhibiting high intra-class variations.

Abstract: The task of weed detection is an essential element of precision agriculture since accurate species identification allows a farmer to selectively apply herbicides and fits into sustainable agriculture crop management. This paper proposes a hybrid deep learning framework recipe for weed detection that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to build robustness to multiple field conditions. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based augmentation method was imposed to balance class distributions and better generalize the model. Further, a self-supervised contrastive pre-training method helps to learn more features from limited annotated data. Experimental results yield superior results with 99.33% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on multi-benchmark datasets. The proposed model architecture enables local, global, and relational feature representations and offers high interpretability and adaptability. Practically, the framework allows real-time, efficient deployment to edge devices for automated weed detecting, reducing over-reliance on herbicides and providing scalable, sustainable precision-farming options.

Abstract: Human pose forecasting predicts future poses based on past observations, and has many significant applications in areas such as action recognition, autonomous driving or human-robot interaction. This paper evaluates a wide range of pose forecasting algorithms in the task of absolute pose forecasting, revealing many reproducibility issues, and provides a unified training and evaluation pipeline. After drawing a high-level analogy to the task of speech understanding, it is shown that recent speech models can be efficiently adapted to the task of pose forecasting, and improve current state-of-the-art performance. At last the robustness of the models is evaluated, using noisy joint coordinates obtained from a pose estimator model, to reflect a realistic type of noise, which is more close to real-world applications. For this a new dataset variation is introduced, and it is shown that estimated poses result in a substantial performance degradation, and how much of it can be recovered again by unsupervised finetuning.

Conclusion: 该论文通过引入AUI-Gym基准和Coder-CUA协作框架，将GUI设计从以人为中心转向以代理为中心，提升了任务可解性和导航成功率。

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUA) are becoming increasingly capable of autonomously operating digital environments through Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). Yet, most GUI remain designed primarily for humans--prioritizing aesthetics and usability--forcing agents to adopt human-oriented behaviors that are unnecessary for efficient task execution. At the same time, rapid advances in coding-oriented language models (Coder) have transformed automatic GUI design. This raises a fundamental question: Can CUA as judges to assist Coder for automatic GUI design? To investigate, we introduce AUI-Gym, a benchmark for Automatic GUI development spanning 52 applications across diverse domains. Using language models, we synthesize 1560 tasks that simulate real-world scenarios. To ensure task reliability, we further develop a verifier that programmatically checks whether each task is executable within its environment. Building on this, we propose a Coder-CUA in Collaboration framework: the Coder acts as Designer, generating and revising websites, while the CUA serves as Judge, evaluating functionality and refining designs. Success is measured not by visual appearance, but by task solvability and CUA navigation success rate. To turn CUA feedback into usable guidance, we design a CUA Dashboard that compresses multi-step navigation histories into concise visual summaries, offering interpretable guidance for iterative redesign. By positioning agents as both designers and judges, our framework shifts interface design toward agent-native efficiency and reliability. Our work takes a step toward shifting agents from passive use toward active participation in digital environments. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/showlab/AUI.

Abstract: Recent AI-generated image (AIGI) detectors achieve impressive accuracy under clean condition. In view of antiforensics, it is significant to develop advanced adversarial attacks for evaluating the security of such detectors, which remains unexplored sufficiently. This letter proposes a Dual-domain Feature Importance Attack (DuFIA) scheme to invalidate AIGI detectors to some extent. Forensically important features are captured by the spatially interpolated gradient and frequency-aware perturbation. The adversarial transferability is enhanced by jointly modeling spatial and frequency-domain feature importances, which are fused to guide the optimization-based adversarial example generation. Extensive experiments across various AIGI detectors verify the cross-model transferability, transparency and robustness of DuFIA.

Motivation: 理解ViT特征蒸馏失败的原因，并设计有效的方法来提升其性能。

Method: 采用层级的奇异值分解（SVD）和token级的光谱能量模式（SEP）分析，提出了两种策略：后特征提升和原生宽度对齐。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上，DeiT-Tiny的准确率从74.86%提升至77.53%和78.23%，同时独立训练的学生的性能也有所提高。

Conclusion: 通过分析ViT的特征蒸馏失败原因，并利用低秩结构提出了两种有效的、可解释的解决方案，为紧凑型ViT的设计提供了具体指导。

Abstract: Feature-map knowledge distillation (KD) is highly effective for convolutional networks but often fails for Vision Transformers (ViTs). To understand this failure and guide method design, we conduct a two-view representation analysis of ViTs. First, a layer-wise Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of full feature matrices shows that final-layer representations are globally low-rank: for CaiT-S24, only $121/61/34/14$ dimensions suffice to capture $99\%/95\%/90\%/80\%$ of the energy. In principle, this suggests that a compact student plus a simple linear projector should be enough for feature alignment, contradicting the weak empirical performance of standard feature KD. To resolve this paradox, we introduce a token-level Spectral Energy Pattern (SEP) analysis that measures how each token uses channel capacity. SEP reveals that, despite the global low-rank structure, individual tokens distribute energy over most channels, forming a high-bandwidth encoding pattern. This results in an encoding mismatch between wide teachers and narrow students. Motivated by this insight, we propose two minimal, mismatch-driven strategies: (1) post-hoc feature lifting with a lightweight projector retained during inference, or (2) native width alignment that widens only the student's last block to the teacher's width. On ImageNet-1K, these strategies reactivate simple feature-map distillation in ViTs, raising DeiT-Tiny accuracy from $74.86\%$ to $77.53\%$ and $78.23\%$ when distilling from CaiT-S24, while also improving standalone students trained without any teacher. Our analysis thus explains why ViT feature distillation fails and shows how exploiting low-rank structure yields effective, interpretable remedies and concrete design guidance for compact ViTs.

Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of video content, effectively understanding and answering questions about long form videos has become essential for numerous applications. Although large vision language models (LVLMs) have enhanced performance, they often face challenges with nuanced queries that demand both a comprehensive understanding and detailed analysis. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce AVATAAR, a modular and interpretable framework that combines global and local video context, along with a Pre Retrieval Thinking Agent and a Rethink Module. AVATAAR creates a persistent global summary and establishes a feedback loop between the Rethink Module and the Pre Retrieval Thinking Agent, allowing the system to refine its retrieval strategies based on partial answers and replicate human-like iterative reasoning. On the CinePile benchmark, AVATAAR demonstrates significant improvements over a baseline, achieving relative gains of +5.6% in temporal reasoning, +5% in technical queries, +8% in theme-based questions, and +8.2% in narrative comprehension. Our experiments confirm that each module contributes positively to the overall performance, with the feedback loop being crucial for adaptability. These findings highlight AVATAAR's effectiveness in enhancing video understanding capabilities. Ultimately, AVATAAR presents a scalable solution for long-form Video Question Answering (QA), merging accuracy, interpretability, and extensibility.

Abstract: LiDAR place recognition plays a crucial role in SLAM, robot navigation, and autonomous driving. However, existing LiDAR place recognition methods often struggle to adapt to new environments without forgetting previously learned knowledge, a challenge widely known as catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, we propose KDF+, a novel continual learning framework for LiDAR place recognition that extends the KDF paradigm with a loss-aware sampling strategy and a rehearsal enhancement mechanism. The proposed sampling strategy estimates the learning difficulty of each sample via its loss value and selects samples for replay according to their estimated difficulty. Harder samples, which tend to encode more discriminative information, are sampled with higher probability while maintaining distributional coverage across the dataset. In addition, the rehearsal enhancement mechanism encourages memory samples to be further refined during new-task training by slightly reducing their loss relative to previous tasks, thereby reinforcing long-term knowledge retention. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KDF+ consistently outperforms existing continual learning methods and can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art continual learning for LiDAR place recognition frameworks to yield significant and stable performance gains. The code will be available at https://github.com/repo/KDF-plus.

Abstract: Ultrasound offers a radiation-free, cost-effective solution for real-time visualization of spinal landmarks, paraspinal soft tissues and neurovascular structures, making it valuable for intraoperative guidance during spinal procedures. However, ultrasound suffers from inherent limitations in visualizing complete vertebral anatomy, in particular vertebral bodies, due to acoustic shadowing effects caused by bone. In this work, we present a novel multi-modal deep learning method for completing occluded anatomical structures in 3D ultrasound by leveraging complementary information from a single X-ray image. To enable training, we generate paired training data consisting of: (1) 2D lateral vertebral views that simulate X-ray scans, and (2) 3D partial vertebrae representations that mimic the limited visibility and occlusions encountered during ultrasound spine imaging. Our method integrates morphological information from both imaging modalities and demonstrates significant improvements in vertebral reconstruction (p < 0.001) compared to state of art in 3D ultrasound vertebral completion. We perform phantom studies as an initial step to future clinical translation, and achieve a more accurate, complete volumetric lumbar spine visualization overlayed on the ultrasound scan without the need for registration with preoperative modalities such as computed tomography. This demonstrates that integrating a single X-ray projection mitigates ultrasound's key limitation while preserving its strengths as the primary imaging modality.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation typically adopts a point-wise convolutional segmentation head to predict dense labels, where each output channel is heuristically tied to a specific class. This rigid design limits both feature sharing and semantic generalization. In this work, we propose a unified decoupled segmentation head that separates multi-class prediction into class-agnostic mask prediction and class label prediction using shared object queries. Furthermore, we introduce a Full-Scale Aware Deformable Transformer module that enables low-resolution encoder features to attend across full-resolution encoder features via deformable attention, achieving memory-efficient and spatially aligned full-scale fusion. Our proposed method, named MaskMed, achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing nnUNet by +2.0% Dice on AMOS 2022 and +6.9% Dice on BTCV.

Abstract: Test-time thinking (that is, generating explicit intermediate reasoning chains) is known to boost performance in large language models and has recently shown strong gains for large vision language models (LVLMs). However, despite these promising results, there is still no systematic analysis of how thinking actually affects visual reasoning. We provide the first such analysis with a large scale, controlled comparison of thinking for LVLMs, evaluating ten variants from the InternVL3.5 and Qwen3-VL families on MMMU-val under generous token budgets and multi pass decoding. We show that more thinking is not always better; long chains often yield long wrong trajectories that ignore the image and underperform the same models run in standard instruct mode. A deeper analysis reveals that certain short lookback phrases, which explicitly refer back to the image, are strongly enriched in successful trajectories and correlate with better visual grounding. Building on this insight, we propose uncertainty guided lookback, a training free decoding strategy that combines an uncertainty signal with adaptive lookback prompts and breadth search. Our method improves overall MMMU performance, delivers the largest gains in categories where standard thinking is weak, and outperforms several strong decoding baselines, setting a new state of the art under fixed model families and token budgets. We further show that this decoding strategy generalizes, yielding consistent improvements on five additional benchmarks, including two broad multimodal suites and math focused visual reasoning datasets.

Conclusion: FlashMesh通过利用网格数据的结构先验，系统地加速和提升了自回归生成的质量，展示了在交互式和大规模应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Autoregressive models can generate high-quality 3D meshes by sequentially producing vertices and faces, but their token-by-token decoding results in slow inference, limiting practical use in interactive and large-scale applications. We present FlashMesh, a fast and high-fidelity mesh generation framework that rethinks autoregressive decoding through a predict-correct-verify paradigm. The key insight is that mesh tokens exhibit strong structural and geometric correlations that enable confident multi-token speculation. FlashMesh leverages this by introducing a speculative decoding scheme tailored to the commonly used hourglass transformer architecture, enabling parallel prediction across face, point, and coordinate levels. Extensive experiments show that FlashMesh achieves up to a 2 x speedup over standard autoregressive models while also improving generation fidelity. Our results demonstrate that structural priors in mesh data can be systematically harnessed to accelerate and enhance autoregressive generation.

Motivation: 现实世界中的视觉和语言概念具有内在层次性，但现有的基于CLIP的CIL方法未能明确捕捉这种层次性，导致细粒度类别特征漂移和灾难性遗忘。

Method: HASTEN采用外部知识图谱作为监督，将视觉和文本特征嵌入双曲空间，并在共享双曲映射器的零空间上投影梯度，防止对先前任务的干扰。

Conclusion: HASTEN通过将层次信息锚定到CIL中，有效减少了灾难性遗忘，并在实验中表现优于现有方法，提供了统一的结构化表示。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) enables models to learn new classes continually while preserving past knowledge. Recently, vision-language models like CLIP offer transferable features via multi-modal pre-training, making them well-suited for CIL. However, real-world visual and linguistic concepts are inherently hierarchical: a textual concept like "dog" subsumes fine-grained categories such as "Labrador" and "Golden Retriever," and each category entails its images. But existing CLIP-based CIL methods fail to explicitly capture this inherent hierarchy, leading to fine-grained class features drift during incremental updates and ultimately to catastrophic forgetting. To address this challenge, we propose HASTEN (Hierarchical Semantic Tree Anchoring) that anchors hierarchical information into CIL to reduce catastrophic forgetting. First, we employ an external knowledge graph as supervision to embed visual and textual features in hyperbolic space, effectively preserving hierarchical structure as data evolves. Second, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we project gradients onto the null space of the shared hyperbolic mapper, preventing interference with prior tasks. These two steps work synergistically to enable the model to resist forgetting by maintaining hierarchical relationships. Extensive experiments show that HASTEN consistently outperforms existing methods while providing a unified structured representation.

TL;DR: MUSSE-Net通过深度学习提升超声应变弹性成像的稳健性，解决了噪声和一致性难题，临床验证表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超声应变弹性成像中组织去相关噪声、缺乏真实数据及不同变形条件下应变估计不一致的问题。

Method: 提出MUSSE-Net，一种基于残差感知的多阶段无监督序列深度学习框架，包含USSE-Net（多流编码器-解码器架构）和CACFF编码器、TCA瓶颈及CAF解码器，结合一致性损失和残差细化阶段。

Result: 在仿真和临床数据上，MUSSE-Net在SNR、CNR等指标上优于现有无监督方法，尤其在BUET数据集上表现出更好的病灶对比度和噪声抑制。

Conclusion: MUSSE-Net框架通过多阶段无监督深度学习显著提升了超声应变弹性成像的准确性和一致性，尤其在临床数据集上表现出色，提供了可解释的应变模式。

Abstract: Ultrasound Strain Elastography (USE) is a powerful non-invasive imaging technique for assessing tissue mechanical properties, offering crucial diagnostic value across diverse clinical applications. However, its clinical application remains limited by tissue decorrelation noise, scarcity of ground truth, and inconsistent strain estimation under different deformation conditions. Overcoming these barriers, we propose MUSSE-Net, a residual-aware, multi-stage unsupervised sequential deep learning framework designed for robust and consistent strain estimation. At its backbone lies our proposed USSE-Net, an end-to-end multi-stream encoder-decoder architecture that parallelly processes pre- and post-deformation RF sequences to estimate displacement fields and axial strains. The novel architecture incorporates Context-Aware Complementary Feature Fusion (CACFF)-based encoder with Tri-Cross Attention (TCA) bottleneck with a Cross-Attentive Fusion (CAF)-based sequential decoder. To ensure temporal coherence and strain stability across varying deformation levels, this architecture leverages a tailored consistency loss. Finally, with the MUSSE-Net framework, a secondary residual refinement stage further enhances accuracy and suppresses noise. Extensive validation on simulation, in vivo, and private clinical datasets from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) medical center, demonstrates MUSSE-Net's outperformed existing unsupervised approaches. On MUSSE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with a target SNR of 24.54, background SNR of 132.76, CNR of 59.81, and elastographic SNR of 9.73 on simulation data. In particular, on the BUET dataset, MUSSE-Net produces strain maps with enhanced lesion-to-background contrast and significant noise suppression yielding clinically interpretable strain patterns.

Motivation: 大型社区科学平台（如iNaturalist）包含数亿张生物多样性图像，但传统方法无法充分利用这些图像中的生态背景信息（如行为、互动、物候、栖息地）。

Method: INQUIRE-Search是一个开源系统，允许科学家使用自然语言在生态图像数据库中快速交互搜索特定概念，验证并导出相关观察数据，用于新的科学分析。

Result: 通过五个案例研究，展示了INQUIRE-Search支持的多样化科学应用，如跨物种行为的季节性变化和野火后森林再生。与传统方法相比，INQUIRE-Search显著提高了效率。

Abstract: Large community science platforms such as iNaturalist contain hundreds of millions of biodiversity images that often capture ecological context on behaviors, interactions, phenology, and habitat. Yet most ecological workflows rely on metadata filtering or manual inspection, leaving this secondary information inaccessible at scale. We introduce INQUIRE-Search, an open-source system that enables scientists to rapidly and interactively search within an ecological image database for specific concepts using natural language, verify and export relevant observations, and utilize this discovered data for novel scientific analysis. Compared to traditional methods, INQUIRE-Search takes a fraction of the time, opening up new possibilities for scientific questions that can be explored. Through five case studies, we show the diversity of scientific applications that a tool like INQUIRE-Search can support, from seasonal variation in behavior across species to forest regrowth after wildfires. These examples demonstrate a new paradigm for interactive, efficient, and scalable scientific discovery that can begin to unlock previously inaccessible scientific value in large-scale biodiversity datasets. Finally, we emphasize using such AI-enabled discovery tools for science call for experts to reframe the priorities of the scientific process and develop novel methods for experiment design, data collection, survey effort, and uncertainty analysis.

*Yushi Huang,Zining Wang,Zhihang Yuan,Yifu Ding,Ruihao Gong,Jinyang Guo,Xianglong Liu,Jun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoDES is a training-free framework that efficiently skips experts in MoE MLLMs, improving performance and speed by addressing modality-specific and layer-wise expert contributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing expert skipping methods, designed for unimodal LLMs, degrade performance when applied to MLLMs due to their failure to account for heterogeneous expert contributions and modality-specific token behaviors.

Method: MoDES incorporates a globally-modulated local gating (GMLG) mechanism and a dual-modality thresholding (DMT) method, along with a frontier search algorithm for optimal threshold setting.

Result: MoDES improves performance by up to 10.67% and enhances inference speed, with prefilling time improved by 2.16× and decoding time by 1.26×.

Conclusion: MoDES significantly enhances both the efficiency and accuracy of MoE MLLMs, outperforming previous methods by a large margin.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at vision-language tasks, but they suffer from high computational inefficiency. To reduce inference overhead, expert skipping methods have been proposed to deactivate redundant experts based on the current input tokens. However, we find that applying these methods-originally designed for unimodal large language models (LLMs)-to MLLMs results in considerable performance degradation. This is primarily because such methods fail to account for the heterogeneous contributions of experts across MoE layers and modality-specific behaviors of tokens within these layers. Motivated by these findings, we propose MoDES, the first training-free framework that adaptively skips experts to enable efficient and accurate MoE MLLM inference. It incorporates a globally-modulated local gating (GMLG) mechanism that integrates global layer-wise importance into local routing probabilities to accurately estimate per-token expert importance. A dual-modality thresholding (DMT) method is then applied, which processes tokens from each modality separately, to derive the skipping schedule. To set the optimal thresholds, we introduce a frontier search algorithm that exploits monotonicity properties, cutting convergence time from several days to a few hours. Extensive experiments for 3 model series across 13 benchmarks demonstrate that MoDES far outperforms previous approaches. For instance, when skipping 88% experts for Qwen3-VL-MoE-30B-A3B-Instruct, the performance boost is up to 10.67% (97.33% vs. 86.66%). Furthermore, MoDES significantly enhances inference speed, improving the prefilling time by 2.16$\times$ and the decoding time by 1.26$\times$.

Abstract: This paper introduces SS-MixNet, a lightweight and effective deep learning model for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. The architecture integrates 3D convolutional layers for local spectral-spatial feature extraction with two parallel MLP-style mixer blocks that capture long-range dependencies in spectral and spatial dimensions. A depthwise convolution-based attention mechanism is employed to enhance discriminative capability with minimal computational overhead. The model is evaluated on the QUH-Tangdaowan and QUH-Qingyun datasets using only 1% of labeled data for training and validation. SS-MixNet achieves the highest performance among compared methods, including 2D-CNN, 3D-CNN, IP-SWIN, SimPoolFormer, and HybridKAN, reaching 95.68% and 93.86% overall accuracy on the Tangdaowan and Qingyun datasets, respectively. The results, supported by quantitative metrics and classification maps, confirm the model's effectiveness in delivering accurate and robust predictions with limited supervision.

Motivation: 传统观点将视频生成的第一帧视为时空起点，本研究挑战这一观点，探索第一帧作为记忆缓冲区的潜在功能及其在视频定制中的应用。

Method: 通过分析视频生成模型对第一帧的处理方式，揭示了其作为记忆缓冲区的功能，并利用这一发现进行视频内容定制。

Result: 研究表明，仅需20-50个训练样本即可实现多样场景下的鲁棒视频内容定制，揭示了视频生成模型在参考定制方面的强大潜力。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了视频生成模型中第一帧作为概念性记忆缓冲区的角色，展示了其在无需大规模微调或架构改动的情况下，仅需少量训练样本即可实现视频内容定制的能力。

Abstract: What role does the first frame play in video generation models? Traditionally, it's viewed as the spatial-temporal starting point of a video, merely a seed for subsequent animation. In this work, we reveal a fundamentally different perspective: video models implicitly treat the first frame as a conceptual memory buffer that stores visual entities for later reuse during generation. Leveraging this insight, we show that it's possible to achieve robust and generalized video content customization in diverse scenarios, using only 20-50 training examples without architectural changes or large-scale finetuning. This unveils a powerful, overlooked capability of video generation models for reference-based video customization.

Motivation: 现有地理定位基准无法满足高分辨率图像和深度代理推理的需求，因此构建GeoBench，并开发GeoVista模型以填补通用代理模型的空白。

Method: 提出GeoVista代理模型，整合图像放大和网络搜索工具，采用冷启动监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）两阶段训练流程，并利用分层奖励优化地理定位性能。

Result: GeoVista在地理定位任务中显著优于其他开源代理模型，性能接近闭源模型。

Conclusion: GeoVista在GeoBench上的表现优于其他开源代理模型，并在大多数指标上与闭源模型如Gemini-2.5-flash和GPT-5相当。

Abstract: Current research on agentic visual reasoning enables deep multimodal understanding but primarily focuses on image manipulation tools, leaving a gap toward more general-purpose agentic models. In this work, we revisit the geolocalization task, which requires not only nuanced visual grounding but also web search to confirm or refine hypotheses during reasoning. Since existing geolocalization benchmarks fail to meet the need for high-resolution imagery and the localization challenge for deep agentic reasoning, we curate GeoBench, a benchmark that includes photos and panoramas from around the world, along with a subset of satellite images of different cities to rigorously evaluate the geolocalization ability of agentic models. We also propose GeoVista, an agentic model that seamlessly integrates tool invocation within the reasoning loop, including an image-zoom-in tool to magnify regions of interest and a web-search tool to retrieve related web information. We develop a complete training pipeline for it, including a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage to learn reasoning patterns and tool-use priors, followed by a reinforcement learning (RL) stage to further enhance reasoning ability. We adopt a hierarchical reward to leverage multi-level geographical information and improve overall geolocalization performance. Experimental results show that GeoVista surpasses other open-source agentic models on the geolocalization task greatly and achieves performance comparable to closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-flash and GPT-5 on most metrics.

Result: 新模型在解决复杂匹配任务上表现优异，训练速度更快，内存使用更高效。

Conclusion: 新型匹配器在广泛的实验中展现出比前代产品更高的准确性，设定了新的技术标准。

Abstract: Dense feature matching aims to estimate all correspondences between two images of a 3D scene and has recently been established as the gold-standard due to its high accuracy and robustness. However, existing dense matchers still fail or perform poorly for many hard real-world scenarios, and high-precision models are often slow, limiting their applicability. In this paper, we attack these weaknesses on a wide front through a series of systematic improvements that together yield a significantly better model. In particular, we construct a novel matching architecture and loss, which, combined with a curated diverse training distribution, enables our model to solve many complex matching tasks. We further make training faster through a decoupled two-stage matching-then-refinement pipeline, and at the same time, significantly reduce refinement memory usage through a custom CUDA kernel. Finally, we leverage the recent DINOv3 foundation model along with multiple other insights to make the model more robust and unbiased. In our extensive set of experiments we show that the resulting novel matcher sets a new state-of-the-art, being significantly more accurate than its predecessors.

TL;DR: PolyKAN是一个GPU加速的KAN实现库，通过优化CUDA内核显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KAN的并行实现GPU利用率低，阻碍了其在实际应用中的采用。

Method: 设计了四个正交技术：查找表与线性插值、2D平铺、两阶段归约方案和系数布局重排序，以优化CUDA内核。

Result: PolyKAN在高端和消费级GPU上，比Triton + cuBLAS基线实现了1.2-10倍的推理加速和1.4-12倍的训练加速。

Conclusion: PolyKAN通过优化CUDA内核显著提升了KAN及其变体的GPU利用率，实现了比现有基线更快的推理和训练速度，同时保持相同的准确性。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) promise higher expressive capability and stronger interpretability than Multi-Layer Perceptron, particularly in the domain of AI for Science. However, practical adoption has been hindered by low GPU utilization of existing parallel implementations. To address this challenge, we present a GPU-accelerated operator library, named PolyKAN which is the first general open-source implementation of KAN and its variants. PolyKAN fuses the forward and backward passes of polynomial KAN layers into a concise set of optimized CUDA kernels. Four orthogonal techniques underpin the design: (i) \emph{lookup-table} with linear interpolation that replaces runtime expensive math-library functions; (ii) \emph{2D tiling} to expose thread-level parallelism with preserving memory locality; (iii) a \emph{two-stage reduction} scheme converting scattered atomic updates into a single controllable merge step; and (iv) \emph{coefficient-layout reordering} yielding unit-stride reads under the tiled schedule. Using a KAN variant, Chebyshev KAN, as a case-study, PolyKAN delivers $1.2$--$10\times$ faster inference and $1.4$--$12\times$ faster training than a Triton + cuBLAS baseline, with identical accuracy on speech, audio-enhancement, and tabular-regression workloads on both highend GPU and consumer-grade GPU.

Result: 在解决美国西部混合整数容量扩展模型时，使用RemoteOptiGraph和Benders分解比未分解方法快7.5倍。

Conclusion: RemoteOptiGraph提供了一种在分布式内存环境中建模和解决优化问题的统一方法，显著提升了大规模问题的求解效率。

Abstract: We present a general, flexible modeling abstraction for building and working with distributed optimization problems called a RemoteOptiGraph. This abstraction extends the OptiGraph model in Plasmo$.$jl, where optimization problems are represented as hypergraphs with nodes that define modular subproblems (variables, constraints, and objectives) and edges that encode algebraic linking constraints between nodes. The RemoteOptiGraph allows OptiGraphs to be utilized in distributed memory environments through InterWorkerEdges, which manage linking constraints that span workers. This abstraction offers a unified approach for modeling optimization problems on distributed memory systems (avoiding bespoke modeling approaches), and provides a basis for developing general-purpose meta-algorithms that can exploit distributed memory structure such as Benders or Lagrangian decompositions. We implement this abstraction in the open-source package, Plasmo$.$jl and we illustrate how it can be used by solving a mixed integer capacity expansion model for the western United States containing over 12 million variables and constraints. The RemoteOptiGraph abstraction together with Benders decomposition performs 7.5 times faster than solving the same problem without decomposition.

TL;DR: NCCL 2.28的GIN功能通过设备端发起的通信优化了MoE架构的GPU间通信，结合低延迟与NCCL的统一运行环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI工作负载（尤其是MoE架构）需要低延迟、细粒度的GPU间通信，传统主机端发起的通信模式（CPU协调）难以满足需求。

Method: GIN采用三层架构设计：1）NCCL Core主机端API用于设备通信器设置和集体内存窗口注册；2）设备端API支持从CUDA内核调用远程内存操作；3）网络插件架构支持GPUDirect Async Kernel-Initiated和Proxy两种语义，广泛兼容硬件。

Result: GIN通过集成DeepEP（MoE通信库）展示了实用性，基准测试表明其设备端发起通信在NCCL统一运行时中实现了低延迟操作，并兼容集体算法和生产基础设施。

Conclusion: GIN（GPU-Initiated Networking）在NCCL 2.28中引入了设备端发起的通信功能，显著提升了MoE架构中计算与通信的紧密集成效率，同时保持了NCCL的统一运行环境和生产基础设施。

Abstract: Modern AI workloads, especially Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, increasingly demand low-latency, fine-grained GPU-to-GPU communication with device-side control. Traditional GPU communication follows a host-initiated model, where the CPU orchestrates all communication operations - a characteristic of the CUDA runtime. Although robust for collective operations, applications requiring tight integration of computation and communication can benefit from device-initiated communication that eliminates CPU coordination overhead.
  NCCL 2.28 introduces the Device API with three operation modes: Load/Store Accessible (LSA) for NVLink/PCIe, Multimem for NVLink SHARP, and GPU-Initiated Networking (GIN) for network RDMA. This paper presents the GIN architecture, design, semantics, and highlights its impact on MoE communication. GIN builds on a three-layer architecture: i) NCCL Core host-side APIs for device communicator setup and collective memory window registration; ii) Device-side APIs for remote memory operations callable from CUDA kernels; and iii) A network plugin architecture with dual semantics (GPUDirect Async Kernel-Initiated and Proxy) for broad hardware support. The GPUDirect Async Kernel-Initiated backend leverages DOCA GPUNetIO for direct GPU-to-NIC communication, while the Proxy backend provides equivalent functionality via lock-free GPU-to-CPU queues over standard RDMA networks. We demonstrate GIN's practicality through integration with DeepEP, an MoE communication library. Comprehensive benchmarking shows that GIN provides device-initiated communication within NCCL's unified runtime, combining low-latency operations with NCCL's collective algorithms and production infrastructure.

TL;DR: BlueBottle通过双层架构（BB-Core和BB-Guard）解决了区块链共识的三难问题，实现了高吞吐量和亚秒级最终性，同时保持安全性和活跃性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区块链共识面临安全性、延迟和去中心化的三难问题，高吞吐量系统往往需要牺牲去中心化或对强对手的鲁棒性，而高度去中心化和安全的系统性能较低。

Method: 提出了BlueBottle，一个双层共识架构，包括核心层BB-Core（n=5f+1协议）和守护层BB-Guard（提供去中心化时间戳、主动错误检测和同步恢复路径）。

Result: 实验显示，BB-Core相比Mysticeti降低了20-25%的延迟；BB-Guard能容忍核心层最多f<3n/5的故障节点，并在检测到错误时采取恢复措施。

Conclusion: BlueBottle的两层共识架构（BB-Core和BB-Guard）在保持高吞吐量的同时，实现了乐观的亚秒级最终性，并在轻度同步假设下维持了强大的安全性和活跃性。

Abstract: Blockchain consensus faces a trilemma of security, latency, and decentralization. High-throughput systems often require a reduction in decentralization or robustness against strong adversaries, while highly decentralized and secure systems tend to have lower performance. We present BlueBottle, a two-layer consensus architecture. The core layer, BB-Core, is an n=5f+1 protocol that trades some fault tolerance for a much lower finality latency with a medium-sized core validator set. Our experiments show that BB-Core reduces latency by 20-25% in comparison to Mysticeti. The guard layer, BB-Guard, provides decentralized timestamping, proactive misbehavior detection in BB-Core, and a synchronous recovery path. When it observes equivocations or liveness failures in the core -- while tolerating up to f<3n/5 faulty nodes in the primary layer -- guard validators disseminate evidence, agree on misbehaving parties for exclusion or slashing, and either restart the core protocol (for liveness violations) or select a canonical fork (for safety violations). Together, these layers enable optimistic sub-second finality at high throughput while maintaining strong safety and liveness under a mild synchrony assumption.

Abstract: Blockchain technologies underpin an expanding ecosystem of decentralized applications, financial systems, and infrastructure. However, the fundamental networking layer that sustains these systems, the peer-to-peer layer, of all but the top few ecosystems remains largely opaque. In this paper, we present the first longitudinal, cross-network measurement study of 36 public blockchain networks. Over 9 months, we deployed 15 active crawlers, sourced data from two additional community crawlers, and conducted hourly connectivity probes to observe the evolving state of these networks. Furthermore, by leveraging Ethereum's discovery protocols, we inferred metadata for an additional 19 auxiliary networks that utilize the Ethereum peer discovery protocol. We also explored Internet-wide scans, which only require probing each protocol's default ports with a simple, network-specific payload. This approach allows us to rapidly identify responsive peers across the entire address space without having to implement custom discovery and handshake logic for every blockchain. We validated this method on Bitcoin and similar networks with known ground truth, then applied it to Cardano, which we could not crawl directly.
  Our study uncovers dramatic variation in network size from under 10 to more than 10,000 active nodes. We quantify trends in IPv4 versus IPv6 usage, analyze autonomous systems and geographic concentration, and characterize churn, diurnal behavior, and the coverage and redundancy of discovery protocols. These findings expose critical differences in network resilience, decentralization, and observability. Beyond characterizing each network, our methodology demonstrates a general framework for measuring decentralized networks at scale. This opens the door for continued monitoring, benchmarking, and more transparent assessments of blockchain infrastructure across diverse ecosystems.

Conclusion: 该论文得出结论，比特币交易的确认最终性与交易金额和用户风险容忍度密切相关，通过分析不同网络延迟下的分叉情况，建立了区块深度与因分叉导致的确认撤销概率之间的关系。

Abstract: We study financial transaction confirmation finality in Bitcoin as a function of transaction amount and user risk tolerance. A transaction is recorded in a block on a blockchain. However, a transaction may be revoked due to a fork in the blockchain, the odds of which decrease over time but never reach zero. Therefore, a transaction is considered confirmed if its block is sufficiently deep in the blockchain. This depth is usually set empirically at some fixed number such as six blocks. We analyze forks under varying network delays in simulation and actual Bitcoin data. Based on this analysis, we establish a relationship between block depth and the probability of confirmation revocation due to a fork. We use prospect theory to relate transaction confirmation probability to transaction amount and user risk tolerance.

In this framework, nodes are assigned labels, called certificates, which are supposed to prove that the property holds. The nodes then communicate with their neighbors to verify the correctness of these certificates.
  Certifying that there is a unique leader in a network is one of the most classical problems in this setting. It is well-known that this can be done using certificates that encode node identifiers and distances in the graph. These require $O(\log n)$ and $O(\log D)$ bits respectively, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $D$ is the diameter. A matching lower bound is known in cycle graphs (where $n$ and $D$ are equal up to multiplicative constants).
  A recent line of work has shown that network structure greatly influences local certification. For example, certifying that a network does not contain triangles takes $Θ(n)$ bits in general graphs, but only $O(\log n)$ bits in graphs of bounded treewidth. This observation raises the question: Is it possible to achieve sublogarithmic leader certification in graph classes that do not contain cycle graphs? And since in that case we cannot write identifiers in a certificate, do we actually need identifiers at all in such topologies? [We answer these questions with results on small diameter graphs, chordal graphs, grids, and dense graphs. See full abstract in the paper.]

Abstract: We present a physics-based fluid control method utilizing localized spacetime windows, extending force-based spacetime control to simulation scales that were previously intractable. Building on the observation that optimal control force distributions are often localized, we show that operating only in a localized spacetime window around the edit of interest can improve performance. To determine the optimal spacetime window size, we employ the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) method to search for the optimal temporal window size within a user-defined spatial region. Instead of using a Lagrangian representation, we optimize and apply control forces on a "floating" background grid, decoupling the control dimensionality from the simulation and enabling seamless integration with particle-based methods. Moreover, since the boundary conditions of the localized areas are encoded in the objective function, no extra effort is required to ensure consistency between the local control region and the global simulation domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method with various 2D and 3D particle-based free-surface simulation examples.

Conclusion: 几何代数（GA）为计算机图形学（CG）和扩展现实（XR）领域提供了一种统一且高效的数学框架，显著提升了视觉质量和计算效率。

Abstract: This position paper delves into the transformative role of Geometric Algebra (GA) in advancing specific areas of Computer Graphics (CG) and Extended Reality (XR), particularly in character animation, rendering, rigging, neural rendering, and generative AI-driven scene editing. Common CG algorithms require handling rotations, translations, and dilations (uniform scalings) in operations such as object rendering, rigged model animation, soft-body deformation, and XR simulations. Traditional representation forms - such as matrices, quaternions, and vectors - often introduce limitations in precision and performance. Recent breakthroughs in the use of GA suggest it can significantly enhance these processes by encapsulating geometric forms and transformations into uniform algebraic expressions, which maintain critical geometric properties throughout multi-step transformations. Furthermore, we explore how GA can serve as a unifying mathematical substrate for neurosymbolic XR scene authoring, bridging learned neural representations and explicit geometric reasoning. This paper outlines how GA-based approaches can improve the fidelity of rigged character animations, enhance soft-body simulations, streamline real-time rendering, and optimize neural and generative AI scene editing. GA offers a coherent and efficient framework for these processes, resulting in superior visual outcomes and computational efficiency, particularly in XR environments.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的V2X辅助多智能体强化学习框架显著提高了匝道合并的成功率、交通效率和道路安全性。

Abstract: Ramp merging is a critical and challenging task for autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in mixed traffic environments with human-driven vehicles (HVs). Existing approaches typically rely on either lane-changing or inter-vehicle gap creation strategies based solely on local or neighboring information, often leading to suboptimal performance in terms of safety and traffic efficiency. In this paper, we present a V2X (vehicle-to-everything communication)-assisted Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework for on-ramp merging that effectively coordinates the complex interplay between lane-changing and inter-vehicle gap adaptation strategies by utilizing zone-specific global information available from a roadside unit (RSU). The merging control problem is formulated as a Multiagent Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (MA-POMDP), where agents leverage both local and global observations through V2X communication. To support both discrete and continuous control decisions, we design a hybrid action space and adopt a parameterized deep Q-learning approach. Extensive simulations, integrating the SUMO traffic simulator and the MOSAIC V2X simulator, demonstrate that our framework significantly improves merging success rate, traffic efficiency, and road safety across diverse traffic scenarios.

Abstract: Odometry with lidar sensors is a state-of-the-art method to estimate the ego pose of a moving vehicle. Many implementations of lidar odometry use variants of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. Real-world effects such as dynamic objects, non-overlapping areas, and sensor noise diminish the accuracy of ICP. We build on a recently proposed method that makes these effects visible by visualizing the multidimensional objective function of ICP in two dimensions. We use this method to study different ICP variants in the context of lidar odometry. In addition, we propose a novel method to filter out dynamic objects and to address the ego blind spot problem.

Conclusion: SVBRD-LLM框架通过零样本提示工程自动发现、验证和应用可解释的行为规则，显著提升了自动驾驶车辆识别的准确性和F1分数，揭示了自动驾驶车辆在速度控制、变道保守性和加速稳定性方面的独特特征。

Abstract: As more autonomous vehicles operate on public roads, understanding real-world behavior of autonomous vehicles is critical to analyzing traffic safety, making policies, and public acceptance. This paper proposes SVBRD-LLM, a framework that automatically discovers, verifies, and applies interpretable behavioral rules from real traffic videos through zero-shot prompt engineering. The framework extracts vehicle trajectories using YOLOv8 and ByteTrack, computes kinematic features, and employs GPT-5 zero-shot prompting to compare autonomous and human-driven vehicles, generating 35 structured behavioral rule hypotheses. These rules are tested on a validation set, iteratively refined based on failure cases to filter spurious correlations, and compiled into a high-confidence rule library. The framework is evaluated on an independent test set for speed change prediction, lane change prediction, and autonomous vehicle identification tasks. Experiments on over 1500 hours of real traffic videos show that the framework achieves 90.0% accuracy and 93.3% F1-score in autonomous vehicle identification. The discovered rules clearly reveal distinctive characteristics of autonomous vehicles in speed control smoothness, lane change conservativeness, and acceleration stability, with each rule accompanied by semantic description, applicable context, and validation confidence.

Conclusion: CALM框架通过结合时间依赖和时间独立方法的优点，提供了一种更灵活、更鲁棒的LfD方法，适用于多种机器人任务。

Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) has shown to provide robots with fundamental motion skills for a variety of domains. Various branches of LfD research (e.g., learned dynamical systems and movement primitives) can generally be classified into ''time-dependent'' or ''time-independent'' systems. Each provides fundamental benefits and drawbacks -- time-independent methods cannot learn overlapping trajectories, while time-dependence can result in undesirable behavior under perturbation. This paper introduces Cluster Alignment for Learned Motions (CALM), an LfD framework dependent upon an alignment with a representative ''mean" trajectory of demonstrated motions rather than pure time- or state-dependence. We discuss the convergence properties of CALM, introduce an alignment technique able to handle the shifts in alignment possible under perturbation, and utilize demonstration clustering to generate multi-modal behavior. We show how CALM mitigates the drawbacks of time-dependent and time-independent techniques on 2D datasets and implement our system on a 7-DoF robot learning tasks in three domains.

Abstract: Distributed optimization offers a promising paradigm for trajectory planning in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms, yet its deployment in communication-constrained environments remains challenging due to unreliable links and limited data exchange. This paper addresses this issue via a two-tier architecture explicitly designed for operation under communication constraints. We develop a Communication-Aware Asynchronous Distributed Trajectory Optimization (CA-ADTO) framework that integrates Parameterized Differential Dynamic Programming (PDDP) for local trajectory optimization of individual UAVs with an asynchronous Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (async-ADMM) for swarm-level coordination. The proposed architecture enables fully distributed optimization while substantially reducing communication overhead, making it suitable for real-world scenarios in which reliable connectivity cannot be guaranteed. The method is particularly effective in handling nonlinear dynamics and spatio-temporal coupling under communication constraints.

Abstract: In this work we present AURA, a framework for synergistic human-artist painting. We developed a robot arm that collaboratively paints with a human artist. The robot has an awareness of the artist's heartbeat through the EmotiBit sensor, which provides the arousal levels of the painter. Given the heartbeat detected, the robot decides to increase proximity to the artist's workspace or retract. If a higher heartbeat is detected, which is associated with increased arousal in human artists, the robot will move away from that area of the canvas. If the artist's heart rate is detected as neutral, indicating the human artist's baseline state, the robot will continue its painting actions across the entire canvas. We also demonstrate and propose alternative robot-artist interactions using natural language and physical touch. This work combines the biometrics of a human artist to inform fluent artistic interactions.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation systems are increasingly deployed across diverse domains. Yet existing multi-modal learning frameworks lack inherent guarantees of geometric consistency, struggling to handle spatial transformations such as rotations and translations. While recent works attempt to introduce equivariance through bespoke architectural modifications, these methods suffer from high implementation complexity, computational cost, and poor portability. Inspired by human cognitive processes in spatial reasoning, we propose Eq.Bot, a universal canonicalization framework grounded in SE(2) group equivariant theory for robotic manipulation learning. Our framework transforms observations into a canonical space, applies an existing policy, and maps the resulting actions back to the original space. As a model-agnostic solution, Eq.Bot aims to endow models with spatial equivariance without requiring architectural modifications. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Eq.Bot under both CNN-based (e.g., CLIPort) and Transformer-based (e.g., OpenVLA-OFT) architectures over existing methods on various robotic manipulation tasks, where the most significant improvement can reach 50.0%.

Abstract: A key barrier to the real-world deployment of humanoid robots is the lack of autonomous loco-manipulation skills. We introduce VIRAL, a visual sim-to-real framework that learns humanoid loco-manipulation entirely in simulation and deploys it zero-shot to real hardware. VIRAL follows a teacher-student design: a privileged RL teacher, operating on full state, learns long-horizon loco-manipulation using a delta action space and reference state initialization. A vision-based student policy is then distilled from the teacher via large-scale simulation with tiled rendering, trained with a mixture of online DAgger and behavior cloning. We find that compute scale is critical: scaling simulation to tens of GPUs (up to 64) makes both teacher and student training reliable, while low-compute regimes often fail. To bridge the sim-to-real gap, VIRAL combines large-scale visual domain randomization over lighting, materials, camera parameters, image quality, and sensor delays--with real-to-sim alignment of the dexterous hands and cameras. Deployed on a Unitree G1 humanoid, the resulting RGB-based policy performs continuous loco-manipulation for up to 54 cycles, generalizing to diverse spatial and appearance variations without any real-world fine-tuning, and approaching expert-level teleoperation performance. Extensive ablations dissect the key design choices required to make RGB-based humanoid loco-manipulation work in practice.

Abstract: Model-based development enables quicker prototyping, earlier experimentation and validation of design intents. For a multi-agent system with complex asynchronous interactions and concurrency, formal verification, model-checking in particular, offers an automated mechanism for verifying desired properties. Timed Rebeca is an actor-based modelling language supporting reactive, concurrent and time semantics, accompanied with a model-checking compiler. These capabilities allow using Timed Rebeca to correctly model ROS2 node topographies, recurring physical signals, motion primitives and other timed and time-convertible behaviors. The biggest challenges in modelling and verifying a multi-robot system lie in abstracting complex information, bridging the gap between a discrete model and a continuous system and compacting the state space, while maintaining the model's accuracy. We develop different discretization strategies for different kinds of information, identifying the 'enough' thresholds of abstraction, and applying efficient optimization techniques to boost computations. With this work we demonstrate how to use models to design and verify a multi-robot system, how to discretely model a continuous system to do model-checking efficiently, and the round-trip engineering flow between the model and the implementation. The released Rebeca and ROS2 codes can serve as a foundation for modelling multiple autonomous robots systems.

Abstract: We address the fundamental challenge of resolving symmetry-induced deadlocks in distributed multi-agent navigation by proposing a new hierarchical navigation method. When multiple agents interact, it is inherently difficult for them to autonomously break the symmetry of deciding how to pass each other. To tackle this problem, we introduce an approach that quantifies cooperative symmetry-breaking strategies using a topological invariant called the winding number, and learns the strategies themselves through reinforcement learning. Our method features a hierarchical policy consisting of a learning-based Planner, which plans topological cooperative strategies, and a model-based Controller, which executes them. Through reinforcement learning, the Planner learns to produce two types of parameters for the Controller: one is the topological cooperative strategy represented by winding numbers, and the other is a set of dynamic weights that determine which agent interaction to prioritize in dense scenarios where multiple agents cross simultaneously. The Controller then generates collision-free and efficient motions based on the strategy and weights provided by the Planner. This hierarchical structure combines the flexible decision-making ability of learning-based methods with the reliability of model-based approaches. Simulation and real-world robot experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines, particularly in dense environments, by efficiently avoiding collisions and deadlocks while achieving superior navigation performance.

### [126] [Behavior Trees vs Executable Ontologies: a Comparative Analysis of Robot Control Paradigms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15274)
*Alexander Boldachev*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文比较了行为树（BTs）和可执行本体（EO）在机器人行为建模中的表现，发现EO通过事件驱动架构在动态系统中更具优势，支持更多高级功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨EO是否能够通过完全不同的架构（用事件驱动的状态传播替代基于轮询的tick执行）实现与BTs相当的反应性和模块化。

Method: 比较了两种建模机器人行为的方法：命令式的行为树（BTs）和声明式的可执行本体（EO），通过boldsea框架实现。BTs使用控制流构建层次化行为，而EO通过数据流规则驱动的事件语义图表示领域。

Result: EO在动态、演化的机器人系统中表现出色，支持运行时模型修改和完整的时间可追溯性，而BTs在稳定、可预测的场景中表现更优。

Conclusion: EO提供了一种替代框架，通过语义领域建模来解决传统机器人控制中的语义-过程差距，支持运行时模型修改、完整的时间可追溯性以及数据、逻辑和界面的统一表示。

Abstract: This paper compares two distinct approaches to modeling robotic behavior: imperative Behavior Trees (BTs) and declarative Executable Ontologies (EO), implemented through the boldsea framework. BTs structure behavior hierarchically using control-flow, whereas EO represents the domain as a temporal, event-based semantic graph driven by dataflow rules. We demonstrate that EO achieves comparable reactivity and modularity to BTs through a fundamentally different architecture: replacing polling-based tick execution with event-driven state propagation. We propose that EO offers an alternative framework, moving from procedural programming to semantic domain modeling, to address the semantic-process gap in traditional robotic control. EO supports runtime model modification, full temporal traceability, and a unified representation of data, logic, and interface - features that are difficult or sometimes impossible to achieve with BTs, although BTs excel in established, predictable scenarios. The comparison is grounded in a practical mobile manipulation task. This comparison highlights the respective operational strengths of each approach in dynamic, evolving robotic systems.

TL;DR: EyeVLA是一种主动视觉感知机器人眼球，结合视觉语言模型和强化学习，实现广域覆盖和细粒度细节获取，提升机器人环境感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉模型和固定RGB-D相机系统无法兼顾广域覆盖和细粒度细节获取的问题，提升开放世界机器人应用的效能。

Method: 通过将动作行为离散化为动作令牌，并与具有强大开放世界理解能力的视觉语言模型（VLMs）集成，实现视觉、语言和动作在单一自回归序列中的联合建模。使用2D边界框坐标指导推理链，并应用强化学习优化视点选择策略。

Conclusion: EyeVLA提出了一种新型机器人视觉系统，能够主动获取高信息量的视觉观察，为下游具身任务提供支持。

Abstract: In embodied AI perception systems, visual perception should be active: the goal is not to passively process static images, but to actively acquire more informative data within pixel and spatial budget constraints. Existing vision models and fixed RGB-D camera systems fundamentally fail to reconcile wide-area coverage with fine-grained detail acquisition, severely limiting their efficacy in open-world robotic applications. To address this issue, we propose EyeVLA, a robotic eyeball for active visual perception that can take proactive actions based on instructions, enabling clear observation of fine-grained target objects and detailed information across a wide spatial extent. EyeVLA discretizes action behaviors into action tokens and integrates them with vision-language models (VLMs) that possess strong open-world understanding capabilities, enabling joint modeling of vision, language, and actions within a single autoregressive sequence. By using the 2D bounding box coordinates to guide the reasoning chain and applying reinforcement learning to refine the viewpoint selection policy, we transfer the open-world scene understanding capability of the VLM to a vision language action (VLA) policy using only minimal real-world data. Experiments show that our system efficiently performs instructed scenes in real-world environments and actively acquires more accurate visual information through instruction-driven actions of rotation and zoom, thereby achieving strong environmental perception capabilities. EyeVLA introduces a novel robotic vision system that leverages detailed and spatially rich, large-scale embodied data, and actively acquires highly informative visual observations for downstream embodied tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种区域感知强化学习框架，用于动态环境中的路径规划，通过分布式代理和层次分解实现高效适应，联邦学习方法表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态环境中的路径规划是智能交通和机器人学中的基本挑战，现有方法通常假设环境完全不可预测或依赖全局规划器，这些假设限制了在实际环境中的可扩展性和部署。

Method: 我们提出了一种可扩展的区域感知强化学习（RL）框架，用于动态环境中的路径规划。该方法基于层次分解环境和部署分布式RL代理，利用局部变化进行适应。我们还提出了基于子环境成功率的重新训练机制，以确定何时需要更新策略。探索了两种训练范式：单智能体Q学习和多智能体联邦Q学习。

Conclusion: 尽管在大型环境中初始训练仍然耗时，但我们的去中心化框架消除了对全局规划器的需求，并为未来使用深度强化学习和灵活环境分解的改进奠定了基础。

Abstract: Path planning in dynamic environments is a fundamental challenge in intelligent transportation and robotics, where obstacles and conditions change over time, introducing uncertainty and requiring continuous adaptation. While existing approaches often assume complete environmental unpredictability or rely on global planners, these assumptions limit scalability and practical deployment in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose a scalable, region-aware reinforcement learning (RL) framework for path planning in dynamic environments. Our method builds on the observation that environmental changes, although dynamic, are often localized within bounded regions. To exploit this, we introduce a hierarchical decomposition of the environment and deploy distributed RL agents that adapt to changes locally. We further propose a retraining mechanism based on sub-environment success rates to determine when policy updates are necessary. Two training paradigms are explored: single-agent Q-learning and multi-agent federated Q-learning, where local Q-tables are aggregated periodically to accelerate the learning process. Unlike prior work, we evaluate our methods in more realistic settings, where multiple simultaneous obstacle changes and increasing difficulty levels are present. Results show that the federated variants consistently outperform their single-agent counterparts and closely approach the performance of A* Oracle while maintaining shorter adaptation times and robust scalability. Although initial training remains time-consuming in large environments, our decentralized framework eliminates the need for a global planner and lays the groundwork for future improvements using deep RL and flexible environment decomposition.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种确定Fanuc CRX10iA/L协作机器人最优基座位置的方法，以应对工业任务中的轨迹需求。通过粒子群优化算法和α-shape算法，结合Voronoi图，该方法提供了在机器人放置不精确情况下的鲁棒性标准。

Abstract: This study presents a methodology for determining the optimal base placement of a Fanuc CRX10iA/L collaborative robot for a desired trajectory corresponding to an industrial task. The proposed method uses a particle swarm optimization algorithm that explores the search space to find positions for performing the trajectory. An $α$-shape algorithm is then used to draw the borders of the feasibility areas, and the largest circle inscribed is calculated from the Voronoi diagrams. The aim of this approach is to provide a robustness criterion in the context of robot placement inaccuracies that may be encountered, for example, if the robot is placed on a mobile base when the system is deployed by an operator. The approach developed uses an inverse kinematics model to evaluate all initial configurations, then moves the robot end-effector along the reference trajectory using the Jacobian matrix and assigns a score to the attempt. For the Fanuc CRX10iA/L robot, there can be up to 16 solutions to the inverse kinematics model. The calculation of these solutions is not trivial and requires a specific study that planning tools such as MoveIt cannot fully take into account. Additionally, the optimization process must consider constraints such as joint limits, singularities, and workspace limitations to ensure feasible and efficient trajectory execution.

In contrast to previous results, it is suitable for mixed architectures containing closed-loops, flexible links, rigid connections, passive and elastic joints with external loadings and preloadings. The proposed approach produces the Cartesian stiffness matrices in a semi-analytical manner. It presents the manipulator stiffness model as a set of conventional equations describing the link elasticities that are supplemented by a set of constraints describing connections between links. Its allows user straightforward aggregation of stiffness model equations avoiding traditional column/row merging procedures in the extended stiffness matrix. Advantages of this approach are illustrated by stiffness analysis of NaVaRo manipulator.

Conclusion: C2F-Space通过粗到细的空间定位框架显著提升了空间定位性能，并通过消融研究验证了各模块的有效性及其协同效应。

Abstract: Space grounding refers to localizing a set of spatial references described in natural language instructions. Traditional methods often fail to account for complex reasoning -- such as distance, geometry, and inter-object relationships -- while vision-language models (VLMs), despite strong reasoning abilities, struggle to produce a fine-grained region of outputs. To overcome these limitations, we propose C2F-Space, a novel coarse-to-fine space-grounding framework that (i) estimates an approximated yet spatially consistent region using a VLM, then (ii) refines the region to align with the local environment through superpixelization. For the coarse estimation, we design a grid-based visual-grounding prompt with a propose-validate strategy, maximizing VLM's spatial understanding and yielding physically and semantically valid canonical region (i.e., ellipses). For the refinement, we locally adapt the region to surrounding environment without over-relaxed to free space. We construct a new space-grounding benchmark and compare C2F-Space with five state-of-the-art baselines using success rate and intersection-over-union. Our C2F-Space significantly outperforms all baselines. Our ablation study confirms the effectiveness of each module in the two-step process and their synergistic effect of the combined framework. We finally demonstrate the applicability of C2F-Space to simulated robotic pick-and-place tasks.

Abstract: Autonomous exploration of obstacle-rich spaces requires strategies that ensure efficiency while guaranteeing safety against collisions with obstacles. This paper investigates a novel platform-agnostic reinforcement learning framework that integrates a graph neural network-based policy for next-waypoint selection, with a safety filter ensuring safe mobility. Specifically, the neural network is trained using reinforcement learning through the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to maximize exploration efficiency while minimizing safety filter interventions. Henceforth, when the policy proposes an infeasible action, the safety filter overrides it with the closest feasible alternative, ensuring consistent system behavior. In addition, this paper introduces a reward function shaped by a potential field that accounts for both the agent's proximity to unexplored regions and the expected information gain from reaching them. The proposed framework combines the adaptability of reinforcement learning-based exploration policies with the reliability provided by explicit safety mechanisms. This feature plays a key role in enabling the deployment of learning-based policies on robotic platforms operating in real-world environments. Extensive evaluations in both simulations and experiments performed in a lab environment demonstrate that the approach achieves efficient and safe exploration in cluttered spaces.

Abstract: We investigate the sampling-based optimal path planning problem for robotics in complex and dynamic environments. Most existing sampling-based algorithms neglect environmental information or the information from previous samples. Yet, these pieces of information are highly informative, as leveraging them can provide better heuristics when sampling the next state. In this paper, we propose a novel sampling-based planning algorithm, called \emph{RRT*former}, which integrates the standard RRT* algorithm with a Transformer network in a novel way. Specifically, the Transformer is used to extract features from the environment and leverage information from previous samples to better guide the sampling process. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to existing sampling-based approaches such as RRT*, Neural RRT*, and their variants, our algorithm achieves considerable improvements in both the optimality of the path and sampling efficiency. The code for our implementation is available on https://github.com/fengmingyang666/RRTformer.

Abstract: Legged robots offer several advantages when navigating unstructured environments, but they often fall short of the efficiency achieved by wheeled robots. One promising strategy to improve their energy economy is to leverage their natural (unactuated) dynamics using elastic elements. This work explores that concept by designing energy-optimal control inputs through a unified, multi-stage framework. It starts with a novel energy injection technique to identify passive motion patterns by harnessing the system's natural dynamics. This enables the discovery of passive solutions even in systems with energy dissipation caused by factors such as friction or plastic collisions. Building on these passive solutions, we then employ a continuation approach to derive energy-optimal control inputs for the fully actuated, dissipative robotic system. The method is tested on simulated models to demonstrate its applicability in both single- and multi-legged robotic systems. This analysis provides valuable insights into the design and operation of elastic legged robots, offering pathways to improve their efficiency and adaptability by exploiting the natural system dynamics.

Abstract: Diffusion Policy has shown great performance in robotic manipulation tasks under stochastic perturbations, due to its ability to model multimodal action distributions. Nonetheless, its reliance on a computationally expensive reverse-time diffusion (denoising) process, for action inference, makes it challenging to use for real-time applications where quick decision-making is mandatory. This work studies the possibility of conducting the denoising process only partially before executing an action, allowing the plant to evolve according to its dynamics in parallel to the reverse-time diffusion dynamics ongoing on the computer. In a classical diffusion policy setting, the plant dynamics are usually slow and the two dynamical processes are uncoupled. Here, we investigate theoretical bounds on the stability of closed-loop systems using diffusion policies when the plant dynamics and the denoising dynamics are coupled. The contribution of this work gives a framework for faster imitation learning and a metric that yields if a controller will be stable based on the variance of the demonstrations.

Abstract: Teams of cooperating autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) rely on acoustic communication for coordination, yet this communication medium is constrained by limited range, multi-path effects, and low bandwidth. One way to address the uncertainty associated with acoustic communication is to learn the communication environment in real-time. We address the challenge of a team of robots building a map of the probability of communication success from one location to another in real-time. This is a decentralized classification problem -- communication events are either successful or unsuccessful -- where AUVs share a subset of their communication measurements to build the map. The main contribution of this work is a rigorously derived data sharing policy that selects measurements to be shared among AUVs. We experimentally validate our proposed sharing policy using real acoustic communication data collected from teams of Virginia Tech 690 AUVs, demonstrating its effectiveness in underwater environments.

Abstract: Catching fast-moving objects serves as a benchmark for robotic agility, posing significant coordination challenges for cooperative manipulator systems holding a catcher, particularly due to inherent closed-chain constraints. This paper presents a nonlinear model predictive control (MPC)-based motion planner that bridges high-level interception planning with real-time joint space control, enabling dynamic object interception for systems comprising two cooperating arms. We introduce an Adaptive- Terminal (AT) MPC formulation featuring cost shaping, which contrasts with a simpler Primitive-Terminal (PT) approach relying heavily on terminal penalties for rapid convergence. The proposed AT formulation is shown to effectively mitigate issues related to actuator power limit violations frequently encountered with the PT strategy, yielding trajectories and significantly reduced control effort. Experimental results on a robotic platform with two cooperative arms, demonstrating excellent real time performance, with an average planner cycle computation time of approximately 19 ms-less than half the 40 ms system sampling time. These results indicate that the AT formulation achieves significantly improved motion quality and robustness with minimal computational overhead compared to the PT baseline, making it well-suited for dynamic, cooperative interception tasks.

Abstract: Ultrasound scanning is a critical imaging technique for real-time, non-invasive diagnostics. However, variations in patient anatomy and complex human-in-the-loop interactions pose significant challenges for autonomous robotic scanning. Existing ultrasound scanning robots are commonly limited to relatively low generalization and inefficient data utilization. To overcome these limitations, we present UltraDP, a Diffusion-Policy-based method that receives multi-sensory inputs (ultrasound images, wrist camera images, contact wrench, and probe pose) and generates actions that are fit for multi-modal action distributions in autonomous ultrasound scanning of carotid artery. We propose a specialized guidance module to enable the policy to output actions that center the artery in ultrasound images. To ensure stable contact and safe interaction between the robot and the human subject, a hybrid force-impedance controller is utilized to drive the robot to track such trajectories. Also, we have built a large-scale training dataset for carotid scanning comprising 210 scans with 460k sample pairs from 21 volunteers of both genders. By exploring our guidance module and DP's strong generalization ability, UltraDP achieves a 95% success rate in transverse scanning on previously unseen subjects, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: SRPO框架通过自引用策略优化，显著提升了VLA-RL模型的性能，无需额外监督即可达到99.2%的成功率，并在LIBERO-Plus基准测试中表现出强大的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models excel in robotic manipulation but are constrained by their heavy reliance on expert demonstrations, leading to demonstration bias and limiting performance. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a vital post-training strategy to overcome these limits, yet current VLA-RL methods, including group-based optimization approaches, are crippled by severe reward sparsity. Relying on binary success indicators wastes valuable information in failed trajectories, resulting in low training efficiency. To solve this, we propose Self-Referential Policy Optimization (SRPO), a novel VLA-RL framework. SRPO eliminates the need for external demonstrations or manual reward engineering by leveraging the model's own successful trajectories, generated within the current training batch, as a self-reference. This allows us to assign a progress-wise reward to failed attempts. A core innovation is the use of latent world representations to measure behavioral progress robustly. Instead of relying on raw pixels or requiring domain-specific fine-tuning, we utilize the compressed, transferable encodings from a world model's latent space. These representations naturally capture progress patterns across environments, enabling accurate, generalized trajectory comparison. Empirical evaluations on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate SRPO's efficiency and effectiveness. Starting from a supervised baseline with 48.9% success, SRPO achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 99.2% in just 200 RL steps, representing a 103% relative improvement without any extra supervision. Furthermore, SRPO shows substantial robustness, achieving a 167% performance improvement on the LIBERO-Plus benchmark.

Equipped with advanced infrared sensors, the Optimus-Q robot continuously streams real-time environmental data to predict hazardous gas emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH$_4$). Utilizing a federated learning approach, the robot collaborates with other systems across various NPPs to improve its predictive capabilities without compromising data privacy. Additionally, the implementation of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) ensures secure data transmission, safeguarding sensitive operational information. Our methodology combines systematic navigation patterns with machine learning algorithms to facilitate efficient coverage of designated areas, thereby optimizing contamination monitoring processes. Through simulations and real-world experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the Optimus-Q robot in enhancing operational safety and responsiveness in nuclear facilities. This research underscores the potential of integrating robotics, machine learning, and quantum technologies to revolutionize monitoring systems in hazardous environments.

Abstract: This article presents a novel framework for real-time Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data transmission that leverages rate-adaptive technologies and point cloud encoding methods to ensure low-latency, and low-loss data streaming. The proposed framework is intended for, but not limited to, robotic applications that require real-time data transmission over the internet for offloaded processing. Specifically, the Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable Throughput L4S-enabled SCReAM v2 transmission framework is extended to incorporate the Draco geometry compression algorithm, enabling dynamic compression of high-bitrate 3D LiDAR data according to the sensed channel capacity and network load. The low-latency 3D LiDAR streaming system is designed to maintain minimal end-to-end delay while constraining encoding errors to meet the accuracy requirements of robotic applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through real-world experiments conducted over a public 5G network across multi-kilometer urban environments. The low-latency and low-loss requirements are preserved, while real-time offloading and evaluation of 3D SLAM algorithms are used to validate the framework's performance in practical use cases.

Conclusion: Human0模型通过大规模人类数据学习，实现了语言指令跟随、少量样本学习和鲁棒性提升，展示了人类数据在机器人策略学习中的潜力。

Abstract: Egocentric videos are a valuable and scalable data source to learn manipulation policies. However, due to significant data heterogeneity, most existing approaches utilize human data for simple pre-training, which does not unlock its full potential. This paper first provides a scalable recipe for collecting and using egocentric data by categorizing human data into two categories: in-the-wild and on-task alongside with systematic analysis on how to use the data. We first curate a dataset, PHSD, which contains over 1,000 hours of diverse in-the-wild egocentric data and over 20 hours of on-task data directly aligned to the target manipulation tasks. This enables learning a large egocentric language-conditioned flow matching policy, Human0. With domain adaptation techniques, Human0 minimizes the gap between humans and humanoids. Empirically, we show Human0 achieves several novel properties from scaling human data, including language following of instructions from only human data, few-shot learning, and improved robustness using on-task data.

### [143] [The Illusion of Procedural Reasoning: Measuring Long-Horizon FSM Execution in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14777)
*Mahdi Samiei,Mahdi Mansouri,Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FSM Execution framework reveals LLMs' procedural reasoning flaws, showing degradation with complexity and suggesting externalizing steps improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To isolate and measure the collapse of LLMs in procedural reasoning, as current benchmarks lack controlled, interpretable methods to assess this capability.

Method: Introduces Finite-State Machine (FSM) Execution as a minimal, interpretable framework to evaluate LLMs' procedural reasoning by requiring step-by-step execution of deterministic rules.

Result: LLMs show systematic degradation with increased task complexity, especially under high branching factors, though larger models improve local accuracy but remain brittle in multi-step reasoning.

Conclusion: FSM-based evaluation provides a transparent method to diagnose LLMs' procedural reasoning failures and suggests the need for inductive biases to improve long-horizon competence.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results on tasks framed as reasoning problems, yet their true ability to perform procedural reasoning, executing multi-step, rule-based computations remains unclear. Unlike algorithmic systems, which can deterministically execute long-horizon symbolic procedures, LLMs often degrade under extended reasoning chains, but there is no controlled, interpretable benchmark to isolate and measure this collapse. We introduce Finite-State Machine (FSM) Execution as a minimal, fully interpretable framework for evaluating the procedural reasoning capacity of LLMs. In our setup, the model is given an explicit FSM definition and must execute it step-by-step given input actions, maintaining state consistency over multiple turns. This task requires no world knowledge, only faithful application of deterministic transition rules, making it a direct probe of the model's internal procedural fidelity. We measure both Turn Accuracy and Task Accuracy to disentangle immediate computation from cumulative state maintenance. Empirical results reveal systematic degradation as task horizon or branching complexity increases. Models perform significantly worse when rule retrieval involves high branching factors than when memory span is long. Larger models show improved local accuracy but remain brittle under multi-step reasoning unless explicitly prompted to externalize intermediate steps. FSM-based evaluation offers a transparent, complexity-controlled probe for diagnosing this failure mode and guiding the design of inductive biases that enable genuine long-horizon procedural competence. By grounding reasoning in measurable execution fidelity rather than surface correctness, this work helps establish a rigorous experimental foundation for understanding and improving the algorithmic reliability of LLMs.

Abstract: We take two key steps in automating the open-ended discovery of new mathematical theories, a grand challenge in artificial intelligence. First, we introduce $\emph{FERMAT}$, a reinforcement learning (RL) environment that models concept discovery and theorem-proving using a set of symbolic actions, opening up a range of RL problems relevant to theory discovery. Second, we explore a specific problem through $\emph{FERMAT}$: automatically scoring the $\emph{interestingness}$ of mathematical objects. We investigate evolutionary algorithms for synthesizing nontrivial interestingness measures. In particular, we introduce an LLM-based evolutionary algorithm that features function abstraction, leading to notable improvements in discovering elementary number theory and finite fields over hard-coded baselines. We open-source the $\emph{FERMAT}$ environment at this URL(https://github.com/trishullab/Fermat).

Motivation: 研究多智能体交互中的信念状态，特别是在医学案例模拟器中，智能体的信念如何反映现实世界的学科立场，以及这些信念如何被追踪和质疑。

Method: Ask WhAI 框架记录并重放智能体交互，支持对每个智能体信念和理由的带外查询，并启用反事实证据注入以测试信念结构对新信息的响应。

Result: 模拟显示智能体信念常反映现实世界的学科立场，包括对经典研究的过度依赖和对反证据的抵抗，这些信念可以以人类专家无法实现的方式被追踪和质疑。

Conclusion: Ask WhAI 提供了一个可重复的方法来研究多智能体科学推理中的信念形成和认知孤岛，通过可视化和测试这些动态。

Abstract: We present Ask WhAI, a systems-level framework for inspecting and perturbing belief states in multi-agent interactions. The framework records and replays agent interactions, supports out-of-band queries into each agent's beliefs and rationale, and enables counterfactual evidence injection to test how belief structures respond to new information. We apply the framework to a medical case simulator notable for its multi-agent shared memory (a time-stamped electronic medical record, or EMR) and an oracle agent (the LabAgent) that holds ground truth lab results revealed only when explicitly queried. We stress-test the system on a multi-specialty diagnostic journey for a child with an abrupt-onset neuropsychiatric presentation. Large language model agents, each primed with strong role-specific priors ("act like a neurologist", "act like an infectious disease specialist"), write to a shared medical record and interact with a moderator across sequential or parallel encounters. Breakpoints at key diagnostic moments enable pre- and post-event belief queries, allowing us to distinguish entrenched priors from reasoning or evidence-integration effects. The simulation reveals that agent beliefs often mirror real-world disciplinary stances, including overreliance on canonical studies and resistance to counterevidence, and that these beliefs can be traced and interrogated in ways not possible with human experts. By making such dynamics visible and testable, Ask WhAI offers a reproducible way to study belief formation and epistemic silos in multi-agent scientific reasoning.

Abstract: Subnational location data of disaster events are critical for risk assessment and disaster risk reduction. Disaster databases such as EM-DAT often report locations in unstructured textual form, with inconsistent granularity or spelling, that make it difficult to integrate with spatial datasets. We present a fully automated LLM-assisted workflow that processes and cleans textual location information using GPT-4o, and assigns geometries by cross-checking three independent geoinformation repositories: GADM, OpenStreetMap and Wikidata. Based on the agreement and availability of these sources, we assign a reliability score to each location while generating subnational geometries. Applied to the EM-DAT dataset from 2000 to 2024, the workflow geocodes 14,215 events across 17,948 unique locations. Unlike previous methods, our approach requires no manual intervention, covers all disaster types, enables cross-verification across multiple sources, and allows flexible remapping to preferred frameworks. Beyond the dataset, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs to extract and structure geographic information from unstructured text, offering a scalable and reliable method for related analyses.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种概率方法来量化数据集在目标操作域（TOD）中的代表性，通过不精确贝叶斯方法处理有限数据和先验不确定性，生成区间值估计。

Abstract: Assuring the trustworthiness and safety of AI systems, e.g., autonomous vehicles (AV), depends critically on the data-related safety properties, e.g., representativeness, completeness, etc., of the datasets used for their training and testing. Among these properties, this paper focuses on representativeness-the extent to which the scenario-based data used for training and testing, reflect the operational conditions that the system is designed to operate safely in, i.e., Operational Design Domain (ODD) or expected to encounter, i.e., Target Operational Domain (TOD). We propose a probabilistic method that quantifies representativeness by comparing the statistical distribution of features encoded by the scenario suites with the corresponding distribution of features representing the TOD, acknowledging that the true TOD distribution is unknown, as it can only be inferred from limited data.
  We apply an imprecise Bayesian method to handle limited data and uncertain priors. The imprecise Bayesian formulation produces interval-valued, uncertainty-aware estimates of representativeness, rather than a single value. We present a numerical example comparing the distributions of the scenario suite and the inferred TOD across operational categories-weather, road type, time of day, etc., under dependencies and prior uncertainty. We estimate representativeness locally (between categories) and globally as an interval.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在资源分配效率上比传统DRL方法提升高达22%，并在多样化的O-RAN切片中实现了更优的QoS满意度。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种结合Sharpness-Aware Minimization（SAM）的改进型Soft Actor Critic（SAC）算法，通过自适应选择性SAM机制和动态ρ调度方案，显著提升了资源分配效率和服务质量（QoS）满意度。

Abstract: Next-generation networks utilize the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture to enable dynamic resource management, facilitated by the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC). While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models show promise in optimizing network resources, they often struggle with robustness and generalizability in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a novel resource management approach that enhances the Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm with Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) in a distributed Multi-Agent RL (MARL) framework. Our method introduces an adaptive and selective SAM mechanism, where regularization is explicitly driven by temporal-difference (TD)-error variance, ensuring that only agents facing high environmental complexity are regularized. This targeted strategy reduces unnecessary overhead, improves training stability, and enhances generalization without sacrificing learning efficiency. We further incorporate a dynamic $ρ$ scheduling scheme to refine the exploration-exploitation trade-off across agents. Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms conventional DRL approaches, yielding up to a $22\%$ improvement in resource allocation efficiency and ensuring superior QoS satisfaction across diverse O-RAN slices.

Conclusion: MAQ框架通过将人类演示提炼为宏动作，显著提升了强化学习代理的人类相似性，并在D4RL Adroit基准测试中表现优异，为学习人类相似RL代理开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Human-like agents have long been one of the goals in pursuing artificial intelligence. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved superhuman performance in many domains, relatively little attention has been focused on designing human-like RL agents. As a result, many reward-driven RL agents often exhibit unnatural behaviors compared to humans, raising concerns for both interpretability and trustworthiness. To achieve human-like behavior in RL, this paper first formulates human-likeness as trajectory optimization, where the objective is to find an action sequence that closely aligns with human behavior while also maximizing rewards, and adapts the classic receding-horizon control to human-like learning as a tractable and efficient implementation. To achieve this, we introduce Macro Action Quantization (MAQ), a human-like RL framework that distills human demonstrations into macro actions via Vector-Quantized VAE. Experiments on D4RL Adroit benchmarks show that MAQ significantly improves human-likeness, increasing trajectory similarity scores, and achieving the highest human-likeness rankings among all RL agents in the human evaluation study. Our results also demonstrate that MAQ can be easily integrated into various off-the-shelf RL algorithms, opening a promising direction for learning human-like RL agents.

Conclusion: OpenBioLLM的模块化多智能体设计在基因组问答任务中展现出高效性和潜力，匹配或超越GeneGPT的性能，同时降低了延迟和成本。

Abstract: Genomic question answering often requires complex reasoning and integration across diverse biomedical sources. GeneGPT addressed this challenge by combining domain-specific APIs with OpenAI's code-davinci-002 large language model to enable natural language interaction with genomic databases. However, its reliance on a proprietary model limits scalability, increases operational costs, and raises concerns about data privacy and generalization.
  In this work, we revisit and reproduce GeneGPT in a pilot study using open source models, including Llama 3.1, Qwen2.5, and Qwen2.5 Coder, within a monolithic architecture; this allows us to identify the limitations of this approach. Building on this foundation, we then develop OpenBioLLM, a modular multi-agent framework that extends GeneGPT by introducing agent specialization for tool routing, query generation, and response validation. This enables coordinated reasoning and role-based task execution.
  OpenBioLLM matches or outperforms GeneGPT on over 90% of the benchmark tasks, achieving average scores of 0.849 on Gene-Turing and 0.830 on GeneHop, while using smaller open-source models without additional fine-tuning or tool-specific pretraining. OpenBioLLM's modular multi-agent design reduces latency by 40-50% across benchmark tasks, significantly improving efficiency without compromising model capability. The results of our comprehensive evaluation highlight the potential of open-source multi-agent systems for genomic question answering.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models on tabular data is critically dependent on high-quality feature engineering. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating feature extraction (AutoFE), existing methods are often limited by monolithic LLM architectures, simplistic quantitative feedback, and a failure to systematically integrate external domain knowledge. This paper introduces Rogue One, a novel, LLM-based multi-agent framework for knowledge-informed automatic feature extraction. Rogue One operationalizes a decentralized system of three specialized agents-Scientist, Extractor, and Tester-that collaborate iteratively to discover, generate, and validate predictive features. Crucially, the framework moves beyond primitive accuracy scores by introducing a rich, qualitative feedback mechanism and a "flooding-pruning" strategy, allowing it to dynamically balance feature exploration and exploitation. By actively incorporating external knowledge via an integrated retrieval-augmented (RAG) system, Rogue One generates features that are not only statistically powerful but also semantically meaningful and interpretable. We demonstrate that Rogue One significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a comprehensive suite of 19 classification and 9 regression datasets. Furthermore, we show qualitatively that the system surfaces novel, testable hypotheses, such as identifying a new potential biomarker in the myocardial dataset, underscoring its utility as a tool for scientific discovery.

Result: 通过对19个LRM的评估，SafeRBench展示了其在多维度安全性评估上的有效性，能够从多个视角揭示风险和保护机制。

Conclusion: SafeRBench作为首个端到端评估大型推理模型（LRM）安全性的基准，通过输入特征化、细粒度输出分析和人类安全对齐三个维度，实现了对安全风险的全面评估，为未来模型的安全性改进提供了多维度的见解。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) improve answer quality through explicit chain-of-thought, yet this very capability introduces new safety risks: harmful content can be subtly injected, surface gradually, or be justified by misleading rationales within the reasoning trace. Existing safety evaluations, however, primarily focus on output-level judgments and rarely capture these dynamic risks along the reasoning process. In this paper, we present SafeRBench, the first benchmark that assesses LRM safety end-to-end -- from inputs and intermediate reasoning to final outputs. (1) Input Characterization: We pioneer the incorporation of risk categories and levels into input design, explicitly accounting for affected groups and severity, and thereby establish a balanced prompt suite reflecting diverse harm gradients. (2) Fine-Grained Output Analysis: We introduce a micro-thought chunking mechanism to segment long reasoning traces into semantically coherent units, enabling fine-grained evaluation across ten safety dimensions. (3) Human Safety Alignment: We validate LLM-based evaluations against human annotations specifically designed to capture safety judgments. Evaluations on 19 LRMs demonstrate that SafeRBench enables detailed, multidimensional safety assessment, offering insights into risks and protective mechanisms from multiple perspectives.

Method: HISE-KT构建多关系HIN捕捉结构关系，利用LLM智能评分和过滤元路径实例，设计基于元路径的相似学生检索机制，并通过结构化提示整合目标学生历史与相似轨迹。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的实验表明，HISE-KT在预测性能和可解释性上均优于现有KT基线。

Conclusion: HISE-KT框架通过整合异构信息网络（HINs）和大语言模型（LLMs），在知识追踪（KT）任务中实现了更高的预测性能和可解释性，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to mine students' evolving knowledge states and predict their future question-answering performance. Existing methods based on heterogeneous information networks (HINs) are prone to introducing noises due to manual or random selection of meta-paths and lack necessary quality assessment of meta-path instances. Conversely, recent large language models (LLMs)-based methods ignore the rich information across students, and both paradigms struggle to deliver consistently accurate and evidence-based explanations. To address these issues, we propose an innovative framework, HIN-LLM Synergistic Enhanced Knowledge Tracing (HISE-KT), which seamlessly integrates HINs with LLMs. HISE-KT first builds a multi-relationship HIN containing diverse node types to capture the structural relations through multiple meta-paths. The LLM is then employed to intelligently score and filter meta-path instances and retain high-quality paths, pioneering automated meta-path quality assessment. Inspired by educational psychology principles, a similar student retrieval mechanism based on meta-paths is designed to provide a more valuable context for prediction. Finally, HISE-KT uses a structured prompt to integrate the target student's history with the retrieved similar trajectories, enabling the LLM to generate not only accurate predictions but also evidence-backed, explainable analysis reports. Experiments on four public datasets show that HISE-KT outperforms existing KT baselines in both prediction performance and interpretability.

TL;DR: COPYCHECK通过不确定性信号检测LLM训练数据中的版权内容，显著提升准确率且无需依赖经验阈值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因LLM的过度自信、缺乏真实训练数据及依赖经验阈值而受限，亟需一种更可靠的版权内容检测方法。

Method: COPYCHECK采用两阶段策略：(1) 将文件分割为小片段以减少对大规模训练数据的依赖；(2) 基于不确定性的无监督聚类，避免依赖经验性阈值。

Result: COPYCHECK在LLaMA 7b和LLaMA2 7b上平均平衡准确率分别达90.1%和91.6%，相对基线提升超90%，并在GPT-J 6B上表现优异。

Conclusion: COPYCHECK利用不确定性信号有效检测LLM训练数据中的版权内容，显著提升了检测准确率，并为训练数据透明度提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The remarkable language ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) stems from extensive training on vast datasets, often including copyrighted material, which raises serious concerns about unauthorized use. While Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) offer potential solutions for detecting such violations, existing approaches face critical limitations and challenges due to LLMs' inherent overconfidence, limited access to ground truth training data, and reliance on empirically determined thresholds.
  We present COPYCHECK, a novel framework that leverages uncertainty signals to detect whether copyrighted content was used in LLM training sets. Our method turns LLM overconfidence from a limitation into an asset by capturing uncertainty patterns that reliably distinguish between ``seen" (training data) and ``unseen" (non-training data) content. COPYCHECK further implements a two-fold strategy: (1) strategic segmentation of files into smaller snippets to reduce dependence on large-scale training data, and (2) uncertainty-guided unsupervised clustering to eliminate the need for empirically tuned thresholds. Experiment results show that COPYCHECK achieves an average balanced accuracy of 90.1% on LLaMA 7b and 91.6% on LLaMA2 7b in detecting seen files. Compared to the SOTA baseline, COPYCHECK achieves over 90% relative improvement, reaching up to 93.8\% balanced accuracy. It further exhibits strong generalizability across architectures, maintaining high performance on GPT-J 6B. This work presents the first application of uncertainty for copyright detection in LLMs, offering practical tools for training data transparency.

Motivation: 整合数学优化与大型语言模型的上下文能力，以提升决策质量，同时保持模块化和数据隐私。

Method: SOLID 通过双价格和偏差惩罚促进优化与大型语言模型（LLMs）代理之间的迭代协作。

Result: 实证结果表明，在各种场景下均能收敛，并且与仅使用基线优化器的方法相比，年化收益率有所提高。

Conclusion: SOLID 提供了一个有前景的框架，可推动跨领域自动化和智能决策的进步。

Abstract: This paper introduces SOLID (Synergizing Optimization and Large Language Models for Intelligent Decision-Making), a novel framework that integrates mathematical optimization with the contextual capabilities of large language models (LLMs). SOLID facilitates iterative collaboration between optimization and LLMs agents through dual prices and deviation penalties. This interaction improves the quality of the decisions while maintaining modularity and data privacy. The framework retains theoretical convergence guarantees under convexity assumptions, providing insight into the design of LLMs prompt. To evaluate SOLID, we applied it to a stock portfolio investment case with historical prices and financial news as inputs. Empirical results demonstrate convergence under various scenarios and indicate improved annualized returns compared to a baseline optimizer-only method, validating the synergy of the two agents. SOLID offers a promising framework for advancing automated and intelligent decision-making across diverse domains.

Motivation: 随着能效改进接近物理极限，新兴推理AI缺乏类似的需求饱和点，性能不再受限于训练数据量，而是随计算投资的指数增长持续扩展。

Method: 通过分析AI研究的历史趋势和当前能效挑战，提出多步骤推理AI的可持续性问题。

Result: 指出效率提升不足以解决推理AI的可持续性问题，需结合研究和政策干预。

Conclusion: 本文主张仅靠效率无法实现可持续的推理AI，并探讨了在优化和治理此类系统中嵌入明确限制的研究和政策方向。

Abstract: AI research is increasingly moving toward complex problem solving, where models are optimized not only for pattern recognition but for multi-step reasoning. Historically, computing's global energy footprint has been stabilized by sustained efficiency gains and natural saturation thresholds in demand. But as efficiency improvements are approaching physical limits, emerging reasoning AI lacks comparable saturation points: performance is no longer limited by the amount of available training data but continues to scale with exponential compute investments in both training and inference. This paper argues that efficiency alone will not lead to sustainable reasoning AI and discusses research and policy directions to embed explicit limits into the optimization and governance of such systems.

Conclusion: 本文认为，明确AI研究中关于智能本质的潜在假设（现实主义与多元主义）有助于更清晰地理解研究中的分歧。

Abstract: In this paper, we argue that current AI research operates on a spectrum between two different underlying conceptions of intelligence: Intelligence Realism, which holds that intelligence represents a single, universal capacity measurable across all systems, and Intelligence Pluralism, which views intelligence as diverse, context-dependent capacities that cannot be reduced to a single universal measure. Through an analysis of current debates in AI research, we demonstrate how the conceptions remain largely implicit yet fundamentally shape how empirical evidence gets interpreted across a wide range of areas. These underlying views generate fundamentally different research approaches across three areas. Methodologically, they produce different approaches to model selection, benchmark design, and experimental validation. Interpretively, they lead to contradictory readings of the same empirical phenomena, from capability emergence to system limitations. Regarding AI risk, they generate categorically different assessments: realists view superintelligence as the primary risk and search for unified alignment solutions, while pluralists see diverse threats across different domains requiring context-specific solutions. We argue that making explicit these underlying assumptions can contribute to a clearer understanding of disagreements in AI research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态推理模型缺乏自主探索和动态适应能力，而人类具备互补的思维维度，因此需设计更灵活的系统。

Method: 提出了Octopus框架，定义六种核心能力并构建评估基准Octopus-Bench，支持自主探索和动态能力选择。

Result: 实验表明Octopus在Octopus-Bench的大多数任务中表现最佳。

Conclusion: Octopus通过协调六种核心能力，在动态任务中展现了卓越的多模态推理性能，验证了能力协调在智能多模态推理中的关键作用。

Abstract: Existing multimodal reasoning models and frameworks suffer from fundamental architectural limitations: most lack the human-like ability to autonomously explore diverse reasoning pathways-whether in direct inference, tool-driven visual exploration, programmatic visual manipulation, or intrinsic visual imagination. Consequently, they struggle to adapt to dynamically changing capability requirements in real-world tasks. Meanwhile, humans exhibit a complementary set of thinking abilities when addressing such tasks, whereas existing methods typically cover only a subset of these dimensions. Inspired by this, we propose Octopus: Agentic Multimodal Reasoning with Six-Capability Orchestration, a new paradigm for multimodal agentic reasoning. We define six core capabilities essential for multimodal reasoning and organize a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, Octopus-Bench, accordingly. Octopus is capable of autonomously exploring during reasoning and dynamically selecting the most appropriate capability based on the current state. Experimental results show that Octopus achieves the best performance on the vast majority of tasks in Octopus-Bench, highlighting the crucial role of capability coordination in agentic multimodal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多任务基准主要评估智能体在无关任务间的策略切换能力，而非深度推理能力。Terra Nova旨在填补这一空白，提供一个需要集成理解和长期规划的环境。

Method: 通过构建一个受《文明V》启发的综合环境，Terra Nova同时引入了部分可观测性、信用分配、表示学习、巨大动作空间等多种经典RL挑战。

Result: Terra Nova成功定义并实现了一个CCE，能够同时呈现多种RL挑战，为研究智能体的综合能力提供了新平台。

Conclusion: Terra Nova作为一种全面的挑战环境（CCE），旨在通过集成多种RL挑战来推动强化学习研究的深入发展，要求智能体具备跨多个交互变量的长期理解和深度推理能力。

Abstract: We introduce Terra Nova, a new comprehensive challenge environment (CCE) for reinforcement learning (RL) research inspired by Civilization V. A CCE is a single environment in which multiple canonical RL challenges (e.g., partial observability, credit assignment, representation learning, enormous action spaces, etc.) arise simultaneously. Mastery therefore demands integrated, long-horizon understanding across many interacting variables. We emphasize that this definition excludes challenges that only aggregate unrelated tasks in independent, parallel streams (e.g., learning to play all Atari games at once). These aggregated multitask benchmarks primarily asses whether an agent can catalog and switch among unrelated policies rather than test an agent's ability to perform deep reasoning across many interacting challenges.

Motivation: 探讨智能体是否可以通过交互和积累经验，像人类一样获取类似人类的推理能力。

Method: 提出IPR（交互式物理推理器），利用世界模型模拟来评分和强化VLM的策略，并引入PhysCode，一种以物理为中心的动作代码，将语义意图与动态对齐，为预测和推理提供共享的动作空间。

Result: IPR在三个层次上表现稳健，整体上与GPT-5相当，在好奇心方面超越GPT-5。性能随着训练游戏和交互步骤的增加而提升，且模型能零样本迁移到未见过的游戏中。

Conclusion: 研究支持以物理为中心的交互作为持续提升物理推理能力的途径。

Abstract: Humans learn by observing, interacting with environments, and internalizing physics and causality. Here, we aim to ask whether an agent can similarly acquire human-like reasoning from interaction and keep improving with more experience. We study this in a Game-to-Unseen (G2U) setting, curating 1,000+ heterogeneous games with diverse physical and causal mechanisms, and evaluate at three human-like levels: Survival, Curiosity, Utility, from primitive intuition to goal-driven reasoning. Our analysis reveals complementary failures: VLM/VLA agents reason but lack look-ahead in interactive settings, while world models imagine but imitate visual patterns rather than analyze physics and causality. We therefore propose IPR (Interactive Physical Reasoner), using world-model rollouts to score and reinforce a VLM's policy, and introduce PhysCode, a physics-centric action code aligning semantic intent with dynamics to provide a shared action space for prediction and reasoning. Pretrained on 1,000+ games, our IPR performs robustly on three levels, matches GPT-5 overall, and surpasses it on Curiosity. We find that performance improves with more training games and interaction steps, and that the model also zero-shot transfers to unseen games. These results support physics-centric interaction as a path to steadily improving physical reasoning.

Motivation: 由于DeFi交易涉及复杂的智能合约交互、多方面的链上/链下因素以及不透明的hex日志，理解用户意图至关重要但极具挑战性，现有方法缺乏深入的语义洞察。

Method: TIM框架结合了基于扎根理论的DeFi意图分类法和多代理大型语言模型（LLM）系统，通过元级规划器动态协调领域专家，将多视角意图分析分解为可解决的子任务，问题求解器处理多模态链上/链下数据，认知评估器则减轻LLM幻觉并确保可验证性。

Result: 实验表明，TIM在意图推断方面显著优于机器学习模型、单一LLM和单一代理基线。

Conclusion: 本文提出了TIM框架，显著提升了DeFi用户意图推断的准确性和可靠性，为复杂区块链活动提供了上下文感知的解释。

Abstract: As Decentralized Finance (DeFi) develops, understanding user intent behind DeFi transactions is crucial yet challenging due to complex smart contract interactions, multifaceted on-/off-chain factors, and opaque hex logs. Existing methods lack deep semantic insight. To address this, we propose the Transaction Intent Mining (TIM) framework. TIM leverages a DeFi intent taxonomy built on grounded theory and a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) system to robustly infer user intents. A Meta-Level Planner dynamically coordinates domain experts to decompose multiple perspective-specific intent analyses into solvable subtasks. Question Solvers handle the tasks with multi-modal on/off-chain data. While a Cognitive Evaluator mitigates LLM hallucinations and ensures verifiability. Experiments show that TIM significantly outperforms machine learning models, single LLMs, and single Agent baselines. We also analyze core challenges in intent inference. This work helps provide a more reliable understanding of user motivations in DeFi, offering context-aware explanations for complex blockchain activity.

Method: 研究首先分析了不同模型和代理支架在MLE-bench基准上的表现，随后通过控制实验调整构思多样性程度，并验证了其对性能的影响。

Result: 研究发现，构思多样性与代理性能正相关，且这一结论在不同评估指标下均成立。

Conclusion: 研究得出结论，构思多样性（ideation diversity）是影响AI研究代理性能的关键因素，更高的构思多样性通常伴随更强的表现。

Abstract: AI research agents offer the promise to accelerate scientific progress by automating the design, implementation, and training of machine learning models. However, the field is still in its infancy, and the key factors driving the success or failure of agent trajectories are not fully understood. We examine the role that ideation diversity plays in agent performance. First, we analyse agent trajectories on MLE-bench, a well-known benchmark to evaluate AI research agents, across different models and agent scaffolds. Our analysis reveals that different models and agent scaffolds yield varying degrees of ideation diversity, and that higher-performing agents tend to have increased ideation diversity. Further, we run a controlled experiment where we modify the degree of ideation diversity, demonstrating that higher ideation diversity results in stronger performance. Finally, we strengthen our results by examining additional evaluation metrics beyond the standard medal-based scoring of MLE-bench, showing that our findings still hold across other agent performance metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G O-RAN的虚拟化和解耦引入了控制平面的新漏洞，尤其是RA信令风暴会导致CU处理管道过载，现有基于n-RT RIC的检测方法因高延迟无法及时应对。

Method: RAID在可编程Tofino交换机中嵌入轻量级随机森林（RF）分类器，实现微秒级延迟的线速流分类。

Result: RAID在多种流量负载下保持94%以上的检测准确率，单流推理延迟仅3.4微秒，满足O-RAN严格的控制平面时限要求。

Conclusion: RAID系统通过P4可编程交换机ASIC实现了对5G O-RAN中RA信令风暴的实时检测与缓解，显著提升了QoS保障能力。

Abstract: The disaggregation and virtualization of 5G Open RAN (O-RAN) introduces new vulnerabilities in the control plane that can greatly impact the quality of service (QoS) of latency-sensitive 5G applications and services. One critical issue is Random Access (RA) signaling storms where, a burst of illegitimate or misbehaving user equipments (UEs) send Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection requests that rapidly saturate a Central Unit's (CU) processing pipeline. Such storms trigger widespread connection failures within the short contention resolution window defined by 3GPP. Existing detection and mitigation approaches based on near-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller (n-RT RIC) applications cannot guarantee a timely reaction to such attacks as RIC control loops incur tens to hundreds of milliseconds of latency due to the non-deterministic nature of their general purpose processor (GPP) based architectures. This paper presents RAID, an in-network RA signaling storm detection and mitigation system that leverages P4-programmable switch ASICs to enable real-time protection from malicious attacks. RAID embeds a lightweight Random Forest (RF) classifier into a programmable Tofino switch, enabling line-rate flow classification with deterministic microsecond-scale inference delay. By performing ML-based detection directly in the data plane, RAID catches and filters malicious RA requests before they reach and overwhelm the RRC. RAID achieves above 94% detection accuracy with a fixed per-flow inference delay on the order of 3.4 microseconds, effectively meeting strict O-RAN control-plane deadlines. These improvements are sustained across multiple traffic loads, making RAID a fast and scalable solution for the detection and mitigation of signaling storms in 5G O-RAN.

Motivation: 探讨在仅知道顶点集的情况下，如何通过查询重建加权图的结构和权重。

Method: 研究了多种场景，使用包含两到三个简单查询的复合查询来学习加权图。

Result: 证明仅使用简单的最短路径长度查询不足以重建加权图，但复合查询可以实现高效学习。

Conclusion: 研究发现，通过组合查询可以高效地重建加权图，尤其是在使用次二次数量的复合查询时。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the exact learning problem for weighted graphs, where we are given the vertex set, $V$, of a weighted graph, $G=(V,E,w)$, but we are not given $E$. The problem, which is also known as graph reconstruction, is to determine all the edges of $E$, including their weights, by asking queries about $G$ from an oracle. As we observe, using simple shortest-path length queries is not sufficient, in general, to learn a weighted graph. So we study a number of scenarios where it is possible to learn $G$ using a subquadratic number of composite queries, which combine two or three simple queries.

Result: 相比现有最快算法，Intergrams实现了高达33倍的加速。

Conclusion: Intergrams算法通过多轮处理高效准确地恢复最频繁的n-gram，理论支持其有效性，并在实践中实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: The number of n-gram features grows exponentially in n, making it computationally demanding to compute the most frequent n-grams even for n as small as 3. Motivated by our production machine learning system built on n-gram features, we ask: is it possible to accurately, deterministically, and quickly recover the top-k most frequent n-grams? We devise a multi-pass algorithm called Intergrams that constructs candidate n-grams from the preceding (n - 1)-grams. By designing this algorithm with hardware in mind, our approach yields more than an order of magnitude speedup (up to 33x!) over the next known fastest algorithm, even when similar optimizations are applied to the other algorithm. Using the empirical power-law distribution over n-grams, we also provide theory to inform the efficacy of our multi-pass approach. Our code is available at https://github.com/rcurtin/Intergrams.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于理解1-平面绘图中不同交叉类型对图的可绘制性及识别问题复杂性的影响，特别是参数化复杂度与NP难易性的边界条件。

Method: 论文通过分析1-平面绘图中六种可能的交叉类型，研究了63种非空子集$\mathcal{S}$对应的识别问题。通过定义$\mathcal{S}_{\\rm bad}$集合，并分别考察其包含与不包含时的复杂度行为，结合树宽和路径宽度的参数化分析，得出了相关结论。

Result: 结果表明，$\mathcal{S}_{\\rm bad}$的存在显著影响了识别问题的复杂度：其子集决定了问题是固定参数可解还是NP难。这一结果也适用于直线绘图场景。

Conclusion: 该论文得出结论，存在一个包含三种交叉类型的集合$\mathcal{S}_{\\rm bad}$，其性质决定了$\mathcal{S}$-受限绘图的识别问题在参数化复杂度上的表现：若$\mathcal{S}$不包含$\mathcal{S}_{\\rm bad}$中的任何交叉类型，则识别问题是固定参数可解的（相对于输入图的树宽）；若包含，则即使对于恒定路径宽度的图，问题也是NP难的。这一结论也适用于1-平面直线绘图。

Abstract: A drawing of a graph is 1-planar if each edge participates in at most one crossing and adjacent edges do not cross. Up to symmetry, each crossing in a 1-planar drawing belongs to one out of six possible crossing types, where a type characterizes the subgraph induced by the four vertices of the crossing edges. Each of the 63 possible nonempty subsets $\mathcal{S}$ of crossing types gives a recognition problem: does a given graph admit an $\mathcal{S}$-restricted drawing, that is, a 1-planar drawing where the crossing type of each crossing is in $\mathcal{S}$?
  We show that there is a set $\mathcal{S}_{\rm bad}$ with three crossing types and the following properties: If $\mathcal{S}$ contains no crossing type from $\mathcal{S}_{\rm bad}$, then the recognition of graphs that admit an $\mathcal{S}$-restricted drawing is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the treewidth of the input graph. If $\mathcal{S}$ contains any crossing type from $\mathcal{S}_{\rm bad}$, then it is NP-hard to decide whether a graph has an $\mathcal{S}$-restricted drawing, even when considering graphs of constant pathwidth.
  We also extend this characterization of crossing types to 1-planar straight-line drawings and show the same complexity behaviour parameterized by treewidth.

Abstract: In a linear combinatorial optimization problem, we are given a family $\mathcal{F} \subseteq 2^U$ of feasible subsets of a ground set $U$ of $n$ elements, and aim to find $S^* = \arg\min_{S \in \mathcal{F}} \langle w, \mathbbm{1}_S \rangle$. Traditionally, the weight vector is given, or a value oracle allows evaluating $w(S) := \langle w, \mathbbm{1}_S \rangle$. Motivated by practical interest in pairwise comparisons, and by the theoretical quest to understand computational models, we study a weaker, more robust comparison oracle that for any $S, T \in \mathcal{F}$ reveals only whether $w(S) <, =, > w(T)$. We ask: when can we find $S^*$ using few comparison queries, and when can this be done efficiently?
  We present three contributions: (1) We establish that the query complexity over any set system $\mathcal{F} \subseteq 2^U$ is $\tilde O(n^2)$, using the inference dimension framework, highlighting a separation between information and computational complexity (runtime may still be exponential for NP-hard problems under ETH). (2) We introduce a Global Subspace Learning (GSL) framework for objective functions with discrete integer weights bounded by $B$, giving an algorithm to sort all feasible sets using $O(nB \log(nB))$ queries, improving the $\tilde O(n^2)$ bound when $B = o(n)$. For linear matroids, algebraic techniques yield efficient algorithms for problems including $k$-SUM, SUBSET-SUM, and $A{+}B$ sorting. (3) We give the first polynomial-time, low-query algorithms for classic combinatorial problems: minimum cuts, minimum weight spanning trees (and matroid bases), bipartite matching (and matroid intersection), and shortest $s$-$t$ paths.
  Our work provides the first general query complexity bounds and efficient algorithms for this model, opening new directions for comparison-based optimization.

TL;DR: 本文研究动态拟阵问题，提出高效算法维护基包和基覆盖的近似解，为动态组合优化提供新工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拟阵是组合优化问题的核心，研究动态拟阵可以推广动态图问题（如树性和最大二分匹配），因此探索动态拟阵的高效算法具有重要价值。

Method: 提出了确定性算法，用于动态维护基包数和基覆盖数的近似解，并针对不同场景优化查询复杂度。

Result: 提出了多项算法：动态维护基的确定性算法，以及基包数和基覆盖数的近似算法，查询复杂度分别为O(Φ·poly(log n, ε⁻¹))和O(β·poly(log n, ε⁻¹))，并在特定场景下进一步优化。

Conclusion: 本文通过探索基集合（基包和基覆盖）与树包等概念之间的关系，提出了高效的动态算法，为动态拟阵问题的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider dynamic matroids, where elements can be inserted to or deleted from the ground set over time. The independent sets change to reflect the current ground set. As matroids are central to the study of many combinatorial optimization problems, it is a natural next step to also consider them in a dynamic setting. The study of dynamic matroids has the potential to generalize several dynamic graph problems, including, but not limited to, arboricity and maximum bipartite matching. We contribute by providing efficient algorithms for some fundamental matroid questions.
  In particular, we study the most basic question of maintaining a base dynamically, providing an essential building block for future algorithms. We further utilize this result and consider the elementary problems of base packing and base covering. We provide a deterministic algorithm that maintains a $(1\pm \varepsilon)$-approximation of the base packing number $Φ$ in $O(Φ\cdot \text{poly}(\log n, \varepsilon^{-1}))$ queries per update. Similarly, we provide a deterministic algorithm that maintains a $(1\pm \varepsilon)$-approximation of the base covering number $β$ in $O(β\cdot \text{poly}(\log n, \varepsilon^{-1}))$ queries per update. Moreover, we give an algorithm that maintains a $(1\pm \varepsilon)$-approximation of the base covering number $β$ in $O(\text{poly}(\log n, \varepsilon^{-1}))$ queries per update against an oblivious adversary.
  These results are obtained by exploring the relationship between base collections, a generalization of tree-packings, and base packing and covering respectively. We provide structural theorems to formalize these connections, and show how they lead to simple dynamic algorithms.

We demonstrate use cases including quantum kernel methods, variational quantum eigensolvers, portfolio optimization, and integration with classical ML frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX. Through concrete Python examples with widely used libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib, we show how PennyLane facilitates efficient quantum circuit construction, automatic differentiation, and hybrid optimization workflows. By situating PennyLane within the broader context of quantum computing and machine learning, we highlight its role as a methodological building block for quantum-enhanced data science. Our goal is to provide researchers and practitioners with a concise reference that bridges foundational quantum computing concepts and applied machine learning practice, making PennyLane a default citation for hybrid quantum-classical workflows in Python-based research.

Abstract: Early detection of faults in district heating substations is imperative to reduce return temperatures and enhance efficiency. However, progress in this domain has been hindered by the limited availability of public, labelled datasets. We present an open source framework combining a service report validated public dataset, an evaluation method based on Accuracy, Reliability, and Earliness, and baseline results implemented with EnergyFaultDetector, an open source Python framework.
  The dataset contains time series of operational data from 93 substations across two manufacturers, annotated with a list of disturbances due to faults and maintenance actions, a set of normal-event examples and detailed fault metadata. We evaluate the EnergyFaultDetector using three metrics: Accuracy for recognising normal behaviour, an eventwise F Score for reliable fault detection with few false alarms, and Earliness for early detection. The framework also supports root cause analysis using ARCANA. We demonstrate three use cases to assist operators in interpreting anomalies and identifying underlying faults. The models achieve high normal-behaviour accuracy (0.98) and eventwise F-score (beta=0.5) of 0.83, detecting 60% of the faults in the dataset before the customer reports a problem, with an average lead time of 3.9 days.
  Integrating an open dataset, metrics, open source code, and baselines establishes a reproducible, fault centric benchmark with operationally meaningful evaluation, enabling consistent comparison and development of early fault detection and diagnosis methods for district heating substations.

Motivation: 现有工具如irace仅调整参数值而不修改代码，限制了算法优化的潜力。

Method: 提出了irace-evo框架，整合了代码进化（通过LLM）和参数调整，支持多语言，采用渐进式上下文管理和Always-From-Original原则。

Result: irace-evo在VSBPP的CMSA元启发式上发现了优于现有实现的新算法变体，且计算和货币成本低。

Conclusion: 结合自动配置与LLM驱动的代码进化，为启发式设计和元启发式优化提供了一种强大且成本效益高的途径。

Abstract: Automatic algorithm configuration tools such as irace efficiently tune parameter values but leave algorithmic code unchanged. This paper introduces a first version of irace-evo, an extension of irace that integrates code evolution through large language models (LLMs) to jointly explore parameter and code spaces. The proposed framework enables multi-language support (e.g., C++, Python), reduces token consumption via progressive context management, and employs the Always-From-Original principle to ensure robust and controlled code evolution. We evaluate irace-evo on the Construct, Merge, Solve & Adapt (CMSA) metaheuristic for the Variable-Sized Bin Packing Problem (VSBPP). Experimental results show that irace-evo can discover new algorithm variants that outperform the state-of-the-art CMSA implementation while maintaining low computational and monetary costs. Notably, irace-evo generates competitive algorithmic improvements using lightweight models (e.g., Claude Haiku 3.5) with a total usage cost under 2 euros. These results demonstrate that coupling automatic configuration with LLM-driven code evolution provides a powerful, cost-efficient avenue for advancing heuristic design and metaheuristic optimization.

Method: 比较了两种AI评分技术：Direct（直接应用评分标准）和Reverse（先修复错误再评分），并在不同评分范围下评估其准确性。

Result: Direct方法更快更直接，但Reverse方法通过关注修正努力提供更细粒度的评估。两种方法均需精心设计提示，特别是在分配部分分数和处理逻辑错误时。

Conclusion: 两种AI评分方法各有优劣，Direct方法快速直接，而Reverse方法能提供更细粒度的评估。未来可探索人机混合评分系统以提高一致性、效率和公平性。

Abstract: Manual grading of programming assignments in introductory computer science courses can be time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies. While unit testing is commonly used for automatic evaluation, it typically follows a binary pass/fail model and does not give partial marks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer the potential for automated, scalable, and more objective grading.
  This paper compares two AI-based grading techniques: \textit{Direct}, where the AI model applies a rubric directly to student code, and \textit{Reverse} (a newly proposed approach), where the AI first fixes errors, then deduces a grade based on the nature and number of fixes. Each method was evaluated on both the instructor's original grading scale and a tenfold expanded scale to assess the impact of range on AI grading accuracy. To assess their effectiveness, AI-assigned scores were evaluated against human tutor evaluations on a range of coding problems and error types.
  Initial findings suggest that while the Direct approach is faster and straightforward, the Reverse technique often provides a more fine-grained assessment by focusing on correction effort. Both methods require careful prompt engineering, particularly for allocating partial credit and handling logic errors. To further test consistency, we also used synthetic student code generated using Gemini Flash 2.0, which allowed us to evaluate AI graders on a wider range of controlled error types and difficulty levels. We discuss the strengths and limitations of each approach, practical considerations for prompt design, and future directions for hybrid human-AI grading systems that aim to improve consistency, efficiency, and fairness in CS courses.

Abstract: Autonomous systems must sustain justified confidence in their correctness and safety across their operational lifecycle-from design and deployment through post-deployment evolution. Traditional assurance methods often separate development-time assurance from runtime assurance, yielding fragmented arguments that cannot adapt to runtime changes or system updates - a significant challenge for assured autonomy. Towards addressing this, we propose a unified Continuous Assurance Framework that integrates design-time, runtime, and evolution-time assurance within a traceable, model-driven workflow as a step towards assured autonomy. In this paper, we specifically instantiate the design-time phase of the framework using two formal verification methods: RoboChart for functional correctness and PRISM for probabilistic risk analysis. We also propose a model-driven transformation pipeline, implemented as an Eclipse plugin, that automatically regenerates structured assurance arguments whenever formal specifications or their verification results change, thereby ensuring traceability. We demonstrate our approach on a nuclear inspection robot scenario, and discuss its alignment with the Trilateral AI Principles, reflecting regulator-endorsed best practices.

Conclusion: MermaidSeqBench 为评估LLM生成Mermaid序列图的能力提供了基准，揭示了模型间的显著能力差距，并为结构化图表生成研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent capabilities in generating structured diagrams from natural language descriptions. In particular, they have shown great promise in generating sequence diagrams for software engineering, typically represented in a text-based syntax such as Mermaid. However, systematic evaluations in this space remain underdeveloped as there is a lack of existing benchmarks to assess the LLM's correctness in this task. To address this shortcoming, we introduce MermaidSeqBench, a human-verified and LLM-synthetically-extended benchmark for assessing an LLM's capabilities in generating Mermaid sequence diagrams from textual prompts. The benchmark consists of a core set of 132 samples, starting from a small set of manually crafted and verified flows. These were expanded via a hybrid methodology combining human annotation, in-context LLM prompting, and rule-based variation generation. Our benchmark uses an LLM-as-a-judge model to assess Mermaid sequence diagram generation across fine-grained metrics, including syntax correctness, activation handling, error handling, and practical usability. We perform initial evaluations on numerous state-of-the-art LLMs and utilize multiple LLM judge models to demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our benchmark. Our results reveal significant capability gaps across models and evaluation modes. Our proposed benchmark provides a foundation for advancing research in structured diagram generation and for developing more rigorous, fine-grained evaluation methodologies.

Conclusion: AdvPrompt-MIA通过结合代码特定的对抗性提示和深度学习，显著提升了代码补全模型的成员推断攻击效果，并在不同模型和数据集上展现出强大的可迁移性。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) on code completion models offer an effective way to assess privacy risks by inferring whether a given code snippet was part of the training data. Existing black- and gray-box MIAs rely on expensive surrogate models or manually crafted heuristic rules, which limit their ability to capture the nuanced memorization patterns exhibited by over-parameterized code language models. To address these challenges, we propose AdvPrompt-MIA, a method specifically designed for code completion models, combining code-specific adversarial perturbations with deep learning. The core novelty of our method lies in designing a series of adversarial prompts that induce variations in the victim code model's output. By comparing these outputs with the ground-truth completion, we construct feature vectors to train a classifier that automatically distinguishes member from non-member samples. This design allows our method to capture richer memorization patterns and accurately infer training set membership. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on widely adopted models, such as Code Llama 7B, over the APPS and HumanEval benchmarks. The results show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with AUC gains of up to 102%. In addition, our method exhibits strong transferability across different models and datasets, underscoring its practical utility and generalizability.

Abstract: Automated web application testing is a critical component of modern software development, with frameworks like Selenium widely adopted for validating functionality through browser automation. Among the essential aspects of such testing is the ability to interact with and validate web forms, a task that requires syntactically correct, executable scripts with high coverage of input fields. Despite its importance, this task remains underexplored in the context of large language models (LLMs), and no public benchmark or dataset exists to evaluate LLMs on form interaction generation systematically. This paper introduces a novel method for training LLMs to generate high-quality test cases in Selenium, specifically targeting form interaction testing. We curate both synthetic and human-annotated datasets for training and evaluation, covering diverse real-world forms and testing scenarios. We define clear metrics for syntax correctness, script executability, and input field coverage. Our empirical study demonstrates that our approach significantly outperforms strong baselines, including GPT-4o and other popular LLMs, across all evaluation metrics. Our work lays the groundwork for future research on LLM-based web testing and provides resources to support ongoing progress in this area.

Abstract: Much of the existing ML research focuses on model performance metrics, leaving limited attention to the long-term sustainability and resource efficiency of ML applications. While high performance is essential, ensuring efficient resource management is equally critical for robust deployment. This study addresses this gap by systematically identifying code smells that lead to resource leaks in ML applications. We conducted an empirical investigation of developer discussions and real-world code snippets from PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras. The analysis identified 30 PyTorch-related smells and 16 TensorFlow/Keras smells linked to resource leaks. These smells were categorized in two ways: (1) based on their root causes, and (2) as general ML smells with framework-specific characteristics. For each smell, we derived at least one best practice, resulting in 50 recommended coding patterns aimed at reducing resource leakage and improving efficiency. To ensure the validity of our findings, we employed a three-phase validation process involving independent analysis by three authors followed by consensus discussions. This is the first comprehensive study to examine resource-leak-inducing code smells across major ML frameworks and to present actionable best practices for mitigating them. The contributions support developers in building more efficient and sustainable ML applications and offer a structured view of the underlying causes of resource leaks.

Abstract: Complex software-driven systems often interleave distributed, concurrent computation processes with physical interactions with the environment. Developing these systems more efficiently and safely can be achieved by employing actionable, software-based models. From a high-level system model, engineers often need to derive multiple specialized models for different purposes, including simulation, deployment, and formal verification. Each of these target models usually rely on its own formalism, specification language, and execution platform. Traditionally, a compiler analyzes a program written in a programming language and generates executable code. In contrast, a model compiler processes a source model written in a modeling language and should ideally support the generation of multiple heterogeneous targets. However, most existing modeling languages are designed with a narrow focus, typically targeting only simulation or implementation. Multi-target compilation, when not considered during the language's early design, becomes significantly harder to achieve. In this paper, we introduce our initiative: a toolchain and modeling language called M, designed to support system modeling and multi-target compilation for model-driven engineering of complex, concurrent, and time-aware systems. M is a textual, grammar-driven language based on the actor model and extended with discrete-event scheduling semantics. It provides constructs for modeling system entities, message-based interactions, and time- or state-triggered reactions. From such models, M enables the systematic generation of diverse target artifacts while preserving semantic conformance to the original model. Moreover, M can serve as a middle language to which other modeling languages may anchor, thereby allowing them to benefit from its compilation framework.

Abstract: Software development automation is a long-term goal in software engineering. With the development of artificial intelligence (AI), more and more researchers are exploring approaches to software automation. They view AI systems as tools or assistants in software development, still requiring significant human involvement. Another initiative is ``vibe coding'', where AI systems write and repeatedly revise most (or even all) of the code. We foresee these two development paths will converge towards the same destination: AI systems participate in throughout the software development lifecycle, expanding boundaries of full-stack software development. In this paper, we present a vision of an iterative end-to-end automated software development paradigm AutoSW. It operates in an analyze-plan-implement-deliver loop, where AI systems as human partners become first-class actors, translating human intentions expressed in natural language into executable software. We explore a lightweight prototype across the paradigm and initially execute various representative cases. The results indicate that AutoSW can successfully deliver executable software, providing a feasible direction for truly end-to-end automated software development.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ML文档（如ModelCards和DataSheets）中包含大量需求工程相关信息，可通过现有RE表示方法转化为结构化需求，支持ML系统的软件工程流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器学习（ML）系统的软件工程流程中，集成和验证ML组件是一个主要挑战，而传统需求工程（RE）流程在指定ML组件需求（包括模型和数据）方面面临新的障碍。ML文档（如ModelCards和DataSheets）是一个尚未充分探索的需求工程相关信息来源。

Method: 本研究首先分析了20个公开可用的ModelCards和DataSheets中与需求工程相关的信息的数量和性质，随后评估了三种现有的RE表示方法（EARS、Rupp's template和Volere）将这些知识转化为需求的有效性。

Result: 研究发现，ModelCards和DataSheets中包含大量潜在的需求工程相关信息，并且现有的RE表示方法能够有效地将这些信息转化为结构化需求。

Conclusion: 研究表明，ML文档（如ModelCards和DataSheets）中包含大量与需求工程相关的信息，并且可以通过现有的RE表示方法（如EARS、Rupp's template和Volere）将这些信息转化为结构化需求，从而为ML系统的软件工程流程提供支持。

Abstract: In software engineering processes for machine learning (ML)-enabled systems, integrating and verifying ML components is a major challenge. A prerequisite is the specification of ML component requirements, including models and data, an area where traditional requirements engineering (RE) processes face new obstacles. An underexplored source of RE-relevant information in this context is ML documentation such as ModelCards and DataSheets. However, it is uncertain to what extent RE-relevant information can be extracted from these documents. This study first investigates the amount and nature of RE-relevant information in 20 publicly available ModelCards and DataSheets. We show that these documents contain a significant amount of potentially RE-relevant information. Next, we evaluate how effectively three established RE representations (EARS, Rupp's template, and Volere) can structure this knowledge into requirements. Our results demonstrate that there is a pathway to transform ML-specific knowledge into structured requirements, incorporating ML documentation in software engineering processes for ML systems.

*Isabel Amaral,Alexandra Mendes,José Campos*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MutDafny是一个通过突变测试揭示Dafny规范弱点的工具，评估显示其能有效识别需加强的规范。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在验证感知编程语言（如Dafny）中，规范与实现同样容易出错，可能导致验证通过的程序偏离预期行为。

Method: 采用突变测试方法，结合现有工具的突变操作符和从GitHub上Dafny项目的bug修复提交中合成的新操作符，共32个操作符。

Result: 在794个真实世界的Dafny程序中评估MutDafny，手动分析未检测到的突变体，发现平均每241行代码就有一个需要加强的弱规范。

Conclusion: MutDafny通过突变测试有效揭示了Dafny规范中的潜在弱点，提高了其可靠性。

Abstract: This paper explores the use of mutation testing to reveal weaknesses in formal specifications written in Dafny. In verification-aware programming languages, such as Dafny, despite their critical role, specifications are as prone to errors as implementations. Flaws in specs can result in formally verified programs that deviate from the intended behavior.
  We present MutDafny, a tool that increases the reliability of Dafny specifications by automatically signaling potential weaknesses. Using a mutation testing approach, we introduce faults (mutations) into the code and rely on formal specifications for detecting them. If a program with a mutant verifies, this may indicate a weakness in the specification. We extensively analyze mutation operators from popular tools, identifying the ones applicable to Dafny. In addition, we synthesize new operators tailored for Dafny from bugfix commits in publicly available Dafny projects on GitHub. Drawing from both, we equipped our tool with a total of 32 mutation operators. We evaluate MutDafny's effectiveness and efficiency in a dataset of 794 real-world Dafny programs and we manually analyze a subset of the resulting undetected mutants, identifying five weak real-world specifications (on average, one at every 241 lines of code) that would benefit from strengthening.

TL;DR: EPSO是一种基于缓存的eBPF超级优化器，通过离线发现和重用重写规则，显著优化程序大小和运行时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: eBPF的性能关键用例和严格的验证器限制使得现有编译器优化支持有限，手动优化规则设计效果有限且具有挑战性。超级优化虽然能自动发现最优转换，但计算成本高。

Method: 提出了EPSO，一种基于缓存的超级优化器，通过离线超级优化发现重写规则并重用它们。

Result: EPSO发现了795条重写规则，程序大小平均减少24.37%（最高68.87%），运行时性能平均提升6.60%，在所有基准测试中优于K2，在92.68%的测试中优于Merlin。

Conclusion: EPSO作为一种基于缓存的超级优化器，通过离线超级优化发现重写规则并重用它们，实现了高质量的优化且运行时开销最小。在Linux内核和多个eBPF项目上的评估表明，EPSO在程序大小和运行时性能上均优于现有优化器。

Abstract: Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) allows developers to extend Linux kernel functionality without modifying its source code. To ensure system safety, an in-kernel safety checker, the verifier, enforces strict safety constraints (for example, a limited program size) on eBPF programs loaded into the kernel. These constraints, combined with eBPF's performance-critical use cases, make effective optimization essential. However, existing compilers (such as Clang) offer limited optimization support, and many semantics-preserving transformations are rejected by the verifier, which makes handcrafted optimization rule design both challenging and limited in effectiveness. Superoptimization overcomes the limitations of rule-based methods by automatically discovering optimal transformations, but its high computational cost limits scalability. To address this, we propose EPSO, a caching-based superoptimizer that discovers rewrite rules via offline superoptimization and reuses them to achieve high-quality optimizations with minimal runtime overhead. We evaluate EPSO on benchmarks from the Linux kernel and several eBPF-based projects, including Cilium, Katran, hXDP, Sysdig, Tetragon, and Tracee. EPSO discovers 795 rewrite rules and achieves up to 68.87 percent (average 24.37 percent) reduction in program size compared to Clang's output, outperforming the state-of-the-art BPF optimizer K2 on all benchmarks and Merlin on 92.68 percent of them. Additionally, EPSO reduces program runtime by an average of 6.60 percent, improving throughput and lowering latency in network applications.

*Huixiang Zhang,Mahzabeen Emu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于TDD和QUBO的框架，通过量子退火快速优化测试用例，显著减少令牌消耗并提升代码质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确控制大型语言模型（LLMs）生成高效简洁的代码是软件工程中的核心挑战。

Method: 论文提出了一个基于测试驱动开发（TDD）的框架，将代码规范转化为组合优化任务，并将测试用例最小化（TCM）问题建模为二次无约束二进制优化（QUBO）模型。

Result: 实验表明，量子退火解决核心TCM任务的速度比模拟退火快16倍，端到端框架减少了36.5%的总令牌消耗，并显著提高了代码质量。

Conclusion: 该论文展示了生成式AI与组合优化在软件工程中的强大协同作用，强调了精确模型制定的重要性。

Abstract: Precisely controlling Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate efficient and concise code is a central challenge in software engineering. We introduce a framework based on Test-Driven Development (TDD) that transforms code specification into a combinatorial optimization task. The framework first prompts an LLM to generate a test suite, then formulates the Test Case Minimization (TCM) problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model. This QUBO paradigm is compatible with both classical solvers and emerging hardware such as quantum annealers. Experimentally, quantum annealing solves the core TCM task 16 times faster than simulated annealing. This performance underpins our end-to-end framework, which reduces total token consumption by 36.5\% and significantly improves code quality. This work demonstrates a powerful synergy between generative AI and combinatorial optimization in software engineering, highlighting the critical importance of precise model formulation.
