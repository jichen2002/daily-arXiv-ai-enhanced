Abstract: Image-based virtual try-on (VTON) aims to synthesize photorealistic images of a person wearing specified garments. Despite significant progress, building a universal VTON framework that can flexibly handle diverse and complex tasks remains a major challenge. Recent methods explore multi-task VTON frameworks guided by textual instructions, yet they still face two key limitations: (1) semantic gap between text instructions and reference images, and (2) data scarcity in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose UniFit, a universal VTON framework driven by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Specifically, we introduce an MLLM-Guided Semantic Alignment Module (MGSA), which integrates multimodal inputs using an MLLM and a set of learnable queries. By imposing a semantic alignment loss, MGSA captures cross-modal semantic relationships and provides coherent and explicit semantic guidance for the generative process, thereby reducing the semantic gap. Moreover, by devising a two-stage progressive training strategy with a self-synthesis pipeline, UniFit is able to learn complex tasks from limited data. Extensive experiments show that UniFit not only supports a wide range of VTON tasks, including multi-garment and model-to-model try-on, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Chengxi Zeng,Yuxuan Jiang,Aaron Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EfficientSAM3通过渐进式蒸馏技术将SAM3的能力迁移到轻量级模型，实现高效设备端概念分割与跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM3的统一架构（共享视觉骨干、DETR风格检测器、密集内存跟踪器）在设备端应用时计算成本过高，需要一种高效轻量化的解决方案。

Method: 采用渐进式分层蒸馏（PHD）技术，分为三个阶段：编码器蒸馏、时序记忆蒸馏和端到端微调，使用RepViT、TinyViT和EfficientViT等轻量级骨干网络。

Result: 在流行的VOS数据集上进行了基准测试，与相关工作相比，实现了性能与效率的强权衡。

Conclusion: EfficientSAM3通过渐进式分层蒸馏（PHD）技术，成功将SAM3的能力迁移到轻量级模型上，实现了设备端的高效概念分割与跟踪，同时保持了与教师模型行为的高保真度。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3) advances visual understanding with Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) across images and videos, but its unified architecture (shared vision backbone, DETR-style detector, dense-memory tracker) remains prohibitive for on-device use. We present EfficientSAM3, a family of efficient models built on Progressive Hierarchical Distillation (PHD) that transfers capability from SAM3 to lightweight students in three stages: (1) Encoder Distillation aligns image features via prompt-in-the-loop training on SA-1B; (2) Temporal Memory Distillation replaces dense memory with a compact Perceiver-based module trained on SA-V to compress and retrieve spatiotemporal features efficiently; and (3) End-to-End Fine-Tuning refines the full pipeline on the official SAM3 PCS data to preserve concept-level performance. PHD yields a spectrum of student variants using RepViT, TinyViT, and EfficientViT backbones, enabling on-device concept segmentation and tracking while maintaining high fidelity to teacher behavior. We benchmark on popular VOS datasets, and compare with varies of releated work, achieing strong performance-efficiency trade-offs.

### [3] [Clustered Error Correction with Grouped 4D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16112)
*Taeho Kang,Jaeyeon Park,Kyungjin Lee,Youngki Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出新方法改进4D高斯泼溅，通过误差聚类和分组技术提升动态场景重建质量，PSNR提升0.39dB。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有4D高斯泼溅方法在动态场景重建中存在像素对应关系模糊和动态区域密度不足的问题，需改进。

Method: 1. 椭圆误差聚类和误差修正泼溅添加，用于定位动态区域并初始化拟合泼溅；2. 分组4D高斯泼溅技术，提升泼溅与动态对象映射的一致性。通过分类渲染错误并应用针对性修正（如反向投影或前景分割）。

Conclusion: 该方法通过引入椭圆误差聚类和分组4D高斯泼溅技术，显著提升了动态场景重建的准确性和时间一致性，并在Technicolor Light Field数据集上实现了0.39dB的PSNR提升。

Abstract: Existing 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) methods struggle to accurately reconstruct dynamic scenes, often failing to resolve ambiguous pixel correspondences and inadequate densification in dynamic regions. We address these issues by introducing a novel method composed of two key components: (1) Elliptical Error Clustering and Error Correcting Splat Addition that pinpoints dynamic areas to improve and initialize fitting splats, and (2) Grouped 4D Gaussian Splatting that improves consistency of mapping between splats and represented dynamic objects. Specifically, we classify rendering errors into missing-color and occlusion types, then apply targeted corrections via backprojection or foreground splitting guided by cross-view color consistency. Evaluations on Neural 3D Video and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves temporal consistency and achieves state-of-the-art perceptual rendering quality, improving 0.39dB of PSNR on the Technicolor Light Field dataset. Our visualization shows improved alignment between splats and dynamic objects, and the error correction method's capability to identify errors and properly initialize new splats. Our implementation details and source code are available at https://github.com/tho-kn/cem-4dgs.

*Sajjad Pakdamansavoji,Yintao Ma,Amir Rasouli,Tongtong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出四种改进模型基础的6D姿态估计方法，显著提升遮挡情况下的准确率和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有6D物体姿态估计方法在遮挡情况下早期阶段易出错且误差传播的问题。

Method: 动态非均匀密集采样策略、多假设推理机制、迭代细化以及遮挡训练增强。

Result: 在ICBIN和BOP数据集上分别实现了超过5%和2%的准确率提升，推理速度提高了约3倍。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在ICBIN和BOP数据集上分别实现了超过5%和2%的准确率提升，同时推理速度提高了约3倍。

Abstract: Accurate 6D object pose estimation is vital for robotics, augmented reality, and scene understanding. For seen objects, high accuracy is often attainable via per-object fine-tuning but generalizing to unseen objects remains a challenge. To address this problem, past arts assume access to CAD models at test time and typically follow a multi-stage pipeline to estimate poses: detect and segment the object, propose an initial pose, and then refine it. Under occlusion, however, the early-stage of such pipelines are prone to errors, which can propagate through the sequential processing, and consequently degrade the performance. To remedy this shortcoming, we propose four novel extensions to model-based 6D pose estimation methods: (i) a dynamic non-uniform dense sampling strategy that focuses computation on visible regions, reducing occlusion-induced errors; (ii) a multi-hypothesis inference mechanism that retains several confidence-ranked pose candidates, mitigating brittle single-path failures; (iii) iterative refinement to progressively improve pose accuracy; and (iv) series of occlusion-focused training augmentations that strengthen robustness and generalization. Furthermore, we propose a new weighted by visibility metric for evaluation under occlusion to minimize the bias in the existing protocols. Via extensive empirical evaluations, we show that our proposed approach achieves more than 5% improvement in accuracy on ICBIN and more than 2% on BOP dataset benchmarks, while achieving approximately 3 times faster inference.

### [5] [Layer-wise Noise Guided Selective Wavelet Reconstruction for Robust Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16162)
*Yuting Lu,Ziliang Wang,Weixin Xu,Wei Zhang,Yongqiang Zhao,Yang Yu,Xiaohong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LNG-SWR通过噪声注入和小波重建提升医学图像分割的鲁棒性，无需牺牲清洁精度，且与对抗训练兼容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床部署中分割模型在分布变化和扰动下的稳定性问题，避免对抗训练带来的清洁-鲁棒性权衡和高成本。

Method: 通过在多层次注入小噪声学习频率偏差先验，并应用先导选择性小波重建实现频率适应。

Result: 在CT和超声数据集上，LNG-SWR在清洁Dice/IoU上表现一致，显著减少了强攻击下的性能下降，与对抗训练结合时进一步提升了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LNG-SWR 提供了一种简单、有效且工程友好的方法，用于在对抗性和标准训练机制下实现稳健的医学图像分割。

Abstract: Clinical deployment requires segmentation models to stay stable under distribution shifts and perturbations. The mainstream solution is adversarial training (AT) to improve robustness; however, AT often brings a clean--robustness trade-off and high training/tuning cost, which limits scalability and maintainability in medical imaging. We propose \emph{Layer-wise Noise-Guided Selective Wavelet Reconstruction (LNG-SWR)}. During training, we inject small, zero-mean noise at multiple layers to learn a frequency-bias prior that steers representations away from noise-sensitive directions. We then apply prior-guided selective wavelet reconstruction on the input/feature branch to achieve frequency adaptation: suppress noise-sensitive bands, enhance directional structures and shape cues, and stabilize boundary responses while maintaining spectral consistency. The framework is backbone-agnostic and adds low additional inference overhead. It can serve as a plug-in enhancement to AT and also improves robustness without AT. On CT and ultrasound datasets, under a unified protocol with PGD-$L_{\infty}/L_{2}$ and SSAH, LNG-SWR delivers consistent gains on clean Dice/IoU and significantly reduces the performance drop under strong attacks; combining LNG-SWR with AT yields additive gains. When combined with adversarial training, robustness improves further without sacrificing clean accuracy, indicating an engineering-friendly and scalable path to robust segmentation. These results indicate that LNG-SWR provides a simple, effective, and engineering-friendly path to robust medical image segmentation in both adversarial and standard training regimes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用深度生成和随机退化技术生成合成历史地图数据，解决了训练数据稀缺问题，并提升了语义分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地图的自动化分析缺乏大量标注训练数据，且合成数据常缺乏真实性和多样性。

Method: 提出了一种自动深度生成方法和手动随机退化技术，用于模拟历史地图扫描中的视觉不确定性和噪声。

Result: 生成的合成训练数据在自构建图卷积网络上实现了领域自适应语义分割的全面评估。

Conclusion: 通过自动深度生成方法和手动随机退化技术，成功生成了适用于历史地图分析的合成训练数据，显著提升了领域自适应语义分割的效果。

Abstract: The automated analysis of historical documents, particularly maps, has drastically benefited from advances in deep learning and its success across various computer vision applications. However, most deep learning-based methods heavily rely on large amounts of annotated training data, which are typically unavailable for historical maps, especially for those belonging to specific, homogeneous cartographic domains, also known as corpora. Creating high-quality training data suitable for machine learning often takes a significant amount of time and involves extensive manual effort. While synthetic training data can alleviate the scarcity of real-world samples, it often lacks the affinity (realism) and diversity (variation) necessary for effective learning. By transferring the cartographic style of an original historical map corpus onto vector data, we bootstrap an effectively unlimited number of synthetic historical maps suitable for tasks such as land-cover interpretation of a homogeneous historical map corpus. We propose an automatic deep generative approach and a alternative manual stochastic degradation technique to emulate the visual uncertainty and noise, also known as data-dependent uncertainty, commonly observed in historical map scans. To quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of our approach, the generated training datasets were employed for domain-adaptive semantic segmentation on a homogeneous map corpus using a Self-Constructing Graph Convolutional Network, enabling a comprehensive assessment of the impact of our data bootstrapping methods.

### [7] [TetraSDF: Precise Mesh Extraction with Multi-resolution Tetrahedral Grid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16273)
*Seonghun Oh,Youngjung Uh,Jin-Hwa Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TetraSDF是一个精确的解析网格化框架，用于ReLU MLP与多分辨率四面体位编码器组合表示的SDF，解决了现有方法的挑战，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提取与神经符号距离函数（SDFs）的零级集完全匹配的网格仍然具有挑战性。基于采样的方法引入了离散化误差，而连续分段仿射（CPWA）解析方法仅适用于普通的ReLU MLP。

Method: TetraSDF是一个精确的解析网格化框架，用于由ReLU MLP与多分辨率四面体位编码器组合表示的SDF。编码器的重心插值保留了全局CPWA结构，使我们能够跟踪编码器诱导的多面体复合体中的ReLU线性区域。此外，从编码器的度量中导出的固定解析输入预调节器进一步减少了方向偏差并稳定了训练。

Result: TetraSDF在多个基准测试中表现出色，其解析提取器生成的网格高度自洽，忠实于学习到的等值面，同时保持了实用的运行时间和内存效率。

Conclusion: TetraSDF在多个基准测试中表现优异，不仅在SDF重建精度上匹配或超越了现有的基于网格的编码器，而且其解析提取器生成的网格高度自洽，忠实于学习到的等值面，同时保持了实用的运行时间和内存效率。

Abstract: Extracting meshes that exactly match the zero-level set of neural signed distance functions (SDFs) remains challenging. Sampling-based methods introduce discretization error, while continuous piecewise affine (CPWA) analytic approaches apply only to plain ReLU MLPs. We present TetraSDF, a precise analytic meshing framework for SDFs represented by a ReLU MLP composed with a multi-resolution tetrahedral positional encoder. The encoder's barycentric interpolation preserves global CPWA structure, enabling us to track ReLU linear regions within an encoder-induced polyhedral complex. A fixed analytic input preconditioner derived from the encoder's metric further reduces directional bias and stabilizes training. Across multiple benchmarks, TetraSDF matches or surpasses existing grid-based encoders in SDF reconstruction accuracy, and its analytic extractor produces highly self-consistent meshes that remain faithful to the learned isosurfaces, all with practical runtime and memory efficiency.

TL;DR: Box6D是一种针对仓库存储箱的6D姿态估计方法，通过类别CAD模板和优化策略，在保持高精度的同时显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在仓库自动化等工业场景中面临高分辨率网格需求、灵活性不足或过度泛化等问题，Box6D旨在平衡灵活性与准确性，提升工业实用性。

Method: Box6D 通过快速二分搜索从单个RGB-D观测中推断箱体尺寸，并使用类别CAD模板估计姿态，结合深度合理性过滤器和早期停止策略降低计算成本。

Result: Box6D 在真实仓库场景和公共基准测试中表现优异，6D姿态精度具有竞争力或更优，同时推理时间减少约76%。

Conclusion: Box6D 提出了一种针对仓库环境中存储箱的6D姿态估计方法，通过使用类别CAD模板而非实例特定模型，结合深度合理性过滤器和早期停止策略，显著提高了效率和精度。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects under clutter and occlusion is critical for robotic manipulation across warehouse automation, bin picking, logistics, and e-commerce fulfillment. There are three main approaches in this domain; Model-based methods assume an exact CAD model at inference but require high-resolution meshes and transfer poorly to new environments; Model-free methods that rely on a few reference images or videos are more flexible, however often fail under challenging conditions; Category-level approaches aim to balance flexibility and accuracy but many are overly general and ignore environment and object priors, limiting their practicality in industrial settings.
  To this end, we propose Box6d, a category-level 6D pose estimation method tailored for storage boxes in the warehouse context. From a single RGB-D observation, Box6D infers the dimensions of the boxes via a fast binary search and estimates poses using a category CAD template rather than instance-specific models. Suing a depth-based plausibility filter and early-stopping strategy, Box6D then rejects implausible hypotheses, lowering computational cost. We conduct evaluations on real-world storage scenarios and public benchmarks, and show that our approach delivers competitive or superior 6D pose precision while reducing inference time by approximately 76%.

TL;DR: Texture3dgs优化了3D高斯泼溅在移动GPU上的实现，通过新颖排序算法和内存优化，显著提升了效率和内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 考虑到移动设备部署的优势（数据隐私、无需网络连接、响应更快），研究如何优化3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）在移动GPU上的实现。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的排序算法，优化了2D内存的数据处理、移动和布局，并改进了变量布局设计。

Result: Texture3dgs在排序和整体3D场景重建上分别实现了4.1倍和1.7倍的加速，内存使用减少了1.6倍。

Conclusion: Texture3dgs通过优化2D纹理缓存和排序算法，显著提升了移动GPU上的3D场景重建效率，同时减少了内存使用。

Abstract: Image-based 3D scene reconstruction, which transforms multi-view images into a structured 3D representation of the surrounding environment, is a common task across many modern applications. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a new paradigm to address this problem and offers considerable efficiency as compared to the previous methods. Motivated by this, and considering various benefits of mobile device deployment (data privacy, operating without internet connectivity, and potentially faster responses), this paper develops Texture3dgs, an optimized mapping of 3DGS for a mobile GPU. A critical challenge in this area turns out to be optimizing for the two-dimensional (2D) texture cache, which needs to be exploited for faster executions on mobile GPUs. As a sorting method dominates the computations in 3DGS on mobile platforms, the core of Texture3dgs is a novel sorting algorithm where the processing, data movement, and placement are highly optimized for 2D memory. The properties of this algorithm are analyzed in view of a cost model for the texture cache. In addition, we accelerate other steps of the 3DGS algorithm through improved variable layout design and other optimizations. End-to-end evaluation shows that Texture3dgs delivers up to 4.1$\times$ and 1.7$\times$ speedup for the sorting and overall 3D scene reconstruction, respectively -- while also reducing memory usage by up to 1.6$\times$ -- demonstrating the effectiveness of our design for efficient mobile 3D scene reconstruction.

TL;DR: 论文提出两阶段自我改进方法，通过生成理由并微调模型，提升视觉语言模型在特定领域视频分类中的表现，无需额外标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在特定领域视频分类任务中表现不佳，尤其是数据有限时，存在“理由鸿沟”，即稀疏数据难以连接复杂时空内容与抽象分类标签。

Method: 1. 使用视觉语言模型为每个视频生成详细文本理由；2. 利用这些自生成的理由对模型进行微调，以对齐目标领域的表示；3. 在任务标签上进行常规监督微调。

Result: 在多样化数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于直接监督微调，验证了自生成理由作为一种高效、标注节省的范式。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种两阶段自我改进范式，通过生成详细文本理由并利用这些理由进行微调，显著提升了视觉语言模型在特定领域视频分类任务中的性能，且无需额外标注。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly integral to multimedia understanding; however, they often struggle with domain-specific video classification tasks, particularly in cases with limited data. This stems from a critical \textit{rationale gap}, where sparse domain data is insufficient to bridge the semantic distance between complex spatio-temporal content and abstract classification labels. We propose a two-stage self-improvement paradigm to bridge this gap without new annotations. First, we prompt the VLMs to generate detailed textual rationales for each video, compelling them to articulate the domain-specific logic. The VLM is then fine-tuned on these self-generated rationales, utilizing this intermediate supervision to align its representations with the nuances of the target domain. Second, conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is performed on the task labels, achieving markedly higher effectiveness as a result of the model's pre-acquired domain reasoning. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms direct SFT, validating self-generated rationale as an effective, annotation-efficient paradigm for adapting VLMs to domain-specific video analysis.

TL;DR: PartUV是一种基于部件的UV展开方法，通过语义部件分解和几何启发式方法，减少图表数量并保持低失真，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UV展开方法在处理AI生成网格时表现不佳，常导致高度碎片化的图表和次优边界，影响下游任务。

Method: PartUV基于学习部件分解方法PartField，采用自上而下的递归框架，结合参数化和打包算法，并针对非流形和退化网格进行专门处理。

Result: 在四个不同数据集的评估中，PartUV在图表数量和接缝长度上优于现有工具和神经方法，失真程度相当，且在挑战性网格上具有高成功率。

Conclusion: PartUV通过结合高层次语义部件分解与新颖的几何启发式方法，显著减少了部件对齐的图表数量，同时保持低失真，并在多个数据集中表现优于现有工具和神经方法。

Abstract: UV unwrapping flattens 3D surfaces to 2D with minimal distortion, often requiring the complex surface to be decomposed into multiple charts. Although extensively studied, existing UV unwrapping methods frequently struggle with AI-generated meshes, which are typically noisy, bumpy, and poorly conditioned. These methods often produce highly fragmented charts and suboptimal boundaries, introducing artifacts and hindering downstream tasks. We introduce PartUV, a part-based UV unwrapping pipeline that generates significantly fewer, part-aligned charts while maintaining low distortion. Built on top of a recent learning-based part decomposition method PartField, PartUV combines high-level semantic part decomposition with novel geometric heuristics in a top-down recursive framework. It ensures each chart's distortion remains below a user-specified threshold while minimizing the total number of charts. The pipeline integrates and extends parameterization and packing algorithms, incorporates dedicated handling of non-manifold and degenerate meshes, and is extensively parallelized for efficiency. Evaluated across four diverse datasets, including man-made, CAD, AI-generated, and Common Shapes, PartUV outperforms existing tools and recent neural methods in chart count and seam length, achieves comparable distortion, exhibits high success rates on challenging meshes, and enables new applications like part-specific multi-tiles packing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP等现有方法在单标签、单粒度对齐上的局限性限制了其在复杂领域（如医学影像）的应用，需解决多标签和跨粒度对齐问题。

Method: 提出Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL)框架，利用结构化多标签监督、跨粒度文本描述整合及软标签监督，结合平滑KL散度确保跨粒度一致性。

Conclusion: MGLL框架通过多粒度和多标签对齐显著提升了视觉语言模型在复杂领域（如医学影像）的性能，并在多个下游任务中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in image-text pretraining have significantly enhanced visual understanding by aligning visual and textual representations. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has played a pivotal role in multimodal learning. However, its focus on single-label, single-granularity alignment limits its effectiveness in complex domains such as medical imaging, where images often correspond to multiple high-level labels (e.g., disease categories) across different annotation granularities (e.g., diagnostic description, clinical explanation). To address this, we propose Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL), a contrastive learning framework designed to improve both multi-label and cross-granularity alignment. MGLL leverages structured multi-label supervision, integrates textual descriptions across granularities, and introduces soft-label supervision with point-wise constraints to enhance alignment. MGLL employs smooth Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to ensure cross-granularity consistency while maintaining computational efficiency as a plug-and-play module for vision-language models. Pretrained on our constructed large-scale multi-granular datasets and evaluated across multiple datasets, MGLL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks.

Motivation: 传统心脏超声依赖于一系列2D视频，而3D超声心动图虽能提供更全面的图像质量，但临床医生仍习惯使用标准2D视图进行诊断。

Method: 应用深度学习视图分类器和基于解剖标志的下游启发式方法，结合心脏病专家提供的启发式规则，重建标准超声心动图视图。

Abstract: Although the heart has complex three-dimensional (3D) anatomy, conventional medical imaging with cardiac ultrasound relies on a series of 2D videos showing individual cardiac structures. 3D echocardiography is a developing modality that now offers adequate image quality for clinical use, with potential to streamline acquisition and improve assessment of off-axis features. We propose an automated method to select standard 2D views from 3D cardiac ultrasound volumes, allowing physicians to interpret the data in their usual format while benefiting from the speed and usability of 3D scanning. Applying a deep learning view classifier and downstream heuristics based on anatomical landmarks together with heuristics provided by cardiologists, we reconstruct standard echocardiography views. This approach was validated by three cardiologists in blinded evaluation (96\% accuracy in 1,600 videos from 2 hospitals). The downstream 2D videos were also validated in their ability to detect cardiac abnormalities using AI echocardiography models (EchoPrime and PanEcho) as well as ability to generate clinical-grade measurements of cardiac anatomy (EchoNet-Measurement). We demonstrated that the extracted 2D videos preserve spatial calibration and diagnostic features, allowing clinicians to obtain accurate real-world interpretations from 3D volumes. We release the code and a dataset of 29 3D echocardiography videos https://github.com/echonet/3d-echo .

In contrast, promptable segmentation models such as SAM2 enable precise user interaction but lack semantic or relational reasoning. We introduce Click2Graph, the first interactive framework for Panoptic Video Scene Graph Generation (PVSG) that unifies visual prompting with spatial, temporal, and semantic understanding. From a single user cue, such as a click or bounding box, Click2Graph segments and tracks the subject across time, autonomously discovers interacting objects, and predicts <subject, object, predicate> triplets to form a temporally consistent scene graph. Our framework introduces two key components: a Dynamic Interaction Discovery Module that generates subject-conditioned object prompts, and a Semantic Classification Head that performs joint entity and predicate reasoning. Experiments on the OpenPVSG benchmark demonstrate that Click2Graph establishes a strong foundation for user-guided PVSG, showing how human prompting can be combined with panoptic grounding and relational inference to enable controllable and interpretable video scene understanding.

Conclusion: InfoCLIP通过信息论视角成功提升了CLIP在开放词汇语义分割任务中的微调效果，保持了预训练模型的模态对齐能力，并在多个基准测试中展现出优越性。

Abstract: Recently, the strong generalization ability of CLIP has facilitated open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which labels pixels using arbitrary text. However, existing methods that fine-tune CLIP for segmentation on limited seen categories often lead to overfitting and degrade the pretrained vision-language alignment. To stabilize modality alignment during fine-tuning, we propose InfoCLIP, which leverages an information-theoretic perspective to transfer alignment knowledge from pretrained CLIP to the segmentation task. Specifically, this transfer is guided by two novel objectives grounded in mutual information. First, we compress the pixel-text modality alignment from pretrained CLIP to reduce noise arising from its coarse-grained local semantic representations learned under image-text supervision. Second, we maximize the mutual information between the alignment knowledge of pretrained CLIP and the fine-tuned model to transfer compact local semantic relations suited for the segmentation task. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks validate the effectiveness of InfoCLIP in enhancing CLIP fine-tuning for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, demonstrating its adaptability and superiority in asymmetric transfer.

Abstract: Multi-task learning can suffer from destructive task interference, where jointly trained models underperform single-task baselines and limit generalization. To improve generalization performance in breast ultrasound-based tumor segmentation via multi-task learning, we propose a novel consistency regularization approach that mitigates destructive interference between segmentation and classification. The consistency regularization approach is composed of differentiable BI-RADS-inspired morphological features. We validated this approach by training all models on the BrEaST dataset (Poland) and evaluating them on three external datasets: UDIAT (Spain), BUSI (Egypt), and BUS-UCLM (Spain). Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates statistically significant (p<0.001) improvements in generalization for segmentation task of the proposed multi-task approach vs. the baseline one: UDIAT, BUSI, BUS-UCLM (Dice coefficient=0.81 vs 0.59, 0.66 vs 0.56, 0.69 vs 0.49, resp.). The proposed approach also achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance under rigorous external validation on the UDIAT dataset.

Abstract: Achieving visual semantic understanding requires a unified framework that simultaneously handles object detection, category prediction, and attribute recognition. However, current advanced approaches rely on global similarity and struggle to capture fine-grained category distinctions and category-specific attribute diversity, especially in large-scale e-commerce scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a detection-guided generative framework that predicts hierarchical category and attribute tokens. For each detected object, we extract refined ROI-level features and employ a BART-based generator to produce semantic tokens in a coarse-to-fine sequence covering category hierarchies and property-value pairs, with support for property-conditioned attribute recognition. Experiments on both large-scale proprietary e-commerce datasets and open-source datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing similarity-based pipelines and multi-stage classification systems, achieving stronger fine-grained recognition and more coherent unified inference.

Conclusion: FADS通过聚类采样构建人口统计学平衡且语义相关的示例，有效减少了医疗图像推理中的性别、种族和民族相关差异，同时保持了高准确性，为公平医疗图像推理提供了一条高效且可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for medical image reasoning, yet fairness across demographic groups remains a major concern. Existing debiasing methods often rely on large labeled datasets or fine-tuning, which are impractical for foundation-scale models. We explore In-Context Learning (ICL) as a lightweight, tuning-free alternative for improving fairness. Through systematic analysis, we find that conventional demonstration selection (DS) strategies fail to ensure fairness due to demographic imbalance in selected exemplars. To address this, we propose Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), which builds demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations via clustering-based sampling. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show that FADS consistently reduces gender-, race-, and ethnicity-related disparities while maintaining strong accuracy, offering an efficient and scalable path toward fair medical image reasoning. These results highlight the potential of fairness-aware in-context learning as a scalable and data-efficient solution for equitable medical image reasoning.

Conclusion: 利用基于图的表示方法，通过GCNs优化特征空间，显著提升了长尾视觉数据集中的OOD检测性能，并在多个基准测试中大幅优于现有方法。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is essential for safe deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs). This problem becomes particularly challenging in the presence of long-tailed in-distribution (ID) datasets, often leading to high false positive rates (FPR) and low tail-class ID classification accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that exploiting inter-sample relationships using a graph-based representation can significantly improve OOD detection in long-tailed recognition of vision datasets. To this end, we use the feature space of a pre-trained model to initialize our graph structure. We account for the differences between the activation layer distribution of the pre-training vs. training data, and actively introduce Gaussianization to alleviate any deviations from a standard normal distribution in the activation layers of the pre-trained model. We then refine this initial graph representation using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to arrive at a feature space suitable for long-tailed OOD detection. This leads us to address the inferior performance observed in ID tail-classes within existing OOD detection methods. Experiments over three benchmarks CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin in terms of FPR and tail-class ID classification accuracy.

Abstract: Deep neural networks used for human detection are highly vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, creating safety and privacy risks in real surveillance environments. Wearable attacks offer a realistic threat model, yet existing approaches usually optimize textures frame by frame and therefore fail to maintain concealment across long video sequences with motion, pose changes, and garment deformation. In this work, a sequence-level optimization framework is introduced to generate natural, printable adversarial textures for shirts, trousers, and hats that remain effective throughout entire walking videos in both digital and physical settings. Product images are first mapped to UV space and converted into a compact palette and control-point parameterization, with ICC locking to keep all colors printable. A physically based human-garment pipeline is then employed to simulate motion, multi-angle camera viewpoints, cloth dynamics, and illumination variation. An expectation-over-transformation objective with temporal weighting is used to optimize the control points so that detection confidence is minimized across whole sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong and stable concealment, high robustness to viewpoint changes, and superior cross-model transferability. Physical garments produced with sublimation printing achieve reliable suppression under indoor and outdoor recordings, confirming real-world feasibility.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的Mixture-of-Ranks (MoR)架构在单步图像超分辨率任务中表现出色，通过综合实验验证了其有效性和最先进的性能。

Abstract: The demonstrated success of sparsely-gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, exemplified by models such as DeepSeek and Grok, has motivated researchers to investigate their adaptation to diverse domains. In real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR), existing approaches mainly rely on fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images. However, these dense Real-ISR models are limited in their ability to adaptively capture the heterogeneous characteristics of complex real-world degraded samples or enable knowledge sharing between inputs under equivalent computational budgets. To address this, we investigate the integration of sparse MoE into Real-ISR and propose a Mixture-of-Ranks (MoR) architecture for single-step image super-resolution. We introduce a fine-grained expert partitioning strategy that treats each rank in LoRA as an independent expert. This design enables flexible knowledge recombination while isolating fixed-position ranks as shared experts to preserve common-sense features and minimize routing redundancy. Furthermore, we develop a degradation estimation module leveraging CLIP embeddings and predefined positive-negative text pairs to compute relative degradation scores, dynamically guiding expert activation. To better accommodate varying sample complexities, we incorporate zero-expert slots and propose a degradation-aware load-balancing loss, which dynamically adjusts the number of active experts based on degradation severity, ensuring optimal computational resource allocation. Comprehensive experiments validate our framework's effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Laser cutting is a widely adopted technology in material processing across various industries, but it generates a significant amount of dust, smoke, and aerosols during operation, posing a risk to both the environment and workers' health. Speckle sensing has emerged as a promising method to monitor the cutting process and identify material types in real-time. This paper proposes a material classification technique using a speckle pattern of the material's surface based on deep learning to monitor and control the laser cutting process. The proposed method involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of laser speckle patterns to recognize distinct material types for safe and efficient cutting. Previous methods for material classification using speckle sensing may face issues when the color of the laser used to produce the speckle pattern is changed. Experiments conducted in this study demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in material classification, even when the laser color is changed. The model achieved an accuracy of 98.30 % on the training set and 96.88% on the validation set. Furthermore, the model was evaluated on a set of 3000 new images for 30 different materials, achieving an F1-score of 0.9643. The proposed method provides a robust and accurate solution for material-aware laser cutting using speckle sensing.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an efficient, high-fidelity representation for real-time scene reconstruction and rendering. However, extending 3DGS to sparse-view settings remains challenging because of supervision scarcity and overfitting caused by limited viewpoint coverage. In this paper, we present CuriGS, a curriculum-guided framework for sparse-view 3D reconstruction using 3DGS. CuriGS addresses the core challenge of sparse-view synthesis by introducing student views: pseudo-views sampled around ground-truth poses (teacher). For each teacher, we generate multiple groups of student views with different perturbation levels. During training, we follow a curriculum schedule that gradually unlocks higher perturbation level, randomly sampling candidate students from the active level to assist training. Each sampled student is regularized via depth-correlation and co-regularization, and evaluated using a multi-signal metric that combines SSIM, LPIPS, and an image-quality measure. For every teacher and perturbation level, we periodically retain the best-performing students and promote those that satisfy a predefined quality threshold to the training set, resulting in a stable augmentation of sparse training views. Experimental results show that CuriGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both rendering fidelity and geometric consistency across various synthetic and real sparse-view scenes.

Abstract: Recent advances in plant phenotyping have driven widespread adoption of multi sensor platforms for collecting crop canopy reflectance data. This includes the collection of heterogeneous data across multiple platforms, with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) seeing significant usage due to their high performance in crop monitoring, forecasting, and prediction tasks. Similarly, satellite missions have been shown to be effective for agriculturally relevant tasks. In contrast to UAVs, such missions are bound to the limitation of spatial resolution, which hinders their effectiveness for modern farming systems focused on micro-plot management. In this work, we propose a cross modal learning strategy that enriches high-resolution satellite imagery with UAV level visual detail for crop canopy trait estimation. Using a dataset of approximately co registered satellite UAV image pairs collected from replicated plots of 84 hybrid maize varieties across five distinct locations in the U.S. Corn Belt, we train a model that learns fine grained spectral spatial correspondences between sensing modalities. Results show that the generated UAV-like representations from satellite inputs consistently outperform real satellite imagery on multiple downstream tasks, including yield and nitrogen prediction, demonstrating the potential of cross-modal correspondence learning to bridge the gap between satellite and UAV sensing in agricultural monitoring.

Abstract: Training a model for food recognition is challenging because the training samples, which are typically crawled from the Internet, are visually different from the pictures captured by users in the free-living environment. In addition to this domain-shift problem, the real-world food datasets tend to be long-tailed distributed and some dishes of different categories exhibit subtle variations that are difficult to distinguish visually. In this paper, we present a framework empowered with large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges in food recognition. We first leverage LLMs to parse food images to generate food titles and ingredients. Then, we project the generated texts and food images from different domains to a shared embedding space to maximize the pair similarities. Finally, we take the aligned features of both modalities for recognition. With this simple framework, we show that our proposed approach can outperform the existing approaches tailored for long-tailed data distribution, domain adaptation, and fine-grained classification, respectively, on two food datasets.

Conclusion: AMS-KV通过自适应KV缓存策略显著提升了VAR模型的生成效率和质量，支持更大的批量处理。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) via next-scale prediction has emerged as a scalable image generation paradigm. While Key and Value (KV) caching in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively studied, next-scale prediction presents unique challenges, and KV caching design for next-scale based VAR transformers remains largely unexplored. A major bottleneck is the excessive KV memory growth with the increasing number of scales-severely limiting scalability. Our systematic investigation reveals that: (1) Attending to tokens from local scales significantly contributes to generation quality (2) Allocating a small amount of memory for the coarsest scales, termed as condensed scales, stabilizes multi-scale image generation (3) Strong KV similarity across finer scales is predominantly observed in cache-efficient layers, whereas cache-demanding layers exhibit weaker inter-scale similarity. Based on the observations, we introduce AMS-KV, a scale-adaptive KV caching policy for next-scale prediction in VAR models. AMS-KV prioritizes storing KVs from condensed and local scales, preserving the most relevant tokens to maintain generation quality. It further optimizes KV cache utilization and computational efficiency identifying cache-demanding layers through inter-scale similarity analysis. Compared to the vanilla next-scale prediction-based VAR models, AMS-KV reduces KV cache usage by up to 84.83% and self-attention latency by 60.48%. Moreover, when the baseline VAR-d30 model encounters out-of-memory failures at a batch size of 128, AMS-KV enables stable scaling to a batch size of 256 with improved throughput.

Abstract: Synthesizing high-fidelity and controllable 4D LiDAR data is crucial for creating scalable simulation environments for autonomous driving. This task is inherently challenging due to the sensor's unique spherical geometry, the temporal sparsity of point clouds, and the complexity of dynamic scenes. To address these challenges, we present LiSTAR, a novel generative world model that operates directly on the sensor's native geometry. LiSTAR introduces a Hybrid-Cylindrical-Spherical (HCS) representation to preserve data fidelity by mitigating quantization artifacts common in Cartesian grids. To capture complex dynamics from sparse temporal data, it utilizes a Spatio-Temporal Attention with Ray-Centric Transformer (START) that explicitly models feature evolution along individual sensor rays for robust temporal coherence. Furthermore, for controllable synthesis, we propose a novel 4D point cloud-aligned voxel layout for conditioning and a corresponding discrete Masked Generative START (MaskSTART) framework, which learns a compact, tokenized representation of the scene, enabling efficient, high-resolution, and layout-guided compositional generation. Comprehensive experiments validate LiSTAR's state-of-the-art performance across 4D LiDAR reconstruction, prediction, and conditional generation, with substantial quantitative gains: reducing generation MMD by a massive 76%, improving reconstruction IoU by 32%, and lowering prediction L1 Med by 50%. This level of performance provides a powerful new foundation for creating realistic and controllable autonomous systems simulations. Project link: https://ocean-luna.github.io/LiSTAR.gitub.io.

It comprises three stages: (1) A hierarchical text-guided frame sampler to emulate human attention; (2) A reasoning model that produces spatial cues along with explicit reasoning chains; and (3) A segmentation-propagation stage using SAM2 and XMem. A task difficulty-aware mechanism adaptively controls reasoning length for better efficiency and accuracy. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VideoSeg-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in complex video reasoning and segmentation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3DGS-based SLAM系统缺乏开放词汇语义理解能力的问题，同时克服高维语言特征存储与渲染开销大的挑战。

Method: 提出LEGO-SLAM框架，采用场景自适应编码解码器将高维语言嵌入压缩至16维特征空间，结合语言引导的修剪策略优化高斯分布数量。

Result: 实验表明LEGO-SLAM在保持15 FPS实时性能的同时，实现了竞争性的映射质量与跟踪精度，高斯数量减少60%以上。

Conclusion: LEGO-SLAM成功实现了在3DGS-based SLAM系统中实时开放词汇映射，通过场景自适应编码解码器优化语言嵌入，显著提升了语义理解能力与系统性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems to build photorealistic maps. However, these maps lack the open-vocabulary semantic understanding required for advanced robotic interaction. Integrating language features into SLAM remains a significant challenge, as storing high-dimensional features demands excessive memory and rendering overhead, while existing methods with static models lack adaptability for novel environments. To address these limitations, we propose LEGO-SLAM (Language-Embedded Gaussian Optimization SLAM), the first framework to achieve real-time, open-vocabulary mapping within a 3DGS-based SLAM system. At the core of our method is a scene-adaptive encoder-decoder that distills high-dimensional language embeddings into a compact 16-dimensional feature space. This design reduces the memory per Gaussian and accelerates rendering, enabling real-time performance. Unlike static approaches, our encoder adapts online to unseen scenes. These compact features also enable a language-guided pruning strategy that identifies semantic redundancy, reducing the map's Gaussian count by over 60\% while maintaining rendering quality. Furthermore, we introduce a language-based loop detection approach that reuses these mapping features, eliminating the need for a separate detection model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LEGO-SLAM achieves competitive mapping quality and tracking accuracy, all while providing open-vocabulary capabilities at 15 FPS.

Conclusion: SpectralTrain框架通过结合课程学习和PCA降维，显著提升了高光谱图像分类的效率，并在多种数据集上展现了良好的泛化能力，为气候相关遥感任务提供了潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification typically involves large-scale data and computationally intensive training, which limits the practical deployment of deep learning models in real-world remote sensing tasks. This study introduces SpectralTrain, a universal, architecture-agnostic training framework that enhances learning efficiency by integrating curriculum learning (CL) with principal component analysis (PCA)-based spectral downsampling. By gradually introducing spectral complexity while preserving essential information, SpectralTrain enables efficient learning of spectral -- spatial patterns at significantly reduced computational costs. The framework is independent of specific architectures, optimizers, or loss functions and is compatible with both classical and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Indian Pines, Salinas-A, and the newly introduced CloudPatch-7 -- demonstrate strong generalization across spatial scales, spectral characteristics, and application domains. The results indicate consistent reductions in training time by 2-7x speedups with small-to-moderate accuracy deltas depending on backbone. Its application to cloud classification further reveals potential in climate-related remote sensing, emphasizing training strategy optimization as an effective complement to architectural design in HSI models.

Abstract: We present Rad-GS, a 4D radar-camera SLAM system designed for kilometer-scale outdoor environments, utilizing 3D Gaussian as a differentiable spatial representation. Rad-GS combines the advantages of raw radar point cloud with Doppler information and geometrically enhanced point cloud to guide dynamic object masking in synchronized images, thereby alleviating rendering artifacts and improving localization accuracy. Additionally, unsynchronized image frames are leveraged to globally refine the 3D Gaussian representation, enhancing texture consistency and novel view synthesis fidelity. Furthermore, the global octree structure coupled with a targeted Gaussian primitive management strategy further suppresses noise and significantly reduces memory consumption in large-scale environments. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that Rad-GS achieves performance comparable to traditional 3D Gaussian methods based on camera or LiDAR inputs, highlighting the feasibility of robust outdoor mapping using 4D mmWave radar. Real-world reconstruction at kilometer scale validates the potential of Rad-GS for large-scale scene reconstruction.

Result: 在九个跨任务场景中取得顶级结果，在十个额外场景中表现次优。

Conclusion: T2T-VICL方法在跨任务视觉上下文学习中表现出色，解锁了VLMs在此领域的潜力。

Abstract: In large language models (LLM), in-context learning (ICL) refers to performing new tasks by conditioning on small demonstrations provided in the input context. Recent advances in visual in-context learning (VICL) demonstrate promising capabilities for solving downstream tasks by unified vision-language models (VLMs). When the visual prompt and the target images originate from different visual tasks, can VLMs still enable VICL? In the paper, we propose a fully collaborative pipeline, i.e. T2T-VICL, for VLMs to investigate the potential of cross-task VICL. Fundamentally, we design a mechanism to generate and select text prompts that best implicitly describe the differences between two distinct low-level vision tasks, and construct the first cross-task VICL dataset. Building upon this, we propose a novel inference framework that combines perceptual score-based reasoning with traditional evaluation metrics to perform cross-task VICL. Our approach achieves top-tier results across nine cross-task scenarios and second-tier performance in ten additional scenarios, unlocking the boundaries of cross-task VICL within VLMs.

Method: DCS-LDM通过多级令牌建模样本复杂性，构建了一个层次化的潜在空间，支持从粗到细的渐进生成。

Result: 实验结果表明，DCS-LDM在性能上可与最先进方法媲美，同时支持跨多样尺度和视觉质量的灵活生成。

Conclusion: DCS-LDM提出了一种新的视觉生成范式，通过解耦信息复杂性与规模，构建了一个层次化、尺度无关的潜在空间，实现了在固定潜在表示下灵活的解码到任意分辨率和帧率，同时支持渐进式生成。

Abstract: Existing latent diffusion models typically couple scale with content complexity, using more latent tokens to represent higher-resolution images or higher-frame rate videos. However, the latent capacity required to represent visual data primarily depends on content complexity, with scale serving only as an upper bound. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCS-LDM, a novel paradigm for visual generation that decouples information complexity from scale. DCS-LDM constructs a hierarchical, scale-independent latent space that models sample complexity through multi-level tokens and supports decoding to arbitrary resolutions and frame rates within a fixed latent representation. This latent space enables DCS-LDM to achieve a flexible computation-quality tradeoff. Furthermore, by decomposing structural and detailed information across levels, DCS-LDM supports a progressive coarse-to-fine generation paradigm. Experimental results show that DCS-LDM delivers performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering flexible generation across diverse scales and visual qualities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VTinker提出引导流上采样和纹理映射技术，解决了传统视频帧插值方法中的模糊和伪影问题，性能优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于流的视频帧插值方法在低分辨率下估计运动后，使用高倍上采样（如双线性）获取高分辨率流，易导致边缘模糊或马赛克，且无法充分捕捉高分辨率下的精细像素运动，导致插值帧出现重影和不连续。

Method: 提出了一种新的VFI流程VTinker，包含引导流上采样（GFU）和纹理映射两个核心组件。GFU利用输入帧作为引导，改善低分辨率流上采样时的边缘模糊问题；纹理映射则生成中间代理帧，选择清晰纹理块进行映射，最终通过重建模块生成插值帧。

Result: 大量实验证明，VTinker在视频帧插值任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VTinker通过引导流上采样和纹理映射技术，显著提升了视频帧插值的质量，减少了模糊和伪影，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Due to large pixel movement and high computational cost, estimating the motion of high-resolution frames is challenging. Thus, most flow-based Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) methods first predict bidirectional flows at low resolution and then use high-magnification upsampling (e.g., bilinear) to obtain the high-resolution ones. However, this kind of upsampling strategy may cause blur or mosaic at the flows' edges. Additionally, the motion of fine pixels at high resolution cannot be adequately captured in motion estimation at low resolution, which leads to the misalignment of task-oriented flows. With such inaccurate flows, input frames are warped and combined pixel-by-pixel, resulting in ghosting and discontinuities in the interpolated frame. In this study, we propose a novel VFI pipeline, VTinker, which consists of two core components: guided flow upsampling (GFU) and Texture Mapping. After motion estimation at low resolution, GFU introduces input frames as guidance to alleviate the blurring details in bilinear upsampling flows, which makes flows' edges clearer. Subsequently, to avoid pixel-level ghosting and discontinuities, Texture Mapping generates an initial interpolated frame, referred to as the intermediate proxy. The proxy serves as a cue for selecting clear texture blocks from the input frames, which are then mapped onto the proxy to facilitate producing the final interpolated frame via a reconstruction module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VTinker achieves state-of-the-art performance in VFI. Codes are available at: https://github.com/Wucy0519/VTinker.

Conclusion: PiN-CLIP通过联合训练噪声生成器和检测网络，成功抑制了捷径敏感方向并放大了稳定的取证线索，实现了更鲁棒和泛化的伪影表示提取，在开放世界数据集上达到了新的最先进性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has made real and synthetic images increasingly indistinguishable. Although extensive efforts have been devoted to detecting AI-generated images, out-of-distribution generalization remains a persistent challenge. We trace this weakness to spurious shortcuts exploited during training and we also observe that small feature-space perturbations can mitigate shortcut dominance. To address this problem in a more controllable manner, we propose the Positive-Incentive Noise for CLIP (PiN-CLIP), which jointly trains a noise generator and a detection network under a variational positive-incentive principle. Specifically, we construct positive-incentive noise in the feature space via cross-attention fusion of visual and categorical semantic features. During optimization, the noise is injected into the feature space to fine-tune the visual encoder, suppressing shortcut-sensitive directions while amplifying stable forensic cues, thereby enabling the extraction of more robust and generalized artifact representations. Comparative experiments are conducted on an open-world dataset comprising synthetic images generated by 42 distinct generative models. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance, with notable improvements of 5.4 in average accuracy over existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合预训练DRL模块和分层终止机制的盲QECV方法，显著提升了性能并优化了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的QECV方法依赖于已知的QP，限制了其在QP未知的实际场景中的适用性。当前的盲方法生成的退化向量缺乏空间细节，难以适应不同空间位置的伪影模式。此外，现有方法忽视了不同压缩级别对计算需求的变化。

Method: 论文提出了一种预训练的退化表示学习（DRL）模块，用于解耦和提取高维多尺度的退化表示，以指导伪影去除。此外，还引入了分层终止机制，根据压缩级别动态调整伪影减少阶段的次数。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在QP=22时，PSNR提升了110%（从0.31 dB到0.65 dB），并且在QP=22时的平均推理时间比QP=42时减少了一半。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的预训练退化表示学习（DRL）模块和分层终止机制显著提升了压缩视频质量增强（QECV）的性能，特别是在QP未知的盲方法中。实验结果显示，该方法在PSNR上实现了110%的提升，并在推理时间上实现了显著优化。

Abstract: Existing studies on Quality Enhancement for Compressed Video (QECV) predominantly rely on known Quantization Parameters (QPs), employing distinct enhancement models per QP setting, termed non-blind methods. However, in real-world scenarios involving transcoding or transmission, QPs may be partially or entirely unknown, limiting the applicability of such approaches and motivating the development of blind QECV techniques. Current blind methods generate degradation vectors via classification models with cross-entropy loss, using them as channel attention to guide artifact removal. However, these vectors capture only global degradation information and lack spatial details, hindering adaptation to varying artifact patterns at different spatial positions. To address these limitations, we propose a pretrained Degradation Representation Learning (DRL) module that decouples and extracts high-dimensional, multiscale degradation representations from video content to guide the artifact removal. Additionally, both blind and non-blind methods typically employ uniform architectures across QPs, hence, overlooking the varying computational demands inherent to different compression levels. We thus introduce a hierarchical termination mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of artifact reduction stages based on the compression level. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances performance, achieving a PSNR improvement of 110% (from 0.31 dB to 0.65 dB) over a competing state-of-the-art blind method at QP = 22. Furthermore, the proposed hierarchical termination mechanism reduces the average inference time at QP = 22 by half compared to QP = 42.

Abstract: Real-time 3D object detection from point clouds is essential for dynamic scene understanding in applications such as augmented reality, robotics and navigation. We introduce a novel Spatial-prioritized and Rank-aware 3D object detection (SR3D) framework for indoor point clouds, to bridge the gap between how detectors are trained and how they are evaluated. This gap stems from the lack of spatial reliability and ranking awareness during training, which conflicts with the ranking-based prediction selection used as inference. Such a training-inference gap hampers the model's ability to learn representations aligned with inference-time behavior. To address the limitation, SR3D consists of two components tailored to the spatial nature of point clouds during training: a novel spatial-prioritized optimal transport assignment that dynamically emphasizes well-located and spatially reliable samples, and a rank-aware adaptive self-distillation scheme that adaptively injects ranking perception via a self-distillation paradigm. Extensive experiments on ScanNet V2 and SUN RGB-D show that SR3D effectively bridges the training-inference gap and significantly outperforms prior methods in accuracy while maintaining real-time speed.

Conclusion: 提出的SSCP注意力模块在WBCD网络中显著提升了水体变化的检测能力，并通过实验验证了其有效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Remote sensing Water Body Change Detection (WBCD) aims to detect water body surface changes from bi-temporal images of the same geographic area. Recently, the scarcity of high spatial resolution datasets for WBCD restricts its application in urban and rural regions, which require more accurate positioning. Meanwhile, previous deep learning-based methods fail to comprehensively exploit the spatial semantic and structural information in deep features in the change detection networks. To resolve these concerns, we first propose a new dataset, HSRW-CD, with a spatial resolution higher than 3 meters for WBCD. Specifically, it contains a large number of image pairs, widely covering various water body types. Besides, a Spatial Semantics and Continuity Perception (SSCP) attention module is designed to fully leverage both the spatial semantics and structure of deep features in the WBCD networks, significantly improving the discrimination capability for water body. The proposed SSCP has three components: the Multi-Semantic spatial Attention (MSA), the Structural Relation-aware Global Attention (SRGA), and the Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA). The MSA enhances the spatial semantics of water body features and provides precise spatial semantic priors for the CSA. Then, the SRGA further extracts spatial structure to learn the spatial continuity of the water body. Finally, the CSA utilizes the spatial semantic and structural priors from the MSA and SRGA to compute the similarity across channels. Specifically designed as a plug-and-play module for water body deep features, the proposed SSCP allows integration into existing WBCD models. Numerous experiments conducted on the proposed HSRW-CD and Water-CD datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization of the SSCP. The code of this work and the HSRW-CD dataset will be accessed at https://github.com/QingMa1/SSCP.

Conclusion: 显式推理能有效提升嵌入质量，RGE方法通过结合生成推理和对比训练，在多模态检索任务中表现优于非推理基线。

Abstract: Multimodal embeddings are widely used in downstream tasks such as multimodal retrieval, enabling alignment of interleaved modalities in a shared representation space. While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can serve as strong embedding extractors, existing approaches treat embedding extraction as a direct encoding step, overlooking the fact that MLLMs possess the generative capability for reasoning that could be leveraged to enhance representation quality. In this work, we explore how to explicitly incorporate reasoning into the embedding process. To this end, we propose Reasoning Guided Embeddings (RGE), which preserves the generative rationale process of MLLMs and couples it with contrastive training. Our method first enables the model to perform structured rationale generation conditioned on the instruction, and then extracts representations after reasoning has unfolded. This simple design enhances the context-conditional inference signals within the embedding, leading to improved multimodal representation quality. Experiments on the MMEB benchmark show that reasoning-guided conditioning improves multimodal retrieval performance by 4.9% over the non-reasoning baseline, confirming that explicit reasoning can effectively enhance embedding quality.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have shown exceptional performance in image generation, yet their large parameter counts incur high computational costs, impeding deployment in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose Pluggable Pruning with Contiguous Layer Distillation (PPCL), a flexible structured pruning framework specifically designed for DiT architectures. First, we identify redundant layer intervals through a linear probing mechanism combined with the first-order differential trend analysis of similarity metrics. Subsequently, we propose a plug-and-play teacher-student alternating distillation scheme tailored to integrate depth-wise and width-wise pruning within a single training phase. This distillation framework enables flexible knowledge transfer across diverse pruning ratios, eliminating the need for per-configuration retraining. Extensive experiments on multiple Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer architecture models demonstrate that PPCL achieves a 50\% reduction in parameter count compared to the full model, with less than 3\% degradation in key objective metrics. Notably, our method maintains high-quality image generation capabilities while achieving higher compression ratios, rendering it well-suited for resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: Video2Layout框架通过连续边界坐标显著提升了MLLMs的空间推理能力，并在多个基准测试中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is a critical frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), empowering them to comprehend the physical world. Drawing inspiration from human perception mechanisms, existing studies attempt to construct a coherent spatial understanding via grid-based cognitive maps from multi-frame visual inputs. However, current grid-based map methods rely on discretized raster representations, which limit the model's ability in fine-grained spatial reasoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose Video2Layout, a framework for reconstructing metric-grounded spatial layouts from video. The framework employs continuous object boundary coordinates to quantify inter-object physical distances and object size. This empowers the model with quantitative spatial computation capabilities, effectively alleviating the inherent ambiguity when describing spatial relationships in natural language. Specifically, our method comprises two core stages. First, in supervised fine-tuning stage, we construct a high-quality dataset from the AI2THOR simulator, which enables the model to learn the mapping from visual inputs to precise boundary coordinates. Subsequently, a reinforcement fine-tuning stage further enhances the model's real-world generalization capabilities. To systematically evaluate the correlation between cognitive map accuracy and image quantity, as well as how the quantity of image inputs affects spatial reasoning accuracy, we introduce QVS-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark designed to analyze the relevant mechanisms. Evaluated on QVS-Bench and mainstream spatial reasoning benchmarks, our model, V2LO-7B achieves an average improvement of 4.92% over the model trained on grid maps, validating the superiority of our method.

Conclusion: Simba框架通过将点云补全任务重新定义为分布学习问题，结合扩散模型的生成能力和对称性先验，显著提升了细节保留和全局结构完整性，并在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Point cloud completion is a fundamental task in 3D vision. A persistent challenge in this field is simultaneously preserving fine-grained details present in the input while ensuring the global structural integrity of the completed shape. While recent works leveraging local symmetry transformations via direct regression have significantly improved the preservation of geometric structure details, these methods suffer from two major limitations: (1) These regression-based methods are prone to overfitting which tend to memorize instant-specific transformations instead of learning a generalizable geometric prior. (2) Their reliance on point-wise transformation regression lead to high sensitivity to input noise, severely degrading their robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce Simba, a novel framework that reformulates point-wise transformation regression as a distribution learning problem. Our approach integrates symmetry priors with the powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models, avoiding instance-specific memorization while capturing robust geometric structures. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical Mamba-based architecture to achieve high-fidelity upsampling. Extensive experiments across the PCN, ShapeNet, and KITTI benchmarks validate our method's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Abstract: With the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on multimodal tasks, concerns regarding their deployment efficiency have become increasingly prominent. In particular, the number of tokens consumed during the generation process has emerged as a key evaluation metric.Prior studies have shown that specific inputs can induce VLMs to generate lengthy outputs with low information density, which significantly increases energy consumption, latency, and token costs. However, existing methods simply delay the occurrence of the EOS token to implicitly prolong output, and fail to directly maximize the output token length as an explicit optimization objective, lacking stability and controllability.To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel verbose-text induction attack (VTIA) to inject imperceptible adversarial perturbations into benign images via a two-stage framework, which identifies the most malicious prompt embeddings for optimizing and maximizing the output token of the perturbed images.Specifically, we first perform adversarial prompt search, employing reinforcement learning strategies to automatically identify adversarial prompts capable of inducing the LLM component within VLMs to produce verbose outputs. We then conduct vision-aligned perturbation optimization to craft adversarial examples on input images, maximizing the similarity between the perturbed image's visual embeddings and those of the adversarial prompt, thereby constructing malicious images that trigger verbose text generation. Comprehensive experiments on four popular VLMs demonstrate that our method achieves significant advantages in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization capability.

TL;DR: EvoVLA 是一种自监督 VLA 框架，通过 SAR、POE 和长时程记忆解决阶段幻觉问题，显著提升长时程机器人操作的性能和样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前 VLA 模型存在阶段幻觉问题，代理利用粗略评估信号在多步任务中走捷径，导致高进度报告但未真正完成任务。

Method: EvoVLA 采用自监督学习框架，包含阶段对齐奖励（SAR）、基于姿态的对象探索（POE）和长时程记忆机制。SAR 通过三元组对比学习和 Gemini 生成的难负样本来防止视觉捷径；POE 通过相对物体-夹爪姿态激发好奇心；长时程记忆通过选择性上下文保留和门控融合稳定内在塑造。

Result: 在 Discoverse-L 基准测试中，EvoVLA 平均任务成功率比基线（OpenVLA-OFT）提高 10.2 个百分点，达到 69.2%。样本效率提高 1.5 倍，阶段幻觉从 38.5% 降至 14.8%。真实机器人部署平均成功率为 54.6%，比基线高 11 个百分点。

Conclusion: EvoVLA 通过引入 SAR、POE 和 Long-Horizon Memory 三个组件，显著提升了长时程机器人操作的性能，成功率和样本效率均有显著提高，同时有效减少了阶段幻觉问题。

Abstract: Long-horizon robotic manipulation remains challenging for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models despite recent progress in zero-shot generalization and simulation-to-real-world transfer. Current VLA models suffer from stage hallucination, where agents exploit coarse evaluation signals to shortcut multi-step tasks, reporting high progress without truly completing them. We present EvoVLA, a self-supervised VLA framework that addresses this issue through three complementary components: Stage-Aligned Reward (SAR), which uses triplet contrastive learning with Gemini-generated hard negatives to prevent visual shortcuts; Pose-Based Object Exploration (POE), which grounds curiosity in relative object-gripper pose instead of raw pixels; and Long-Horizon Memory, which uses selective context retention and gated fusion to stabilize intrinsic shaping during extended rollouts. Extensive evaluations on Discoverse-L, a long-horizon manipulation benchmark with three multi-stage tasks, show that EvoVLA improves average task success by 10.2 percentage points over the strongest baseline (OpenVLA-OFT), reaching 69.2 percent. EvoVLA also achieves one-and-a-half times better sample efficiency and reduces stage hallucination from 38.5 percent to 14.8 percent. Real-world deployment on physical robots reaches an average success rate of 54.6 percent across four manipulation tasks, outperforming OpenVLA-OFT by 11 points, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer and strong generalization.

Conclusion: ReFocusing CLIP (RF-CLIP) 通过模拟人类注意力重新聚焦行为，显著提升了CLIP在密集预测任务中的性能，并在多个基准测试中达到最优表现。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) employs pixel-level vision-language alignment to associate category-related prompts with corresponding pixels. A key challenge is enhancing the multimodal dense prediction capability, specifically this pixel-level multimodal alignment. Although existing methods achieve promising results by leveraging CLIP's vision-language alignment, they rarely investigate the performance boundaries of CLIP for dense prediction from an interpretability mechanisms perspective. In this work, we systematically investigate CLIP's internal mechanisms and identify a critical phenomenon: analogous to human distraction, CLIP diverts significant attention resources from target regions to irrelevant tokens. Our analysis reveals that these tokens arise from dimension-specific over-activation; filtering them enhances CLIP's dense prediction performance. Consequently, we propose ReFocusing CLIP (RF-CLIP), a training-free approach that emulates human distraction-refocusing behavior to redirect attention from distraction tokens back to target regions, thereby refining CLIP's multimodal alignment granularity. Our method achieves SOTA performance on eight benchmarks while maintaining high inference efficiency.

Conclusion: Mantis框架通过解耦视觉预测与主干网络，结合元查询和扩散Transformer头，显著提升了视觉-语言-动作模型的性能，尤其在指令跟随、泛化能力和推理能力上表现突出。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate that visual signals can effectively complement sparse action supervisions. However, letting VLA directly predict high-dimensional visual states can distribute model capacity and incur prohibitive training cost, while compressing visual states into more compact supervisory signals inevitably incurs information bottlenecks. Moreover, existing methods often suffer from poor comprehension and reasoning capabilities due to the neglect of language supervision. This paper introduces Mantis, a novel framework featuring a Disentangled Visual Foresight (DVF) to tackle these issues. Specifically, Mantis decouples visual foresight prediction from the backbone with the combination of meta queries and a diffusion Transformer (DiT) head. With the current visual state provided to the DiT via a residual connection, a simple next-state prediction objective enables the meta queries to automatically capture the latent actions that delineate the visual trajectory, and hence boost the learning of explicit actions. The disentanglement reduces the burden of the VLA backbone, enabling it to maintain comprehension and reasoning capabilities through language supervision. Empirically, pretrained on human manipulation videos, robot demonstrations, and image-text pairs, Mantis achieves a 96.7% success rate on LIBERO benchmark after fine-tuning, surpassing powerful baselines while exhibiting high convergence speed. Real-world evaluations show that Mantis outperforms $π_{0.5}$, a leading open-source VLA model, particularly in instruction-following capability, generalization to unseen instructions, and reasoning ability. Code and weights are released to support the open-source community.

Motivation: 解决现有VI-ReID算法在真实场景中因数据差异导致的性能下降问题，提出无监督域适应方法以避免新样本标注需求。

Method: 设计了DSLGA模型，包含两个阶段：预训练阶段采用DSLS策略缓解域间模态差异，微调阶段采用GAS策略通过簇到整体对齐方式处理域内模态差异。

Result: 大量实验表明，DSLGA方法在多种设置下显著优于现有域适应方法。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的DSLGA模型在UDA-VI-ReID任务中显著优于现有方法，甚至在某些情况下超越了监督学习方法。

Abstract: Recently, Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (VI-ReID) has achieved remarkable performance on public datasets. However, due to the discrepancies between public datasets and real-world data, most existing VI-ReID algorithms struggle in real-life applications. To address this, we take the initiative to investigate Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (UDA-VI-ReID), aiming to transfer the knowledge learned from the public data to real-world data without compromising accuracy and requiring the annotation of new samples. Specifically, we first analyze two basic challenges in UDA-VI-ReID, i.e., inter-domain modality discrepancies and intra-domain modality discrepancies. Then, we design a novel two-stage model, i.e., Domain-Shared Learning and Gradual Alignment (DSLGA), to handle these discrepancies. In the first pre-training stage, DSLGA introduces a Domain-Shared Learning Strategy (DSLS) to mitigate ineffective pre-training caused by inter-domain modality discrepancies via exploiting shared information between the source and target domains. While, in the second fine-tuning stage, DSLGA designs a Gradual Alignment Strategy (GAS) to handle the cross-modality alignment challenges between visible and infrared data caused by the large intra-domain modality discrepancies through a cluster-to-holistic alignment way. Finally, a new UDA-VI-ReID testing method i.e., CMDA-XD, is constructed for training and testing different UDA-VI-ReID models. A large amount of experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation methods for VI-ReID and even some supervised methods under various settings.

Abstract: Human organs are composed of interconnected substructures whose geometry and spatial relationships constrain one another. Yet, most deep-learning approaches treat these parts independently, producing anatomically implausible reconstructions. We introduce PrIntMesh, a template-based, topology-preserving framework that reconstructs organs as unified systems. Starting from a connected template, PrIntMesh jointly deforms all substructures to match patient-specific anatomy, while explicitly preserving internal boundaries and enforcing smooth, artifact-free surfaces. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the heart, hippocampus, and lungs, achieving high geometric accuracy, correct topology, and robust performance even with limited or noisy training data. Compared to voxel- and surface-based methods, PrIntMesh better reconstructs shared interfaces, maintains structural consistency, and provides a data-efficient solution suitable for clinical use.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in embodied environments, enabling robots to perceive, reason, and act through unified multimodal understanding. Despite their impressive capabilities, the adversarial robustness of these systems remains largely unexplored, especially under realistic multimodal and black-box conditions. Existing studies mainly focus on single-modality perturbations and overlook the cross-modal misalignment that fundamentally affects embodied reasoning and decision-making. In this paper, we introduce VLA-Fool, a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in embodied VLA models under both white-box and black-box settings. VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: (1) textual perturbations through gradient-based and prompt-based manipulations, (2) visual perturbations via patch and noise distortions, and (3) cross-modal misalignment attacks that intentionally disrupt the semantic correspondence between perception and instruction. We further incorporate a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts, developing the first automatically crafted and semantically guided prompting framework. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark using a fine-tuned OpenVLA model reveal that even minor multimodal perturbations can cause significant behavioral deviations, demonstrating the fragility of embodied multimodal alignment.

Conclusion: ICCE是首个在ImageNet上准确率超过70%的全无监督图像分类方法，显著缩小了与有监督方法的性能差距。

Abstract: Unsupervised image classification, or image clustering, aims to group unlabeled images into semantically meaningful categories. Early methods integrated representation learning and clustering within an iterative framework. However, the rise of foundational models have recently shifted focus solely to clustering, bypassing the representation learning step. In this work, we build upon a recent multi-head clustering approach by introducing adaptive nearest neighbor selection and cluster ensembling strategies to improve clustering performance. Our method, "Image Clustering through Cluster Ensembles" (ICCE), begins with a clustering stage, where we train multiple clustering heads on a frozen backbone, producing diverse image clusterings. We then employ a cluster ensembling technique to consolidate these potentially conflicting results into a unified consensus clustering. Finally, we train an image classifier using the consensus clustering result as pseudo-labels. ICCE achieves state-of-the-art performance on ten image classification benchmarks, achieving 99.3% accuracy on CIFAR10, 89% on CIFAR100, and 70.4% on ImageNet datasets, narrowing the performance gap with supervised methods. To the best of our knowledge, ICCE is the first fully unsupervised image classification method to exceed 70% accuracy on ImageNet.

Abstract: Despite their advanced reasoning capabilities, state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrably lack a core component of human intelligence: the ability to `read the room' and assess deception in complex social interactions. To rigorously quantify this failure, we introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Deception Assessment (MIDA), and present a novel multimodal dataset providing synchronized video and text with verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating 12 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to effectively ground language in multimodal social cues and lack the ability to model what others know, believe, or intend, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems. To take a step forward, we design a Social Chain-of-Thought (SoCoT) reasoning pipeline and a Dynamic Social Epistemic Memory (DSEM) module. Our framework yields performance improvement on this challenging task, demonstrating a promising new path toward building MLLMs capable of genuine human-like social reasoning.

Conclusion: SwiTrack通过部署三个专用流重新定义了跨模态目标跟踪（CMOT），显著提升了跟踪精度和成功率，同时保持实时性能。

Abstract: Cross-modal object tracking (CMOT) is an emerging task that maintains target consistency while the video stream switches between different modalities, with only one modality available in each frame, mostly focusing on RGB-Near Infrared (RGB-NIR) tracking. Existing methods typically connect parallel RGB and NIR branches to a shared backbone, which limits the comprehensive extraction of distinctive modality-specific features and fails to address the issue of object drift, especially in the presence of unreliable inputs. In this paper, we propose SwiTrack, a novel state-switching framework that redefines CMOT through the deployment of three specialized streams. Specifically, RGB frames are processed by the visual encoder, while NIR frames undergo refinement via a NIR gated adapter coupled with the visual encoder to progressively calibrate shared latent space features, thereby yielding more robust cross-modal representations. For invalid modalities, a consistency trajectory prediction module leverages spatio-temporal cues to estimate target movement, ensuring robust tracking and mitigating drift. Additionally, we incorporate dynamic template reconstruction to iteratively update template features and employ a similarity alignment loss to reinforce feature consistency. Experimental results on the latest benchmarks demonstrate that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance, boosting precision rate and success rate gains by 7.2\% and 4.3\%, respectively, while maintaining real-time tracking at 65 frames per second.

Abstract: Realistic and smooth full-body tracking is crucial for immersive AR/VR applications. Existing systems primarily track head and hands via Head Mounted Devices (HMDs) and controllers, making the 3D full-body reconstruction in-complete. One potential approach is to generate the full-body motions from sparse inputs collected from limited sensors using a Neural Network (NN) model. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) backbone that is enhanced with residual connections and a novel NN-component called Memory-Block. In particular, Memory-Block represents missing sensor data with trainable code-vectors, which are combined with the sparse signals from previous time instances to improve the temporal consistency. Furthermore, we formulate our solution as a multi-task learning problem, allowing our MLP-backbone to learn robust representations that boost accuracy. Our experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by substantially reducing prediction errors. Moreover, it achieves 72 FPS on mobile HMDs that ultimately improves the accuracy-running time tradeoff.

We exploit the VGGT tracking head to aggregate 2D semantic instance masks into 3D objects. To allow for temporal consistency and richer contextual reasoning the system stores timestamps and instance-level identities, thereby enabling the detection of changes in the environment. We evaluate the approach on well-known benchmarks and custom datasets specifically designed for assistive navigation scenarios. The results demonstrate the applicability of the framework to real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid deep learning framework effectively integrates CNNs, ViTs, and GNNs for robust weed detection, achieving high accuracy and interpretability, and supports sustainable agriculture by reducing herbicide reliance.

Abstract: The task of weed detection is an essential element of precision agriculture since accurate species identification allows a farmer to selectively apply herbicides and fits into sustainable agriculture crop management. This paper proposes a hybrid deep learning framework recipe for weed detection that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to build robustness to multiple field conditions. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based augmentation method was imposed to balance class distributions and better generalize the model. Further, a self-supervised contrastive pre-training method helps to learn more features from limited annotated data. Experimental results yield superior results with 99.33% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on multi-benchmark datasets. The proposed model architecture enables local, global, and relational feature representations and offers high interpretability and adaptability. Practically, the framework allows real-time, efficient deployment of edge devices for automated weed detecting, reducing over-reliance on herbicides and providing scalable, sustainable precision-farming options.

Conclusion: Upsample Anything 是一种轻量级的测试时优化框架，无需训练即可将低分辨率特征恢复为高分辨率像素级输出，展示了在多种任务中的卓越性能和高效性。

Abstract: We present \textbf{Upsample Anything}, a lightweight test-time optimization (TTO) framework that restores low-resolution features to high-resolution, pixel-wise outputs without any training. Although Vision Foundation Models demonstrate strong generalization across diverse downstream tasks, their representations are typically downsampled by 14x/16x (e.g., ViT), which limits their direct use in pixel-level applications. Existing feature upsampling approaches depend on dataset-specific retraining or heavy implicit optimization, restricting scalability and generalization. Upsample Anything addresses these issues through a simple per-image optimization that learns an anisotropic Gaussian kernel combining spatial and range cues, effectively bridging Gaussian Splatting and Joint Bilateral Upsampling. The learned kernel acts as a universal, edge-aware operator that transfers seamlessly across architectures and modalities, enabling precise high-resolution reconstruction of features, depth, or probability maps. It runs in only $\approx0.419 \text{s}$ per 224x224 image and achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and both depth and probability map upsampling.

*Leander Girrbach,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAEs are reinterpreted as topic models, leading to SAE-TM, a framework for learning reusable topic atoms that outperforms baselines in coherence and diversity, applicable across text and image datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the role and practical value of sparse autoencoders (SAEs) by proposing a new perspective that views SAEs as topic models, enabling large-scale thematic analysis.

Method: The paper extends Latent Dirichlet Allocation to embedding spaces, deriving the SAE objective as a maximum a posteriori estimator, and introduces SAE-TM for training reusable topic atoms and merging them into topics without retraining.

Result: SAE-TM yields more coherent topics than strong baselines on text and image datasets while maintaining diversity, and successfully analyzes thematic structure in image datasets and topic changes over time.

Conclusion: SAEs are positioned as effective tools for large-scale thematic analysis across modalities, with SAE-TM demonstrating superior topic coherence and diversity compared to baselines.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to analyze embeddings, but their role and practical value are debated. We propose a new perspective on SAEs by demonstrating that they can be naturally understood as topic models. We extend Latent Dirichlet Allocation to embedding spaces and derive the SAE objective as a maximum a posteriori estimator under this model. This view implies SAE features are thematic components rather than steerable directions. Based on this, we introduce SAE-TM, a topic modeling framework that: (1) trains an SAE to learn reusable topic atoms, (2) interprets them as word distributions on downstream data, and (3) merges them into any number of topics without retraining. SAE-TM yields more coherent topics than strong baselines on text and image datasets while maintaining diversity. Finally, we analyze thematic structure in image datasets and trace topic changes over time in Japanese woodblock prints. Our work positions SAEs as effective tools for large-scale thematic analysis across modalities. Code and data will be released upon publication.

Abstract: ImageNet-1K linear-probe transfer accuracy remains the default proxy for visual representation quality, yet it no longer predicts performance on scientific imagery. Across 46 modern vision model checkpoints, ImageNet top-1 accuracy explains only 34% of variance on ecology tasks and mis-ranks 30% of models above 75% accuracy. We present BioBench, an open ecology vision benchmark that captures what ImageNet misses. BioBench unifies 9 publicly released, application-driven tasks, 4 taxonomic kingdoms, and 6 acquisition modalities (drone RGB, web video, micrographs, in-situ and specimen photos, camera-trap frames), totaling 3.1M images. A single Python API downloads data, fits lightweight classifiers to frozen backbones, and reports class-balanced macro-F1 (plus domain metrics for FishNet and FungiCLEF); ViT-L models evaluate in 6 hours on an A6000 GPU.

Motivation: 解决传统基于多视图扩散模型（MVD）的纹理生成方法在处理遮挡区域、精确网格纹理对齐以及跨视图一致性和颜色强度一致性方面的固有局限性。

Method: NaTex采用了一种新颖的范式，将纹理视为密集颜色点云，并提出潜在颜色扩散方法，包括几何感知的颜色点云VAE和多控制扩散变换器（DiT），完全基于3D数据训练。

Result: NaTex在纹理一致性和对齐方面显著优于先前方法，并在材料生成、纹理细化等下游应用中表现出色。

Conclusion: NaTex通过其创新的原生纹理生成框架，显著提升了纹理一致性和对齐性能，并在多种下游应用中展现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: We present NaTex, a native texture generation framework that predicts texture color directly in 3D space. In contrast to previous approaches that rely on baking 2D multi-view images synthesized by geometry-conditioned Multi-View Diffusion models (MVDs), NaTex avoids several inherent limitations of the MVD pipeline. These include difficulties in handling occluded regions that require inpainting, achieving precise mesh-texture alignment along boundaries, and maintaining cross-view consistency and coherence in both content and color intensity. NaTex features a novel paradigm that addresses the aforementioned issues by viewing texture as a dense color point cloud. Driven by this idea, we propose latent color diffusion, which comprises a geometry-awared color point cloud VAE and a multi-control diffusion transformer (DiT), entirely trained from scratch using 3D data, for texture reconstruction and generation. To enable precise alignment, we introduce native geometry control that conditions the DiT on direct 3D spatial information via positional embeddings and geometry latents. We co-design the VAE-DiT architecture, where the geometry latents are extracted via a dedicated geometry branch tightly coupled with the color VAE, providing fine-grained surface guidance that maintains strong correspondence with the texture. With these designs, NaTex demonstrates strong performance, significantly outperforming previous methods in texture coherence and alignment. Moreover, NaTex also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, either training-free or with simple tuning, for various downstream applications, e.g., material generation, texture refinement, and part segmentation and texturing.

Conclusion: WWE-UIE通过整合自适应白平衡、小波增强块和梯度感知模块，实现了高效且高质量的水下图像增强，适用于资源有限的实时场景。

Abstract: Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) aims to restore visibility and correct color distortions caused by wavelength-dependent absorption and scattering. Recent hybrid approaches, which couple domain priors with modern deep neural architectures, have achieved strong performance but incur high computational cost, limiting their practicality in real-time scenarios. In this work, we propose WWE-UIE, a compact and efficient enhancement network that integrates three interpretable priors. First, adaptive white balance alleviates the strong wavelength-dependent color attenuation, particularly the dominance of blue-green tones. Second, a wavelet-based enhancement block (WEB) performs multi-band decomposition, enabling the network to capture both global structures and fine textures, which are critical for underwater restoration. Third, a gradient-aware module (SGFB) leverages Sobel operators with learnable gating to explicitly preserve edge structures degraded by scattering. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that WWE-UIE achieves competitive restoration quality with substantially fewer parameters and FLOPs, enabling real-time inference on resource-limited platforms. Ablation studies and visualizations further validate the contribution of each component. The source code is available at https://github.com/chingheng0808/WWE-UIE.

TL;DR: ChangeDINO is a Siamese framework for building change detection that outperforms state-of-the-art methods by leveraging semantic-rich features and a novel decoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning-based RSCD methods underuse semantic information in non-changing regions and lack robustness under illumination variation, off-nadir views, and scarce labels.

Method: The model combines a lightweight backbone stream with features from a frozen DINOv3, uses a spatial-spectral differential transformer decoder to highlight true changes, and employs a learnable morphology module for boundary refinement.

Result: Experiments on four public benchmarks confirm ChangeDINO's superior performance in IoU and F1 metrics.

Conclusion: ChangeDINO consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in IoU and F1, demonstrating its effectiveness in optical building change detection.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) aims to identify surface changes from co-registered bi-temporal images. However, many deep learning-based RSCD methods rely solely on change-map annotations and underuse the semantic information in non-changing regions, which limits robustness under illumination variation, off-nadir views, and scarce labels. This article introduces ChangeDINO, an end-to-end multiscale Siamese framework for optical building change detection. The model fuses a lightweight backbone stream with features transferred from a frozen DINOv3, yielding semantic- and context-rich pyramids even on small datasets. A spatial-spectral differential transformer decoder then exploits multi-scale absolute differences as change priors to highlight true building changes and suppress irrelevant responses. Finally, a learnable morphology module refines the upsampled logits to recover clean boundaries. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that ChangeDINO consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in IoU and F1, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component.

Conclusion: ARASFSR方法通过创新的设计，实现了任意分辨率和任意尺度的面部超分辨率，显著提升了现有技术的性能。

Abstract: Face super-resolution (FSR) is a critical technique for enhancing low-resolution facial images and has significant implications for face-related tasks. However, existing FSR methods are limited by fixed up-sampling scales and sensitivity to input size variations. To address these limitations, this paper introduces an Arbitrary-Resolution and Arbitrary-Scale FSR method with implicit representation networks (ARASFSR), featuring three novel designs. First, ARASFSR employs 2D deep features, local relative coordinates, and up-sampling scale ratios to predict RGB values for each target pixel, allowing super-resolution at any up-sampling scale. Second, a local frequency estimation module captures high-frequency facial texture information to reduce the spectral bias effect. Lastly, a global coordinate modulation module guides FSR to leverage prior facial structure knowledge and achieve resolution adaptation effectively. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the robustness of ARASFSR over existing state-of-the-art methods while super-resolving facial images across various input sizes and up-sampling scales.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种结合教师-学生架构、关键帧选择和关键帧更新算法的框架，成功实现了弱监督学习和时间一致性知识蒸馏，克服了传统方法在航空任务中的不足。

Abstract: The study of terrain and landform classification through UAV remote sensing diverges significantly from ground vehicle patrol tasks. Besides grappling with the complexity of data annotation and ensuring temporal consistency, it also confronts the scarcity of relevant data and the limitations imposed by the effective range of many technologies. This research substantiates that, in aerial positioning tasks, both the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and temporal consistency (TC) metrics are of paramount importance. It is demonstrated that fully labeled data is not the optimal choice, as selecting only key data lacks the enhancement in TC, leading to failures. Hence, a teacher-student architecture, coupled with key frame selection and key frame updating algorithms, is proposed. This framework successfully performs weakly supervised learning and TC knowledge distillation, overcoming the deficiencies of traditional TC training in aerial tasks. The experimental results reveal that our method utilizing merely 30\% of labeled data, concurrently elevates mIoU and temporal consistency ensuring stable localization of terrain objects.

Abstract: Accurate camera localization is crucial for robotics and Extended Reality (XR), enabling reliable navigation and alignment of virtual and real content. Existing visual methods often suffer from drift, scale ambiguity, and depend on fiducials or loop closure. This work introduces a real-time method for localizing a camera within a pre-captured, highly accurate colored LiDAR point cloud. By rendering synthetic views from this cloud, 2D-3D correspondences are established between live frames and the point cloud. A neural rendering technique narrows the domain gap between synthetic and real images, reducing occlusion and background artifacts to improve feature matching. The result is drift-free camera tracking with correct metric scale in the global LiDAR coordinate system. Two real-time variants are presented: Online Render and Match, and Prebuild and Localize. We demonstrate improved results on the ScanNet++ dataset and outperform existing SLAM pipelines.

Conclusion: MOMNet提出了一种无需对齐的框架，通过多阶匹配机制和聚合策略，显著提升了深度超分辨率在未对齐RGB-D场景下的性能，表现出卓越的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent guided depth super-resolution methods are premised on the assumption of strictly spatial alignment between depth and RGB, achieving high-quality depth reconstruction. However, in real-world scenarios, the acquisition of strictly aligned RGB-D is hindered by inherent hardware limitations (e.g., physically separate RGB-D sensors) and unavoidable calibration drift induced by mechanical vibrations or temperature variations. Consequently, existing approaches often suffer inevitable performance degradation when applied to misaligned real-world scenes. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Order Matching Network (MOMNet), a novel alignment-free framework that adaptively retrieves and selects the most relevant information from misaligned RGB. Specifically, our method begins with a multi-order matching mechanism, which jointly performs zero-order, first-order, and second-order matching to comprehensively identify RGB information consistent with depth across multi-order feature spaces. To effectively integrate the retrieved RGB and depth, we further introduce a multi-order aggregation composed of multiple structure detectors. This strategy uses multi-order priors as prompts to facilitate the selective feature transfer from RGB to depth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits outstanding robustness.

Conclusion: DetailSemNet在离线签名验证（OSV）中表现出色，不仅实现了最先进的性能，还增强了模型的解释性和泛化能力，为实际应用提供了巨大潜力。

Abstract: Offline signature verification (OSV) is a frequently utilized technology in forensics. This paper proposes a new model, DetailSemNet, for OSV. Unlike previous methods that rely on holistic features for pair comparisons, our approach underscores the significance of fine-grained differences for robust OSV. We propose to match local structures between two signature images, significantly boosting verification accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that without specific architectural modifications, transformer-based backbones might naturally obscure local details, adversely impacting OSV performance. To address this, we introduce a Detail Semantics Integrator, leveraging feature disentanglement and re-entanglement. This integrator is specifically designed to enhance intricate details while simultaneously expanding discriminative semantics, thereby augmenting the efficacy of local structural matching. We evaluate our method against leading benchmarks in offline signature verification. Our model consistently outperforms recent methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with clear margins. The emphasis on local structure matching not only improves performance but also enhances the model's interpretability, supporting our findings. Additionally, our model demonstrates remarkable generalization capabilities in cross-dataset testing scenarios. The combination of generalizability and interpretability significantly bolsters the potential of DetailSemNet for real-world applications.

Conclusion: CAMS通过多维空间中的语义解缠和门控交叉注意力机制，显著提升了在未见属性-对象组合上的泛化能力，并在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to learn the concepts of attributes and objects in seen compositions and to recognize their unseen compositions. Most Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based CZSL methods focus on disentangling attributes and objects by leveraging the global semantic representation obtained from the image encoder. However, this representation has limited representational capacity and do not allow for complete disentanglement of the two. To this end, we propose CAMS, which aims to extract semantic features from visual features and perform semantic disentanglement in multidimensional spaces, thereby improving generalization over unseen attribute-object compositions. Specifically, CAMS designs a Gated Cross-Attention that captures fine-grained semantic features from the high-level image encoding blocks of CLIP through a set of latent units, while adaptively suppressing background and other irrelevant information. Subsequently, it conducts Multi-Space Disentanglement to achieve disentanglement of attribute and object semantics. Experiments on three popular benchmarks (MIT-States, UT-Zappos, and C-GQA) demonstrate that CAMS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both closed-world and open-world settings.

Conclusion: 结合稀疏6-DoF RBM和流形感知的测地损失，为图形、虚拟现实和生物力学中的实时MoCap提供了一种实用且高保真的解决方案。

Abstract: Marker-based optical motion capture (MoCap), while long regarded as the gold standard for accuracy, faces practical challenges, such as time-consuming preparation and marker identification ambiguity, due to its reliance on dense marker configurations, which fundamentally limit its scalability. To address this, we introduce a novel fundamental unit for MoCap, the Rigid Body Marker (RBM), which provides unambiguous 6-DoF data and drastically simplifies setup. Leveraging this new data modality, we develop a deep-learning-based regression model that directly estimates SMPL parameters under a geodesic loss. This end-to-end approach matches the performance of optimization-based methods while requiring over an order of magnitude less computation. Trained on synthesized data from the AMASS dataset, our end-to-end model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in body pose estimation. Real-world data captured using a Vicon optical tracking system further demonstrates the practical viability of our approach. Overall, the results show that combining sparse 6-DoF RBM with a manifold-aware geodesic loss yields a practical and high-fidelity solution for real-time MoCap in graphics, virtual reality, and biomechanics.

Conclusion: 提出的几何引导方法显著提高了多摄像头深度估计的一致性和整体精度，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Self-supervised surround-view depth estimation enables dense, low-cost 3D perception with a 360° field of view from multiple minimally overlapping images. Yet, most existing methods suffer from depth estimates that are inconsistent between overlapping images. Addressing this limitation, we propose a novel geometry-guided method for calibrated, time-synchronized multi-camera rigs that predicts dense, metric, and cross-view-consistent depth. Given the intrinsic and relative orientation parameters, a first depth map is predicted per image and the so-derived 3D points from all images are projected onto a shared unit cylinder, establishing neighborhood relations across different images. This produces a 2D position map for every image, where each pixel is assigned its projected position on the cylinder. Based on these position maps, we apply an explicit, non-learned spatial attention that aggregates features among pixels across images according to their distances on the cylinder, to predict a final depth map per image. Evaluated on the DDAD and nuScenes datasets, our approach improves the consistency of depth estimates across images and the overall depth compared to state-of-the-art methods.

(1) A static k Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) graph with a Graph Convolutional Network with Initial Residual and Identity Mapping (GCNII) enables stable long-range information propagation. (2) A dynamic Differentiable Graph Generator (DGG) with a Graph Attention Network (GAT) supports adaptive topology learning. Both models are evaluated on the Endoscapes-Seg50 and CholecSeg8k benchmarks.
  Results: The proposed approaches achieve up to 7-8% improvement in Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and 6% improvement in Mean Dice (mDice) scores over state-of-the-art baselines. It produces anatomically coherent predictions, particularly on thin, rare and safety-critical structures.
  Conclusion: The proposed graph-based segmentation methods enhance both performance and anatomical consistency in surgical scene segmentation. By combining ViT-based global context with graph-based relational reasoning, the models improve interpretability and reliability, paving the way for safer laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery through a precise identification of critical anatomical features.

Conclusion: 本文提出的LDAG架构通过语言驱动的属性泛化方法，显著提升了少样本分割的性能，达到了新的state-of-the-art水平。

Abstract: Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment novel classes under the guidance of limited support samples by a meta-learning paradigm. Existing methods mainly mine references from support images as meta guidance. However, due to intra-class variations among visual representations, the meta information extracted from support images cannot produce accurate guidance to segment untrained classes. In this paper, we argue that the references from support images may not be essential, the key to the support role is to provide unbiased meta guidance for both trained and untrained classes. We then introduce a Language-Driven Attribute Generalization (LDAG) architecture to utilize inherent target property language descriptions to build robust support strategy. Specifically, to obtain an unbiased support representation, we design a Multi-attribute Enhancement (MaE) module, which produces multiple detailed attribute descriptions of the target class through Large Language Models (LLMs), and then builds refined visual-text prior guidance utilizing multi-modal matching. Meanwhile, due to text-vision modal shift, attribute text struggles to promote visual feature representation, we design a Multi-modal Attribute Alignment (MaA) to achieve cross-modal interaction between attribute texts and visual feature. Experiments show that our proposed method outperforms existing approaches by a clear margin and achieves the new state-of-the art performance. The code will be released.

Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏针对垃圾容器跟踪的注释或是在静态环境中采集，限制了其在现实物流中的应用。

Method: 提出了StreetView-Waste数据集，并针对三个评估任务（垃圾容器检测、跟踪和溢出分割）提供了基线模型。此外，提出了两种补充策略：基于启发式的方法改进容器跟踪，以及利用几何先验优化分割的模型无关框架。

Result: 实验结果显示，微调的目标检测器在容器检测上表现良好，但基线跟踪方法在数量估计上表现不佳；提出的启发式方法将平均绝对计数误差降低了79.6%。几何感知策略在轻量级模型上将分割mAP@0.5提高了27%。

Conclusion: StreetView-Waste数据集为城市垃圾管理提供了一个具有挑战性的基准，鼓励研究面向现实世界的感知系统。

Abstract: Urban waste management remains a critical challenge for the development of smart cities. Despite the growing number of litter detection datasets, the problem of monitoring overflowing waste containers, particularly from images captured by garbage trucks, has received little attention. While existing datasets are valuable, they often lack annotations for specific container tracking or are captured in static, decontextualized environments, limiting their utility for real-world logistics. To address this gap, we present StreetView-Waste, a comprehensive dataset of urban scenes featuring litter and waste containers. The dataset supports three key evaluation tasks: (1) waste container detection, (2) waste container tracking, and (3) waste overflow segmentation. Alongside the dataset, we provide baselines for each task by benchmarking state-of-the-art models in object detection, tracking, and segmentation. Additionally, we enhance baseline performance by proposing two complementary strategies: a heuristic-based method for improved waste container tracking and a model-agnostic framework that leverages geometric priors to refine litter segmentation. Our experimental results show that while fine-tuned object detectors achieve reasonable performance in detecting waste containers, baseline tracking methods struggle to accurately estimate their number; however, our proposed heuristics reduce the mean absolute counting error by 79.6%. Similarly, while segmenting amorphous litter is challenging, our geometry-aware strategy improves segmentation mAP@0.5 by 27% on lightweight models, demonstrating the value of multimodal inputs for this task. Ultimately, StreetView-Waste provides a challenging benchmark to encourage research into real-world perception systems for urban waste management.

Conclusion: VLA-Pruner通过双级重要性标准和自适应令牌选择策略，显著提升了VLA模型的实时性能，同时保持了语义理解和动作执行的双重能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown great promise for embodied AI, yet the heavy computational cost of processing continuous visual streams severely limits their real-time deployment. Token pruning (keeping salient visual tokens and dropping redundant ones) has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), offering a solution for efficient VLA. However, these VLM-specific token pruning methods select tokens based solely on semantic salience metrics (e.g., prefill attention), while overlooking the VLA's intrinsic dual-system nature of high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution. Consequently, these methods bias token retention toward semantic cues, discard critical information for action generation, and significantly degrade VLA performance. To bridge this gap, we propose VLA-Pruner, a versatile plug-and-play VLA-specific token prune method that aligns with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploits the temporal continuity in robot manipulation. Specifically, VLA-Pruner adopts a dual-level importance criterion for visual token retention: vision-language prefill attention for semantic-level relevance and action decode attention, estimated via temporal smoothing, for action-level importance. Based on this criterion, VLA-Pruner proposes a novel dual-level token selection strategy that adaptively preserves a compact, informative set of visual tokens for both semantic understanding and action execution under given compute budget. Experiments show that VLA-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VLA architectures and diverse robotic tasks.

Conclusion: LLaVA$^3$通过仅使用多视角2D图像且无需微调的方法，显著提升了视觉语言模型（VLM）的3D场景理解能力，并在3D视觉问答和3D语言基础任务中优于现有2D基解决方案。

Abstract: Developing a multi-modal language model capable of understanding 3D scenes remains challenging due to the limited availability of 3D training data, in contrast to the abundance of 2D datasets used for vision-language models (VLM). As an alternative, we introduce LLaVA$^3$ (pronounced LLaVA-Cube), a novel method that improves the 3D scene understanding capabilities of VLM using only multi-view 2D images and without any fine-tuning. Inspired by Cubist painters, who represented multiple viewpoints of a 3D object within a single picture, we propose to describe the 3D scene for the VLM through omnidirectional visual representations of each object. These representations are derived from an intermediate multi-view 3D reconstruction of the scene. Extensive experiments on 3D VQA and 3D language grounding show that our approach outperforms previous 2D-based VLM solutions.

Abstract: The corpus callosum, the largest commissural structure in the human brain, is a central focus in research on aging and neurological diseases. It is also a critical target for interventions such as deep brain stimulation and serves as an important biomarker in clinical trials, including those investigating remyelination therapies. Despite extensive research on corpus callosum segmentation, few publicly available tools provide a comprehensive and automated analysis pipeline. To address this gap, we present FastSurfer-CC, an efficient and fully automated framework for corpus callosum morphometry. FastSurfer-CC automatically identifies mid-sagittal slices, segments the corpus callosum and fornix, localizes the anterior and posterior commissures to standardize head positioning, generates thickness profiles and subdivisions, and extracts eight shape metrics for statistical analysis. We demonstrate that FastSurfer-CC outperforms existing specialized tools across the individual tasks. Moreover, our method reveals statistically significant differences between Huntington's disease patients and healthy controls that are not detected by the current state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Video prediction is a fundamental task for various downstream applications, including robotics and world modeling. Although general video prediction models have achieved remarkable performance in standard scenarios, occlusion is still an inherent challenge in video prediction. We hypothesize that providing explicit information about motion (via point-flow) and geometric structure (via depth-maps) will enable video prediction models to perform better in situations with occlusion and the background motion. To investigate this, we present the first systematic study dedicated to occluded video prediction. We use a standard multi-object latent transformer architecture to predict future frames, but modify this to incorporate information from depth and point-flow. We evaluate this model in a controlled setting on both synthetic and real-world datasets with not only appearance-based metrics but also Wasserstein distances on object masks, which can effectively measure the motion distribution of the prediction. We find that when the prediction model is assisted with point flow and depth, it performs better in occluded scenarios and predicts more accurate background motion compared to models without the help of these modalities.

Abstract: Precise pose estimation of optical microrobots is essential for enabling high-precision object tracking and autonomous biological studies. However, current methods rely heavily on large, high-quality microscope image datasets, which are difficult and costly to acquire due to the complexity of microrobot fabrication and the labour-intensive labelling. Digital twin systems offer a promising path for sim-to-real data augmentation, yet existing techniques struggle to replicate complex optical microscopy phenomena, such as diffraction artifacts and depth-dependent imaging.This work proposes a novel physics-informed deep generative learning framework that, for the first time, integrates wave optics-based physical rendering and depth alignment into a generative adversarial network (GAN), to synthesise high-fidelity microscope images for microrobot pose estimation efficiently. Our method improves the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 35.6% compared to purely AI-driven methods, while maintaining real-time rendering speeds (0.022 s/frame).The pose estimator (CNN backbone) trained on our synthetic data achieves 93.9%/91.9% (pitch/roll) accuracy, just 5.0%/5.4% (pitch/roll) below that of an estimator trained exclusively on real data. Furthermore, our framework generalises to unseen poses, enabling data augmentation and robust pose estimation for novel microrobot configurations without additional training data.

Result: 实验表明，引入采集时间信息后，模型在域内和域外数据集上的分割性能均有所提升。

Conclusion: 利用图像采集时间知识来调制模型特征，显著提高了肿瘤分割的性能和模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) plays an important role in breast cancer screening, tumor assessment, and treatment planning and monitoring. The dynamic changes in contrast in different tissues help to highlight the tumor in post-contrast images. However, varying acquisition protocols and individual factors result in large variation in the appearance of tissues, even for images acquired in the same phase (e.g., first post-contrast phase), making automated tumor segmentation challenging. Here, we propose a tumor segmentation method that leverages knowledge of the image acquisition time to modulate model features according to the specific acquisition sequence. We incorporate the acquisition times using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layers, a lightweight method for incorporating temporal information that also allows for capitalizing on the full, variables number of images acquired per imaging study. We trained baseline and different configurations for the time-modulated models with varying backbone architectures on a large public multisite breast DCE-MRI dataset. Evaluation on in-domain images and a public out-of-domain dataset showed that incorporating knowledge of phase acquisition time improved tumor segmentation performance and model generalization.

Result: 在few-shot学习模式下，仅需每类150张图像即可达到91.3%的平均检测准确率，比现有方法提高了5.2个百分点。来源归属任务在AUC和OSCR指标上分别提升了14.70%和4.27%。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的两阶段检测框架在合成图像检测和来源归属任务上取得了显著进展，能够在不需要频繁重新训练的情况下适应快速发展的生成AI技术。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence has enabled the creation of synthetic images that are increasingly indistinguishable from authentic content, posing significant challenges for digital media integrity. This problem is compounded by the accelerated release cycle of novel generative models, which renders traditional detection approaches (reliant on periodic retraining) computationally infeasible and operationally impractical.
  This work proposes a novel two-stage detection framework designed to address the generalization challenge inherent in synthetic image detection. The first stage employs a vision deep learning model trained via supervised contrastive learning to extract discriminative embeddings from input imagery. Critically, this model was trained on a strategically partitioned subset of available generators, with specific architectures withheld from training to rigorously ablate cross-generator generalization capabilities. The second stage utilizes a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier operating on the learned embedding space, trained in a few-shot learning paradigm incorporating limited samples from previously unseen test generators.
  With merely 150 images per class in the few-shot learning regime, which are easily obtainable from current generation models, the proposed framework achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.3\%, representing a 5.2 percentage point improvement over existing approaches . For the source attribution task, the proposed approach obtains improvements of of 14.70\% and 4.27\% in AUC and OSCR respectively on an open set classification context, marking a significant advancement toward robust, scalable forensic attribution systems capable of adapting to the evolving generative AI landscape without requiring exhaustive retraining protocols.

Abstract: Using ceiling-mounted cameras (CMCs) for indoor visual capturing opens up a wide range of applications. However, registering CMCs to the target scene layout presents a challenging task. While manual registration with specialized tools is inefficient and costly, automatic registration with visual localization may yield poor results when visual ambiguity exists. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel solution for jointly mapping an indoor scene and registering CMCs to the scene layout. Our approach involves equipping a mobile agent with a head-mounted RGB-D camera to traverse the entire scene once and synchronize CMCs to capture this mobile agent. The egocentric videos generate world-coordinate agent trajectories and the scene layout, while the videos of CMCs provide pseudo-scale agent trajectories and CMC relative poses. By correlating all the trajectories with their corresponding timestamps, the CMC relative poses can be aligned to the world-coordinate scene layout. Based on this initialization, a factor graph is customized to enable the joint optimization of ego-camera poses, scene layout, and CMC poses. We also develop a new dataset, setting the first benchmark for collaborative scene mapping and CMC registration (https://sites.google.com/view/yowo/home). Experimental results indicate that our method not only effectively accomplishes two tasks within a unified framework, but also jointly enhances their performance. We thus provide a reliable tool to facilitate downstream position-aware applications.

Motivation: Address the challenge of mixed performance in CLIP when evaluating negated or paraphrased text, aiming to improve evaluation results and alignment.

Method: Proposes a new CLIP contrastive loss function and uses LLM-generated training triples (original, paraphrased, negated captions) to enhance alignment.

Result: SemCLIP improves accuracy from 68.1% to 78.1% on CC-Neg benchmark and shows better performance on downstream zero-shot classification tasks compared to CLIP.

Conclusion: SemCLIP demonstrates significant robustness to semantic transformations, improving performance on negated and paraphrased text while maintaining CLIP's original capabilities.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models continue to be the dominant approach for image and text retrieval. Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) trains two neural networks in contrastive manner to align their image and text embeddings in a shared latent space. Recent results evaluating CLIP on negated or paraphrased text have shown mixed performance because negation changes meaning radically with minimal lexical changes, while paraphrasing can create very different textual expressions with the same intended meaning. This poses a significant challenge for improving the evaluation results and alignment of vision-language models. To address this challenge, this paper evaluates the combination of paraphrasing and negation, proposes a new CLIP contrastive loss function accounting for both paraphrasing and negation, and applies LLM-generated training triples consisting of original, paraphrased and negated textual captions to CLIP-like training models. The approach, called SemCLIP, is shown to move paraphrased captions towards the original image embeddings while pushing negated captions further away in embedding space. Empirically, SemCLIP is shown to be capable of preserving CLIP's performance while increasing considerably the distances to negated captions. On the CC-Neg benchmark using an original over negation image-retrieval accuracy metric, SemCLIP improves accuracy from 68.1% to 78.1%. Although results are mixed when compared with CLIP on the Sugarcrepe++ benchmark, SemCLIP's performance is generally better than the models trained with negated captions. This robustness to negation extends to downstream zero-shot classification tasks where SemCLIP pre-trained on Sugarcrepe++ performs better than CLIP on all tested downstream tasks. These results indicate that SemCLIP can achieve significant robustness to semantic transformations.

Abstract: We introduce TimeViper, a hybrid vision-language model designed to tackle challenges of long video understanding. Processing long videos demands both an efficient model architecture and an effective mechanism for handling extended temporal contexts. To this end, TimeViper adopts a hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone that combines the efficiency of state-space models with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Through this hybrid design, we reveal the vision-to-text information aggregation phenomenon, where information progressively flows from vision tokens to text tokens across increasing LLM depth, resulting in severe vision token redundancy. Motivated by this observation, we propose TransV, a token information transfer module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens while maintaining multimodal understanding capabilities. This design enables TimeViper to process hour-long videos exceeding 10,000 frames. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TimeViper competes with state-of-the-art models while extending frame numbers. We further analyze attention behaviors of both Mamba and Transformer layers, offering new insights into hybrid model interpretability. This work represents an initial step towards developing, interpreting, and compressing hybrid Mamba-Transformer architectures.

Abstract: We present a robust multi-camera gymnast tracking, which has been applied at international gymnastics championships for gymnastics judging. Despite considerable progress in multi-camera tracking algorithms, tracking gymnasts presents unique challenges: (i) due to space restrictions, only a limited number of cameras can be installed in the gymnastics stadium; and (ii) due to variations in lighting, background, uniforms, and occlusions, multi-camera gymnast detection may fail in certain views and only provide valid detections from two opposing views. These factors complicate the accurate determination of a gymnast's 3D trajectory using conventional multi-camera triangulation. To alleviate this issue, we incorporate gymnastics domain knowledge into our tracking solution. Given that a gymnast's 3D center typically lies within a predefined vertical plane during \revised{much of their} performance, we can apply a ray-plane intersection to generate coplanar 3D trajectory candidates for opposing-view detections. More specifically, we propose a novel cascaded data association (DA) paradigm that employs triangulation to generate 3D trajectory candidates when cross-view detections are sufficient, and resort to the ray-plane intersection when they are insufficient. Consequently, coplanar candidates are used to compensate for uncertain trajectories, thereby minimizing tracking failures. The robustness of our method is validated through extensive experimentation, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in challenging scenarios. Furthermore, our gymnastics judging system, equipped with this tracking method, has been successfully applied to recent Gymnastics World Championships, earning significant recognition from the International Gymnastics Federation.

Abstract: The early detection of wildfires is a critical environmental challenge, with timely identification of smoke plumes being key to mitigating large-scale damage. While deep neural networks have proven highly effective for localization tasks, the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for smoke detection limits their potential. In response, we leverage generative AI techniques to address this data limitation by synthesizing a comprehensive, annotated smoke dataset. We then explore unsupervised domain adaptation methods for smoke plume segmentation, analyzing their effectiveness in closing the gap between synthetic and real-world data. To further refine performance, we integrate advanced generative approaches such as style transfer, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and image matting. These methods aim to enhance the realism of synthetic data and bridge the domain disparity, paving the way for more accurate and scalable wildfire detection models.

Conclusion: 本文通过改进Balanced Group Softmax框架和引入度量学习，成功提升了长尾2D目标检测的性能，达到了24.5%的mAP，超越了之前的基准。

Abstract: Object detection has been widely explored for class-balanced datasets such as COCO. However, real-world scenarios introduce the challenge of long-tailed distributions, where numerous categories contain only a few instances. This inherent class imbalance biases detection models towards the more frequent classes, degrading performance on rare categories. In this paper, we tackle the problem of long-tailed 2D object detection using the LVISv1 dataset, which consists of 1,203 categories and 164,000 images. We employ a two-stage Faster R-CNN architecture and propose enhancements to the Balanced Group Softmax (BAGS) framework to mitigate class imbalance. Our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 24.5%, surpassing the previous benchmark of 24.0%.
  Additionally, we hypothesize that tail class features may form smaller, denser clusters within the feature space of head classes, making classification challenging for regression-based classifiers. To address this issue, we explore metric learning to produce feature embeddings that are both well-separated across classes and tightly clustered within each class. For inference, we utilize a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) approach to improve classification performance, particularly for rare classes. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in advancing long-tailed object detection.

Abstract: We present SAM 3D, a generative model for visually grounded 3D object reconstruction, predicting geometry, texture, and layout from a single image. SAM 3D excels in natural images, where occlusion and scene clutter are common and visual recognition cues from context play a larger role. We achieve this with a human- and model-in-the-loop pipeline for annotating object shape, texture, and pose, providing visually grounded 3D reconstruction data at unprecedented scale. We learn from this data in a modern, multi-stage training framework that combines synthetic pretraining with real-world alignment, breaking the 3D "data barrier". We obtain significant gains over recent work, with at least a 5:1 win rate in human preference tests on real-world objects and scenes. We will release our code and model weights, an online demo, and a new challenging benchmark for in-the-wild 3D object reconstruction.

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has been introduced as a compelling alternative to NeRF for Earth observation, offering com- petitive reconstruction quality with significantly reduced training times. In this work, we extend the Earth Observation Gaussian Splatting (EOGS) framework to propose EOGS++, a novel method tailored for satellite imagery that directly operates on raw high-resolution panchromatic data without requiring external preprocessing. Furthermore, leveraging optical flow techniques we embed bundle adjustment directly within the training process, avoiding reliance on external optimization tools while improving camera pose estimation. We also introduce several improvements to the original implementation, including early stopping and TSDF post-processing, all contributing to sharper reconstructions and better geometric accuracy. Experiments on the IARPA 2016 and DFC2019 datasets demonstrate that EOGS++ achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of reconstruction quality and effi- ciency, outperforming the original EOGS method and other NeRF-based methods while maintaining the computational advantages of Gaussian Splatting. Our model demonstrates an improvement from 1.33 to 1.19 mean MAE errors on buildings compared to the original EOGS models

Conclusion: 该论文提出的教师引导剪枝框架在保持高性能的同时实现了高稀疏度，为资源受限环境提供了一种计算高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Unstructured pruning remains a powerful strategy for compressing deep neural networks, yet it often demands iterative train-prune-retrain cycles, resulting in significant computational overhead. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel teacher-guided pruning framework that tightly integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) with importance score estimation. Unlike prior approaches that apply KD as a post-pruning recovery step, our method leverages gradient signals informed by the teacher during importance score calculation to identify and retain parameters most critical for both task performance and knowledge transfer. Our method facilitates a one-shot global pruning strategy that efficiently eliminates redundant weights while preserving essential representations. After pruning, we employ sparsity-aware retraining with and without KD to recover accuracy without reactivating pruned connections. Comprehensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves high sparsity levels with minimal performance degradation. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as EPG and EPSD at high sparsity levels, while offering a more computationally efficient alternative to iterative pruning schemes like COLT. The proposed framework offers a computation-efficient, performance-preserving solution well suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Method: 提出VARiant方法，通过等距采样选择多个子网，早期尺度使用完整网络处理，后期尺度使用子网处理，并共享权重。采用渐进式训练策略优化子网和完整网络的生成质量。

Result: 实验表明VARiant-d16和VARiant-d8在保持接近VAR-d30质量的同时，内存消耗减少40-65%。VARiant-d2实现3.5倍加速和80%内存减少，质量略有下降。

Conclusion: VARiant通过子网权重共享和渐进式训练策略，在保持生成质量的同时显著降低了内存消耗和推理时间，支持灵活的部署选项。

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) models significantly reduce inference steps through the "next-scale" prediction paradigm. However, progressive multi-scale generation incurs substantial memory overhead due to cumulative KV caching, limiting practical deployment.
  We observe a scale-depth asymmetric dependency in VAR: early scales exhibit extreme sensitivity to network depth, while later scales remain robust to depth reduction. Inspired by this, we propose VARiant: by equidistant sampling, we select multiple subnets ranging from 16 to 2 layers from the original 30-layer VAR-d30 network. Early scales are processed by the full network, while later scales utilize subnet. Subnet and the full network share weights, enabling flexible depth adjustment within a single model.
  However, weight sharing between subnet and the entire network can lead to optimization conflicts. To address this, we propose a progressive training strategy that breaks through the Pareto frontier of generation quality for both subnets and the full network under fixed-ratio training, achieving joint optimality.
  Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that, compared to the pretrained VAR-d30 (FID 1.95), VARiant-d16 and VARiant-d8 achieve nearly equivalent quality (FID 2.05/2.12) while reducing memory consumption by 40-65%. VARiant-d2 achieves 3.5 times speedup and 80% memory reduction at moderate quality cost (FID 2.97). In terms of deployment, VARiant's single-model architecture supports zero-cost runtime depth switching and provides flexible deployment options from high quality to extreme efficiency, catering to diverse application scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in stereo matching have focused on accuracy, often at the cost of significantly increased model size. Traditionally, the community has regarded efficient models as incapable of zero-shot ability due to their limited capacity. In this paper, we introduce Lite Any Stereo, a stereo depth estimation framework that achieves strong zero-shot generalization while remaining highly efficient. To this end, we design a compact yet expressive backbone to ensure scalability, along with a carefully crafted hybrid cost aggregation module. We further propose a three-stage training strategy on million-scale data to effectively bridge the sim-to-real gap. Together, these components demonstrate that an ultra-light model can deliver strong generalization, ranking 1st across four widely used real-world benchmarks. Remarkably, our model attains accuracy comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art non-prior-based accurate methods while requiring less than 1% computational cost, setting a new standard for efficient stereo matching.

Abstract: Recent advances in visual generation have increasingly explored the integration of reasoning capabilities. They incorporate textual reasoning, i.e., think, either before (as pre-planning) or after (as post-refinement) the generation process, yet they lack on-the-fly multimodal interaction during the generation itself. In this preliminary study, we introduce Thinking-while-Generating (TwiG), the first interleaved framework that enables co-evolving textual reasoning throughout the visual generation process. As visual content is progressively generating, textual reasoning is interleaved to both guide upcoming local regions and reflect on previously synthesized ones. This dynamic interplay produces more context-aware and semantically rich visual outputs. To unveil the potential of this framework, we investigate three candidate strategies, zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our curated TwiG-50K dataset, and reinforcement learning (RL) via a customized TwiG-GRPO strategy, each offering unique insights into the dynamics of interleaved reasoning. We hope this work inspires further research into interleaving textual reasoning for enhanced visual generation. Code will be released at: https://github.com/ZiyuGuo99/Thinking-while-Generating.

Abstract: The task of dataset distillation aims to find a small set of synthetic images such that training a model on them reproduces the performance of the same model trained on a much larger dataset of real samples. Existing distillation methods focus on synthesizing datasets that enable training randomly initialized models. In contrast, state-of-the-art vision approaches are increasingly building on large, pre-trained self-supervised models rather than training from scratch. In this paper, we investigate the problem of distilling datasets that enable us to optimally train linear probes on top of such large, pre-trained vision models. We introduce a method of dataset distillation for this task called Linear Gradient Matching that optimizes the synthetic images such that, when passed through a pre-trained feature extractor, they induce gradients in the linear classifier similar to those produced by the real data. Our method yields synthetic data that outperform all real-image baselines and, remarkably, generalize across pre-trained vision models, enabling us, for instance, to train a linear CLIP probe that performs competitively using a dataset distilled via a DINO backbone. Further, we show that our distilled datasets are exceptionally effective for fine-grained classification and provide a valuable tool for model interpretability, predicting, among other things, how similar two models' embedding spaces are under the platonic representation hypothesis or whether a model is sensitive to spurious correlations in adversarial datasets.

Conclusion: POMA-3D 提出了一种基于点图的3D场景理解方法，解决了3D表示学习中预训练先验和数据稀缺的问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce POMA-3D, the first self-supervised 3D representation model learned from point maps. Point maps encode explicit 3D coordinates on a structured 2D grid, preserving global 3D geometry while remaining compatible with the input format of 2D foundation models. To transfer rich 2D priors into POMA-3D, a view-to-scene alignment strategy is designed. Moreover, as point maps are view-dependent with respect to a canonical space, we introduce POMA-JEPA, a joint embedding-predictive architecture that enforces geometrically consistent point map features across multiple views. Additionally, we introduce ScenePoint, a point map dataset constructed from 6.5K room-level RGB-D scenes and 1M 2D image scenes to facilitate large-scale POMA-3D pretraining. Experiments show that POMA-3D serves as a strong backbone for both specialist and generalist 3D understanding. It benefits diverse tasks, including 3D question answering, embodied navigation, scene retrieval, and embodied localization, all achieved using only geometric inputs (i.e., 3D coordinates). Overall, our POMA-3D explores a point map way to 3D scene understanding, addressing the scarcity of pretrained priors and limited data in 3D representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for selectively removing knowledge from medical segmentation networks for privacy compliance, ethical deployment, and continual dataset revision.

Method: The method uses a teacher-student distillation paradigm with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrained subspace updates, enabling targeted forgetting through adversarial optimization and gentle restoration phases.

Result: On ISIC segmentation, forget-set IoU reduced from 0.875 to 0.509 while maintaining performance on retain and validation splits. On CHASE dataset, similar trends were observed. For ISIC classification, forget subset accuracy decreased from 87.0% to 64.1% while retain accuracy improved from 83.9% to 90.6%.

Conclusion: LoRA-based subspace unlearning provides a practical pathway toward responsible, controllable, and reversible unlearning in medical image analysis, enabling models to forget sensitive samples or structures while preserving performance where it matters most.

Abstract: The ability to selectively remove knowledge from medical segmentation networks is increasingly important for privacy compliance, ethical deployment, and continual dataset revision. We introduce Erase to Retain, a controllable unlearning framework for medical image segmentation that achieves targeted forgetting without full retraining. Our method uses a teacher-student distillation paradigm with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrained subspace updates, enabling the student network to erase lesion-specific or class-specific representations in low-rank decoder spaces while preserving global anatomical understanding. During the strong unlearning phase, LoRA modules are adversarially optimized to contradict the teacher's confident predictions on a designated forget subset, enforcing semantic removal. This is followed by a gentle restoration phase that recovers generalization on retained data through head-only supervised refinement.
  For ISIC segmentation, the student reduces forget-set IoU from 0.875 to 0.509 while maintaining competitive performance on the retain and validation splits (0.647 to 0.677 IoU). On the cross-domain CHASE dataset, Erase to Retain consistently lowers forget-set IoU while preserving utility on retain and validation sets. For ISIC classification, our method decreases accuracy on the forget subset from 87.0 percent to 64.1 percent while improving retain accuracy from 83.9 percent to 90.6 percent.
  These results demonstrate that LoRA-based subspace unlearning provides a practical pathway toward responsible, controllable, and reversible unlearning in medical image analysis, enabling models to forget sensitive samples or structures while preserving performance where it matters most.

Abstract: Surgical video segmentation is crucial for computer-assisted surgery, enabling precise localization and tracking of instruments and tissues. Interactive Video Object Segmentation (iVOS) models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) provide prompt-based flexibility beyond methods with predefined categories, but face challenges in surgical scenarios due to the domain gap and limited long-term tracking. To address these limitations, we construct SA-SV, the largest surgical iVOS benchmark with instance-level spatio-temporal annotations (masklets) spanning eight procedure types (61k frames, 1.6k masklets), enabling comprehensive development and evaluation for long-term tracking and zero-shot generalization. Building on SA-SV, we propose SAM2S, a foundation model enhancing \textbf{SAM2} for \textbf{S}urgical iVOS through: (1) DiveMem, a trainable diverse memory mechanism for robust long-term tracking; (2) temporal semantic learning for instrument understanding; and (3) ambiguity-resilient learning to mitigate annotation inconsistencies across multi-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning on SA-SV enables substantial performance gains, with SAM2 improving by 12.99 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$ over vanilla SAM2. SAM2S further advances performance to 80.42 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$, surpassing vanilla and fine-tuned SAM2 by 17.10 and 4.11 points respectively, while maintaining 68 FPS real-time inference and strong zero-shot generalization.

Motivation: 现有引导方法在低光照图像上效果不佳，因高噪声和低亮度导致特征不足。

Method: 基于引导图像方法，通过多参数优化学习低光照与明亮图像特征之间的关联。

Result: AGU能同时优化多项图像质量特征（如降噪和锐化），实验证明其在低光照场景下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AGU方法在低光照图像提升方面表现出色，能够实时生成高质量图像，优于现有技术。

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Guided Upsampling (AGU), an efficient method for upscaling low-light images capable of optimizing multiple image quality characteristics at the same time, such as reducing noise and increasing sharpness. It is based on a guided image method, which transfers image characteristics from a guidance image to the target image. Using state-of-the-art guided methods, low-light images lack sufficient characteristics for this purpose due to their high noise level and low brightness, rendering suboptimal/not significantly improved images in the process. We solve this problem with multi-parameter optimization, learning the association between multiple low-light and bright image characteristics. Our proposed machine learning method learns these characteristics from a few sample images-pairs. AGU can render high-quality images in real time using low-quality, low-resolution input; our experiments demonstrate that it is superior to state-of-the-art methods in the addressed low-light use case.

Motivation: 现有生存分析方法缺乏临床所需的透明度，且无法整合多模态数据、有效探索感兴趣区域或利用历史病例的经验学习。

Method: SurvAgent采用两阶段方法：1) WSI-Gene CoT增强病例库构建，通过低倍筛查、跨模态相似性感知补丁挖掘和置信感知补丁挖掘处理病理图像，同时进行基因分层分析；2) 基于二分法的多专家代理推理，通过RAG检索相似病例并整合多模态报告与专家预测。

Conclusion: SurvAgent通过分层思维链增强的多代理系统，为多模态生存预测建立了可解释AI驱动的新范式，优于传统方法和现有医疗代理。

Abstract: Survival analysis is critical for cancer prognosis and treatment planning, yet existing methods lack the transparency essential for clinical adoption. While recent pathology agents have demonstrated explainability in diagnostic tasks, they face three limitations for survival prediction: inability to integrate multimodal data, ineffective region-of-interest exploration, and failure to leverage experiential learning from historical cases. We introduce SurvAgent, the first hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT)-enhanced multi-agent system for multimodal survival prediction. SurvAgent consists of two stages: (1) WSI-Gene CoT-Enhanced Case Bank Construction employs hierarchical analysis through Low-Magnification Screening, Cross-Modal Similarity-Aware Patch Mining, and Confidence-Aware Patch Mining for pathology images, while Gene-Stratified analysis processes six functional gene categories. Both generate structured reports with CoT reasoning, storing complete analytical processes for experiential learning. (2) Dichotomy-Based Multi-Expert Agent Inference retrieves similar cases via RAG and integrates multimodal reports with expert predictions through progressive interval refinement. Extensive experiments on five TCGA cohorts demonstrate SurvAgent's superority over conventional methods, proprietary MLLMs, and medical agents, establishing a new paradigm for explainable AI-driven survival prediction in precision oncology.

Conclusion: TRIM通过时间与空间修剪策略显著提升了3D高斯扩散模型的效率与生成质量，支持推理时的扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian diffusion models suffer from time-intensive denoising and post-denoising processing due to the massive number of Gaussian primitives, resulting in slow generation and limited scalability along sampling trajectories. To improve the efficiency of 3D diffusion models, we propose $\textbf{TRIM}$ ($\textbf{T}$rajectory $\textbf{R}$eduction and $\textbf{I}$nstance $\textbf{M}$ask denoising), a post-training approach that incorporates both temporal and spatial trimming strategies, to accelerate inference without compromising output quality while supporting the inference-time scaling for Gaussian diffusion models. Instead of scaling denoising trajectories in a costly end-to-end manner, we develop a lightweight selector model to evaluate latent Gaussian primitives derived from multiple sampled noises, enabling early trajectory reduction by selecting candidates with high-quality potential. Furthermore, we introduce instance mask denoising to prune learnable Gaussian primitives by filtering out redundant background regions, reducing inference computation at each denoising step. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that TRIM significantly improves both the efficiency and quality of 3D generation.

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过解耦结构和双分支监督机制，有效解决了多层级冲突和类别不平衡问题，在多个数据集和骨干网络上实现了最先进的3DHS性能。

Abstract: 3D hierarchical semantic segmentation (3DHS) is crucial for embodied intelligence applications that demand a multi-grained and multi-hierarchy understanding of 3D scenes. Despite the progress, previous 3DHS methods have overlooked following two challenges: I) multi-label learning with a parameter-sharing model can lead to multi-hierarchy conflicts in cross-hierarchy optimization, and II) the class imbalance issue is inevitable across multiple hierarchies of 3D scenes, which makes the model performance become dominated by major classes. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework with a primary 3DHS branch and an auxiliary discrimination branch. Specifically, to alleviate the multi-hierarchy conflicts, we propose a late-decoupled 3DHS framework which employs multiple decoders with the coarse-to-fine hierarchical guidance and consistency. The late-decoupled architecture can mitigate the underfitting and overfitting conflicts among multiple hierarchies and can also constrain the class imbalance problem in each individual hierarchy. Moreover, we introduce a 3DHS-oriented semantic prototype based bi-branch supervision mechanism, which additionally learns class-wise discriminative point cloud features and performs mutual supervision between the auxiliary and 3DHS branches, to enhance the class-imbalance segmentation. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbones demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art 3DHS performance, and its core components can also be used as a plug-and-play enhancement to improve previous methods.

TL;DR: 研究发现Cambrian-S的基准测试和推理方法存在问题，无法有效衡量空间超感知能力，且其性能提升可能来自捷径而非真正的感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估Cambrian-S在视频世界模型中引入的空间超感知能力及其基准测试的有效性。

Method: 研究通过引入简单的基线方法NoSense和对VSC基准测试进行简单扰动（VSC-Repeat）来评估Cambrian-S的性能。

Result: NoSense在VSR基准测试中达到95%的准确率，而VSC-Repeat扰动使Cambrian-S的准确率从42%降至0%，表明其推理方法依赖捷径。

Conclusion: 当前的研究表明，VSI-Super基准测试尚未能可靠地衡量空间超感知能力，而Cambrian-S的推理方法可能利用了基准测试中的捷径而非真正的空间超感知能力。

Abstract: Cambrian-S aims to take the first steps towards improving video world models with spatial supersensing by introducing (i) two benchmarks, VSI-Super-Recall (VSR) and VSI-Super-Counting (VSC), and (ii) bespoke predictive sensing inference strategies tailored to each benchmark. In this work, we conduct a critical analysis of Cambrian-S across both these fronts. First, we introduce a simple baseline, NoSense, which discards almost all temporal structure and uses only a bag-of-words SigLIP model, yet near-perfectly solves VSR, achieving 95% accuracy even on 4-hour videos. This shows benchmarks like VSR can be nearly solved without spatial cognition, world modeling or spatial supersensing. Second, we hypothesize that the tailored inference methods proposed by Cambrian-S likely exploit shortcut heuristics in the benchmark. We illustrate this with a simple sanity check on the VSC benchmark, called VSC-Repeat: We concatenate each video with itself 1-5 times, which does not change the number of unique objects. However, this simple perturbation entirely collapses the mean relative accuracy of Cambrian-S from 42% to 0%. A system that performs spatial supersensing and integrates information across experiences should recognize views of the same scene and keep object-count predictions unchanged; instead, Cambrian-S inference algorithm relies largely on a shortcut in the VSC benchmark that rooms are never revisited. Taken together, our findings suggest that (i) current VSI-Super benchmarks do not yet reliably measure spatial supersensing, and (ii) predictive-sensing inference recipes used by Cambrian-S improve performance by inadvertently exploiting shortcuts rather than from robust spatial supersensing. We include the response from the Cambrian-S authors (in Appendix A) to provide a balanced perspective alongside our claims. We release our code at: https://github.com/bethgelab/supersanity

Conclusion: TriDiff-4D 通过扩散模型和自回归策略，显著提升了4D头像生成的效率和质量，解决了现有方法在时间一致性、运动准确性和计算成本上的问题。

Abstract: With the increasing demand for 3D animation, generating high-fidelity, controllable 4D avatars from textual descriptions remains a significant challenge. Despite notable efforts in 4D generative modeling, existing methods exhibit fundamental limitations that impede their broader applicability, including temporal and geometric inconsistencies, perceptual artifacts, motion irregularities, high computational costs, and limited control over dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose TriDiff-4D, a novel 4D generative pipeline that employs diffusion-based triplane re-posing to produce high-quality, temporally coherent 4D avatars. Our model adopts an auto-regressive strategy to generate 4D sequences of arbitrary length, synthesizing each 3D frame with a single diffusion process. By explicitly learning 3D structure and motion priors from large-scale 3D and motion datasets, TriDiff-4D enables skeleton-driven 4D generation that excels in temporal consistency, motion accuracy, computational efficiency, and visual fidelity. Specifically, TriDiff-4D first generates a canonical 3D avatar and a corresponding motion sequence from a text prompt, then uses a second diffusion model to animate the avatar according to the motion sequence, supporting arbitrarily long 4D generation. Experimental results demonstrate that TriDiff-4D significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing generation time from hours to seconds by eliminating the optimization process, while substantially improving the generation of complex motions with high-fidelity appearance and accurate 3D geometry.

Conclusion: SceneDesigner显著优于现有方法，在可控性和生成质量上均有提升，代码已开源。

Abstract: Controllable image generation has attracted increasing attention in recent years, enabling users to manipulate visual content such as identity and style. However, achieving simultaneous control over the 9D poses (location, size, and orientation) of multiple objects remains an open challenge. Despite recent progress, existing methods often suffer from limited controllability and degraded quality, falling short of comprehensive multi-object 9D pose control. To address these limitations, we propose SceneDesigner, a method for accurate and flexible multi-object 9-DoF pose manipulation. SceneDesigner incorporates a branched network to the pre-trained base model and leverages a new representation, CNOCS map, which encodes 9D pose information from the camera view. This representation exhibits strong geometric interpretation properties, leading to more efficient and stable training. To support training, we construct a new dataset, ObjectPose9D, which aggregates images from diverse sources along with 9D pose annotations. To further address data imbalance issues, particularly performance degradation on low-frequency poses, we introduce a two-stage training strategy with reinforcement learning, where the second stage fine-tunes the model using a reward-based objective on rebalanced data. At inference time, we propose Disentangled Object Sampling, a technique that mitigates insufficient object generation and concept confusion in complex multi-object scenes. Moreover, by integrating user-specific personalization weights, SceneDesigner enables customized pose control for reference subjects. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that SceneDesigner significantly outperforms existing approaches in both controllability and quality.

Abstract: Recent progress in generative video models, such as Veo-3, has shown surprising zero-shot reasoning abilities, creating a growing need for systematic and reliable evaluation. We introduce V-ReasonBench, a benchmark designed to assess video reasoning across four key dimensions: structured problem-solving, spatial cognition, pattern-based inference, and physical dynamics. The benchmark is built from both synthetic and real-world image sequences and provides a diverse set of answer-verifiable tasks that are reproducible, scalable, and unambiguous. Evaluations of six state-of-the-art video models reveal clear dimension-wise differences, with strong variation in structured, spatial, pattern-based, and physical reasoning. We further compare video models with strong image models, analyze common hallucination behaviors, and study how video duration affects Chain-of-Frames reasoning. Overall, V-ReasonBench offers a unified and reproducible framework for measuring video reasoning and aims to support the development of models with more reliable, human-aligned reasoning skills.

Conclusion: VANS模型通过强化学习将视觉语言模型（VLM）与视频扩散模型（VDM）对齐，解决了VNEP任务中的挑战，并在视频事件预测和可视化方面实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: While language models have become impactful in many real-world applications, video generation remains largely confined to entertainment. Motivated by video's inherent capacity to demonstrate physical-world information that is difficult to convey through language alone (e.g., imagine teaching someone to tie a tie using only text), we identify an underutilized opportunity to extend video as a new answer modality for Next-Event Prediction (NEP), formalized as Video-Next-Event Prediction (VNEP). While the established NEP task takes a video with a procedural or predictive question as input to predict the next event in text, VNEP requires dynamic video responses. This shift from telling to showing unlocks more intuitive and customized answers for procedural learning and creative exploration. However, this task remains challenging for existing models, as it demands an understanding of multimodal input, instruction-conditioned reasoning, and the generation of video with visual and semantic consistency. To address this, we introduce VANS, a model that leverages reinforcement learning to align a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) for VNEP. The core of VANS is our proposed Joint-GRPO that orchestrates the VLM and VDM to function as a unit. Driven by a shared reward on their respective output, it optimizes the VLM to produce captions that are both accurate and friendly to visualize, while guiding the VDM to generate videos that are faithful to these captions and the input visual context. To enable this learning, we craft VANS-Data-100K, a dedicated dataset for the VNEP task. Experiments on procedural and predictive benchmarks demonstrate that VANS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both video event prediction and visualization. Codes are released in https://github.com/KlingTeam/VANS.

Conclusion: DualMindVLM通过简单的强化学习方法实现了视觉语言模型在快慢思维模式间的自动切换，显著提升了模型性能并保持了高效的token利用率。

Abstract: When confronted with complex problems, we tend to think slowly; conversely, for simple questions, we think quickly. Such a two-system thinking mechanism allows us to efficiently allocate cognitive resources, enabling quick decision-making for straightforward issues while reserving deeper analytical thinking for more intricate challenges. However, existing reasoning-oriented visual language models (VLMs), whether trained with explicit chain-of-thought annotations or rule-based RL rewards, mainly pursue lengthy, detailed reasoning chains, which often lead to excessive computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple RL approach, which enables VLMs to automatically switch between fast and slow thinking modes depending on task difficulty. The approach consists of two stages: in the first stage, we label data as either requiring fast thinking or slow thinking based on the model output length, which is inspired by the observation that pre-trained VLMs typically produce answers of varying lengths for different types of questions; in the second stage, we train the model using GRPO along with the thinking mode labels to develop dual-mode thinking. Despite its simplicity, our model, named DualMindVLM, significantly outperforms the base model and achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art visual reasoning models, while maintaining exceptionally high token efficiency.

Conclusion: EvoLMM框架通过自进化机制显著提升了大型多模态模型的推理能力，无需人工标注数据或外部奖励模型，为未来完全无监督的自改进LMM研究提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have enabled impressive reasoning and perception abilities, yet most existing training pipelines still depend on human-curated data or externally verified reward models, limiting their autonomy and scalability. In this work, we strive to improve LMM reasoning capabilities in a purely unsupervised fashion (without any annotated data or reward distillation). To this end, we propose a self-evolving framework, named EvoLMM, that instantiates two cooperative agents from a single backbone model: a Proposer, which generates diverse, image-grounded questions, and a Solver, which solves them through internal consistency, where learning proceeds through a continuous self-rewarding process. This dynamic feedback encourages both the generation of informative queries and the refinement of structured reasoning without relying on ground-truth or human judgments. When using the popular Qwen2.5-VL as the base model, our EvoLMM yields consistent gains upto $\sim$3\% on multimodal math-reasoning benchmarks, including ChartQA, MathVista, and MathVision, using only raw training images. We hope our simple yet effective approach will serve as a solid baseline easing future research in self-improving LMMs in a fully-unsupervised fashion.

Method: 提出了NoPo-Avatar，一种无需姿态输入的重建方法，通过消除对测试时人体姿态的依赖，避免因姿态估计噪声导致的性能下降。

Result: 在THuman2.0、XHuman和HuGe100K数据集上的实验表明，NoPo-Avatar在无真实姿态的实用场景中优于基线方法，在实验室设置（有真实姿态）中表现相当。

Conclusion: NoPo-Avatar在无需姿态输入的情况下，能够从单张或稀疏图像中重建可动画化的3D人体化身，且在无真实姿态的实用场景中表现优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: We tackle the task of recovering an animatable 3D human avatar from a single or a sparse set of images. For this task, beyond a set of images, many prior state-of-the-art methods use accurate "ground-truth" camera poses and human poses as input to guide reconstruction at test-time. We show that pose-dependent reconstruction degrades results significantly if pose estimates are noisy. To overcome this, we introduce NoPo-Avatar, which reconstructs avatars solely from images, without any pose input. By removing the dependence of test-time reconstruction on human poses, NoPo-Avatar is not affected by noisy human pose estimates, making it more widely applicable. Experiments on challenging THuman2.0, XHuman, and HuGe100K data show that NoPo-Avatar outperforms existing baselines in practical settings (without ground-truth poses) and delivers comparable results in lab settings (with ground-truth poses).

Conclusion: eLLM框架通过集成多个大型语言模型，显著提升了文本分类的性能，减少了对人工标注的依赖，并达到了接近专家水平的分类效果。

Abstract: This study introduces an ensemble framework for unstructured text categorization using large language models (LLMs). By integrating multiple models, the ensemble large language model (eLLM) framework addresses common weaknesses of individual systems, including inconsistency, hallucination, category inflation, and misclassification. The eLLM approach yields a substantial performance improvement of up to 65\% in F1-score over the strongest single model. We formalize the ensemble process through a mathematical model of collective decision-making and establish principled aggregation criteria. Using the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) hierarchical taxonomy, we evaluate ten state-of-the-art LLMs under identical zero-shot conditions on a human-annotated corpus of 8{,}660 samples. Results show that individual models plateau in performance due to the compression of semantically rich text into sparse categorical representations, while eLLM improves both robustness and accuracy. With a diverse consortium of models, eLLM achieves near human-expert-level performance, offering a scalable and reliable solution for taxonomy-based classification that may significantly reduce dependence on human expert labeling.

Result: 我们制定了一个优化目标，最小化总推理成本并通过存储和生成的工作流之间的不一致性进行正则化，为智能系统中的效率-一致性权衡提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 该框架为可解释、成本高效且自我改进的推理架构奠定了基础，朝着大规模代理系统中的持久内存迈出了一步。

Abstract: Modern large language model-based reasoning systems frequently recompute similar reasoning steps across tasks, wasting computational resources, inflating inference latency, and limiting reproducibility. These inefficiencies underscore the need for persistent reasoning mechanisms that can recall and reuse prior computational traces.
  We introduce Graph-Memoized Reasoning, a formal framework for representing, storing, and reusing reasoning workflows as graph-structured memory. By encoding past decision graphs and retrieving them through structural and semantic similarity, our approach enables compositional reuse of subgraphs across new reasoning tasks.
  We formulate an optimization objective that minimizes total reasoning cost regularized by inconsistency between stored and generated workflows, providing a theoretical foundation for efficiency-consistency trade-offs in intelligent systems. We outline a conceptual evaluation protocol aligned with the proposed optimization objective.
  This framework establishes the groundwork for interpretable, cost-efficient, and self-improving reasoning architectures, offering a step toward persistent memory in large-scale agentic systems.

Abstract: As Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning systems are used in safety critical applications. Understanding why agents make decisions and how they achieve collective behavior is crucial. Existing explainable AI methods struggle in multi agent settings. They fail to attribute collective outcomes to individuals, quantify emergent behaviors, or capture complex interactions. We present MACIE Multi Agent Causal Intelligence Explainer, a framework combining structural causal models, interventional counterfactuals, and Shapley values to provide comprehensive explanations. MACIE addresses three questions. First, each agent's causal contribution using interventional attribution scores. Second, system level emergent intelligence through synergy metrics separating collective effects from individual contributions. Third, actionable explanations using natural language narratives synthesizing causal insights. We evaluate MACIE across four MARL scenarios: cooperative, competitive, and mixed motive. Results show accurate outcome attribution, mean phi_i equals 5.07, standard deviation less than 0.05, detection of positive emergence in cooperative tasks, synergy index up to 0.461, and efficient computation, 0.79 seconds per dataset on CPU. MACIE uniquely combines causal rigor, emergence quantification, and multi agent support while remaining practical for real time use. This represents a step toward interpretable, trustworthy, and accountable multi agent AI.

Motivation: 缺乏关于编码如何影响模型感知以及如何区分指令错误和执行错误的系统性解释。假设模态会引入感知瓶颈，从而影响网格特征的可靠感知。

Method: 使用加权集合不一致度量和两阶段推理流程，在九种文本和图像模态中隔离感知与推理。

Result: 结构化文本在稀疏特征上提供精确坐标，图像捕捉2D形状但对分辨率敏感，结合两者可提升执行效果（约8个感知点；约0.20中位数相似度）。

Conclusion: 对齐表示与Transformer的归纳偏置，并实现文本和图像之间的交叉验证，可以在不改变底层模型的情况下产生更准确的指令和更可靠的执行。

Abstract: ARC-AGI and ARC-AGI-2 measure generalization-through-composition on small color-quantized grids, and their prize competitions make progress on these harder held-out tasks a meaningful proxy for systematic generalization. Recent instruction-first systems translate grids into concise natural-language or DSL rules executed in generate-execute-select loops, yet we lack a principled account of how encodings shape model perception and how to separate instruction errors from execution errors. We hypothesize that modality imposes perceptual bottlenecks -- text flattens 2D structure into 1D tokens while images preserve layout but can introduce patch-size aliasing -- thereby shaping which grid features are reliably perceived. To test this, we isolate perception from reasoning across nine text and image modalities using a weighted set-disagreement metric and a two-stage reasoning pipeline, finding that structured text yields precise coordinates on sparse features, images capture 2D shapes yet are resolution-sensitive, and combining them improves execution (about 8 perception points; about 0.20 median similarity). Overall, aligning representations with transformer inductive biases and enabling cross-validation between text and image yields more accurate instructions and more reliable execution without changing the underlying model.

Motivation: The scarcity of high-quality trajectories hinders the development of stronger LLM agents, and existing works overlook turn-level errors that degrade model performance.

Method: The data synthesis pipeline constructs a function graph based on parameter correlations and uses a multi-agent framework to simulate realistic user-assistant-tool interactions. Fine-grained turn-level filtering is employed to remove erroneous or suboptimal steps.

Result: ToolMind introduces a large-scale, high-quality tool-agentic dataset with 160k synthetic data instances and 200k augmented open-source data instances.

Conclusion: Models fine-tuned on ToolMind show significant improvements over baselines on several benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have developed rapidly in recent years to solve complex real-world problems using external tools. However, the scarcity of high-quality trajectories still hinders the development of stronger LLM agents. Most existing works on multi-turn dialogue synthesis validate correctness only at the trajectory level, which may overlook turn-level errors that can propagate during training and degrade model performance. To address these limitations, we introduce ToolMind, a large-scale, high-quality tool-agentic dataset with 160k synthetic data instances generated using over 20k tools and 200k augmented open-source data instances. Our data synthesis pipeline first constructs a function graph based on parameter correlations and then uses a multi-agent framework to simulate realistic user-assistant-tool interactions. Beyond trajectory-level validation, we employ fine-grained turn-level filtering to remove erroneous or suboptimal steps, ensuring that only high-quality reasoning traces are retained. This approach mitigates error amplification during training while preserving self-corrective reasoning signals essential for robust tool-use learning. Models fine-tuned on ToolMind show significant improvements over baselines on several benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决LLMs因不友好格式和上下文长度限制难以消化外部网络内容的问题。

Method: 提出的Chain of Summaries (CoS)方法，受黑格尔辩证法启发，通过迭代精炼初始摘要（论点），通过质疑（反论点）识别其局限性，最终生成满足当前和未来信息需求的通用摘要（综合）。

Result: 在TriviaQA、TruthfulQA和SQUAD数据集上的实验表明，CoS比零样本LLM基线高出66%，比专业摘要方法如BRIO和PEGASUS高出27%。CoS生成的摘要比源内容具有更高的Q&A性能，同时需要更少的token且对下游LLM无特定要求。

Conclusion: CoS方法为网站维护者提供了一种吸引人的选择，使其内容更易于LLMs访问，同时保留了人类监督的可能性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly using external web content. However, much of this content is not easily digestible by LLMs due to LLM-unfriendly formats and limitations of context length. To address this issue, we propose a method for generating general-purpose, information-dense summaries that act as plain-text repositories of web content. Inspired by Hegel's dialectical method, our approach, denoted as Chain of Summaries (CoS), iteratively refines an initial summary (thesis) by identifying its limitations through questioning (antithesis), leading to a general-purpose summary (synthesis) that can satisfy current and anticipate future information needs. Experiments on the TriviaQA, TruthfulQA, and SQUAD datasets demonstrate that CoS outperforms zero-shot LLM baselines by up to 66% and specialized summarization methods such as BRIO and PEGASUS by up to 27%. CoS-generated summaries yield higher Q&A performance compared to the source content, while requiring substantially fewer tokens and being agnostic to the specific downstream LLM. CoS thus resembles an appealing option for website maintainers to make their content more accessible for LLMs, while retaining possibilities for human oversight.

Conclusion: 尽管规模较小，Molmo 7B和Qwen2 VL 2B在某些提示配置下表现出竞争力，验证了低资源多模态系统在规则感知安全监控中的可行性。

Abstract: This thesis explores a multimodal AI framework for enhancing construction safety through the combined analysis of textual and visual data. In safety-critical environments such as construction sites, accident data often exists in multiple formats, such as written reports, inspection records, and site imagery, making it challenging to synthesize hazards using traditional approaches. To address this, this thesis proposed a multimodal AI framework that combines text and image analysis to assist in identifying safety hazards on construction sites. Two case studies were consucted to evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for automated hazard identification.The first case study introduces a hybrid pipeline that utilizes GPT 4o and GPT 4o mini to extract structured insights from a dataset of 28,000 OSHA accident reports (2000-2025). The second case study extends this investigation using Molmo 7B and Qwen2 VL 2B, lightweight, open-source VLMs. Using the public ConstructionSite10k dataset, the performance of the two models was evaluated on rule-level safety violation detection using natural language prompts. This experiment served as a cost-aware benchmark against proprietary models and allowed testing at scale with ground-truth labels. Despite their smaller size, Molmo 7B and Quen2 VL 2B showed competitive performance in certain prompt configurations, reinforcing the feasibility of low-resource multimodal systems for rule-aware safety monitoring.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning, which requires ability to perceive and manipulate spatial relationships in the 3D world, is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence, yet remains a persistent challenge for Multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While existing surveys often categorize recent progress based on input modality (e.g., text, image, video, or 3D), we argue that spatial ability is not solely determined by the input format. Instead, our survey introduces a taxonomy that organizes spatial intelligence from cognitive aspect and divides tasks in terms of reasoning complexity, linking them to several cognitive functions. We map existing benchmarks across text only, vision language, and embodied settings onto this taxonomy, and review evaluation metrics and methodologies for assessing spatial reasoning ability. This cognitive perspective enables more principled cross-task comparisons and reveals critical gaps between current model capabilities and human-like reasoning. In addition, we analyze methods for improving spatial ability, spanning both training-based and reasoning-based approaches. This dual perspective analysis clarifies their respective strengths, uncovers complementary mechanisms. By surveying tasks, benchmarks, and recent advances, we aim to provide new researchers with a comprehensive understanding of the field and actionable directions for future research.

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often face substantial uncertainty due to noisy data, low-quality labels, and heterogeneous modality characteristics. These issues become especially critical in human-computer interaction settings, where data quality, semantic reliability, and annotation consistency vary across users and recording conditions. This thesis tackles these challenges by exploring uncertainty-resilient multimodal learning through consistency-guided cross-modal transfer. The central idea is to use cross-modal semantic consistency as a basis for robust representation learning. By projecting heterogeneous modalities into a shared latent space, the proposed framework mitigates modality gaps and uncovers structural relations that support uncertainty estimation and stable feature learning. Building on this foundation, the thesis investigates strategies to enhance semantic robustness, improve data efficiency, and reduce the impact of noise and imperfect supervision without relying on large, high-quality annotations. Experiments on multimodal affect-recognition benchmarks demonstrate that consistency-guided cross-modal transfer significantly improves model stability, discriminative ability, and robustness to noisy or incomplete supervision. Latent space analyses further show that the framework captures reliable cross-modal structure even under challenging conditions. Overall, this thesis offers a unified perspective on resilient multimodal learning by integrating uncertainty modeling, semantic alignment, and data-efficient supervision, providing practical insights for developing reliable and adaptive brain-computer interface systems.

Conclusion: 多智能体编排从性能优化转变为基于LLM的事件响应的生产就绪要求，提供了确定性质量和可操作的建议。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) promise to accelerate incident response in production systems, yet single-agent approaches generate vague, unusable recommendations. We present MyAntFarm.ai, a reproducible containerized framework demonstrating that multi-agent orchestration fundamentally transforms LLM-based incident response quality. Through 348 controlled trials comparing single-agent copilot versus multi-agent systems on identical incident scenarios, we find that multi-agent orchestration achieves 100% actionable recommendation rate versus 1.7% for single-agent approaches, an 80 times improvement in action specificity and 140 times improvement in solution correctness. Critically, multi-agent systems exhibit zero quality variance across all trials, enabling production SLA commitments impossible with inconsistent single-agent outputs. Both architectures achieve similar comprehension latency (approx.40s), establishing that the architectural value lies in deterministic quality, not speed. We introduce Decision Quality (DQ), a novel metric capturing validity, specificity, and correctness properties essential for operational deployment that existing LLM metrics do not address. These findings reframe multi-agent orchestration from a performance optimization to a production-readiness requirement for LLM-based incident response. All code, Docker configurations, and trial data are publicly available for reproduction.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable versatility across a wide range of general tasks, their effectiveness often diminishes in domain-specific applications due to inherent knowledge gaps. Moreover, their performance typically declines when addressing complex problems that require multi-step reasoning and analysis. In response to these challenges, we propose leveraging both LLMs and AI agents to develop education assistants aimed at enhancing undergraduate learning in biomechanics courses that focus on analyzing the force and moment in the musculoskeletal system of the human body. To achieve our goal, we construct a dual-module framework to enhance LLM performance in biomechanics educational tasks: 1) we apply Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the specificity and logical consistency of LLM's responses to the conceptual true/false questions; 2) we build a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to solve calculation-oriented problems involving multi-step reasoning and code execution. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of several LLMs, i.e., Qwen-1.0-32B, Qwen-2.5-32B, and Llama-70B, on a biomechanics dataset comprising 100 true/false conceptual questions and problems requiring equation derivation and calculation. Our results demonstrate that RAG significantly enhances the performance and stability of LLMs in answering conceptual questions, surpassing those of vanilla models. On the other hand, the MAS constructed using multiple LLMs demonstrates its ability to perform multi-step reasoning, derive equations, execute code, and generate explainable solutions for tasks that require calculation. These findings demonstrate the potential of applying RAG and MAS to enhance LLM performance for specialized courses in engineering curricula, providing a promising direction for developing intelligent tutoring in engineering education.

Abstract: Risks associated with the use of AI, ranging from algorithmic bias to model hallucinations, have received much attention and extensive research across the AI community, from researchers to end-users. However, a gap exists in the systematic assessment of supply chain risks associated with the complex web of data sources, pre-trained models, agents, services, and other systems that contribute to the output of modern AI systems. This gap is particularly problematic when AI systems are used in critical applications, such as the food supply, healthcare, utilities, law, insurance, and transport.
  We survey the current state of AI risk assessment and management, with a focus on the supply chain of AI and risks relating to the behavior and outputs of the AI system. We then present a proposed taxonomy specifically for categorizing AI supply chain entities. This taxonomy helps stakeholders, especially those without extensive AI expertise, to "consider the right questions" and systematically inventory dependencies across their organization's AI systems. Our contribution bridges a gap between the current state of AI governance and the urgent need for actionable risk assessment and management of AI use in critical applications.

Abstract: Recently, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate optimization models from natural language descriptions has became increasingly popular. However, a major open question is how to validate that the generated models are correct and satisfy the requirements defined in the natural language description. In this work, we propose a novel agent-based method for automatic validation of optimization models that builds upon and extends methods from software testing to address optimization modeling . This method consists of several agents that initially generate a problem-level testing API, then generate tests utilizing this API, and, lastly, generate mutations specific to the optimization model (a well-known software testing technique assessing the fault detection power of the test suite). In this work, we detail this validation framework and show, through experiments, the high quality of validation provided by this agent ensemble in terms of the well-known software testing measure called mutation coverage.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in hardware front-end design using hardware description languages (HDLs). However, their inherent tendency toward hallucination often introduces functional errors into the generated HDL designs. To address this issue, we propose the framework CorrectHDL that leverages high-level synthesis (HLS) results as functional references to correct potential errors in LLM-generated HDL designs.The input to the proposed framework is a C/C++ program that specifies the target circuit's functionality. The program is provided to an LLM to directly generate an HDL design, whose syntax errors are repaired using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism. The functional correctness of the LLM-generated circuit is iteratively improved by comparing its simulated behavior with an HLS reference design produced by conventional HLS tools, which ensures the functional correctness of the result but can lead to suboptimal area and power efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that circuits generated by the proposed framework achieve significantly better area and power efficiency than conventional HLS designs and approach the quality of human-engineered circuits. Meanwhile, the correctness of the resulting HDL implementation is maintained, highlighting the effectiveness and potential of agentic HDL design leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of traditional correctness-driven IC design flows.

Abstract: Extracting structured medical insights from unstructured clinical text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) remains an open challenge in healthcare, particularly in non-English contexts where resources are scarce. This study presents a comparative analysis of NLP low-compute rule-based methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) for information extraction from electronic health records (EHR) obtained from the Voivodeship Rehabilitation Hospital for Children in Ameryka, Poland. We evaluate both approaches by extracting patient demographics, clinical findings, and prescribed medications while examining the effects of lack of text normalisation and translation-induced information loss. Results demonstrate that rule-based methods provide higher accuracy in information retrieval tasks, particularly for age and sex extraction. However, LLMs offer greater adaptability and scalability, excelling in drug name recognition. The effectiveness of the LLMs was compared with texts originally in Polish and those translated into English, assessing the impact of translation. These findings highlight the trade-offs between accuracy, normalisation, and computational cost when deploying NLP in healthcare settings. We argue for hybrid approaches that combine the precision of rule-based systems with the adaptability of LLMs, offering a practical path toward more reliable and resource-efficient clinical NLP in real-world hospitals.

Conclusion: IMACT-CXR展示了响应式教学流程，具有有限的延迟、对答案泄露的精确控制以及向实时住院医师部署的可扩展性。初步评估显示，与基线相比，定位和诊断推理能力有所提高。

Abstract: IMACT-CXR is an interactive multi-agent conversational tutor that helps trainees interpret chest X-rays by unifying spatial annotation, gaze analysis, knowledge retrieval, and image-grounded reasoning in a single AutoGen-based workflow. The tutor simultaneously ingests learner bounding boxes, gaze samples, and free-text observations. Specialized agents evaluate localization quality, generate Socratic coaching, retrieve PubMed evidence, suggest similar cases from REFLACX, and trigger NV-Reason-CXR-3B for vision-language reasoning when mastery remains low or the learner explicitly asks. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) maintains skill-specific mastery estimates that drive both knowledge reinforcement and case similarity retrieval. A lung-lobe segmentation module derived from a TensorFlow U-Net enables anatomically aware gaze feedback, and safety prompts prevent premature disclosure of ground-truth labels. We describe the system architecture, implementation highlights, and integration with the REFLACX dataset for real DICOM cases. IMACT-CXR demonstrates responsive tutoring flows with bounded latency, precise control over answer leakage, and extensibility toward live residency deployment. Preliminary evaluation shows improved localization and diagnostic reasoning compared to baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统在现实世界决策中面临互联挑战，现有基准无法全面评估整体决策能力。

Method: 引入了Mini Amusement Parks（MAPs）模拟器，设计用于评估智能体建模环境、在不确定性下预测长期后果及战略运营复杂业务的能力。

Result: 人类在MAPs中表现显著优于现有LLM智能体（6.5倍于简单模式，9.8倍于中等模式）。

Conclusion: MAPs提供了一个新的基准环境，用于评估具备适应性决策能力的智能体，揭示了当前LLM智能体在长期优化、高效学习、空间推理和世界建模方面的持续弱点。

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in artificial intelligence, current systems struggle with the interconnected challenges that define real-world decision making. Practical domains, such as business management, require optimizing an open-ended and multi-faceted objective, actively learning environment dynamics from sparse experience, planning over long horizons in stochastic settings, and reasoning over spatial information. Yet existing human--AI benchmarks isolate subsets of these capabilities, limiting our ability to assess holistic decision-making competence. We introduce Mini Amusement Parks (MAPs), an amusement-park simulator designed to evaluate an agent's ability to model its environment, anticipate long-term consequences under uncertainty, and strategically operate a complex business. We provide human baselines and a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM agents, finding that humans outperform these systems by 6.5x on easy mode and 9.8x on medium mode. Our analysis reveals persistent weaknesses in long-horizon optimization, sample-efficient learning, spatial reasoning, and world modelling. By unifying these challenges within a single environment, MAPs offers a new foundation for benchmarking agents capable of adaptable decision making. Code: https://github.com/Skyfall-Research/MAPs

Motivation: 探索音频智能是否能从深度思考中受益，解决音频语言模型在推理方面的不足。

Method: 通过提出的Modality-Grounded Reasoning Distillation (MGRD)框架，Step-Audio-R1学习生成与音频相关的推理链，这些推理链真正基于声学特征。

Result: Step-Audio-R1在音频理解和推理基准测试中表现优异，超越Gemini 2.5 Pro，性能接近Gemini 3 Pro。

Conclusion: Step-Audio-R1成功证明了音频智能也能从深度思考中受益，为构建真正的多模态推理系统开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable success in text and vision domains through extended chain-of-thought deliberation. However, a perplexing phenomenon persists in audio language models: they consistently perform better with minimal or no reasoning, raising a fundamental question - can audio intelligence truly benefit from deliberate thinking? We introduce Step-Audio-R1, the first audio reasoning model that successfully unlocks reasoning capabilities in the audio domain. Through our proposed Modality-Grounded Reasoning Distillation (MGRD) framework, Step-Audio-R1 learns to generate audio-relevant reasoning chains that genuinely ground themselves in acoustic features rather than hallucinating disconnected deliberations. Our model exhibits strong audio reasoning capabilities, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Pro and achieving performance comparable to the state-of-the-art Gemini 3 Pro across comprehensive audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks spanning speech, environmental sounds, and music. These results demonstrate that reasoning is a transferable capability across modalities when appropriately anchored, transforming extended deliberation from a liability into a powerful asset for audio intelligence. By establishing the first successful audio reasoning model, Step-Audio-R1 opens new pathways toward building truly multimodal reasoning systems that think deeply across all sensory modalities.

TL;DR: 研究表明，LLMs的心智理论能力提升依赖于情感理解而非分析推理，通过对比激活引导方法验证了情感处理的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索激活引导如何通过内部变化导致不同输出，以理解心智理论在LLMs中的机制。

Method: 使用线性探针分解LLMs的心智理论，比较被引导与基线LLMs的激活，并应用对比激活加法（CAA）引导Gemma-3-4B模型。

Result: 在1000个BigToM前向信念场景中，信念归因任务准确率从32.5%提升至46.7%，情感内容处理激活（如情感感知+2.23、情感价值+2.20）增强，而分析过程（如质疑-0.78、聚合思维-1.59）被抑制。

Conclusion: 成功的LLM心智理论能力主要由情感理解而非分析推理驱动。

Abstract: Recent work shows activation steering substantially improves language models' Theory of Mind (ToM) (Bortoletto et al. 2024), yet the mechanisms of what changes occur internally that leads to different outputs remains unclear. We propose decomposing ToM in LLMs by comparing steered versus baseline LLMs' activations using linear probes trained on 45 cognitive actions. We applied Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) steering to Gemma-3-4B and evaluated it on 1,000 BigToM forward belief scenarios (Gandhi et al. 2023), we find improved performance on belief attribution tasks (32.5\% to 46.7\% accuracy) is mediated by activations processing emotional content : emotion perception (+2.23), emotion valuing (+2.20), while suppressing analytical processes: questioning (-0.78), convergent thinking (-1.59). This suggests that successful ToM abilities in LLMs are mediated by emotional understanding, not analytical reasoning.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的自校正框架通过实时检测和缓解幻觉，显著提升了大型语言模型在多步推理中的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: This project develops a self correcting framework for large language models (LLMs) that detects and mitigates hallucinations during multi-step reasoning. Rather than relying solely on final answer correctness, our approach leverages fine grained uncertainty signals: 1) self-assessed confidence alignment, and 2) token-level entropy spikes to detect unreliable and unfaithful reasoning in real time. We design a composite reward function that penalizes unjustified high confidence and entropy spikes, while encouraging stable and accurate reasoning trajectories. These signals guide a reinforcement learning (RL) policy that makes the model more introspective and shapes the model's generation behavior through confidence-aware reward feedback, improving not just outcome correctness but the coherence and faithfulness of their intermediate reasoning steps. Experiments show that our method improves both final answer accuracy and reasoning calibration, with ablations validating the individual contribution of each signal.

Motivation: 现有LLM评估方法依赖间接比较，难以自动化且缺乏细粒度评估，需直接评估答案正确性的方法。

Method: 提出JudgeBoard评估流程和MAJ（多智能体判断）框架，通过多个交互的SLM协作提升判断准确性。

Result: MAJ框架显著提升了SLM的可靠性和一致性，在MATH数据集上表现优于或接近大型模型。

Conclusion: 多智能体SLM系统（MAJ）在判断任务中可能达到或超越LLM的性能，为高效评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: While small language models (SLMs) have shown promise on various reasoning tasks, their ability to judge the correctness of answers remains unclear compared to large language models (LLMs). Prior work on LLM-as-a-judge frameworks typically relies on comparing candidate answers against ground-truth labels or other candidate answers using predefined metrics like entailment. However, this approach is inherently indirect and difficult to fully automate, offering limited support for fine-grained and scalable evaluation of reasoning outputs. In this work, we propose JudgeBoard, a novel evaluation pipeline that directly queries models to assess the correctness of candidate answers without requiring extra answer comparisons. We focus on two core reasoning domains: mathematical reasoning and science/commonsense reasoning, and construct task-specific evaluation leaderboards using both accuracy-based ranking and an Elo-based rating system across five benchmark datasets, enabling consistent model comparison as judges rather than comparators. To improve judgment performance in lightweight models, we propose MAJ (Multi-Agent Judging), a novel multi-agent evaluation framework that leverages multiple interacting SLMs with distinct reasoning profiles to approximate LLM-level judgment accuracy through collaborative deliberation. Experimental results reveal a significant performance gap between SLMs and LLMs in isolated judging tasks. However, our MAJ framework substantially improves the reliability and consistency of SLMs. On the MATH dataset, MAJ using smaller-sized models as backbones performs comparatively well or even better than their larger-sized counterparts. Our findings highlight that multi-agent SLM systems can potentially match or exceed LLM performance in judgment tasks, with implications for scalable and efficient assessment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KRAL是一种低成本、可扩展、隐私保护的范式，通过教师模型推理和强化学习提升LLMs的临床诊断能力，显著优于传统方法，且成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床抗菌治疗需要动态整合病原体特征、宿主因素、抗菌药物药理学特性及感染严重性，这种复杂性限制了LLMs在高风险临床决策中的应用，存在知识缺口、数据隐私、高部署成本和有限推理能力等问题。

Method: KRAL采用教师模型推理自动提炼知识和推理轨迹，通过答案到问题的反向生成，结合启发式学习进行半监督数据增强（减少约80%的手动标注需求），并利用代理强化学习联合增强医学知识和推理能力，同时优化计算和内存效率。

Result: 实验结果表明，KRAL显著优于传统的RAG和SFT方法，提升了知识问答能力（MEDQA基准上Accuracy@1比SFT提高1.8%，比RAG提高3.6%）和推理能力（PUMCH Antimicrobial基准上Pass@1比SFT提高27%，比RAG提高27.2%），且长期训练成本仅为SFT的约20%。

Conclusion: KRAL被证明是一种有效的解决方案，能够提升本地LLMs在临床诊断中的能力，实现低成本、高安全性的复杂医疗决策支持部署。

Abstract: Clinical antimicrobial therapy requires the dynamic integration of pathogen profiles, host factors, pharmacological properties of antimicrobials, and the severity of infection.This complexity imposes fundamental limitations on the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical decision-making including knowledge gaps, data privacy concerns, high deployment costs, and limited reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency. A hierarchical evaluation employing diverse teacher-model proxies reduces assessment costs, while modular interface design facilitates seamless system updates. Experimental results demonstrate that KRAL significantly outperforms traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods. It improves knowledge question-answering capability (Accuracy@1 on the external open-source benchmark MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG) and reasoning capability (Pass@1 on the external benchmark PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG), achieved at ~20% of SFT's long-term training costs. This establishes KRAL as an effective solution for enhancing local LLMs' clinical diagnostic capabilities, enabling low-cost, high-safety deployment in complex medical decision support.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种结合语义漂移分析和金丝雀基线比较的双重检测系统，首次为LLM后门检测提供了实用解决方案，填补了AI部署中的关键安全漏洞。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be backdoored to exhibit malicious behavior under specific deployment conditions while appearing safe during training a phenomenon known as "sleeper agents." Recent work by Hubinger et al. demonstrated that these backdoors persist through safety training, yet no practical detection methods exist. We present a novel dual-method detection system combining semantic drift analysis with canary baseline comparison to identify backdoored LLMs in real-time. Our approach uses Sentence-BERT embeddings to measure semantic deviation from safe baselines, complemented by injected canary questions that monitor response consistency. Evaluated on the official Cadenza-Labs dolphin-llama3-8B sleeper agent model, our system achieves 92.5% accuracy with 100% precision (zero false positives) and 85% recall. The combined detection method operates in real-time (<1s per query), requires no model modification, and provides the first practical solution to LLM backdoor detection. Our work addresses a critical security gap in AI deployment and demonstrates that embedding-based detection can effectively identify deceptive model behavior without sacrificing deployment efficiency.

Result: 研究发现即使提供了权威段落，错误仍然存在，RAG可以约束输出，但安全部署需要严格评估推理。

Conclusion: 论文强调了在临床环境中，仅靠检索增强生成（RAG）不足以确保语言模型的推理准确性，必须对推理过程进行严格评估。

Abstract: Access to the right evidence does not guarantee that large language models (LLMs) will reason with it correctly. This gap between retrieval and reasoning is especially concerning in clinical settings, where outputs must align with structured protocols. We study this gap using Written Exposure Therapy (WET) guidelines as a testbed. In evaluating model responses to curated clinician-vetted questions, we find that errors persist even when authoritative passages are provided. To address this, we propose an evaluation framework that measures accuracy, consistency, and fidelity of reasoning. Our results highlight both the potential and the risks: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can constrain outputs, but safe deployment requires assessing reasoning as rigorously as retrieval.

Abstract: Sensorium Arc (AI reflects on climate) is a real-time multimodal interactive AI agent system that personifies the ocean as a poetic speaker and guides users through immersive explorations of complex marine data. Built on a modular multi-agent system and retrieval-augmented large language model (LLM) framework, Sensorium enables natural spoken conversations with AI agents that embodies the ocean's perspective, generating responses that blend scientific insight with ecological poetics. Through keyword detection and semantic parsing, the system dynamically triggers data visualizations and audiovisual playback based on time, location, and thematic cues drawn from the dialogue. Developed in collaboration with the Center for the Study of the Force Majeure and inspired by the eco-aesthetic philosophy of Newton Harrison, Sensorium Arc reimagines ocean data not as an abstract dataset but as a living narrative. The project demonstrates the potential of conversational AI agents to mediate affective, intuitive access to high-dimensional environmental data and proposes a new paradigm for human-machine-ecosystem.

Abstract: Digital transformation in the cultural heritage sector has produced vast yet fragmented collections of artefact data. Existing frameworks for museum information systems struggle to integrate heterogeneous metadata, unstructured documents, and multimodal artefacts into a coherent and queryable form. We present MuseKG, an end-to-end knowledge-graph framework that unifies structured and unstructured museum data through symbolic-neural integration. MuseKG constructs a typed property graph linking objects, people, organisations, and visual or textual labels, and supports natural language queries. Evaluations on real museum collections demonstrate robust performance across queries over attributes, relations, and related entities, surpassing large-language-model zero-shot, few-shot and SPARQL prompt baselines. The results highlight the importance of symbolic grounding for interpretable and scalable cultural heritage reasoning, and pave the way for web-scale integration of digital heritage knowledge.

TL;DR: A novel CP model for serial batch scheduling avoids complex virtual batches, outperforming existing methods by up to 25% on large instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CP models for serial batch scheduling with minimum batch sizes rely on a predefined virtual set of batches, which introduces complexity and suffers from dimensionality issues. This paper aims to address these limitations by proposing a more efficient model.

Method: The paper introduces a novel CP model that avoids the use of a predefined virtual set of batches, instead utilizing key alignment parameters for a more compact formulation. The model is enhanced with tailored search phases and strengthened inference levels of constraint propagators.

Result: Extensive computational experiments on nearly five thousand instances show the proposed model's superiority, especially on small-to-medium instances (up to 100 jobs) and large-scale instances (up to 500 jobs, 10 families, and 10 machines).

Conclusion: The novel CP model proposed in this paper demonstrates superior performance on small-to-medium instances and significantly outperforms existing methods on large-scale instances, providing solutions up to 25% better.

Abstract: In serial batch (s-batch) scheduling, jobs from similar families are grouped into batches and processed sequentially to avoid repetitive setups that are required when processing consecutive jobs of different families. Despite its large success in scheduling, only three Constraint Programming (CP) models have been proposed for this problem considering minimum batch sizes, which is a common requirement in many practical settings, including the ion implantation area in semiconductor manufacturing. These existing CP models rely on a predefined virtual set of possible batches that suffers from the curse of dimensionality and adds complexity to the problem. This paper proposes a novel CP model that does not rely on this virtual set. Instead, it uses key alignment parameters that allow it to reason directly on the sequences of same-family jobs scheduled on the machines, resulting in a more compact formulation. This new model is further improved by exploiting the problem's structure with tailored search phases and strengthened inference levels of the constraint propagators. The extensive computational experiments on nearly five thousand instances compare the proposed models against existing methods in the literature, including mixed-integer programming formulations, tabu search meta-heuristics, and CP approaches. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed models on small-to-medium instances with up to 100 jobs, and their ability to find solutions up to 25\% better than the ones produces by existing methods on large-scale instances with up to 500 jobs, 10 families, and 10 machines.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs), are fundamentally transforming accounting research, creating both opportunities and competitive threats for scholars. This paper proposes a framework that classifies AI-accounting research along two dimensions: research focus (accounting-centric versus AI-centric) and methodological approach (AI-based versus traditional methods). We apply this framework to papers from the IJAIS special issue and recent AI-accounting research published in leading accounting journals to map existing studies and identify research opportunities. Using this same framework, we analyze how accounting researchers can leverage their expertise through strategic positioning and collaboration, revealing where accounting scholars' strengths create the most value. We further examine how GenAI and LLMs transform the research process itself, comparing the capabilities of human researchers and AI agents across the entire research workflow. This analysis reveals that while GenAI democratizes certain research capabilities, it simultaneously intensifies competition by raising expectations for higher-order contributions where human judgment, creativity, and theoretical depth remain valuable. These shifts call for reforming doctoral education to cultivate comparative advantages while building AI fluency.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的混合架构结合了CNN LSTM模型和多智能体深度强化学习，显著提升了云边缘工作负载资源管理的效率和性能，优于传统反应式方法。

Abstract: Old cloud edge workload resource management is too reactive. The problem with relying on static thresholds is that we are either overspending for more resources than needed or have reduced performance because of their lack. This is why we work on proactive solutions. A framework developed for it stops reacting to the problems but starts expecting them. We design a hybrid architecture, combining two powerful tools: the CNN LSTM model for time series forecasting and an orchestrator based on multi agent Deep Reinforcement Learning In fact the novelty is in how we combine them as we embed the predictive forecast from the CNN LSTM directly into the DRL agent state space. That is what makes the AI manager smarter it sees the future, which allows it to make better decisions about a long term plan for where to run tasks That means finding that sweet spot between how much money is saved while keeping the system healthy and apps fast for users That is we have given it eyes in order to see down the road so that it does not have to lurch from one problem to another it finds a smooth path forward Our tests show our system easily beats the old methods It is great at solving tough problems like making complex decisions and juggling multiple goals at once like being cheap fast and reliable

TL;DR: SkyRL-Agent框架通过异步调度和工具增强训练，显著提升模型性能并降低成本，同时展示多任务泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多轮、长视野代理训练和评估中的效率问题，并提升模型在软件工程任务中的性能。

Method: 引入了优化的异步管道调度器（1.55倍加速）和基于AST的搜索工具增强训练配方，提升代码导航和训练效率。

Result: SA-SWE-32B在SWE-Bench Verified上达到39.4% Pass@1，成本降低2倍以上，并在其他代理任务中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SkyRL-Agent框架通过高效的异步调度和工具增强训练配方，显著提升了训练效率和模型性能，同时展示了其在多种代理任务中的泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce SkyRL-Agent, a framework for efficient, multi-turn, long-horizon agent training and evaluation. It provides efficient asynchronous dispatching, lightweight tool integration, and flexible backend interoperability, enabling seamless use with existing RL frameworks such as SkyRL-train, VeRL, and Tinker.
  Using SkyRL-Agent, we train SA-SWE-32B, a software engineering agent trained from Qwen3-32B (24.4% Pass@1) purely with reinforcement learning. We introduce two key components: an optimized asynchronous pipeline dispatcher that achieves a 1.55x speedup over naive asynchronous batching, and a tool-enhanced training recipe leveraging an AST-based search tool to facilitate code navigation, boost rollout Pass@K, and improve training efficiency. Together, these optimizations enable SA-SWE-32B to reach 39.4% Pass@1 on SWE-Bench Verified with more than 2x cost reduction compared to prior models reaching similar performance. Despite being trained solely on SWE tasks, SA-SWE-32B generalizes effectively to other agentic tasks, including Terminal-Bench, BrowseComp-Plus, and WebArena. We further demonstrate SkyRL-Agent's extensibility through case studies on deep research, computer use, and memory agents, each trained using a different training backend.

TL;DR: MR-RML框架通过整合医疗标准和多维奖励模型，解决了LLMs在医疗领域的对齐问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗实践中的应用潜力巨大，但因静态评估与动态临床需求脱节、多源医疗标准适应困难及传统奖励模型无法捕捉多维医疗质量等问题，实际效用受限。

Method: 提出MR-RML（多维评分导向的奖励模型学习）框架，结合GPRC（几何投影参考约束），通过‘维度-场景-学科’矩阵整合医疗标准，优化数据生成和模型训练。

Result: 在Healthbench基准测试中，MR-RML显著优于基础模型Qwen-32B（全子集提升45%，难子集提升85%），并在开源模型中达到SOTA水平（全子集62.7，难子集44.7）。

Conclusion: MR-RML框架通过GPRC技术有效解决了大型语言模型在医疗实践中的对齐问题，显著提升了模型性能，并在权威医疗基准测试中取得了优异表现。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into medical practice holds transformative potential, yet their real-world clinical utility remains limited by critical alignment challenges: (1) a disconnect between static evaluation benchmarks and dynamic clinical cognitive needs, (2) difficulties in adapting to evolving, multi-source medical standards, and (3) the inability of conventional reward models to capture nuanced, multi-dimensional medical quality criteria. To address these gaps, we propose MR-RML (Multidimensional Rubric-oriented Reward Model Learning) via GPRC (Geometric Projection Reference Constraints), a novel alignment framework that integrates medical standards into a structured "Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines" matrix to guide data generation and model optimization. MR-RML introduces three core innovations: (1) a "Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines" medical standard system that embeds domain standards into the full training pipeline; (2) an independent multi-dimensional reward model that decomposes evaluation criteria, shifting from real-time rubric-based scoring to internalized reward modeling for improved consistency and cost-efficiency; (3) geometric projection reference constraints that transform medical cognitive logic into mathematical regularization, aligning scoring gradients with clinical reasoning and enabling synthetic data-driven training. Through extensive evaluations on the authoritative medical benchmark Healthbench, our method yields substantial performance gains over the base LLM Qwen-32B (45% on the full subset and 85% on Hard subset, respectively). It achieves a SOTA among open-source LLMs with scores of 62.7 (full subset) and 44.7 (hard subset), while also outperforming the majority of closed-source models.

TL;DR: FOOTPASS是首个针对足球比赛逐场比赛动作识别的多模态数据集，结合计算机视觉和战术知识，支持自动化数据提取。


<details>

Motivation: 当前动作识别方法不足以构建可靠的逐场比赛数据，且通常仅用于辅助而非完全自动化标注。足球战术建模、轨迹预测和表现分析的研究进展为利用战术知识支持计算机视觉预测提供了动机。

Method: 通过整合时空动作检测（STAD）和多目标跟踪（MOT），并结合足球战术知识作为先验，开发了用于逐场比赛动作识别的方法。

Result: 引入了FOOTPASS数据集，支持在多模态、多智能体战术背景下开发逐场比赛动作识别方法，为数据驱动的体育分析提供输入。

Conclusion: FOOTPASS数据集为足球比赛中的逐场比赛动作识别提供了首个多模态、多智能体战术背景下的基准，支持结合计算机视觉任务输出和足球战术先验知识的方法开发，以生成可靠的逐场比赛数据流。

Abstract: Soccer video understanding has motivated the creation of datasets for tasks such as temporal action localization, spatiotemporal action detection (STAD), or multiobject tracking (MOT). The annotation of structured sequences of events (who does what, when, and where) used for soccer analytics requires a holistic approach that integrates both STAD and MOT. However, current action recognition methods remain insufficient for constructing reliable play-by-play data and are typically used to assist rather than fully automate annotation. Parallel research has advanced tactical modeling, trajectory forecasting, and performance analysis, all grounded in game-state and play-by-play data. This motivates leveraging tactical knowledge as a prior to support computer-vision-based predictions, enabling more automated and reliable extraction of play-by-play data. We introduce Footovision Play-by-Play Action Spotting in Soccer Dataset (FOOTPASS), the first benchmark for play-by-play action spotting over entire soccer matches in a multi-modal, multi-agent tactical context. It enables the development of methods for player-centric action spotting that exploit both outputs from computer-vision tasks (e.g., tracking, identification) and prior knowledge of soccer, including its tactical regularities over long time horizons, to generate reliable play-by-play data streams. These streams form an essential input for data-driven sports analytics.

TL;DR: 本文提出结合LLM和系统性基准测试的可解释自动化算法设计框架，旨在揭示算法有效性的原因并加速科学发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的自动化算法设计缺乏对算法为何有效的解释，设计选择与问题结构的关系不明确。

Method: 提出了一个基于三大支柱的愿景：(i) LLM驱动的算法变体发现，(ii) 可解释的基准测试，(iii) 问题类描述符。

Result: 通过整合发现、解释和泛化，形成闭环知识循环，推动从盲目搜索到可解释、类特定算法设计的转变。

Conclusion: 本文主张将自动化与系统性基准测试的理解相结合，以实现可解释的自动化算法设计，从而推动该领域的突破。

Abstract: Automated algorithm design is entering a new phase: Large Language Models can now generate full optimisation (meta)heuristics, explore vast design spaces and adapt through iterative feedback. Yet this rapid progress is largely performance-driven and opaque. Current LLM-based approaches rarely reveal why a generated algorithm works, which components matter or how design choices relate to underlying problem structures. This paper argues that the next breakthrough will come not from more automation, but from coupling automation with understanding from systematic benchmarking. We outline a vision for explainable automated algorithm design, built on three pillars: (i) LLM-driven discovery of algorithmic variants, (ii) explainable benchmarking that attributes performance to components and hyperparameters and (iii) problem-class descriptors that connect algorithm behaviour to landscape structure. Together, these elements form a closed knowledge loop in which discovery, explanation and generalisation reinforce each other. We argue that this integration will shift the field from blind search to interpretable, class-specific algorithm design, accelerating progress while producing reusable scientific insight into when and why optimisation strategies succeed.

TL;DR: CRM是一个多代理协作奖励模型框架，通过分解评估任务并融合多信号，提升RLHF的鲁棒性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励模型难以同时优化多个可能冲突的偏好维度（如事实性、帮助性、安全性），且评分透明度有限。

Method: CRM通过分解偏好评估为特定领域的代理，每个代理产生部分信号，并与全局评估器（如基于排序和嵌入相似性的奖励）结合。集中式聚合器在每个时间步融合这些信号，平衡逐步正确性、多代理一致性和重复惩罚等因素。

Result: CRM通过多代理协作提高了奖励模型的鲁棒性和可解释性，且无需额外人工标注即可实现多视角奖励塑造。

Conclusion: CRM和rewardBench共同提供了一种实用、模块化的方法，以实现更透明的奖励建模和更稳定的优化。

Abstract: We present CRM (Multi-Agent Collaborative Reward Model), a framework that replaces a single black-box reward model with a coordinated team of specialist evaluators to improve robustness and interpretability in RLHF. Conventional reward models struggle to jointly optimize multiple, sometimes conflicting, preference dimensions (e.g., factuality, helpfulness, safety) and offer limited transparency into why a score is assigned. CRM addresses these issues by decomposing preference evaluation into domain-specific agents that each produce partial signals, alongside global evaluators such as ranker-based and embedding-similarity rewards. A centralized aggregator fuses these signals at each timestep, balancing factors like step-wise correctness, multi-agent agreement, and repetition penalties, yielding a single training reward compatible with standard RL pipelines. The policy is optimized with advantage-based updates (e.g., GAE), while a value model regresses to the aggregated reward, enabling multi-perspective reward shaping without requiring additional human annotations beyond those used to train the evaluators. To support training and assessment, we introduce rewardBench, a benchmark and training suite aligned with the collaborative structure of CRM. Together, CRM and rewardBench provide a practical, modular path to more transparent reward modeling and more stable optimization.

Abstract: Olympiad-level benchmarks in mathematics and physics are crucial testbeds for advanced AI reasoning, but chemistry, with its unique multimodal symbolic language, has remained an open challenge. We introduce ChemO, a new benchmark built from the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) 2025. ChemO features two key innovations for automated assessment: Assessment-Equivalent Reformulation (AER), which converts problems requiring visual outputs (e.g., drawing molecules) into computationally tractable formats, and Structured Visual Enhancement (SVE), a diagnostic mechanism to disentangle a model's visual perception capabilities from its core chemical reasoning. To tackle this benchmark, we propose ChemLabs, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that mimics human expert collaboration through specialized agents for problem decomposition, perception, reasoning, and auditing. Experiments on state-of-the-art multimodal models demonstrate that combining SVE with our multi-agent system yields dramatic performance gains. Our top configuration achieves a score of 93.6 out of 100, surpassing an estimated human gold medal threshold and establishing a new state-of-the-art in automated chemical problem-solving.

Motivation: 高质量监督数据成本高且现有数据集依赖合成样本，导致幻觉和多样性不足；教育文档中丰富的QA内容未被充分利用。

Method: 提出了一种自动化流程，结合布局感知OCR和基于LLM的语义解析，从教育文档中提取QA/VQA对。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能从多样文档类型中提取准确、对齐且低噪声的QA/VQA对。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合布局感知OCR和基于LLM的语义解析，能够从教育文档中提取高质量的QA/VQA对，为LLM训练提供了一种实用的替代合成数据的方法。

Abstract: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly depends on high-quality supervised data, yet existing instruction-tuning and RL datasets remain costly to curate and often rely on synthetic samples that introduce hallucination and limited diversity. At the same time, textbooks and exercise materials contain abundant, high-quality human-authored Question-Answer(QA) content that remains underexploited due to the difficulty of transforming raw PDFs into AI-ready supervision. Although modern OCR and vision-language models can accurately parse document structure, their outputs lack the semantic alignment required for training. We propose an automated pipeline that extracts well-formed QA and visual-QA (VQA) pairs from educational documents by combining layout-aware OCR with LLM-based semantic parsing. Experiments across diverse document types show that the method produces accurate, aligned, and low-noise QA/VQA pairs. This approach enables scalable use of real-world educational content and provides a practical alternative to synthetic data generation for improving reasoning-oriented LLM training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视公平感知的交互式推荐，通过引入项目生命周期这一新控制点，解决现有模型与短视频平台生命周期模式不符的问题。

Method: 引入了LHRL，一个生命周期感知的分层强化学习框架，包含PhaseFormer（轻量级编码器）和两级HRL代理（高层策略和低层策略）。

Result: 实验证明LHRL在多个真实数据集上显著提升公平性和用户参与度，且生命周期感知奖励能提升现有RL模型的性能。

Conclusion: LHRL框架通过动态协调公平性和准确性，显著提升了公平性和用户参与度，展示了其通用性和实用价值。

Abstract: This paper revisits fairness-aware interactive recommendation (e.g., TikTok, KuaiShou) by introducing a novel control knob, i.e., the lifecycle of items. We make threefold contributions. First, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis and uncover that item lifecycles in short-video platforms follow a compressed three-phase pattern, i.e., rapid growth, transient stability, and sharp decay, which significantly deviates from the classical four-stage model (introduction, growth, maturity, decline). Second, we introduce LHRL, a lifecycle-aware hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that dynamically harmonizes fairness and accuracy by leveraging phase-specific exposure dynamics. LHRL consists of two key components: (1) PhaseFormer, a lightweight encoder combining STL decomposition and attention mechanisms for robust phase detection; (2) a two-level HRL agent, where the high-level policy imposes phase-aware fairness constraints, and the low-level policy optimizes immediate user engagement. This decoupled optimization allows for effective reconciliation between long-term equity and short-term utility. Third, experiments on multiple real-world interactive recommendation datasets demonstrate that LHRL significantly improves both fairness and user engagement. Furthermore, the integration of lifecycle-aware rewards into existing RL-based models consistently yields performance gains, highlighting the generalizability and practical value of our approach.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种意图感知检索框架，通过分解多意图问题并优化检索策略，显著提升了证据覆盖和检索准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂的科学问题通常涉及多个意图，如识别基因突变并将其与相关疾病联系起来。这些任务需要来自不同来源的证据和多跳推理，而传统的检索增强生成（RAG）系统通常是单一意图导向的，导致证据覆盖不完整。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLM）假设潜在答案，将其分解为意图特定的查询，并为每个潜在意图检索支持段落。检索到的片段通过互惠排名融合（RRF）进行聚合和重新排名，以平衡不同意图的覆盖范围并减少冗余。

Result: 在MuISQA基准测试和其他通用RAG数据集上的实验表明，该方法在检索准确性和证据覆盖范围方面始终优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 提出的意图感知检索框架在多个基准测试中表现优于传统方法，特别是在检索准确性和证据覆盖范围方面。

Abstract: Complex scientific questions often entail multiple intents, such as identifying gene mutations and linking them to related diseases. These tasks require evidence from diverse sources and multi-hop reasoning, while conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are usually single-intent oriented, leading to incomplete evidence coverage. To assess this limitation, we introduce the Multi-Intent Scientific Question Answering (MuISQA) benchmark, which is designed to evaluate RAG systems on heterogeneous evidence coverage across sub-questions. In addition, we propose an intent-aware retrieval framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to hypothesize potential answers, decompose them into intent-specific queries, and retrieve supporting passages for each underlying intent. The retrieved fragments are then aggregated and re-ranked via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to balance coverage across diverse intents while reducing redundancy. Experiments on both MuISQA benchmark and other general RAG datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms conventional approaches, particularly in retrieval accuracy and evidence coverage.

Motivation: 探索多个组织（如诊所、保险公司和专家网络）如何通过伪匿名案例令牌、本地数据查找和受控操作边界安全合作。

Result: 原型系统证明了分布式系统中代理间通信的可行性，突出了架构模式、隐私考虑和通信流程，使专业代理能够在保持数据本地化的同时进行分布式推理。

Conclusion: 本文通过原型系统展示了分布式系统中代理间通信的可行性，并指出了未来在去中心化多代理系统领域进行更严格评估和研究的机会。

Abstract: This paper presents a proof-of-concept demonstration of agent-to-agent communication across distributed systems, using only natural-language messages and without shared identifiers, structured schemas, or centralised data exchange. The prototype explores how multiple organisations (represented here as a Clinic, Insurer, and Specialist Network) can cooperate securely via pseudonymised case tokens, local data lookups, and controlled operational boundaries.
  The system uses Orpius as the underlying platform for multi-agent orchestration, tool execution, and privacy-preserving communication. All agents communicate through OperationRelay calls, exchanging concise natural-language summaries. Each agent operates on its own data (such as synthetic clinic records, insurance enrolment tables, and clinical guidance extracts), and none receives or reconstructs patient identity. The Clinic computes an HMAC-based pseudonymous token, the Insurer evaluates coverage rules and consults the Specialist agent, and the Specialist returns an appropriateness recommendation.
  The goal of this prototype is intentionally limited: to demonstrate feasibility, not to provide a clinically validated, production-ready system. No clinician review was conducted, and no evaluation beyond basic functional runs was performed. The work highlights architectural patterns, privacy considerations, and communication flows that enable distributed reasoning among specialised agents while keeping data local to each organisation. We conclude by outlining opportunities for more rigorous evaluation and future research in decentralised multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models have fueled growing interest in extending such capabilities to multimodal domains. However, despite notable progress in visual reasoning, the lack of transparent and reproducible data curation and training strategies remains a major barrier to scalable research. In this work, we introduce OpenMMReasoner, a fully transparent two-stage recipe for multimodal reasoning spanning supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we construct an 874K-sample cold-start dataset with rigorous step-by-step validation, providing a strong foundation for reasoning capabilities. The subsequent RL stage leverages a 74K-sample dataset across diverse domains to further sharpen and stabilize these abilities, resulting in a more robust and efficient learning process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our training recipe not only surpasses strong baselines but also highlights the critical role of data quality and training design in shaping multimodal reasoning performance. Notably, our method achieves a 11.6% improvement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct baseline across nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks, establishing a solid empirical foundation for future large-scale multimodal reasoning research. We open-sourced all our codes, pipeline, and data at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/OpenMMReasoner.

Abstract: Even as AI capabilities improve, most enterprises do not consider agents trustworthy enough to work on production data. In this paper, we argue that the path to trustworthy agentic workflows begins with solving the infrastructure problem first: traditional lakehouses are not suited for agent access patterns, but if we design one around transactions, governance follows. In particular, we draw an operational analogy to MVCC in databases and show why a direct transplant fails in a decoupled, multi-language setting. We then propose an agent-first design, Bauplan, that reimplements data and compute isolation in the lakehouse. We conclude by sharing a reference implementation of a self-healing pipeline in Bauplan, which seamlessly couples agent reasoning with all the desired guarantees for correctness and trust.

Conclusion: Pharos-ESG框架通过多模态解析和结构化表示，显著提升了ESG报告的可读性和分析效率，并发布了首个大型公开数据集Aurora-ESG，支持金融治理和决策。

Abstract: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles are reshaping the foundations of global financial gover- nance, transforming capital allocation architectures, regu- latory frameworks, and systemic risk coordination mecha- nisms. However, as the core medium for assessing corpo- rate ESG performance, the ESG reports present significant challenges for large-scale understanding, due to chaotic read- ing order from slide-like irregular layouts and implicit hier- archies arising from lengthy, weakly structured content. To address these challenges, we propose Pharos-ESG, a uni- fied framework that transforms ESG reports into structured representations through multimodal parsing, contextual nar- ration, and hierarchical labeling. It integrates a reading-order modeling module based on layout flow, hierarchy-aware seg- mentation guided by table-of-contents anchors, and a multi- modal aggregation pipeline that contextually transforms vi- sual elements into coherent natural language. The framework further enriches its outputs with ESG, GRI, and sentiment labels, yielding annotations aligned with the analytical de- mands of financial research. Extensive experiments on anno- tated benchmarks demonstrate that Pharos-ESG consistently outperforms both dedicated document parsing systems and general-purpose multimodal models. In addition, we release Aurora-ESG, the first large-scale public dataset of ESG re- ports, spanning Mainland China, Hong Kong, and U.S. mar- kets, featuring unified structured representations of multi- modal content, enriched with fine-grained layout and seman- tic annotations to better support ESG integration in financial governance and decision-making.

Conclusion: TOFA框架通过视觉和文本管道有效利用预训练VLM的多模态信息，无需额外训练资源，成功解决了联邦学习中数据异构性和通信成本高的问题。

Abstract: Efficient and lightweight adaptation of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks through collaborative interactions between local clients and a central server is a rapidly emerging research topic in federated learning. Existing adaptation algorithms are typically trained iteratively, which incur significant communication costs and increase the susceptibility to potential attacks. Motivated by the one-shot federated training techniques that reduce client-server exchanges to a single round, developing a lightweight one-shot federated VLM adaptation method to alleviate these issues is particularly attractive. However, current one-shot approaches face certain challenges in adapting VLMs within federated settings: (1) insufficient exploitation of the rich multimodal information inherent in VLMs; (2) lack of specialized adaptation strategies to systematically handle the severe data heterogeneity; and (3) requiring additional training resource of clients or server. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Training-free One-shot Federated Adaptation framework for VLMs, named TOFA. To fully leverage the generalizable multimodal features in pre-trained VLMs, TOFA employs both visual and textual pipelines to extract task-relevant representations. In the visual pipeline, a hierarchical Bayesian model learns personalized, class-specific prototype distributions. For the textual pipeline, TOFA evaluates and globally aligns the generated local text prompts for robustness. An adaptive weight calibration mechanism is also introduced to combine predictions from both modalities, balancing personalization and robustness to handle data heterogeneity. Our method is training-free, not relying on additional training resources on either the client or server side. Extensive experiments across 9 datasets in various federated settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TOFA method.

Motivation: 探讨生成AI的明确原则是否适用于大脑研究，并挖掘机器学习研究对神经科学的启示。

Method: 通过讨论五个具体例子（世界建模的不足、思维过程的生成、注意力、神经缩放定律和量化），展示了机器学习研究对神经科学的潜在贡献。

Result: 提出了五个机器学习研究中的例子，说明其对神经科学的潜在价值。

Conclusion: 本文强调生成AI的明确原则可能同样适用于大脑研究，对认知神经科学有潜在重要性，并指出机器学习研究为神经信息处理系统提供了有趣的见解。

Abstract: The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modelling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.

*Joy Lai,Alex Mihailidis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PersonaDrift是一个模拟痴呆患者沟通变化的基准测试，评估了多种检测方法，发现个性化模型效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 痴呆患者的沟通方式会逐渐变化，但现有计算工具缺乏对这些行为漂移的跟踪能力。

Method: 通过模拟60天的交互日志，基于护理人员访谈创建合成用户，并注入两种纵向变化（情感扁平化和离题回复），评估了多种异常检测方法，包括无监督统计方法、序列模型和监督分类器。

Result: 初步结果表明，情感扁平化在基线变异性低的用户中可通过简单统计模型检测，而语义漂移需要时间建模和个性化基线。个性化分类器在所有任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: PersonaDrift基准测试展示了在检测痴呆患者日常沟通中的渐进变化时，个性化分类器优于通用模型，强调了行为背景的重要性。

Abstract: People living with dementia (PLwD) often show gradual shifts in how they communicate, becoming less expressive, more repetitive, or drifting off-topic in subtle ways. While caregivers may notice these changes informally, most computational tools are not designed to track such behavioral drift over time. This paper introduces PersonaDrift, a synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate machine learning and statistical methods for detecting progressive changes in daily communication, focusing on user responses to a digital reminder system. PersonaDrift simulates 60-day interaction logs for synthetic users modeled after real PLwD, based on interviews with caregivers. These caregiver-informed personas vary in tone, modality, and communication habits, enabling realistic diversity in behavior. The benchmark focuses on two forms of longitudinal change that caregivers highlighted as particularly salient: flattened sentiment (reduced emotional tone and verbosity) and off-topic replies (semantic drift). These changes are injected progressively at different rates to emulate naturalistic cognitive trajectories, and the framework is designed to be extensible to additional behaviors in future use cases. To explore this novel application space, we evaluate several anomaly detection approaches, unsupervised statistical methods (CUSUM, EWMA, One-Class SVM), sequence models using contextual embeddings (GRU + BERT), and supervised classifiers in both generalized and personalized settings. Preliminary results show that flattened sentiment can often be detected with simple statistical models in users with low baseline variability, while detecting semantic drift requires temporal modeling and personalized baselines. Across both tasks, personalized classifiers consistently outperform generalized ones, highlighting the importance of individual behavioral context.

Method: CLOZE是一种零样本框架，利用预训练的大型语言模型（LLMs）自动提取医学实体并捕获复杂的层次关系，无需额外训练或标记数据。

Result: 实验结果表明，CLOZE能够准确、可扩展且保护隐私地扩展医学本体，具有广泛的下游应用潜力。

Conclusion: CLOZE框架通过利用大型语言模型（LLMs）自动从临床笔记中提取医学实体并整合到层次化医学本体中，提供了一种准确、可扩展且保护隐私的本体扩展解决方案，具有支持生物医学研究和临床信息学下游应用的潜力。

Abstract: Integrating novel medical concepts and relationships into existing ontologies can significantly enhance their coverage and utility for both biomedical research and clinical applications. Clinical notes, as unstructured documents rich with detailed patient observations, offer valuable context-specific insights and represent a promising yet underutilized source for ontology extension. Despite this potential, directly leveraging clinical notes for ontology extension remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose CLOZE, a novel framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract medical entities from clinical notes and integrate them into hierarchical medical ontologies. By capitalizing on the strong language understanding and extensive biomedical knowledge of pre-trained LLMs, CLOZE effectively identifies disease-related concepts and captures complex hierarchical relationships. The zero-shot framework requires no additional training or labeled data, making it a cost-efficient solution. Furthermore, CLOZE ensures patient privacy through automated removal of protected health information (PHI). Experimental results demonstrate that CLOZE provides an accurate, scalable, and privacy-preserving ontology extension framework, with strong potential to support a wide range of downstream applications in biomedical research and clinical informatics.

Abstract: We develop a taxonomical framework for classifying challenges to the possibility of consciousness in digital artificial intelligence systems. This framework allows us to identify the level of granularity at which a given challenge is intended (the levels we propose correspond to Marr's levels) and to disambiguate its degree of force: is it a challenge to computational functionalism that leaves the possibility of digital consciousness open (degree 1), a practical challenge to digital consciousness that suggests improbability without claiming impossibility (degree 2), or an argument claiming that digital consciousness is strictly impossible (degree 3)? We apply this framework to 14 prominent examples from the scientific and philosophical literature. Our aim is not to take a side in the debate, but to provide structure and a tool for disambiguating between challenges to computational functionalism and challenges to digital consciousness, as well as between different ways of parsing such challenges.

Conclusion: ALEs结合了基于案例推理模型的内在可解释性和形式化XAI提供的保证，提出了一种无求解器且可扩展的算法，为安全关键场景提供了更可靠的解释。

Abstract: Case-based reasoning networks are machine-learning models that make predictions based on similarity between the input and prototypical parts of training samples, called prototypes. Such models are able to explain each decision by pointing to the prototypes that contributed the most to the final outcome. As the explanation is a core part of the prediction, they are often qualified as ``interpretable by design". While promising, we show that such explanations are sometimes misleading, which hampers their usefulness in safety-critical contexts. In particular, several instances may lead to different predictions and yet have the same explanation. Drawing inspiration from the field of formal eXplainable AI (FXAI), we propose Abductive Latent Explanations (ALEs), a formalism to express sufficient conditions on the intermediate (latent) representation of the instance that imply the prediction. Our approach combines the inherent interpretability of case-based reasoning models and the guarantees provided by formal XAI. We propose a solver-free and scalable algorithm for generating ALEs based on three distinct paradigms, compare them, and present the feasibility of our approach on diverse datasets for both standard and fine-grained image classification.

Motivation: 现有GUI智能体的数据集和基准测试多为静态和理想化，无法反映真实环境的复杂性和不可预测性，尤其是异常情况的存在。

Method: 提出了D-GARA动态基准测试框架，构建并标注了一个包含常见Android应用及嵌入异常的基准数据集，用于评估GUI智能体在真实异常环境中的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果表明，当前最先进的GUI智能体在异常丰富的环境中性能显著下降。

Conclusion: D-GARA框架通过引入多样化的真实异常场景，显著揭示了当前GUI智能体在异常环境下的性能退化问题，强调了鲁棒性学习的重要性。该框架的模块化和可扩展性支持了未来更广泛的研究和应用。

Abstract: Developing intelligent agents capable of operating a wide range of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) with human-level proficiency is a key milestone on the path toward Artificial General Intelligence. While most existing datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating GUI agents are static and idealized, failing to reflect the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, particularly the presence of anomalies. To bridge this research gap, we propose D-GARA, a dynamic benchmarking framework, to evaluate Android GUI agent robustness in real-world anomalies. D-GARA introduces a diverse set of real-world anomalies that GUI agents commonly face in practice, including interruptions such as permission dialogs, battery warnings, and update prompts. Based on D-GARA framework, we construct and annotate a benchmark featuring commonly used Android applications with embedded anomalies to support broader community research. Comprehensive experiments and results demonstrate substantial performance degradation in state-of-the-art GUI agents when exposed to anomaly-rich environments, highlighting the need for robustness-aware learning. D-GARA is modular and extensible, supporting the seamless integration of new tasks, anomaly types, and interaction scenarios to meet specific evaluation goals.

TL;DR: YOFO通过模板条件方法在单次前向传递中高效完成MLLMs评判任务，显著提升速度并保持可解释性，在标准数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在适应MLLMs输出单一分数时与生成性质不匹配，且限制了细粒度需求理解；而自回归生成评判分析在高吞吐量场景下速度过慢。

Method: 提出YOFO方法，基于自回归模型，通过结构化需求模板在单次推理步骤中为每个需求生成二元决策（是/否），利用最终令牌的logits实现高效判断。

Result: YOFO在标准推荐数据集上达到最先进水平，支持依赖感知分析（后续判断基于先前判断），并能从后验CoT中获益。

Conclusion: YOFO作为一种模板条件方法，通过单次前向传递高效完成多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的评判任务，不仅显著提升了速度，还保持了可解释性，并在标准推荐数据集上取得了最先进的结果。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong potential as judges. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: adapting MLLMs to output a single score misaligns with the generative nature of MLLMs and limits fine-grained requirement understanding, whereas autoregressively generating judging analyses is prohibitively slow in high-throughput settings. Observing that judgment reduces to verifying whether inputs satisfy a set of structured requirements, we propose YOFO, a template-conditioned method that judges all requirements in a single forward pass. Built on an autoregressive model, YOFO accepts a structured requirement template and, in one inference step, produces a binary yes/no decision for each requirement by reading the logits of the final token associated with that requirement. This design yields orders-of-magnitude speedups while preserving interpretability. Extensive experiments show that YOFO not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard recommendation datasets, but also supports dependency-aware analysis-where subsequent judgments are conditioned on previous ones-and further benefits from post-hoc CoT.

Motivation: 解决具身智能系统中的两个主要挑战：具身数据瓶颈和现有方法的算法效率低下。

Method: 提出了Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization (DPPO)，一种元认知的“Metaloop”训练框架，动态交替进行监督微调（能力扩展）和强化学习（技能精炼）。

Result: 训练出的Pelican-VL 1.0模型性能比基础模型提高了20.3%，并在100B参数规模上超越开源模型10.6%。

Conclusion: DPPO提供了一种系统化的框架，有效缓解了数据和资源瓶颈，为构建多功能具身智能体提供了高效途径。

Abstract: Developing a universal and versatile embodied intelligence system presents two primary challenges: the critical embodied data bottleneck, where real-world data is scarce and expensive, and the algorithmic inefficiency of existing methods, which are resource-prohibitive. To address these limitations, we introduce Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization (DPPO), a metacognitive ``Metaloop'' training framework that dynamically alternates between supervised fine-tuning (competence expansion) and reinforcement learning (skill refinement). This enables automatic weakness identification and targeted resource allocation, specifically designed to maximize learning efficiency from sparse, finite data. Theoretically, DPPO can be formalised as a unified preference-learning framework. Empirically, training a vision-language embodied model with DPPO, referred to as Pelican-VL 1.0, yields a 20.3% performance improvement over the base model and surpasses open-source models at the 100B-parameter scale by 10.6%. We are open-sourcing both the models and code, providing the first systematic framework that alleviates the data and resource bottleneck and enables the community to build versatile embodied agents efficiently.

TL;DR: MedBayes-Lite是一种轻量级贝叶斯增强框架，无需重新训练即可为临床Transformer模型提供不确定性感知能力，显著减少过度自信和诊断错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer在临床决策支持中表现出潜力，但其在模糊医学案例中容易过度自信，而校准的不确定性在此类场景中至关重要。

Method: 该框架集成了三个组件：(i) 使用蒙特卡洛dropout进行贝叶斯嵌入校准，(ii) 基于不确定性的加权注意力机制，(iii) 受临床风险最小化启发的置信度引导决策形成。

Result: 在生物医学QA和临床预测基准测试中，MedBayes-Lite持续改进了校准和可信度，将过度自信降低了32%至48%。在模拟临床环境中，它通过标记不确定预测以供人工审查，预防了高达41%的诊断错误。

Conclusion: MedBayes-Lite通过轻量级的贝叶斯增强，显著提升了基于Transformer的临床语言模型的不确定性感知能力，减少了过度自信问题，并在模拟临床环境中有效降低了诊断错误率。

Abstract: We propose MedBayes-Lite, a lightweight Bayesian enhancement for transformer-based clinical language models designed to produce reliable, uncertainty-aware predictions. Although transformers show strong potential for clinical decision support, they remain prone to overconfidence, especially in ambiguous medical cases where calibrated uncertainty is critical. MedBayes-Lite embeds uncertainty quantification directly into existing transformer pipelines without any retraining or architectural rewiring, adding no new trainable layers and keeping parameter overhead under 3 percent. The framework integrates three components: (i) Bayesian Embedding Calibration using Monte Carlo dropout for epistemic uncertainty, (ii) Uncertainty-Weighted Attention that marginalizes over token reliability, and (iii) Confidence-Guided Decision Shaping inspired by clinical risk minimization. Across biomedical QA and clinical prediction benchmarks (MedQA, PubMedQA, MIMIC-III), MedBayes-Lite consistently improves calibration and trustworthiness, reducing overconfidence by 32 to 48 percent. In simulated clinical settings, it can prevent up to 41 percent of diagnostic errors by flagging uncertain predictions for human review. These results demonstrate its effectiveness in enabling reliable uncertainty propagation and improving interpretability in medical AI systems.

The methodological approach centers on integrating a holistic set of input features: key fundamental macroeconomic variables (for example, Gross Domestic Product and Unemployment Rate) collected from both the Euro Zone and the United States, alongside a comprehensive suite of technical variables (including indicators, oscillators, Fibonacci levels, and price divergences). The performance of the resulting algorithm is evaluated using standard machine learning metrics to quantify predictive accuracy and backtesting simulations across historical data to assess trading profitability and risk. The study concludes with a comparative analysis to determine which class of input features, fundamental or technical, provides greater and more reliable predictive capacity for generating profitable trading signals.

Conclusion: 通过将认知科学与大语言模型研究相结合，为开发基于原则性认知机制而非脆弱虚假推理捷径或记忆的模型奠定了基础，为提升模型能力和大规模测试人类认知理论开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models solve complex problems yet fail on simpler variants, suggesting they achieve correct outputs through mechanisms fundamentally different from human reasoning. We synthesize cognitive science research into a taxonomy of 28 cognitive elements spanning computational constraints, meta-cognitive controls, knowledge representations, and transformation operations, then analyze their behavioral manifestations in reasoning traces. We propose a fine-grained cognitive evaluation framework and conduct the first large-scale analysis of 170K traces from 17 models across text, vision, and audio modalities, alongside 54 human think-aloud traces, which we make publicly available. Our analysis reveals systematic structural differences: humans employ hierarchical nesting and meta-cognitive monitoring while models rely on shallow forward chaining, with divergence most pronounced on ill-structured problems. Meta-analysis of 1,598 LLM reasoning papers reveals the research community concentrates on easily quantifiable behaviors (sequential organization: 55%, decomposition: 60%) while neglecting meta-cognitive controls (self-awareness: 16%, evaluation: 8%) that correlate with success. Models possess behavioral repertoires associated with success but fail to deploy them spontaneously. Leveraging these patterns, we develop test-time reasoning guidance that automatically scaffold successful structures, improving performance by up to 60% on complex problems. By bridging cognitive science and LLM research, we establish a foundation for developing models that reason through principled cognitive mechanisms rather than brittle spurious reasoning shortcuts or memorization, opening new directions for both improving model capabilities and testing theories of human cognition at scale.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的万向节转子机制成功实现了全驱动四旋翼飞行器的设计，并通过飞行测试验证了其有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents the design of a gimballed rotor mechanism as a modular and efficient solution for constructing omnidirectional quadrotors. Unlike conventional quadrotors, which are underactuated, this class of quadrotors achieves full actuation, enabling independent motion in all six degrees of freedom. While existing omnidirectional quadrotor designs often require significant structural modifications, the proposed gimballed rotor system maintains a lightweight and easy-to-integrate design by incorporating servo motors within the rotor platforms, allowing independent tilting of each rotor without major alterations to the central structure of a quadrotor. To accommodate this unconventional design, we develop a new control allocation scheme in PX4 Autopilot and present successful flight tests, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Result: 在包含30种独特食谱的协作烹饪环境中，该方法优于三种可比的人类目标预测算法，快速收敛至正确目标。

Conclusion: 该方法在协作烹饪环境中显著优于其他基线算法，能够快速适应人类目标的变化，减少任务完成时间并提高协作效率。

Abstract: For effective human-robot collaboration, a robot must align its actions with human goals, even as they change mid-task. Prior approaches often assume fixed goals, reducing goal prediction to a one-time inference. However, in real-world scenarios, humans frequently shift goals, making it challenging for robots to adapt without explicit communication. We propose a method for detecting goal changes by tracking multiple candidate action sequences and verifying their plausibility against a policy bank. Upon detecting a change, the robot refines its belief in relevant past actions and constructs Receding Horizon Planning (RHP) trees to actively select actions that assist the human while encouraging Differentiating Actions to reveal their updated goal. We evaluate our approach in a collaborative cooking environment with up to 30 unique recipes and compare it to three comparable human goal prediction algorithms. Our method outperforms all baselines, quickly converging to the correct goal after a switch, reducing task completion time, and improving collaboration efficiency.

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了功能和变革性听觉设计在增强人机协作方面的潜力，并为未来的基于声音的交互策略提供了信息。

Abstract: As robots become increasingly integrated into everyday environments, understanding how they communicate with humans is critical. Sound offers a powerful channel for interaction, encompassing both operational noises and intentionally designed auditory cues. In this study, we examined the effects of consequential and functional sounds on human perception and behavior, including a novel exploration of spatial sound through localization and handover tasks. Results show that consequential sounds of the Kinova Gen3 manipulator did not negatively affect perceptions, spatial localization is highly accurate for lateral cues but declines for frontal cues, and spatial sounds can simultaneously convey task-relevant information while promoting warmth and reducing discomfort. These findings highlight the potential of functional and transformative auditory design to enhance human-robot collaboration and inform future sound-based interaction strategies.

Abstract: Many robots are not equipped with a manipulator and many objects are not suitable for prehensile manipulation (such as large boxes and cylinders). In these cases, pushing is a simple yet effective non-prehensile skill for robots to interact with and further change the environment. Existing work often assumes a set of predefined pushing modes and fixed-shape objects. This work tackles the general problem of controlling a robotic fleet to push collaboratively numerous arbitrary objects to respective destinations, within complex environments of cluttered and movable obstacles. It incorporates several characteristic challenges for multi-robot systems such as online task coordination under large uncertainties of cost and duration, and for contact-rich tasks such as hybrid switching among different contact modes, and under-actuation due to constrained contact forces. The proposed method is based on combinatorial hybrid optimization over dynamic task assignments and hybrid execution via sequences of pushing modes and associated forces. It consists of three main components: (I) the decomposition, ordering and rolling assignment of pushing subtasks to robot subgroups; (II) the keyframe guided hybrid search to optimize the sequence of parameterized pushing modes for each subtask; (III) the hybrid control to execute these modes and transit among them. Last but not least, a diffusion-based accelerator is adopted to predict the keyframes and pushing modes that should be prioritized during hybrid search; and further improve planning efficiency. The framework is complete under mild assumptions. Its efficiency and effectiveness under different numbers of robots and general-shaped objects are validated extensively in simulations and hardware experiments, as well as generalizations to heterogeneous robots, planar assembly and 6D pushing.

Abstract: While mainstream robotics pursues metric precision and flawless performance, this paper explores the creative potential of a deliberately "lo-fi" approach. We present the "Semantic Glitch," a soft flying robotic art installation whose physical form, a 3D pixel style cloud, is a "physical glitch" derived from digital archaeology. We detail a novel autonomous pipeline that rejects conventional sensors like LiDAR and SLAM, relying solely on the qualitative, semantic understanding of a Multimodal Large Language Model to navigate. By authoring a bio-inspired personality for the robot through a natural language prompt, we create a "narrative mind" that complements the "weak," historically, loaded body. Our analysis begins with a 13-minute autonomous flight log, and a follow-up study statistically validates the framework's robustness for authoring quantifiably distinct personas. The combined analysis reveals emergent behaviors, from landmark-based navigation to a compelling "plan to execution" gap, and a character whose unpredictable, plausible behavior stems from a lack of precise proprioception. This demonstrates a lo-fi framework for creating imperfect companions whose success is measured in character over efficiency.

Abstract: Underwater robotic manipulation is fundamentally challenged by extreme lighting variations, color distortion, and reduced visibility. We introduce Bi-AQUA, the first underwater bilateral control-based imitation learning framework that integrates lighting-aware visual processing for underwater robot arms. Bi-AQUA employs a hierarchical three-level lighting adaptation mechanism: a Lighting Encoder that extracts lighting representations from RGB images without manual annotation and is implicitly supervised by the imitation objective, FiLM modulation of visual backbone features for adaptive, lighting-aware feature extraction, and an explicit lighting token added to the transformer encoder input for task-aware conditioning. Experiments on a real-world underwater pick-and-place task under diverse static and dynamic lighting conditions show that Bi-AQUA achieves robust performance and substantially outperforms a bilateral baseline without lighting modeling. Ablation studies further confirm that all three lighting-aware components are critical. This work bridges terrestrial bilateral control-based imitation learning and underwater manipulation, enabling force-sensitive autonomous operation in challenging marine environments.

Abstract: Magnetic levitation is about to revolutionize in-machine material flow in industrial automation. Such systems are flexibly configurable and can include a large number of independently actuated shuttles (movers) that dynamically rebalance production capacity. Beyond their capabilities for dynamic transportation, these systems possess the inherent yet unexploited potential to perform manipulation. By merging the fields of transportation and manipulation into a coordinated swarm of magnetic robots (MagBots), we enable manufacturing systems to achieve significantly higher efficiency, adaptability, and compactness. To support the development of intelligent algorithms for magnetic levitation systems, we introduce MagBotSim (Magnetic Robotics Simulation): a physics-based simulation for magnetic levitation systems. By framing magnetic levitation systems as robot swarms and providing a dedicated simulation, this work lays the foundation for next generation manufacturing systems powered by Magnetic Robotics.

Motivation: 多机器人系统在复杂物理协作中面临高维多媒体数据传输导致的带宽瓶颈和决策延迟问题，即‘共享大脑困境’。

Method: PIPHEN框架包含两个核心组件：基于大模型知识蒸馏的物理交互预测网络（PIPN）和基于能量守恒的哈密顿能量网络（HEN）控制器。前者将高维感知数据压缩为紧凑的物理表示，后者将其精确转化为协调动作。

Conclusion: PIPHEN提供了一种高效解决多机器人系统中‘共享大脑困境’的新范式，显著降低了数据传输量和决策延迟，同时提高了任务成功率。

Abstract: Multi-robot systems in complex physical collaborations face a "shared brain dilemma": transmitting high-dimensional multimedia data (e.g., video streams at ~30MB/s) creates severe bandwidth bottlenecks and decision-making latency. To address this, we propose PIPHEN, an innovative distributed physical cognition-control framework. Its core idea is to replace "raw data communication" with "semantic communication" by performing "semantic distillation" at the robot edge, reconstructing high-dimensional perceptual data into compact, structured physical representations. This idea is primarily realized through two key components: (1) a novel Physical Interaction Prediction Network (PIPN), derived from large model knowledge distillation, to generate this representation; and (2) a Hamiltonian Energy Network (HEN) controller, based on energy conservation, to precisely translate this representation into coordinated actions. Experiments show that, compared to baseline methods, PIPHEN can compress the information representation to less than 5% of the original data volume and reduce collaborative decision-making latency from 315ms to 76ms, while significantly improving task success rates. This work provides a fundamentally efficient paradigm for resolving the "shared brain dilemma" in resource-constrained multi-robot systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要大量多样化的数据集，收集过程耗时且不适用于动态环境。D-MG 旨在通过最小化人类监督，支持动态任务设置，解决这一问题。

Method: D-MG 通过将少量人类演示分割为子任务，并利用动态运动基元（DMPs）将演示行为适应和泛化到新颖且动态变化的环境中，生成平滑、真实且任务一致的笛卡尔轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，通过模仿学习在 D-MG 生成数据上训练的机器人代理，在长视野和接触密集的任务（如立方体堆叠和将杯子放入抽屉）中表现优异，即使环境变化不可预测。

Conclusion: DynaMimicGen (D-MG) 提供了一种高效且可扩展的数据生成框架，显著减少了对大量人工演示的依赖，并支持动态环境下的机器人策略训练，为自主机器人学习铺平了道路。

Abstract: Learning robust manipulation policies typically requires large and diverse datasets, the collection of which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often impractical for dynamic environments. In this work, we introduce DynaMimicGen (D-MG), a scalable dataset generation framework that enables policy training from minimal human supervision while uniquely supporting dynamic task settings. Given only a few human demonstrations, D-MG first segments the demonstrations into meaningful sub-tasks, then leverages Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) to adapt and generalize the demonstrated behaviors to novel and dynamically changing environments. Improving prior methods that rely on static assumptions or simplistic trajectory interpolation, D-MG produces smooth, realistic, and task-consistent Cartesian trajectories that adapt in real time to changes in object poses, robot states, or scene geometry during task execution. Our method supports different scenarios - including scene layouts, object instances, and robot configurations - making it suitable for both static and highly dynamic manipulation tasks. We show that robot agents trained via imitation learning on D-MG-generated data achieve strong performance across long-horizon and contact-rich benchmarks, including tasks like cube stacking and placing mugs in drawers, even under unpredictable environment changes. By eliminating the need for extensive human demonstrations and enabling generalization in dynamic settings, D-MG offers a powerful and efficient alternative to manual data collection, paving the way toward scalable, autonomous robot learning.

Conclusion: 智能数据蒸馏是构建高效、高性能VLA模型的一条极具前景的新路径。

Abstract: The powerful generalization of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models is bottlenecked by their heavy reliance on massive, redundant, and unevenly valued datasets, hindering their widespread application. Existing model-centric optimization paths, such as model compression (which often leads to performance degradation) or policy distillation (whose products are model-dependent and lack generality), fail to fundamentally address this data-level challenge. To this end, this paper introduces FT-NCFM, a fundamentally different, data-centric generative data distillation framework. Our framework employs a self-contained Fact-Tracing (FT) engine that combines causal attribution with programmatic contrastive verification to assess the intrinsic value of samples. Guided by these assessments, an adversarial NCFM process synthesizes a model-agnostic, information-dense, and reusable data asset. Experimental results on several mainstream VLA benchmarks show that models trained on just 5% of our distilled coreset achieve a success rate of 85-90% compared with training on the full dataset, while reducing training time by over 80%. Our work demonstrates that intelligent data distillation is a highly promising new path for building efficient, high-performance VLA models.

Conclusion: 这项研究将动物行为与机器人技术相结合，表明通过侧视运动进行合成孔径感知是复杂、杂乱环境中高级场景理解的关键。

Abstract: Peering, a side-to-side motion used by animals to estimate distance through motion parallax, offers a powerful bio-inspired strategy to overcome a fundamental limitation in robotic vision: partial occlusion. Conventional robot cameras, with their small apertures and large depth of field, render both foreground obstacles and background objects in sharp focus, causing occluders to obscure critical scene information. This work establishes a formal connection between animal peering and synthetic aperture (SA) sensing from optical imaging. By having a robot execute a peering motion, its camera describes a wide synthetic aperture. Computational integration of the captured images synthesizes an image with an extremely shallow depth of field, effectively blurring out occluding elements while bringing the background into sharp focus. This efficient, wavelength-independent technique enables real-time, high-resolution perception across various spectral bands. We demonstrate that this approach not only restores basic scene understanding but also empowers advanced visual reasoning in large multimodal models, which fail with conventionally occluded imagery. Unlike feature-dependent multi-view 3D vision methods or active sensors like LiDAR, SA sensing via peering is robust to occlusion, computationally efficient, and immediately deployable on any mobile robot. This research bridges animal behavior and robotics, suggesting that peering motions for synthetic aperture sensing are a key to advanced scene understanding in complex, cluttered environments.

Conclusion: Funabot-Upper成功减少了感知混淆，并将识别准确率从68.8%提升至94.6%，展示了其在未来触觉应用中的优越性和潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents Funabot-Upper, a wearable haptic suit that enables users to perceive 14 upper-body motions, including those of the trunk, shoulder, elbow, and wrist. Inducing kinesthetic perception through wearable haptic devices has attracted attention, and various devices have been developed in the past. However, these have been limited to verifications on single body parts, and few have applied the same method to multiple body parts as well. In our previous study, we developed a technology that uses the contraction of artificial muscles to deform clothing in three dimensions. Using this technology, we developed a haptic suit that induces kinesthetic perception of 7 motions in multiple upper body. However, perceptual mixing caused by stimulating multiple human muscles has occurred between the shoulder and the elbow. In this paper, we established a new, simplified design policy and developed a novel haptic suit that induces kinesthetic perceptions in the trunk, shoulder, elbow, and wrist by stimulating joints and muscles independently. We experimentally demonstrated the induced kinesthetic perception and examined the relationship between stimulation and perceived kinesthetic perception under the new design policy. Experiments confirmed that Funabot-Upper successfully induces kinesthetic perception across multiple joints while reducing perceptual mixing observed in previous designs. The new suit improved recognition accuracy from 68.8% to 94.6% compared to the previous Funabot-Suit, demonstrating its superiority and potential for future haptic applications.

Conclusion: InEKFormer展示了Transformer在人形机器人状态估计中的潜力，但也指出了在高维问题中需要更稳健的自回归训练。

Abstract: Humanoid robots have great potential for a wide range of applications, including industrial and domestic use, healthcare, and search and rescue missions. However, bipedal locomotion in different environments is still a challenge when it comes to performing stable and dynamic movements. This is where state estimation plays a crucial role, providing fast and accurate feedback of the robot's floating base state to the motion controller. Although classical state estimation methods such as Kalman filters are widely used in robotics, they require expert knowledge to fine-tune the noise parameters. Due to recent advances in the field of machine learning, deep learning methods are increasingly used for state estimation tasks. In this work, we propose the InEKFormer, a novel hybrid state estimation method that incorporates an invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF) and a Transformer network. We compare our method with the InEKF and the KalmanNet approaches on datasets obtained from the humanoid robot RH5. The results indicate the potential of Transformers in humanoid state estimation, but also highlight the need for robust autoregressive training in these high-dimensional problems.

Conclusion: C-GMS框架通过数学定义的稳定增益调度流形采样，确保了策略的稳定性和物理可实现性，为复杂环境中的可靠自主交互铺平了道路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful approach for robots to learn complex, collaborative skills by combining Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) for motion and Variable Impedance Control (VIC) for compliant interaction. However, this model-free paradigm often risks instability and unsafe exploration due to the time-varying nature of impedance gains. This work introduces Certified Gaussian Manifold Sampling (C-GMS), a novel trajectory-centric RL framework that learns combined DMP and VIC policies while guaranteeing Lyapunov stability and actuator feasibility by construction. Our approach reframes policy exploration as sampling from a mathematically defined manifold of stable gain schedules. This ensures every policy rollout is guaranteed to be stable and physically realizable, thereby eliminating the need for reward penalties or post-hoc validation. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that our approach ensures bounded tracking error even in the presence of bounded model errors and deployment-time uncertainties. We demonstrate the effectiveness of C-GMS in simulation and verify its efficacy on a real robot, paving the way for reliable autonomous interaction in complex environments.

Abstract: Challenges in traversing dynamic clutters lie mainly in the efficient perception of the environmental dynamics and the generation of evasive behaviors considering obstacle movement. Previous solutions have made progress in explicitly modeling the dynamic obstacle motion for avoidance, but this key dependency of decision-making is time-consuming and unreliable in highly dynamic scenarios with occlusions. On the contrary, without introducing object detection, tracking, and prediction, we empower the reinforcement learning (RL) with single LiDAR sensing to realize an autonomous flight system directly from point to motion. For exteroception, a depth sensing distance map achieving fixed-shape, low-resolution, and detail-safe is encoded from raw point clouds, and an environment change sensing point flow is adopted as motion features extracted from multi-frame observations. These two are integrated into a lightweight and easy-to-learn representation of complex dynamic environments. For action generation, the behavior of avoiding dynamic threats in advance is implicitly driven by the proposed change-aware sensing representation, where the policy optimization is indicated by the relative motion modulated distance field. With the deployment-friendly sensing simulation and dynamics model-free acceleration control, the proposed system shows a superior success rate and adaptability to alternatives, and the policy derived from the simulator can drive a real-world quadrotor with safe maneuvers.

Abstract: Robots today often miss a key ingredient of truly intelligent behavior: the ability to reflect on their own cognitive processes and decisions. In humans, this self-monitoring or metacognition is crucial for learning, decision making and problem solving. For instance, they can evaluate how confident they are in performing a task, thus regulating their own behavior and allocating proper resources. Taking inspiration from neuroscience, we propose a robot metacognition architecture centered on confidence (a second-order judgment on decisions) and we demonstrate it on the use case of autonomous tool invention. We propose the use of confidence as a metacognitive measure within the robot decision making scheme. Confidence-informed robots can evaluate the reliability of their decisions, improving their robustness during real-world physical deployment. This form of robotic metacognition emphasizes embodied action monitoring as a means to achieve better informed decisions. We also highlight potential applications and research directions for robot metacognition.

Motivation: 移动机器人操纵器（MRMs）因非线性动力学、欠驱动性及基座与操纵器子系统间的耦合性，面临显著的控制挑战。传统PID控制器在这些复杂条件下表现不佳，因此需要一种更稳健且协调的控制策略。

Abstract: Mobile robotic manipulators (MRMs), which integrate mobility and manipulation capabilities, present significant control challenges due to their nonlinear dynamics, underactuation, and coupling between the base and manipulator subsystems. This paper proposes a novel homogeneous Proportional-Integral-Derivative (hPID) control strategy tailored for MRMs to achieve robust and coordinated motion control. Unlike classical PID controllers, the hPID controller leverages the mathematical framework of homogeneous control theory to systematically enhance the stability and convergence properties of the closed-loop system, even in the presence of dynamic uncertainties and external disturbances involved into a system in a homogeneous way. A homogeneous PID structure is designed, ensuring improved convergence of tracking errors through a graded homogeneity approach that generalizes traditional PID gains to nonlinear, state-dependent functions. Stability analysis is conducted using Lyapunov-based methods, demonstrating that the hPID controller guarantees global asymptotic stability and finite-time convergence under mild assumptions. Experimental results on a representative MRM model validate the effectiveness of the hPID controller in achieving high-precision trajectory tracking for both the mobile base and manipulator arm, outperforming conventional linear PID controllers in terms of response time, steady-state error, and robustness to model uncertainties. This research contributes a scalable and analytically grounded control framework for enhancing the autonomy and reliability of next-generation mobile manipulation systems in structured and unstructured environments.

Motivation: 现有方法易受动作无关干扰物影响，而动作监督又受限于标签稀缺。光流能抑制背景并突出运动对象，因此提出利用光流约束改进潜在动作学习。

Method: 提出LAOF框架，利用智能体的光流作为动作驱动信号，学习对干扰物鲁棒的潜在动作表示。

Conclusion: LAOF框架通过光流约束学习潜在动作表示，在标签稀缺条件下显著提升性能，甚至无需动作监督即可超越部分有监督方法。

Abstract: Learning latent actions from large-scale videos is crucial for the pre-training of scalable embodied foundation models, yet existing methods often struggle with action-irrelevant distractors. Although incorporating action supervision can alleviate these distractions, its effectiveness is restricted by the scarcity of available action labels. Optical flow represents pixel-level motion between consecutive frames, naturally suppressing background elements and emphasizing moving objects. Motivated by this, we propose robust Latent Action learning with Optical Flow constraints, called LAOF, a pseudo-supervised framework that leverages the agent's optical flow as an action-driven signal to learn latent action representations robust to distractors. Experimental results show that the latent representations learned by LAOF outperform existing methods on downstream imitation learning and reinforcement learning tasks. This superior performance arises from optical flow constraints, which substantially stabilize training and improve the quality of latent representations under extremely label-scarce conditions, while remaining effective as the proportion of action labels increases to 10 percent. Importantly, even without action supervision, LAOF matches or surpasses action-supervised methods trained with 1 percent of action labels.

TL;DR: SEG是一种新型框架，通过在3D生成流程中直接优化模型以减少支撑材料使用，显著降低材料浪费和生产时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前切片技术侧重于后处理优化，而非在模型生成阶段解决支撑效率问题，导致材料浪费和生产时间增加。

Method: SEG框架整合了带有偏移的直接偏好优化（ODPO）到3D生成流程中，通过在训练过程中加入支撑结构模拟，生成需要较少支撑的几何形状。

Result: 在Thingi10k-Val和GPT-3DP-Val数据集上的实验表明，SEG在支撑体积减少和可打印性方面显著优于TRELLIS、DPO和DRO等基线模型。

Conclusion: SEG框架通过直接在生成过程中优化3D模型以减少支撑材料的使用，展示了其在3D打印中实现更可持续和高效数字制造的潜力。

Abstract: The transition from digital 3D models to physical objects via 3D printing often requires support structures to prevent overhanging features from collapsing during the fabrication process. While current slicing technologies offer advanced support strategies, they focus on post-processing optimizations rather than addressing the underlying need for support-efficient design during the model generation phase. This paper introduces SEG (\textit{\underline{S}upport-\underline{E}ffective \underline{G}eneration}), a novel framework that integrates Direct Preference Optimization with an Offset (ODPO) into the 3D generation pipeline to directly optimize models for minimal support material usage. By incorporating support structure simulation into the training process, SEG encourages the generation of geometries that inherently require fewer supports, thus reducing material waste and production time. We demonstrate SEG's effectiveness through extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, Thingi10k-Val and GPT-3DP-Val, showing that SEG significantly outperforms baseline models such as TRELLIS, DPO, and DRO in terms of support volume reduction and printability. Qualitative results further reveal that SEG maintains high fidelity to input prompts while minimizing the need for support structures. Our findings highlight the potential of SEG to transform 3D printing by directly optimizing models during the generative process, paving the way for more sustainable and efficient digital fabrication practices.

Conclusion: 本文展示了仅使用合成数据训练的VLA模型可以达到与最强真实数据集相当的性能，并实现了零样本的模拟到现实迁移。

Abstract: Recent works explore how real and synthetic data contribute to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models' generalization. While current VLA models have shown the strong effectiveness of large-scale real-robot pre-training, synthetic data has not previously demonstrated comparable capability at scale. This paper provides the first evidence that synthetic data alone can match the performance of the strongest $π$-dataset in pre-training a VLA model, revealing the substantial value of large-scale simulation. The resulting model also exhibits surprisingly zero-shot sim-to-real transfer on several challenging tasks. Our synthetic dataset, InternData-A1, contains over 630k trajectories and 7,433 hours across 4 embodiments, 18 skills, 70 tasks, and 227 scenes, covering rigid, articulated, deformable, and fluid-object manipulation. It is generated through a highly autonomous, fully decoupled, and compositional simulation pipeline that enables long-horizon skill composition, flexible task assembly, and heterogeneous embodiments with minimal manual tuning. Using the same architecture as $π_0$, we pre-train a model entirely on InternData-A1 and find that it matches the official $π_0$ across 49 simulation tasks, 5 real-world tasks, and 4 long-horizon dexterous tasks. We release the dataset and will open-source the generation pipeline to broaden access to large-scale robotic data and to lower the barrier to scalable data creation for embodied AI research.

Conclusion: AINA框架通过简单的硬件设备和数据收集方法，显著缩小了人类与机器人之间的体现差距，实现了从自然环境中的人类视频学习多指机器人策略的目标。

Abstract: Learning multi-fingered robot policies from humans performing daily tasks in natural environments has long been a grand goal in the robotics community. Achieving this would mark significant progress toward generalizable robot manipulation in human environments, as it would reduce the reliance on labor-intensive robot data collection. Despite substantial efforts, progress toward this goal has been bottle-necked by the embodiment gap between humans and robots, as well as by difficulties in extracting relevant contextual and motion cues that enable learning of autonomous policies from in-the-wild human videos. We claim that with simple yet sufficiently powerful hardware for obtaining human data and our proposed framework AINA, we are now one significant step closer to achieving this dream. AINA enables learning multi-fingered policies from data collected by anyone, anywhere, and in any environment using Aria Gen 2 glasses. These glasses are lightweight and portable, feature a high-resolution RGB camera, provide accurate on-board 3D head and hand poses, and offer a wide stereo view that can be leveraged for depth estimation of the scene. This setup enables the learning of 3D point-based policies for multi-fingered hands that are robust to background changes and can be deployed directly without requiring any robot data (including online corrections, reinforcement learning, or simulation). We compare our framework against prior human-to-robot policy learning approaches, ablate our design choices, and demonstrate results across nine everyday manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: RGym 是一个低成本、高效的 Linux 内核 APR 框架，通过专门定位技术和反馈重试显著提升了修复成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前 APR 基准（如 SWE-Bench）主要关注用户空间应用，忽视了内核空间调试和修复的复杂性。Linux 内核因其单一结构、并发性和低级硬件交互而带来独特挑战。

Method: 提出了一个基于 RGym 的简单有效的 APR 流程，利用专门的定位技术（如调用栈和 blamed commits）来克服 KGym 中不现实的 oracle 使用。

Result: 在 143 个已验证的 bug 数据集上，方法实现了高达 43.36% 的通过率（使用 GPT-5 Thinking），且每个 bug 的成本低于 0.20 美元。消融研究表明反馈重试可显著提升成功率。

Conclusion: RGym 提供了一个轻量级、平台无关的 Linux 内核 APR 评估框架，显著提高了修复成功率并降低了成本。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized automated program repair (APR) but current benchmarks like SWE-Bench predominantly focus on userspace applications and overlook the complexities of kernel-space debugging and repair. The Linux kernel poses unique challenges due to its monolithic structure, concurrency, and low-level hardware interactions. Prior efforts such as KGym and CrashFixer have highlighted the difficulty of APR in this domain, reporting low success rates or relying on costly and complex pipelines and pricey cloud infrastructure. In this work, we introduce RGym, a lightweight, platform-agnostic APR evaluation framework for the Linux kernel designed to operate on local commodity hardware. Built on RGym, we propose a simple yet effective APR pipeline leveraging specialized localization techniques (e.g., call stacks and blamed commits) to overcome the unrealistic usage of oracles in KGym. We test on a filtered and verified dataset of 143 bugs. Our method achieves up to a 43.36% pass rate with GPT-5 Thinking while maintaining a cost of under $0.20 per bug. We further conduct an ablation study to analyze contributions from our proposed localization strategy, prompt structure, and model choice, and demonstrate that feedback-based retries can significantly enhance success rates.

Motivation: 尽管先前研究已探讨了代码气味的检测或修复，但仍缺乏对LLM生成代码中这些问题如何及何时出现的清晰理解。

Method: 利用Propensity Smelly Score (PSC)作为因果分析工具，研究了生成策略、模型大小、模型架构和提示设计对生成代码结构特性的影响。

Result: 研究发现提示设计和架构选择在气味倾向中起决定性作用，并提出了减少其发生的实用缓解策略。用户研究进一步证明PSC有助于开发者解释模型行为并评估代码质量。

Conclusion: 该研究为将质量感知评估整合到代码生成LLMs的评估和部署中奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated their adoption in software engineering contexts. However, concerns persist about the structural quality of the code they produce. In particular, LLMs often replicate poor coding practices, introducing code smells (i.e., patterns that hinder readability, maintainability, or design integrity). Although prior research has examined the detection or repair of smells, we still lack a clear understanding of how and when these issues emerge in generated code.
  This paper addresses this gap by systematically measuring, explaining and mitigating smell propensity in LLM-generated code. We build on the Propensity Smelly Score (PSC), a probabilistic metric that estimates the likelihood of generating particular smell types, and establish its robustness as a signal of structural quality. Using PSC as an instrument for causal analysis, we identify how generation strategy, model size, model architecture and prompt formulation shape the structural properties of generated code. Our findings show that prompt design and architectural choices play a decisive role in smell propensity and motivate practical mitigation strategies that reduce its occurrence. A user study further demonstrates that PSC helps developers interpret model behavior and assess code quality, providing evidence that smell propensity signals can support human judgement. Taken together, our work lays the groundwork for integrating quality-aware assessments into the evaluation and deployment of LLMs for code.

Motivation: 传统ERP系统的工作流逻辑缺乏适应性，难以应对事件驱动和数据密集的医疗环境。

Method: 研究提出了一种基于AI的事件驱动编排框架，利用机器学习触发器、异常检测和流程挖掘分析，智能同步分布式医疗实体间的财务和供应链工作流。

Result: 多组织案例分析显示，该框架在流程效率、成本透明度和决策准确性方面取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: 将AI功能嵌入Workday的事件驱动架构中，可提升运营弹性、治理能力和可扩展性，为医疗企业下一代自动化策略提供参考。

Abstract: The adoption of cloud-based Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platforms such as Workday has transformed healthcare operations by integrating financial, supply-chain, and workforce processes into a unified ecosystem. However, traditional workflow logic in ERP systems often lacks the adaptability required to manage event-driven and data-intensive healthcare environments.
  This study proposes an AI-enabled event-driven orchestration framework within Workday ERP that intelligently synchronizes financial and supply-chain workflows across distributed healthcare entities. The framework employs machine-learning triggers, anomaly detection, and process mining analytics to anticipate and automate responses to operational events such as inventory depletion, payment delays, or patient demand fluctuations. A multi-organization case analysis demonstrates measurable gains in process efficiency, cost visibility, and decision accuracy.
  Results confirm that embedding AI capabilities into Workday's event-based architecture enhances operational resilience, governance, and scalability. The proposed model contributes to the broader understanding of intelligent ERP integration and establishes a reference for next-generation automation strategies in healthcare enterprises.

Motivation: 高质量的数据标注要求对开发安全可靠的自动驾驶AI感知系统至关重要，但目前其制定和管理仍未被充分探索，导致不一致性、安全风险和监管问题。

Method: 通过19次半结构化访谈，参与者来自6家国际公司和4个研究机构，采用主题分析方法。

Result: 研究揭示了五个主要挑战（模糊性、边缘案例复杂性、需求演变、不一致性和资源限制）和三类最佳实践（确保符合伦理标准、改进数据标注要求指南、嵌入质量保证）。

Conclusion: 本研究首次提供了基于实证的改进数据标注要求的指导，为提高标注质量、法规遵从性和系统可靠性提供了可行的见解，并为软件工程（AI的SE）和需求工程（AI的RE）领域做出了贡献。

Abstract: High-quality data annotation requirements are crucial for the development of safe and reliable AI-enabled perception systems (AIePS) in autonomous driving. Although these requirements play a vital role in reducing bias and enhancing performance, their formulation and management remain underexplored, leading to inconsistencies, safety risks, and regulatory concerns. Our study investigates how annotation requirements are defined and used in practice, the challenges in ensuring their quality, practitioner-recommended improvements, and their impact on AIePS development and performance. We conducted $19$ semi-structured interviews with participants from six international companies and four research organisations. Our thematic analysis reveals five main key challenges: ambiguity, edge case complexity, evolving requirements, inconsistencies, and resource constraints and three main categories of best practices, including ensuring compliance with ethical standards, improving data annotation requirements guidelines, and embedded quality assurance for data annotation requirements. We also uncover critical interrelationships between annotation requirements, annotation practices, annotated data quality, and AIePS performance and development, showing how requirement flaws propagate through the AIePS development pipeline. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to offer empirically grounded guidance on improving annotation requirements, offering actionable insights to enhance annotation quality, regulatory compliance, and system reliability. It also contributes to the emerging fields of Software Engineering (SE for AI) and Requirements Engineering (RE for AI) by bridging the gap between RE and AI in a timely and much-needed manner.

Result: 在SWE-bench Lite和SWE-bench Verified上的实验表明，InfCode持续优于强基线，尤其在SWE-bench Verified上达到79.4%的性能。

Conclusion: InfCode通过对抗性多智能体框架在自动化仓库级问题解决中取得了显著成效，特别是在SWE-bench Verified上达到了79.4%的性能，成为新的最先进技术。

Abstract: Large language models have advanced software engineering automation, yet resolving real-world software issues remains difficult because it requires repository-level reasoning, accurate diagnostics, and strong verification signals. Existing agent-based and pipeline-based methods often rely on insufficient tests, which can lead to patches that satisfy verification but fail to fix the underlying defect. We present InfCode, an adversarial multi-agent framework for automated repository-level issue resolution. InfCode iteratively refines both tests and patches through adversarial interaction between a Test Patch Generator and a Code Patch Generator, while a Selector agent identifies the most reliable fix. The framework runs inside a containerized environment that supports realistic repository inspection, modification, and validation. Experiments on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench Verified using models such as DeepSeek-V3 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet show that InfCode consistently outperforms strong baselines. It achieves 79.4% performance on SWE-bench Verified, establishing a new state-of-the-art. We have released InfCode as an open-source project at https://github.com/Tokfinity/InfCode.

Motivation: 现有基于Python的LLM代理在C++项目中表现不佳，因为C++的复杂特性（如重载标识符、嵌套命名空间等）使得上下文检索和故障定位更加困难。

Method: 结合语义代码意图检索和确定性AST结构化查询，构建语言感知的上下文进行修复。

Result: 在MultiSWE-bench-CPP基准测试中，INFCODE-C++的解决率达到25.58%，比之前最强的代理提高了10.85个百分点。

Conclusion: INFCODE-C++通过结合语义代码意图检索和确定性AST结构化查询，显著提升了C++仓库中问题解决的性能，为未来多语言软件代理的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have recently shown strong performance on repository-level issue resolution, but existing systems are almost exclusively designed for Python and rely heavily on lexical retrieval and shallow code navigation. These approaches transfer poorly to C++ projects, where overloaded identifiers, nested namespaces, template instantiations, and deep control-flow structures make context retrieval and fault localization substantially more difficult. As a result, state-of-the-art Python-oriented agents show a drastic performance drop on the C++ subset of MultiSWE-bench. We introduce INFCODE-C++, the first C++-aware autonomous system for end-to-end issue resolution. The system combines two complementary retrieval mechanisms -- semantic code-intent retrieval and deterministic AST-structured querying -- to construct accurate, language-aware context for repair.These components enable precise localization and robust patch synthesis in large, statically typed C++ repositories. Evaluated on the \texttt{MultiSWE-bench-CPP} benchmark, INFCODE-C++ achieves a resolution rate of 25.58\%, outperforming the strongest prior agent by 10.85 percentage points and more than doubling the performance of MSWE-agent. Ablation and behavioral studies further demonstrate the critical role of semantic retrieval, structural analysis, and accurate reproduction in C++ issue resolution. INFCODE-C++ highlights the need for language-aware reasoning in multi-language software agents and establishes a foundation for future research on scalable, LLM-driven repair for complex, statically typed ecosystems.

Conclusion: 本文提出的领域受限LLM合成框架有效提升了TVDs关键方面的一致性，并通过Digest Labels工具显著提高了可用性。

Abstract: Textual Vulnerability Descriptions (TVDs) are crucial for security analysts to understand and address software vulnerabilities. However, the key aspect inconsistencies in TVDs from different repositories pose challenges for achieving a comprehensive understanding of vulnerabilities. Existing approaches aim to mitigate inconsistencies by aligning TVDs with external knowledge bases, but they often discard valuable information and fail to synthesize comprehensive representations. In this paper, we propose a domain-constrained LLM-based synthesis framework for unifying key aspects of TVDs. Our framework consists of three stages: 1) Extraction, guided by rule-based templates to ensure all critical details are captured; 2) Self-evaluation, using domain-specific anchor words to assess semantic variability across sources; and 3) Fusion, leveraging information entropy to reconcile inconsistencies and prioritize relevant details. This framework improves synthesis performance, increasing the F1 score for key aspect augmentation from 0.82 to 0.87, while enhancing comprehension and efficiency by over 30\%. We further develop Digest Labels, a practical tool for visualizing TVDs, which human evaluations show significantly boosts usability.

Method: 我们通过零样本和检索增强生成设置对四种最先进的模型进行了基准测试，涵盖了500个真实世界函数。评估采用了代码相似性指标、语义嵌入、自动化测试执行、gas分析以及认知和循环复杂度分析。

Result: 结果显示，虽然LLMs生成的代码与真实合约在语义上高度相似，但其功能正确性较低：零样本生成中仅有20%至26%的行为与真实实现一致。生成的代码通常更简单，复杂度和gas消耗显著降低，这通常是由于省略了验证逻辑。检索增强生成显著提升了性能，功能正确性提高了45%，并生成了更简洁高效的代码。

Conclusion: 尽管检索增强生成（RAG）显著提升了性能，但要实现稳健、可用于生产的智能合约代码生成仍是一个重大挑战，需要专家仔细验证。

Abstract: Smart Contracts are critical components of blockchain ecosystems, with Solidity as the dominant programming language. While LLMs excel at general-purpose code generation, the unique constraints of Smart Contracts, such as gas consumption, security, and determinism, raise open questions about the reliability of LLM-generated Solidity code. Existing studies lack a comprehensive evaluation of these critical functional and non-functional properties. We benchmark four state-of-the-art models under zero-shot and retrieval-augmented generation settings across 500 real-world functions. Our multi-faceted assessment employs code similarity metrics, semantic embeddings, automated test execution, gas profiling, and cognitive and cyclomatic complexity analysis. Results show that while LLMs produce code with high semantic similarity to real contracts, their functional correctness is low: only 20% to 26% of zero-shot generations behave identically to ground-truth implementations under testing. The generated code is consistently simpler, with significantly lower complexity and gas consumption, often due to omitted validation logic. Retrieval-Augmented Generation markedly improves performance, boosting functional correctness by up to 45% and yielding more concise and efficient code. Our findings reveal a significant gap between semantic similarity and functional plausibility in LLM-generated Smart Contracts. We conclude that while RAG is a powerful enhancer, achieving robust, production-ready code generation remains a substantial challenge, necessitating careful expert validation.

Motivation: 数据标注在AI-enabled感知系统开发中至关重要但易出错，行业缺乏对标注错误在多组织供应链中如何产生和传播的实证研究。

Method: 采用多组织案例研究，涉及6家公司和4个研究机构，通过19次半结构化访谈（20位专家，50小时转录）和六阶段主题分析。

Result: 开发了一个包含18种标注错误类型的分类法，涵盖完整性、准确性和一致性三个维度，并经行业实践验证其有效性。

Conclusion: 本研究通过多组织案例研究，提出了一个包含18种常见标注错误类型的分类法，为AI-enabled感知系统的数据标注质量提供了共享词汇、诊断工具和可操作指南，有助于构建可信赖的AI系统。

Abstract: Data annotation is essential but highly error-prone in the development of AI-enabled perception systems (AIePS) for automated driving, and its quality directly influences model performance, safety, and reliability. However, the industry lacks empirical insights into how annotation errors emerge and spread across the multi-organisational automotive supply chain. This study addresses this gap through a multi-organisation case study involving six companies and four research institutes across Europe and the UK. Based on 19 semi-structured interviews with 20 experts (50 hours of transcripts) and a six-phase thematic analysis, we develop a taxonomy of 18 recurring annotation error types across three data-quality dimensions: completeness (e.g., attribute omission, missing feedback loops, edge-case omissions, selection bias), accuracy (e.g., mislabelling, bounding-box inaccuracies, granularity mismatches, bias-driven errors), and consistency (e.g., inter-annotator disagreement, ambiguous instructions, misaligned hand-offs, cross-modality inconsistencies). The taxonomy was validated with industry practitioners, who reported its usefulness for root-cause analysis, supplier quality reviews, onboarding, and improving annotation guidelines. They described it as a failure-mode catalogue similar to FMEA. By conceptualising annotation quality as a lifecycle and supply-chain issue, this study contributes to SE4AI by offering a shared vocabulary, diagnostic toolset, and actionable guidance for building trustworthy AI-enabled perception systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OL-CAIS作为一类CPS，在协作学习中易受干扰事件影响，需在恢复性能与限制能源影响之间权衡韧性与绿色性。

Method: 通过多目标优化（单代理）、博弈论决策（双代理）和强化学习（RL代理）开发了GResilience框架，并设计了量化韧性与绿色性的测量框架。

Conclusion: 本研究为OL-CAIS提供了确保绿色恢复的模型、指标和策略，通过平衡韧性与绿色性，实现了性能的稳定恢复。

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) combine computational and physical components. Online Collaborative AI System (OL-CAIS) is a type of CPS that learn online in collaboration with humans to achieve a common goal, which makes it vulnerable to disruptive events that degrade performance. Decision-makers must therefore restore performance while limiting energy impact, creating a trade-off between resilience and greenness. This research addresses how to balance these two properties in OL-CAIS. It aims to model resilience for automatic state detection, develop agent-based policies that optimize the greenness-resilience trade-off, and understand catastrophic forgetting to maintain performance consistency. We model OL-CAIS behavior through three operational states: steady, disruptive, and final. To support recovery during disruptions, we introduce the GResilience framework, which provides recovery strategies through multi-objective optimization (one-agent), game-theoretic decision-making (two-agent), and reinforcement learning (RL-agent). We also design a measurement framework to quantify resilience and greenness. Empirical evaluation uses real and simulated experiments with a collaborative robot learning object classification from human demonstrations. Results show that the resilience model captures performance transitions during disruptions, and that GResilience policies improve green recovery by shortening recovery time, stabilizing performance, and reducing human dependency. RL-agent policies achieve the strongest results, although with a marginal increase in CO2 emissions. We also observe catastrophic forgetting after repeated disruptions, while our policies help maintain steadiness. A comparison with containerized execution shows that containerization cuts CO2 emissions by half. Overall, this research provides models, metrics, and policies that ensure the green recovery of OL-CAIS.

Abstract: Haptic feedback enhances immersion in virtual environments by allowing users to physically interact with simulated objects. Supporting accurate force responses in multiphysics systems is challenging because physically based simulation of fluid, rigid, and deformable materials is computationally demanding, especially when interaction must occur in real time. We present a unified framework for real-time, bidirectional haptic interaction with rigid bodies, deformable objects, and Lagrangian fluids in virtual reality (VR). Our approach integrates Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) with two-way force coupling and feedback smoothing to maintain stability and produce physically meaningful tactile responses. This enables users to manipulate objects immersed in fluid and feel reaction forces consistent with fluid-structure behavior. We demonstrate the capabilities of our framework through interactive VR scenarios involving fluid stirring, soft tissue manipulation, and rigid-body interaction. The proposed system advances haptic-enabled multiphysics simulation by unifying fluid, soft-body, and rigid-body dynamics into a single platform suitable for immersive educational applications.

Conclusion: CLD方法在分解质量和可控性方面均优于现有方法，且其分离的图层可直接在设计工具中编辑，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This work presents Controllable Layer Decomposition (CLD), a method for achieving fine-grained and controllable multi-layer separation of raster images. In practical workflows, designers typically generate and edit each RGBA layer independently before compositing them into a final raster image. However, this process is irreversible: once composited, layer-level editing is no longer possible. Existing methods commonly rely on image matting and inpainting, but remain limited in controllability and segmentation precision. To address these challenges, we propose two key modules: LayerDecompose-DiT (LD-DiT), which decouples image elements into distinct layers and enables fine-grained control; and Multi-Layer Conditional Adapter (MLCA), which injects target image information into multi-layer tokens to achieve precise conditional generation. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, we build a new benchmark and introduce tailored evaluation metrics. Experimental results show that CLD consistently outperforms existing methods in both decomposition quality and controllability. Furthermore, the separated layers produced by CLD can be directly manipulated in commonly used design tools such as PowerPoint, highlighting its practical value and applicability in real-world creative workflows.

Result: 使用ONE模拟器配置的仿真结果显示，AZIZA在交付可靠性、能源效率和路由弹性方面显著优于基准方法。

Conclusion: AZIZA协议作为一种可扩展和可部署的框架，在传统系统经常崩溃的环境中推动了新一代机会路由的应用。

Abstract: Opportunistic routing architectures offer a resilient communication paradigm in environments where conventional networks fail due to disrupted infrastructure, dynamic node mobility, and intermittent connectivity conditions that commonly arise during large-scale disasters. In Bangladesh, recurring floods severely hinder communication systems, isolating affected populations and obstructing emergency response efforts. To address these challenges, there is a growing demand for intelligent and adaptive routing solutions capable of sustaining critical communication and services without relying on fixed infrastructure. This research presents AZIZA (Adaptive Zone-based Intelligent Fully Distributed Trust-Aware Routing Protocol), a next-generation opportunistic protocol designed to improve the resiliency of critical communication and services in disaster-prone and flood-affected regions. AZIZA supports adaptive data delivery for emergency alerts, sensor readings, and inter-zone coordination by integrating (1) zone-based forwarding to optimize localized transmission, (2) trust-aware logic to bypass uncooperative or malicious nodes, and (3) context-driven decision-making based on trust metrics, residual energy, and historical delivery patterns. AZIZA operates over lightweight, infrastructure-less edge ad hoc networks comprising mobile phones, UAVs, and ground vehicles acting as decentralized service relays. Simulation results using The Opportunistic Network Environment (ONE) Simulator configured with real-world mobility traces and flood data from Bangladesh demonstrate that AZIZA significantly outperforms benchmark approaches in delivery reliability, energy efficiency, and routing resilience. As a scalable and deployable framework, AZIZA advances the use of next-generation opportunistic routing in environments where traditional systems routinely collapse.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LEO星座中的ISL布局很少优化网络直径，同时满足物理和操作约束，导致端到端延迟较高。

Method: 研究将ISL的选择和分配问题建模为直径最小化问题，采用局部搜索程序迭代优化拓扑结构，替换或加强链接以减少直径。

Result: 模拟结果显示，所提算法在不影响ISL稳定性的情况下实现了低最坏情况延迟，并量化了跳数与长期链接稳定性之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的算法在满足所有几何和硬件限制的同时，显著降低了LEO星座的网络直径，优化了端到端延迟，并保持了ISL的长期稳定性。

Abstract: End-to-end latency in large low-Earth-orbit (LEO) constellations is dominated by propagation delay, making total delay roughly proportional to the network diameter, the longest shortest path in hops. Current inter-satellite link (ISL) layouts have rarely been optimized to minimize network diameter while simultaneously satisfying physical and operational constraints, including maximum link distance, line-of-sight, per-satellite hardware limits, and long-term link viability over orbital periods. In this study, the selection and assignment of inter-plane ISLs is formulated as a diameter-minimization problem on a Starlink-inspired Walker-Delta constellation in which each satellite is equipped with two fixed intra-plane links and may activate up to two inter-plane links. Beginning with a feasible baseline, the topology is iteratively refined by a local-search procedure that replaces or reinforces links to shrink the diameter. The resulting ISL configuration meets all geometric and hardware limits, preserves link stability across multiple orbital periods, and yields a sparse, diameter-aware graph with potential for centralized routing capabilities. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves low worst-case latency without compromising ISL stability, and the trade-off between hop count and long-term link stability is empirically measured for guidance of future LEO network deployments.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种结合图卷积网络和时间卷积网络的GATE模型，以及HPPO框架，有效解决了卫星边缘计算中的资源分配和服务迁移问题。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of latency-sensitive applications has sparked renewed interest in deploying edge computing capabilities aboard satellite constellations, aiming to achieve truly global and seamless service coverage. On one hand, it is essential to allocate the limited onboard computational and communication resources efficiently to serve geographically distributed users. On the other hand, the dynamic nature of satellite orbits necessitates effective service migration strategies to maintain service continuity and quality as the coverage areas of satellites evolve. We formulate this problem as a spatio-temporal Markov decision process, where satellites, ground users, and flight users are modeled as nodes in a time-varying graph. The node features incorporate queuing dynamics to characterize packet loss probabilities. To solve this problem, we propose a Graph-Aware Temporal Encoder (GATE) that jointly models spatial correlations and temporal dynamics. GATE uses a two-layer graph convolutional network to extract inter-satellite and user dependencies and a temporal convolutional network to capture their short-term evolution, producing unified spatio-temporal representations. The resulting spatial-temporal representations are passed into a Hybrid Proximal Policy Optimization (HPPO) framework. This framework features a multi-head actor that outputs both discrete service migration decisions and continuous resource allocation ratios, along with a critic for value estimation. We conduct extensive simulations involving both persistent and intermittent users distributed across real-world population centers.

Result: 研究发现PAT延迟呈现多模态分布，且与初始指向不确定性和光学束宽非线性相关。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的模型为未来大规模光学卫星网络的性能评估和算法设计奠定了基础。

Abstract: Free-space optical inter-satellite links (OISLs) enable high-capacity space communications but require precise Pointing, Acquisition, and Tracking (PAT) between links. Current scheduling approaches often overlook or oversimplify PAT delays, leading to inefficient contact planning and overestimated network capacities. We present a validated model for quantifying retargeting delays, defined as the delay-inducing portion of PAT before data transmission begins, encompassing coarse pointing, fine pointing, and the handover to tracking. The model is grounded in mission data from NASA TBIRD, LLCD, DSOC, and ESA's Lunar Optical Communication Terminal. We find that PAT delays exhibit multimodal distributions based on prior link geometry and scale nonlinearly with initial pointing uncertainty and optical beam width. Integrating these delay models into routing and scheduling algorithms will enable more accurate contact planning and higher utilization in optical networks. The proposed model provides a foundation for evaluating performance and designing algorithms for future large-scale optical satellite networks.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms encounter the challenge of high overhead due to both network management and formation control requirements. In this paper, we propose a Bio-inspired Integrated Networking and Control (BINC) scheme, enabling efficient formation management for swarms comprising thousands of UAVs. The scheme forms a two-layer hierarchical structure, where network clusters and formations share the same groups so that cross-cluster control is eliminated. For networking, we design a fused routing message together with control information to reduce overhead, and limit clusters' size to local two-hop topologies for fast command transmission. For controlling, we develop a hybrid bio-inspired control approach, including a pigeon-like leader-follower algorithm within formations under the consideration of cluster topology maintenance, and a starling-like algorithm among formations that helps to improve the ability of obstacle avoidance. We establish a simulation platform for UAV swarms with over 1000 nodes, and experimental results show that the proposed BINC scheme can achieve highly maneuverable swarm formation marching with significant reduction on communication overhead.

Abstract: The accelerating expansion of AI workloads is colliding with an energy landscape increasingly dominated by intermittent renewable generation. While vast quantities of zero-carbon energy are routinely curtailed, today's centralized datacenter architectures remain poorly matched to this reality in both energy proportionality and geographic flexibility. This work envisions a shift toward a distributed fabric of renewable-powered micro-datacenters that dynamically follow the availability of surplus green energy through live workload migration.
  At the core of this vision lies a formal feasibility-domain model that delineates when migratory AI computation is practically achievable. By explicitly linking checkpoint size, wide-area bandwidth, and renewable-window duration, the model reveals that migration is almost always energetically justified, and that time-not energy-is the dominant constraint shaping feasibility. This insight enables the design of a feasibility-aware orchestration framework that transforms migration from a best-effort heuristic into a principled control mechanism. Trace-driven evaluation shows that such orchestration can simultaneously reduce non-renewable energy use and improve performance stability, overcoming the tradeoffs of purely energy-driven strategies.
  Beyond the immediate feasibility analysis, the extended version explores the architectural horizon of renewable-aware AI infrastructures. It examines the role of emerging ultra-efficient GPU-enabled edge platforms, anticipates integration with grid-level control and demand-response ecosystems, and outlines paths toward supporting partially migratable and distributed workloads. The work positions feasibility-aware migration as a foundational building block for a future computing paradigm in which AI execution becomes fluid, geographically adaptive, and aligned with renewable energy availability.

Abstract: The growing demand for wireless capacity and coverage has driven research into new radio architectures and higher frequency bands. The recently standardized Wireless Access Backhaul (WAB) architecture represents a key evolution, enabling cost-effective network densification through wireless relaying. This paper presents the first experimental realization of a multi-band WAB testbed, combining an FR2 backhaul and an FR1 access link using open-source software and commercial off-the-shelf components. The proposed framework validates the feasibility of end-to-end WAB operation and demonstrates its ability to extend FR2 coverage while maintaining compatibility with legacy FR1 user equipment. Experimental campaigns conducted in vehicular and outdoor-to-indoor scenarios confirm that WAB effectively mitigates the limitations of FR2 links, particularly in uplink and Non-Line-of-Sight conditions. These results highlight WAB as a practical and scalable approach for next-generation wireless networks.

Conclusion: 本文总结了AI方法在6G网络中实现能源效率的潜力，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Energy efficiency is shaping up to be one of the most challenging issues for 6G networks. The reason is fairly straightforward: Networks will need to meet extreme service demands while remaining sustainable and traditional optimization techniques are too limited. With users moving, traffic swinging unpredictably and services pulling in different directions, management has to be adaptive and AI may offer a way forward. This survey looks at how well AI-based methods actually deliver on that promise. We organize the review around practical use cases. For each use case, we examine how AI techniques contribute to feedback-driven adaptability and rapid decision-making under dynamic conditions. We then evaluate them against seven central dynamic aspects that we consider unavoidable in 6G. The survey also discusses crucial tradeoffs between energy efficiency and the remaining 6G main objectives such as latency, reliability, fairness and coverage, and finally identifies gaps and future research directions.

Abstract: We study a random process over graphs inspired by the way payments are executed in the Lightning Network, the main layer-two solution on top of Bitcoin. We first prove almost tight upper and lower bounds on the time it takes for a payment failure to occur, as a function of the number of nodes and the edge capacities, when the underlying graph is complete. Then, we show how such a random process is related to the edge-betweenness centrality measure and we prove upper and lower bounds for arbitrary graphs as a function of edge-betweenness and capacity. Finally, we validate our theoretical results by running extensive simulations over some classes of graphs, including snapshots of the real Lightning Network.

Abstract: We develop a framework for handling graph separation problems with connectivity constraints. Extending the classical concept of important separators, we introduce and analyze connectivity-preserving important separators, which are important separators that not only disconnect designated terminal sets $A$ and $B$ but also satisfy an arbitrary set of connectivity constraints over the terminals. These constraints can express requirements such as preserving the internal connectivity of each terminal set, enforcing pairwise connections defined by an equivalence relation, or maintaining reachability from a specified subset of vertices. We prove that for any graph $G=(V,E)$, terminal sets $A,B\subseteq V$, and integer $k$, the number of important $A,B$-separators of size at most $k$ satisfying a set of connectivity constraints is bounded by $2^{O(k\log k)}$, and that all such separators can be enumerated within $O(2^{O(k\log k)} \cdot n \cdot T(n,m))$ time, where $T(n,m)$ is the time required to compute a minimum $s,t$-separator. As an application, we obtain a new fixed-parameter-tractable algorithm for the Node Multiway Cut-Uncut (N-MWCU) problem, parameterized by $k$, the size of the separator set. The algorithm runs in $O(2^{O(k\log k)} \cdot n \cdot m^{1+o(1)})$ time for graphs with polynomially-bounded integer weights. This significantly improves the dependence on $k$ from the previous $2^{O(k^2\log k)}$ to $2^{O(k\log k)}$, thereby breaking a long-standing barrier, and simultaneously improves the polynomial factors. Our framework generalises the important-separator paradigm to separation problems in which the deletion set must satisfy both cut and uncut constraints on terminal subsets, thus offering a refined combinatorial foundation for designing fixed-parameter algorithms for cut-uncut problems in graphs.

### [214] [Real Time Proportional Throughput Maximization: How much advance notice should you give your scheduler?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16023)
*Nadim A. Mottu*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper introduces $t$-advance-notice in real-time scheduling, proving a $rac{t}{2t+1}$-competitive algorithm is optimal and no algorithm can exceed $rac{1}{2}$-competitiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to generalize the real-time scheduling problem by considering how advance notice of jobs affects scheduling decisions and throughput maximization, aiming to provide theoretical bounds on algorithm performance.

Method: The authors extend the real-time throughput maximization problem by introducing $t$-advance-notice, a measure of how far in advance jobs are given relative to their processing time. They then propose and analyze a $rac{t}{2t+1}$-competitive algorithm for this extended problem.

Result: The key result is the proof of the $rac{t}{2t+1}$-competitive algorithm's optimality for jobs with $t$-advance-notice and the demonstration that no algorithm can surpass $rac{1}{2}$-competitiveness, regardless of the advance-notice given.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the $rac{t}{2t+1}$-competitive algorithm is optimal for jobs with $t$-advance-notice, and establishes an upper bound on competitiveness, showing no algorithm can achieve $rac{1}{2}$-competitiveness regardless of advance-notice.

Abstract: We will be exploring a generalization of real time scheduling problem sometimes called the real time throughput maximization problem. Our input is a sequence of jobs specified by their release time, deadline and processing time. We assume that jobs are announced before or at their release time. At each time step, the algorithm must decide whether to schedule a job based on the information so far. The goal is to maximize the value of the sum of the processing times of jobs that finish before their deadline, or the total ``active'' time.
  We extend this problem by defining a notion of $t$-advance-notice, a measure of how far in advance each job is given relative to their processing time. We show that there exists a $\frac{t}{2t+1}$-competitive algorithm when all jobs have $t$-advance-notice for $t\in [0,1]$. We also show that this ratio is optimal for all algorithms with $t$-advance-notice and that the upper bound of $\frac{t}{2t+1}$-competitiveness holds for all $t$, in particular that regardless of how much advance-notice is given, no algorithm can reach $\frac{1}{2}$-competitiveness.

Method: 研究了在线度限制为2的图类，分析了确定性分数匹配和随机整数匹配的竞争比率，并给出了匹配的下界。

Result: 确定性分数匹配的最优竞争比率为0.75，而随机整数匹配的最优竞争比率为约0.717772，且后者通过Half-Half算法实现。

Conclusion: 该论文展示了在在线二分匹配问题中，确定性分数匹配和随机整数匹配的竞争比率存在分离，证明了无法获得完美的舍入方案。

Abstract: Online bipartite matching is a classical problem in online algorithms and we know that both the deterministic fractional and randomized integral online matchings achieve the same competitive ratio of $1-\frac{1}{e}$. In this work, we study classes of graphs where the online degree is restricted to $2$. As expected, one can achieve a competitive ratio of better than $1-\frac{1}{e}$ in both the deterministic fractional and randomized integral cases, but surprisingly, these ratios are not the same. It was already known that for fractional matching, a $0.75$ competitive ratio algorithm is optimal. We show that the folklore \textsc{Half-Half} algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of $η\approx 0.717772\dots$ and more surprisingly, show that this is optimal by giving a matching lower-bound. This yields a separation between the two problems: deterministic fractional and randomized integral, showing that it is impossible to obtain a perfect rounding scheme.

TL;DR: 研究提出BIB算法解决库存波动下的在线资源分配问题，证明其竞争比渐近最优，优于传统IB算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统在线资源分配模型未考虑供应端的库存冲击，而现实中的库存波动会显著影响IB算法的收益表现。

Method: 采用随机化原始-对偶方法，设计了BIB算法，并通过组合区间分配问题简化了对偶构造。

Result: BIB算法在库存波动下保持最优竞争比，其性能参数化分析显示与无冲击时的IB算法竞争比完全匹配。

Conclusion: Batched Inventory Balancing (BIB)算法在库存波动环境下展现了鲁棒性，其竞争比在初始库存增长时渐近最优，收敛于(1-1/e)，优于传统IB算法。

Abstract: In classic adversarial online resource allocation problems such as AdWords, customers arrive online while products are given offline with a fixed initial inventory. To ensure revenue guarantees under uncertainty, the decision maker must balance consumption across products. Based on this, the prevalent policy "inventory balancing (IB)" has proved to be optimal or near-optimal competitive in almost all classic settings. However, these models do not capture various forms of inventory shocks on the supply side, which play an important role in real-world online assortment and can significantly impact the revenue performance of the IB algorithm.
  Motivated by this paradigm, we introduce a variant of online assortment planning with inventory shocks. Our model considers adversarial exogenous shocks (where supply increases unpredictably) and allocation-coupled endogenous shocks (where an inventory reduction is triggered by the algorithms and re-adjusted after a usage duration), whose combination leads to non-monotonic inventory fluctuations. As our main result, we show the robustness of IB-type strategies against such shocks by designing a new family of optimal competitive algorithms called "Batched Inventory Balancing (BIB)." Using a novel randomized primal-dual method, we bound the competitive ratio of BIB against optimal offline. We show that with proper choice of a certain parameter, this competitive ratio is asymptotically optimal and converges to (1-1/e) as initial inventories grow, in contrast to the original IB which no longer achieves the optimal ratio in this new model. Moreover, we characterize BIB's competitive ratio parametric by its penalty function and show that it matches exactly the competitive ratio of IB without shocks. Our refined analysis reduces the dual construction to a combinatorial "interval assignment problem" whose algorithmic solution may be of independent interest.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种利用预测来显著降低非预见性情况下竞争比的算法，该算法在预测无误差时表现接近预见性算法，且在预测误差较小时优于非预见性算法。

Abstract: This paper considers using predictions in the context of the online Joint Replenishment Problem with Deadlines (JRP-D). Prior work includes asymptotically optimal competitive ratios of $O(1)$ for the clairvoyant setting and $O(\sqrt{n})$ of the nonclairvoyant setting, where $n$ is the number of items. The goal of this paper is to significantly reduce the competitive ratio for the nonclairvoyant case by leveraging predictions: when a request arrives, the true deadline of the request is not revealed, but the algorithm is given a predicted deadline.
  The main result is an algorithm whose competitive ratio is $O(\min(η^{1/3}\log^{2/3}(n), \sqrtη, \sqrt{n}))$, where $n$ is the number of item types and $η\leq n^2$ quantifies how flawed the predictions are in terms of the number of ``instantaneous item inversions.'' Thus, the algorithm is robust, i.e., it is never worse than the nonclairvoyant solution, and it is consistent, i.e., if the predictions exhibit no inversions, then the algorithm behaves similarly to the clairvoyant algorithm. Moreover, if the error is not too large, specifically $η< o(n^{3/2}/\log^2(n))$, then the algorithm obtains an asymptotically better competitive ratio than the nonclairvoyant algorithm. We also show that all deterministic algorithms falling in a certain reasonable class of algorithms have a competitive ratio of $Ω(η^{1/3})$, so this algorithm is nearly the best possible with respect to this error metric.

Conclusion: 本文在在线图着色问题上取得了显著进展，特别是针对k-可着色图，提出了新的确定性算法，显著改进了现有上界，并探讨了随机算法的性能极限。

Abstract: We study the problem of online graph coloring for $k$-colorable graphs. The best previously known deterministic algorithm uses $\tilde{O}(n^{1-1/k!})$ colors for general $k$ and $\tilde{O}(n^{5/6})$ colors for $k = 4$, both given by Kierstead in 1998. In this paper, nearly thirty years later, we have finally made progress. Our results are summarized as follows:
  (1) $k \geq 5$ case. We provide a deterministic online algorithm to color $k$-colorable graphs with $\tilde{O}(n^{1-2/(k(k-1))})$ colors, significantly improving the current upper bound of $\tilde{O}(n^{1-1/k!})$
  (2) $k = 4$ case. We provide a deterministic online algorithm to color $4$-colorable graphs with $\tilde{O}(n^{14/17})$ colors, improving the current upper bound of $\tilde{O}(n^{5/6})$ colors.
  (3) $k = 2$ case. We show that for randomized algorithms, the upper bound is $1.034 \log_2 n + O(1)$ colors and the lower bound is $\frac{91}{96} \log_2 n - O(1)$ colors. This means that we close the gap to $1.09\mathrm{x}$.
  With our algorithm for the $k \geq 5$ case, we also obtain a deterministic online algorithm for graph coloring that achieves a competitive ratio of $O(n / \log \log n)$, which improves the best known result of $O(n \log \log \log n / \log \log n)$ by Kierstead.
  For the bipartite graph case ($k = 2$), the limit of online deterministic algorithms is known: any deterministic algorithm requires $2 \log_2 n - O(1)$ colors. Our results imply that randomized algorithms can perform slightly better but still have a limit.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于2-森林采样的新方法，用于近似计算Kemeny常数，并在理论和实验上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Kemeny constant, defined as the expected hitting time of random walks from a source node to a randomly chosen target node, is a fundamental metric in graph data management with many real-world applications. However, computing it exactly on large graphs is highly challenging, as it requires inverting large graph matrices. Existing solutions mainly rely on approximate random-walk-based methods, which still need large sample sizes and lack strong theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose a new approach for approximating the Kemeny constant via 2-forest sampling. We first derive an unbiased estimator expressed through spanning trees by introducing a path mapping technique that establishes a direct correspondence between spanning trees and certain classes of 2-forests. Compared to random walk-based estimators, 2-forest-based estimators yield leads to a better theoretical bound. We further design efficient algorithms to sample and traverse spanning trees, leveraging data structures such as the Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) for optimization. Our theoretical analysis shows that the Kemeny constant can be approximated with relative error $ε$ in $O\left(\frac{Δ^2\bar{d}^2}{ε^2}(τ+ n\min(\log n, Δ))\right)$ time, where $τ$ is the tree-sampling time, $\bar{d}$ is the average degree, and $Δ$ is the graph diameter. This complexity is near-linear in practice. Moreover, existing methods largely target static graphs and lack efficient mechanisms for dynamic updates. To address this, we propose two sample maintenance strategies that partially update samples while preserving accuracy on dynamic graphs. Extensive experiments on 10 large real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both efficiency and accuracy on static and dynamic graphs.

Abstract: We study the general scheduling problem (GSP) which generalizes and unifies several well-studied preemptive single-machine scheduling problems, such as weighted flow time, weighted sum of completion time, and minimizing the total weight of tardy jobs. We are given a set of jobs with their processing times and release times and seek to compute a (possibly preemptive) schedule for them on one machine. Each job incurs a cost that depends on its completion time in the computed schedule, as given by a separate job-dependent cost function for each job, and our objective is to minimize the total resulting cost of all jobs. The best known result for GSP is a polynomial time $O(\log\log P)$-approximation algorithm [Bansal and Pruhs, FOCS 2010, SICOMP 2014].
  We give a quasi-polynomial time $(2+ε)$-approximation algorithm for GSP, assuming that the jobs' processing times are quasi-polynomially bounded integers. For the special case of the weighted tardiness objective, we even obtain an improved approximation ratio of $1+ε$. For this case, no better result had been known than the mentioned $O(\log\log P)$-approximation for the general case of GSP. Our algorithms use a reduction to an auxiliary geometric covering problem. In contrast to a related reduction for the special case of weighted flow time [Rohwedder, Wiese, STOC 2021][Armbruster, Rohwedder, Wiese, STOC 2023] for GSP it seems no longer possible to establish a tree-like structure for the rectangles to guide an algorithm that solves this geometric problem. Despite the lack of structure due to the problem itself, we show that an optimal solution can be transformed into a near-optimal solution that has certain structural properties. Due to those we can guess a substantial part of the solution quickly and partition the remaining problem in an intricate way, such that we can independently solve each part recursively.

TL;DR: Slim-HBBFT通过优化请求广播范围，显著降低通信成本，同时确保安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的异步拜占庭协议需要广播所有参与方的请求，导致高昂的通信成本。若请求重复，这种高成本协议显得不必要。

Method: 设计了一个优先可证明广播（P-PB）协议，仅为选定的参与方生成广播证明，并基于此构建了Slim-HBBFT协议。

Result: Slim-HBBFT将通信复杂度降低了O(n)倍，并通过安全分析验证了其满足异步公共子集协议的特性。

Conclusion: Slim-HBBFT是一种原子广播协议，通过仅考虑部分参与方的请求，显著降低了通信复杂度，同时保持了安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Byzantine agreement protocols in asynchronous networks have received renewed interest because they do not rely on network behavior to achieve termination. Conventional asynchronous Byzantine agreement protocols require every party to broadcast its requests (e.g., transactions), and at the end of the protocol, parties agree on one party's request. If parties agree on one party's requests while exchanging every party's request, the protocol becomes expensive. These protocols are used to design an atomic broadcast (ABC) protocol where parties agree on $\langle n-f \rangle$ parties' requests (assuming $n=3f+1$, where $n$ is the total number of parties, and $f$ is the number of Byzantine parties). Although the parties agree on a subset of requests in the ABC protocol, if the requests do not vary (are duplicated), investing in a costly protocol is not justified. We propose Slim-HBBFT, an atomic broadcast protocol that considers requests from a fraction of $n$ parties and improves communication complexity by a factor of $O(n)$. At the core of our design is a prioritized provable-broadcast (P-PB) protocol that generates proof of broadcast only for selected parties. We use the P-PB protocol to design the Slim-HBBFT atomic broadcast protocol. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive security analysis to demonstrate that Slim-HBBFT satisfies the properties of the Asynchronous Common Subset protocol, ensuring robust security and reliability.

Abstract: Large-scale genomic workflows used in precision medicine can process datasets spanning tens to hundreds of gigabytes per sample, leading to high memory spikes, intensive disk I/O, and task failures due to out-of-memory errors. Simple static resource allocation methods struggle to handle the variability in per-chromosome RAM demands, resulting in poor resource utilization and long runtimes. In this work, we propose multiple mechanisms for adaptive, RAM-efficient parallelization of chromosome-level bioinformatics workflows. First, we develop a symbolic regression model that estimates per-chromosome memory consumption for a given task and introduces an interpolating bias to conservatively minimize over-allocation. Second, we present a dynamic scheduler that adaptively predicts RAM usage with a polynomial regression model, treating task packing as a Knapsack problem to optimally batch jobs based on predicted memory requirements. Additionally, we present a static scheduler that optimizes chromosome processing order to minimize peak memory while preserving throughput. Our proposed methods, evaluated on simulations and real-world genomic pipelines, provide new mechanisms to reduce memory overruns and balance load across threads. We thereby achieve faster end-to-end execution, showcasing the potential to optimize large-scale genomic workflows.

Abstract: General matrix multiplication (GEMM) is the computational backbone of modern AI workloads, and its efficiency is critically dependent on effective tiling strategies. Conventional approaches employ symmetric tile buffering, where the buffered tile size of the input $A$ along the dimension $M$ matches the output tile size of $C$.
  In this paper, we introduce asymmetric tile buffering (ATB), a simple but powerful technique that decouples the buffered tile dimensions of the input and output operands. We show, for the first time, that ATB is both practical and highly beneficial. To explain this effect, we develop a performance model that incorporates both the benefits of ATB (higher arithmetic intensity) and its overheads (higher kernel switching costs), providing insight into how to select effective ATB tiling factors. As a case study, we apply ATB to AMD's latest XDNA2 AI Engine (AIE), achieving up to a 4.54x speedup, from 4.8 to 24.6 TFLOPS on mixed-precision BFP16--BF16 GEMM, establishing a new performance record for XDNA2 AIE.

Abstract: Efficient data access in High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems is essential to the performance of intensive computing tasks. Traditional optimizations of the I/O stack aim to improve peak performance but are often workload specific and require deep expertise, making them difficult to generalize or re-use. In shared HPC environments, resource congestion can lead to unpredictable performance, causing slowdowns and timeouts. To address these challenges, we propose a self-adaptive approach based on Control Theory to dynamically regulate client-side I/O rates. Our approach leverages a small set of runtime system load metrics to reduce congestion and enhance performance stability. We implement a controller in a multi-node cluster and evaluate it on a real testbed under a representative workload. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates I/O congestion, reducing total runtime by up to 20% and lowering tail latency, while maintaining stable performance.

Motivation: 为了解决大型语言模型后训练中生成时间过长的问题，SpecActor通过推测解码技术加速生成过程，同时保证正确性。

Method: SpecActor采用动态解耦推测执行方法和动态Best-of-N推测方法，前者最大化GPU计算效率，后者根据生成进度选择和组合不同的草稿方法。

Result: SpecActor比常见的后训练基准快1.3-1.7倍，比简单采用推测解码的方法快1.3-1.5倍。

Conclusion: SpecActor通过动态解耦推测和动态Best-of-N推测方法，显著提升了推测精度和计算效率，实现了比常见后训练基准和简单推测解码方法更快的速度。

Abstract: Rollout dominates the training time in large language model (LLM) post-training, where the trained model is used to generate tokens given a batch of prompts. SpecActor achieves fast rollout with speculative decoding that deploys a fast path (e.g., a smaller model) to accelerate the unparallelizable generation, while the correctness is guaranteed by fast parallel verification of the outputs with the original model. SpecActor addresses two foundational challenges in speculative rollout by (1) a \emph{dynamic decoupled speculation} execution method that maximizes the GPU computational efficiency to realize speedup for large-batch execution -- a configuration common in training but unfriendly to speculative execution and (2) a \emph{dynamic Best-of-N speculation} method that selects and combines different drafting methods according to the rollout progress. It substantially improves the speculation accuracy even when the best drafting method is unknown a priori, meanwhile without requiring adding extra computation resources. {\sys} is {1.3--1.7}\,$\times$ faster than common post-training baselines, and is {1.3--1.5}\,$\times$ faster compared to naively adopting speculative decoding for rollout.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution for training machine learning models across distributed data sources while preserving data privacy. However, FL faces critical challenges related to communication overhead and local resource constraints, especially in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs) with billions of parameters. The sheer size of these models exacerbates both memory and communication constraints, making efficient transmission and processing essential for practical deployment. NVIDIA FLARE, an open-source SDK for federated learning, addresses these challenges by introducing advanced communication capabilities. Building upon existing solutions for large object streaming, we enhance FL workflows for LLMs through two key techniques: message quantization and container/file streaming. Quantization reduces message size, while streaming enables efficient memory management, improving scalability and integration with existing workflows. These advancements significantly enhance the robustness and efficiency of FL with LLMs, ensuring better performance in real-world federated learning scenarios.

Abstract: We study the problem of computing a Maximal Independent Set (MIS) in distributed networks where each node is a rational agent whose payoff depends on whether it joins the MIS. Classical distributed algorithms assume that nodes follow the prescribed protocol, but this assumption fails when nodes are strategic and may deviate if doing so increases their expected utility.
  Standard MIS algorithms rely on honest randomness or unique identifiers to break symmetry. In rational settings, however, agents may manipulate randomness, and relying solely on identifiers can create unfairness, giving some nodes zero probability of joining the MIS and thus no incentive to participate. To address these issues, we propose two algorithms based on a utility model in which agents seek locally correct solutions while also having preferences over which solution is chosen. Randomness in our algorithms is generated through pairwise interactions between neighboring nodes, viewed as simple games in which no single node can unilaterally affect the outcome. This allows symmetry breaking while remaining compatible with rational behavior.
  For both algorithms, we prove that at every stage of the execution, given any history, no agent can increase its expected utility through a unilateral deviation, assuming others follow the algorithm. This gives a stronger guarantee than Trembling-Hand Perfect Equilibrium. When all nodes follow the protocol, every node has a positive probability of joining the MIS, and the final output is a correct MIS. Under mild additional assumptions, both algorithms terminate in $O(\log n)$ rounds with high probability.
