Prior efforts such as KGym and CrashFixer have highlighted the difficulty of APR in this domain, reporting low success rates or relying on costly and complex pipelines and pricey cloud infrastructure. In this work, we introduce RGym, a lightweight, platform-agnostic APR evaluation framework for the Linux kernel designed to operate on local commodity hardware. Built on RGym, we propose a simple yet effective APR pipeline leveraging specialized localization techniques (e.g., call stacks and blamed commits) to overcome the unrealistic usage of oracles in KGym. We test on a filtered and verified dataset of 143 bugs. Our method achieves up to a 43.36% pass rate with GPT-5 Thinking while maintaining a cost of under $0.20 per bug.

However, concerns persist about the structural quality of the code they produce. In particular, LLMs often replicate poor coding practices, introducing code smells (i.e., patterns that hinder readability, maintainability, or design integrity). Although prior research has examined the detection or repair of smells, we still lack a clear understanding of how and when these issues emerge in generated code.\n  This paper addresses this gap by systematically measuring, explaining and mitigating smell propensity in LLM-generated code. We build on the Propensity Smelly Score (PSC), a probabilistic metric that estimates the likelihood of generating particular smell types, and establish its robustness as a signal of structural quality. Using PSC as an instrument for causal analysis, we identify how generation strategy, model size, model architecture and prompt formulation shape the structural properties of generated code. Our findings show that prompt design and architectural choices play a decisive role in smell propensity and motivate practical mitigation strategies that reduce its occurrence. A user study further demonstrates that PSC helps developers interpret model behavior and assess code quality, providing evidence that smell propensity signals can support human judgement.

In Bangladesh, recurring floods severely hinder communication systems, isolating affected populations and obstructing emergency response efforts. To address these challenges, there is a growing demand for intelligent and adaptive routing solutions capable of sustaining critical communication and services without relying on fixed infrastructure. This research presents AZIZA (Adaptive Zone-based Intelligent Fully Distributed Trust-Aware Routing Protocol), a next-generation opportunistic protocol designed to improve the resiliency of critical communication and services in disaster-prone and flood-affected regions. AZIZA supports adaptive data delivery for emergency alerts, sensor readings, and inter-zone coordination by integrating (1) zone-based forwarding to optimize localized transmission, (2) trust-aware logic to bypass uncooperative or malicious nodes, and (3) context-driven decision-making based on trust metrics, residual energy, and historical delivery patterns. AZIZA operates over lightweight, infrastructure-less edge ad hoc networks comprising mobile phones, UAVs, and ground vehicles acting as decentralized service relays. Simulation results using The Opportunistic Network Environment (ONE) Simulator configured with real-world mobility traces and flood data from Bangladesh demonstrate that AZIZA significantly outperforms benchmark approaches in delivery reliability, energy efficiency, and routing resilience.

Unlike conventional quadrotors, which are underactuated, this class of quadrotors achieves full actuation, enabling independent motion in all six degrees of freedom. While existing omnidirectional quadrotor designs often require significant structural modifications, the proposed gimballed rotor system maintains a lightweight and easy-to-integrate design by incorporating servo motors within the rotor platforms, allowing independent tilting of each rotor without major alterations to the central structure of a quadrotor. To accommodate this unconventional design, we develop a new control allocation scheme in PX4 Autopilot and present successful flight tests, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u4e07\u5411\u8282\u8f6c\u5b50\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5168\u9a71\u52a8\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u98de\u884c\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u98de\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u98de\u884c\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5168\u9a71\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f80\u5f80\u9700\u8981\u5927\u5e45\u7ed3\u6784\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f6c\u5b50\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u4f3a\u670d\u7535\u673a\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u4e07\u5411\u8282\u8f6c\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u98de\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e07\u5411\u8282\u8f6c\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u516d\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e07\u5411\u8282\u8f6c\u5b50\u673a\u5236\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5168\u9a71\u52a8\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u98de\u884c\u5668\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u98de\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Our approach integrates Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) with two-way force coupling and feedback smoothing to maintain stability and produce physically meaningful tactile responses. This enables users to manipulate objects immersed in fluid and feel reaction forces consistent with fluid-structure behavior.

Despite significant progress, building a universal VTON framework that can flexibly handle diverse and complex tasks remains a major challenge. Recent methods explore multi-task VTON frameworks guided by textual instructions, yet they still face two key limitations: (1) semantic gap between text instructions and reference images, and (2) data scarcity in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose UniFit, a universal VTON framework driven by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Specifically, we introduce an MLLM-Guided Semantic Alignment Module (MGSA), which integrates multimodal inputs using an MLLM and a set of learnable queries. By imposing a semantic alignment loss, MGSA captures cross-modal semantic relationships and provides coherent and explicit semantic guidance for the generative process, thereby reducing the semantic gap. Moreover, by devising a two-stage progressive training strategy with a self-synthesis pipeline, UniFit is able to learn complex tasks from limited data. Extensive experiments show that UniFit not only supports a wide range of VTON tasks, including multi-garment and model-to-model try-on, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance.

By integrating multiple models, the ensemble large language model (eLLM) framework addresses common weaknesses of individual systems, including inconsistency, hallucination, category inflation, and misclassification. The eLLM approach yields a substantial performance improvement of up to 65\\% in F1-score over the strongest single model. We formalize the ensemble process through a mathematical model of collective decision-making and establish principled aggregation criteria. Using the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) hierarchical taxonomy, we evaluate ten state-of-the-art LLMs under identical zero-shot conditions on a human-annotated corpus of 8{,}660 samples. Results show that individual models plateau in performance due to the compression of semantically rich text into sparse categorical representations, while eLLM improves both robustness and accuracy.

Our study investigates how annotation requirements are defined and used in practice, the challenges in ensuring their quality, practitioner-recommended improvements, and their impact on AIePS development and performance. We conducted $19$ semi-structured interviews with participants from six international companies and four research organisations. Our thematic analysis reveals five main key challenges: ambiguity, edge case complexity, evolving requirements, inconsistencies, and resource constraints and three main categories of best practices, including ensuring compliance with ethical standards, improving data annotation requirements guidelines, and embedded quality assurance for data annotation requirements. We also uncover critical interrelationships between annotation requirements, annotation practices, annotated data quality, and AIePS performance and development, showing how requirement flaws propagate through the AIePS development pipeline. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to offer empirically grounded guidance on improving annotation requirements, offering actionable insights to enhance annotation quality, regulatory compliance, and system reliability.

Current inter-satellite link (ISL) layouts have rarely been optimized to minimize network diameter while simultaneously satisfying physical and operational constraints, including maximum link distance, line-of-sight, per-satellite hardware limits, and long-term link viability over orbital periods. In this study, the selection and assignment of inter-plane ISLs is formulated as a diameter-minimization problem on a Starlink-inspired Walker-Delta constellation in which each satellite is equipped with two fixed intra-plane links and may activate up to two inter-plane links. Beginning with a feasible baseline, the topology is iteratively refined by a local-search procedure that replaces or reinforces links to shrink the diameter. The resulting ISL configuration meets all geometric and hardware limits, preserves link stability across multiple orbital periods, and yields a sparse, diameter-aware graph with potential for centralized routing capabilities. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves low worst-case latency without compromising ISL stability, and the trade-off between hop count and long-term link stability is empirically measured for guidance of future LEO network deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4f18\u5316\u4e86LEO\u661f\u5ea7\u7684ISL\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u76f4\u5f84\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u94fe\u63a5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLEO\u661f\u5ea7\u4e2d\u7684ISL\u5e03\u5c40\u5f88\u5c11\u4f18\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u76f4\u5f84\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u7269\u7406\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8f83\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c06ISL\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u76f4\u5f84\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u66ff\u6362\u6216\u52a0\u5f3a\u94fe\u63a5\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u76f4\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cdISL\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u8df3\u6570\u4e0e\u957f\u671f\u94fe\u63a5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u6240\u6709\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86LEO\u661f\u5ea7\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u76f4\u5f84\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86ISL\u7684\u957f\u671f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Prior approaches often assume fixed goals, reducing goal prediction to a one-time inference. However, in real-world scenarios, humans frequently shift goals, making it challenging for robots to adapt without explicit communication. We propose a method for detecting goal changes by tracking multiple candidate action sequences and verifying their plausibility against a policy bank. Upon detecting a change, the robot refines its belief in relevant past actions and constructs Receding Horizon Planning (RHP) trees to actively select actions that assist the human while encouraging Differentiating Actions to reveal their updated goal. We evaluate our approach in a collaborative cooking environment with up to 30 unique recipes and compare it to three comparable human goal prediction algorithms.

Conventional asynchronous Byzantine agreement protocols require every party to broadcast its requests (e.g., transactions), and at the end of the protocol, parties agree on one party's request. If parties agree on one party's requests while exchanging every party's request, the protocol becomes expensive. These protocols are used to design an atomic broadcast (ABC) protocol where parties agree on $\\langle n-f \\rangle$ parties' requests (assuming $n=3f+1$, where $n$ is the total number of parties, and $f$ is the number of Byzantine parties). Although the parties agree on a subset of requests in the ABC protocol, if the requests do not vary (are duplicated), investing in a costly protocol is not justified. We propose Slim-HBBFT, an atomic broadcast protocol that considers requests from a fraction of $n$ parties and improves communication complexity by a factor of $O(n)$. At the core of our design is a prioritized provable-broadcast (P-PB) protocol that generates proof of broadcast only for selected parties.

However, this process is irreversible: once composited, layer-level editing is no longer possible. Existing methods commonly rely on image matting and inpainting, but remain limited in controllability and segmentation precision. To address these challenges, we propose two key modules: LayerDecompose-DiT (LD-DiT), which decouples image elements into distinct layers and enables fine-grained control; and Multi-Layer Conditional Adapter (MLCA), which injects target image information into multi-layer tokens to achieve precise conditional generation. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, we build a new benchmark and introduce tailored evaluation metrics. Experimental results show that CLD consistently outperforms existing methods in both decomposition quality and controllability.

Extending the classical concept of important separators, we introduce and analyze connectivity-preserving important separators, which are important separators that not only disconnect designated terminal sets $A$ and $B$ but also satisfy an arbitrary set of connectivity constraints over the terminals. These constraints can express requirements such as preserving the internal connectivity of each terminal set, enforcing pairwise connections defined by an equivalence relation, or maintaining reachability from a specified subset of vertices. We prove that for any graph $G=(V,E)$, terminal sets $A,B\\subseteq V$, and integer $k$, the number of important $A,B$-separators of size at most $k$ satisfying a set of connectivity constraints is bounded by $2^{O(k\\log k)}$, and that all such separators can be enumerated within $O(2^{O(k\\log k)} \\cdot n \\cdot T(n,m))$ time, where $T(n,m)$ is the time required to compute a minimum $s,t$-separator. As an application, we obtain a new fixed-parameter-tractable algorithm for the Node Multiway Cut-Uncut (N-MWCU) problem, parameterized by $k$, the size of the separator set. The algorithm runs in $O(2^{O(k\\log k)} \\cdot n \\cdot m^{1+o(1)})$ time for graphs with polynomially-bounded integer weights. This significantly improves the dependence on $k$ from the previous $2^{O(k^2\\log k)}$ to $2^{O(k\\log k)}$, thereby breaking a long-standing barrier, and simultaneously improves the polynomial factors. Our framework generalises the important-separator paradigm to separation problems in which the deletion set must satisfy both cut and uncut constraints on terminal subsets, thus offering a refined combinatorial foundation for designing fixed-parameter algorithms for cut-uncut problems in graphs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u5206\u79bb\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5206\u9694\u7b26\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u56fe\u5206\u79bb\u95ee\u9898\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5206\u9694\u7b26\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5206\u9694\u7b26\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u6027\u8d28\u3002\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u56fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e00\u7ec4\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5206\u9694\u7b26\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u56fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5206\u9694\u7b26\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570k\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u56fe\u5206\u79bb\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5206\u9694\u7b26\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5206\u9694\u7b26\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u5206\u9694\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ec8\u7aef\u5b50\u96c6\u7684\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56fa\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Existing agent-based and pipeline-based methods often rely on insufficient tests, which can lead to patches that satisfy verification but fail to fix the underlying defect. We present InfCode, an adversarial multi-agent framework for automated repository-level issue resolution. InfCode iteratively refines both tests and patches through adversarial interaction between a Test Patch Generator and a Code Patch Generator, while a Selector agent identifies the most reliable fix. The framework runs inside a containerized environment that supports realistic repository inspection, modification, and validation.

On one hand, it is essential to allocate the limited onboard computational and communication resources efficiently to serve geographically distributed users. On the other hand, the dynamic nature of satellite orbits necessitates effective service migration strategies to maintain service continuity and quality as the coverage areas of satellites evolve. We formulate this problem as a spatio-temporal Markov decision process, where satellites, ground users, and flight users are modeled as nodes in a time-varying graph. The node features incorporate queuing dynamics to characterize packet loss probabilities. To solve this problem, we propose a Graph-Aware Temporal Encoder (GATE) that jointly models spatial correlations and temporal dynamics. GATE uses a two-layer graph convolutional network to extract inter-satellite and user dependencies and a temporal convolutional network to capture their short-term evolution, producing unified spatio-temporal representations. The resulting spatial-temporal representations are passed into a Hybrid Proximal Policy Optimization (HPPO) framework. This framework features a multi-head actor that outputs both discrete service migration decisions and continuous resource allocation ratios, along with a critic for value estimation. We conduct extensive simulations involving both persistent and intermittent users distributed across real-world population centers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faGATE\u6a21\u578b\u548cHPPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u536b\u661f\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u8fc1\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5ef6\u8fdf\u654f\u611f\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u536b\u661f\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u7403\u65e0\u7f1d\u670d\u52a1\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f46\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u6311\u6218\u4e9f\u5f85\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u65f6\u7a7a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51faGATE\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528HPPO\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u51b3\u7b56\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86GATE\u548cHPPO\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6301\u4e45\u548c\u95f4\u6b47\u7528\u6237\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u7684GATE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caHPPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u536b\u661f\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u8fc1\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Simple static resource allocation methods struggle to handle the variability in per-chromosome RAM demands, resulting in poor resource utilization and long runtimes. In this work, we propose multiple mechanisms for adaptive, RAM-efficient parallelization of chromosome-level bioinformatics workflows. First, we develop a symbolic regression model that estimates per-chromosome memory consumption for a given task and introduces an interpolating bias to conservatively minimize over-allocation. Second, we present a dynamic scheduler that adaptively predicts RAM usage with a polynomial regression model, treating task packing as a Knapsack problem to optimally batch jobs based on predicted memory requirements. Additionally, we present a static scheduler that optimizes chromosome processing order to minimize peak memory while preserving throughput. Our proposed methods, evaluated on simulations and real-world genomic pipelines, provide new mechanisms to reduce memory overruns and balance load across threads. We thereby achieve faster end-to-end execution, showcasing the potential to optimize large-scale genomic workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94RAM\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u533b\u5b66\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u5e38\u56e0\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u591a\u53d8\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u6bcf\u67d3\u8272\u4f53\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u63d2\u503c\u504f\u7f6e\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5206\u914d\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u56de\u5f52\u9884\u6d4bRAM\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u6253\u5305\u89c6\u4e3a\u80cc\u5305\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u67d3\u8272\u4f53\u5904\u7406\u987a\u5e8f\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5cf0\u503c\u5185\u5b58\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u7ba1\u9053\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u6ea2\u51fa\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u7ebf\u7a0b\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u52a0\u5feb\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6267\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94RAM\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u6ea2\u51fa\u548c\u7ebf\u7a0b\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6267\u884c\u3002"}}

Specifically, we classify rendering errors into missing-color and occlusion types, then apply targeted corrections via backprojection or foreground splitting guided by cross-view color consistency.

For seen objects, high accuracy is often attainable via per-object fine-tuning but generalizing to unseen objects remains a challenge. To address this problem, past arts assume access to CAD models at test time and typically follow a multi-stage pipeline to estimate poses: detect and segment the object, propose an initial pose, and then refine it. Under occlusion, however, the early-stage of such pipelines are prone to errors, which can propagate through the sequential processing, and consequently degrade the performance. To remedy this shortcoming, we propose four novel extensions to model-based 6D pose estimation methods: (i) a dynamic non-uniform dense sampling strategy that focuses computation on visible regions, reducing occlusion-induced errors; (ii) a multi-hypothesis inference mechanism that retains several confidence-ranked pose candidates, mitigating brittle single-path failures; (iii) iterative refinement to progressively improve pose accuracy; and (iv) series of occlusion-focused training augmentations that strengthen robustness and generalization. Furthermore, we propose a new weighted by visibility metric for evaluation under occlusion to minimize the bias in the existing protocols.

Current scheduling approaches often overlook or oversimplify PAT delays, leading to inefficient contact planning and overestimated network capacities. We present a validated model for quantifying retargeting delays, defined as the delay-inducing portion of PAT before data transmission begins, encompassing coarse pointing, fine pointing, and the handover to tracking. The model is grounded in mission data from NASA TBIRD, LLCD, DSOC, and ESA's Lunar Optical Communication Terminal. We find that PAT delays exhibit multimodal distributions based on prior link geometry and scale nonlinearly with initial pointing uncertainty and optical beam width. Integrating these delay models into routing and scheduling algorithms will enable more accurate contact planning and higher utilization in optical networks.

Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO), 2025", "summary": "Many robots are not equipped with a manipulator and many objects are not suitable for prehensile manipulation (such as large boxes and cylinders). In these cases, pushing is a simple yet effective non-prehensile skill for robots to interact with and further change the environment. Existing work often assumes a set of predefined pushing modes and fixed-shape objects. This work tackles the general problem of controlling a robotic fleet to push collaboratively numerous arbitrary objects to respective destinations, within complex environments of cluttered and movable obstacles. It incorporates several characteristic challenges for multi-robot systems such as online task coordination under large uncertainties of cost and duration, and for contact-rich tasks such as hybrid switching among different contact modes, and under-actuation due to constrained contact forces. The proposed method is based on combinatorial hybrid optimization over dynamic task assignments and hybrid execution via sequences of pushing modes and associated forces. It consists of three main components: (I) the decomposition, ordering and rolling assignment of pushing subtasks to robot subgroups; (II) the keyframe guided hybrid search to optimize the sequence of parameterized pushing modes for each subtask; (III) the hybrid control to execute these modes and transit among them. Last but not least, a diffusion-based accelerator is adopted to predict the keyframes and pushing modes that should be prioritized during hybrid search; and further improve planning efficiency. The framework is complete under mild assumptions. Its efficiency and effectiveness under different numbers of robots and general-shaped objects are validated extensively in simulations and hardware experiments, as well as generalizations to heterogeneous robots, planar assembly and 6D pushing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u534f\u4f5c\u63a8\u52a8\u4efb\u610f\u7269\u4f53\u5230\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u7684\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u548c\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u672a\u914d\u5907\u673a\u68b0\u624b\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u6293\u53d6\u64cd\u4f5c\uff08\u5982\u5927\u7bb1\u5b50\u548c\u5706\u67f1\u4f53\uff09\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u975e\u6293\u53d6\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4e92\u52a8\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u53d8\u73af\u5883\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u4e00\u7ec4\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u63a8\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8230\u961f\u534f\u4f5c\u63a8\u52a8\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u610f\u7269\u4f53\u5230\u5404\u81ea\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u7684\u666e\u904d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6742\u4e71\u548c\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u969c\u788d\u7269\u7684\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u6267\u884c\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a(I) \u5c06\u63a8\u52a8\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u6eda\u52a8\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b50\u7ec4\uff1b(II) \u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u641c\u7d22\u4f18\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u63a8\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b(III) \u6df7\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u6267\u884c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u5728\u5b83\u4eec\u4e4b\u95f4\u8f6c\u6362\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u641c\u7d22\u4e2d\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u548c\u63a8\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u89c4\u5212\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u4e00\u822c\u5f62\u72b6\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u5f02\u6784\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3001\u5e73\u9762\u7ec4\u88c5\u548c6D\u63a8\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u662f\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\uff0c\u5176\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u4e00\u822c\u5f62\u72b6\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u5f02\u6784\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3001\u5e73\u9762\u7ec4\u88c5\u548c6D\u63a8\u52a8\u3002"}}

Conventional approaches employ symmetric tile buffering, where the buffered tile size of the input $A$ along the dimension $M$ matches the output tile size of $C$.\n  In this paper, we introduce asymmetric tile buffering (ATB), a simple but powerful technique that decouples the buffered tile dimensions of the input and output operands. We show, for the first time, that ATB is both practical and highly beneficial. To explain this effect, we develop a performance model that incorporates both the benefits of ATB (higher arithmetic intensity) and its overheads (higher kernel switching costs), providing insight into how to select effective ATB tiling factors. As a case study, we apply ATB to AMD's latest XDNA2 AI Engine (AIE), achieving up to a 4.54x speedup, from 4.8 to 24.6 TFLOPS on mixed-precision BFP16--BF16 GEMM, establishing a new performance record for XDNA2 AIE.", "AI": {"tldr": "ATB\u6280\u672f\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u5757\u5c3a\u5bf8\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347GEMM\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728AMD XDNA2 AIE\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b04.54\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5bf9\u79f0\u5757\u7f13\u51b2\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u5757\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5339\u914d\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u6709\u9650\uff0cATB\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7b97\u672f\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5757\u7f13\u51b2\uff08ATB\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u6709\u6548\u7684ATB\u5206\u5757\u56e0\u5b50\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u5728AMD XDNA2 AIE\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528ATB\u540e\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6BFP16--BF16 GEMM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4ece4.8 TFLOPS\u63d0\u5347\u81f324.6 TFLOPS\u3002", "conclusion": "ATB\u6280\u672f\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u7684\u7f13\u51b2\u5757\u5c3a\u5bf8\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728AMD XDNA2 AIE\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe4.54\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002"}}

The mainstream solution is adversarial training (AT) to improve robustness; however, AT often brings a clean--robustness trade-off and high training/tuning cost, which limits scalability and maintainability in medical imaging. We propose \\emph{Layer-wise Noise-Guided Selective Wavelet Reconstruction (LNG-SWR)}. During training, we inject small, zero-mean noise at multiple layers to learn a frequency-bias prior that steers representations away from noise-sensitive directions. We then apply prior-guided selective wavelet reconstruction on the input/feature branch to achieve frequency adaptation: suppress noise-sensitive bands, enhance directional structures and shape cues, and stabilize boundary responses while maintaining spectral consistency. The framework is backbone-agnostic and adds low additional inference overhead. It can serve as a plug-in enhancement to AT and also improves robustness without AT. On CT and ultrasound datasets, under a unified protocol with PGD-$L_{\\infty}/L_{2}$ and SSAH, LNG-SWR delivers consistent gains on clean Dice/IoU and significantly reduces the performance drop under strong attacks; combining LNG-SWR with AT yields additive gains.

However, most deep learning-based methods heavily rely on large amounts of annotated training data, which are typically unavailable for historical maps, especially for those belonging to specific, homogeneous cartographic domains, also known as corpora. Creating high-quality training data suitable for machine learning often takes a significant amount of time and involves extensive manual effort. While synthetic training data can alleviate the scarcity of real-world samples, it often lacks the affinity (realism) and diversity (variation) necessary for effective learning. By transferring the cartographic style of an original historical map corpus onto vector data, we bootstrap an effectively unlimited number of synthetic historical maps suitable for tasks such as land-cover interpretation of a homogeneous historical map corpus. We propose an automatic deep generative approach and a alternative manual stochastic degradation technique to emulate the visual uncertainty and noise, also known as data-dependent uncertainty, commonly observed in historical map scans.

Recent instruction-first systems translate grids into concise natural-language or DSL rules executed in generate-execute-select loops, yet we lack a principled account of how encodings shape model perception and how to separate instruction errors from execution errors. We hypothesize that modality imposes perceptual bottlenecks -- text flattens 2D structure into 1D tokens while images preserve layout but can introduce patch-size aliasing -- thereby shaping which grid features are reliably perceived. To test this, we isolate perception from reasoning across nine text and image modalities using a weighted set-disagreement metric and a two-stage reasoning pipeline, finding that structured text yields precise coordinates on sparse features, images capture 2D shapes yet are resolution-sensitive, and combining them improves execution (about 8 perception points; about 0.20 median similarity).

In this paper, we propose a Bio-inspired Integrated Networking and Control (BINC) scheme, enabling efficient formation management for swarms comprising thousands of UAVs. The scheme forms a two-layer hierarchical structure, where network clusters and formations share the same groups so that cross-cluster control is eliminated. For networking, we design a fused routing message together with control information to reduce overhead, and limit clusters' size to local two-hop topologies for fast command transmission. For controlling, we develop a hybrid bio-inspired control approach, including a pigeon-like leader-follower algorithm within formations under the consideration of cluster topology maintenance, and a starling-like algorithm among formations that helps to improve the ability of obstacle avoidance. We establish a simulation platform for UAV swarms with over 1000 nodes, and experimental results show that the proposed BINC scheme can achieve highly maneuverable swarm formation marching with significant reduction on communication overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faBINC\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7fa4\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u7f16\u961f\u673a\u52a8\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7fa4\u9762\u4e34\u7f51\u7edc\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u7f16\u961f\u63a7\u5236\u9700\u6c42\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u9ad8\u5f00\u9500\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u5c42\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u96c6\u7fa4\u548c\u7f16\u961f\u5171\u4eab\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u7ec4\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u8de8\u96c6\u7fa4\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u9762\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u878d\u5408\u8def\u7531\u6d88\u606f\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u96c6\u7fa4\u5927\u5c0f\u9650\u5236\u4e3a\u672c\u5730\u4e24\u8df3\u62d3\u6251\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u547d\u4ee4\u4f20\u8f93\u3002\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8003\u8651\u96c6\u7fa4\u62d3\u6251\u7ef4\u62a4\u7684\u9e3d\u7c7b\u9886\u5bfc\u8005-\u8ddf\u968f\u8005\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u63d0\u9ad8\u907f\u969c\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u661f\u690b\u9e1f\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBINC\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u8d85\u8fc71000\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7fa4\u4eff\u771f\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u5ea6\u673a\u52a8\u7684\u7f16\u961f\u884c\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684BINC\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u673a\u52a8\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7fa4\u7f16\u961f\u884c\u8fdb\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose a self-adaptive approach based on Control Theory to dynamically regulate client-side I/O rates.

To ensure revenue guarantees under uncertainty, the decision maker must balance consumption across products. Based on this, the prevalent policy \"inventory balancing (IB)\" has proved to be optimal or near-optimal competitive in almost all classic settings. However, these models do not capture various forms of inventory shocks on the supply side, which play an important role in real-world online assortment and can significantly impact the revenue performance of the IB algorithm.\n  Motivated by this paradigm, we introduce a variant of online assortment planning with inventory shocks. Our model considers adversarial exogenous shocks (where supply increases unpredictably) and allocation-coupled endogenous shocks (where an inventory reduction is triggered by the algorithms and re-adjusted after a usage duration), whose combination leads to non-monotonic inventory fluctuations. As our main result, we show the robustness of IB-type strategies against such shocks by designing a new family of optimal competitive algorithms called \"Batched Inventory Balancing (BIB).\" Using a novel randomized primal-dual method, we bound the competitive ratio of BIB against optimal offline. We show that with proper choice of a certain parameter, this competitive ratio is asymptotically optimal and converges to (1-1/e) as initial inventories grow, in contrast to the original IB which no longer achieves the optimal ratio in this new model. Moreover, we characterize BIB's competitive ratio parametric by its penalty function and show that it matches exactly the competitive ratio of IB without shocks. Our refined analysis reduces the dual construction to a combinatorial \"interval assignment problem\" whose algorithmic solution may be of independent interest.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faBIB\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u5e93\u5b58\u6ce2\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u7ade\u4e89\u6bd4\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfIB\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5728\u7ebf\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u8003\u8651\u4f9b\u5e94\u7aef\u7684\u5e93\u5b58\u51b2\u51fb\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7684\u5e93\u5b58\u6ce2\u52a8\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cdIB\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u968f\u673a\u5316\u539f\u59cb-\u5bf9\u5076\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86BIB\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u533a\u95f4\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u5076\u6784\u9020\u3002", "result": "BIB\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5e93\u5b58\u6ce2\u52a8\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u4f18\u7ade\u4e89\u6bd4\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u4e0e\u65e0\u51b2\u51fb\u65f6\u7684IB\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ade\u4e89\u6bd4\u5b8c\u5168\u5339\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "Batched Inventory Balancing (BIB)\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5e93\u5b58\u6ce2\u52a8\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u7ade\u4e89\u6bd4\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u5e93\u5b58\u589e\u957f\u65f6\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u4e8e(1-1/e)\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfIB\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While vast quantities of zero-carbon energy are routinely curtailed, today's centralized datacenter architectures remain poorly matched to this reality in both energy proportionality and geographic flexibility. This work envisions a shift toward a distributed fabric of renewable-powered micro-datacenters that dynamically follow the availability of surplus green energy through live workload migration.\n  At the core of this vision lies a formal feasibility-domain model that delineates when migratory AI computation is practically achievable. By explicitly linking checkpoint size, wide-area bandwidth, and renewable-window duration, the model reveals that migration is almost always energetically justified, and that time-not energy-is the dominant constraint shaping feasibility. This insight enables the design of a feasibility-aware orchestration framework that transforms migration from a best-effort heuristic into a principled control mechanism. Trace-driven evaluation shows that such orchestration can simultaneously reduce non-renewable energy use and improve performance stability, overcoming the tradeoffs of purely energy-driven strategies.\n  Beyond the immediate feasibility analysis, the extended version explores the architectural horizon of renewable-aware AI infrastructures. It examines the role of emerging ultra-efficient GPU-enabled edge platforms, anticipates integration with grid-level control and demand-response ecosystems, and outlines paths toward supporting partially migratable and distributed workloads.

Bi-AQUA employs a hierarchical three-level lighting adaptation mechanism: a Lighting Encoder that extracts lighting representations from RGB images without manual annotation and is implicitly supervised by the imitation objective, FiLM modulation of visual backbone features for adaptive, lighting-aware feature extraction, and an explicit lighting token added to the transformer encoder input for task-aware conditioning. Experiments on a real-world underwater pick-and-place task under diverse static and dynamic lighting conditions show that Bi-AQUA achieves robust performance and substantially outperforms a bilateral baseline without lighting modeling. Ablation studies further confirm that all three lighting-aware components are critical. This work bridges terrestrial bilateral control-based imitation learning and underwater manipulation, enabling force-sensitive autonomous operation in challenging marine environments.

Motivated by this, and considering various benefits of mobile device deployment (data privacy, operating without internet connectivity, and potentially faster responses), this paper develops Texture3dgs, an optimized mapping of 3DGS for a mobile GPU. A critical challenge in this area turns out to be optimizing for the two-dimensional (2D) texture cache, which needs to be exploited for faster executions on mobile GPUs. As a sorting method dominates the computations in 3DGS on mobile platforms, the core of Texture3dgs is a novel sorting algorithm where the processing, data movement, and placement are highly optimized for 2D memory. The properties of this algorithm are analyzed in view of a cost model for the texture cache. In addition, we accelerate other steps of the 3DGS algorithm through improved variable layout design and other optimizations. End-to-end evaluation shows that Texture3dgs delivers up to 4.1$\\times$ and 1.7$\\times$ speedup for the sorting and overall 3D scene reconstruction, respectively -- while also reducing memory usage by up to 1.6$\\times$ -- demonstrating the effectiveness of our design for efficient mobile 3D scene reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Texture3dgs\u4f18\u5316\u4e863D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u5728\u79fb\u52a8GPU\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u8003\u8651\u5230\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff08\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u7f51\u7edc\u8fde\u63a5\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u66f4\u5feb\uff09\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u4f18\u53163D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff083DGS\uff09\u5728\u79fb\u52a8GPU\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e862D\u5185\u5b58\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u3001\u79fb\u52a8\u548c\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf\u5e03\u5c40\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "Texture3dgs\u5728\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u6574\u4f533D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e864.1\u500d\u548c1.7\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u51cf\u5c11\u4e861.6\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "Texture3dgs\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u53162D\u7eb9\u7406\u7f13\u5b58\u548c\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8GPU\u4e0a\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002"}}

Prior work includes asymptotically optimal competitive ratios of $O(1)$ for the clairvoyant setting and $O(\\sqrt{n})$ of the nonclairvoyant setting, where $n$ is the number of items. The goal of this paper is to significantly reduce the competitive ratio for the nonclairvoyant case by leveraging predictions: when a request arrives, the true deadline of the request is not revealed, but the algorithm is given a predicted deadline.\n  The main result is an algorithm whose competitive ratio is $O(\\min(\u03b7^{1/3}\\log^{2/3}(n), \\sqrt\u03b7, \\sqrt{n}))$, where $n$ is the number of item types and $\u03b7\\leq n^2$ quantifies how flawed the predictions are in terms of the number of ``instantaneous item inversions.'' Thus, the algorithm is robust, i.e., it is never worse than the nonclairvoyant solution, and it is consistent, i.e., if the predictions exhibit no inversions, then the algorithm behaves similarly to the clairvoyant algorithm. Moreover, if the error is not too large, specifically $\u03b7< o(n^{3/2}/\\log^2(n))$, then the algorithm obtains an asymptotically better competitive ratio than the nonclairvoyant algorithm.

This stems from a critical \\textit{rationale gap}, where sparse domain data is insufficient to bridge the semantic distance between complex spatio-temporal content and abstract classification labels. We propose a two-stage self-improvement paradigm to bridge this gap without new annotations. First, we prompt the VLMs to generate detailed textual rationales for each video, compelling them to articulate the domain-specific logic. The VLM is then fine-tuned on these self-generated rationales, utilizing this intermediate supervision to align its representations with the nuances of the target domain. Second, conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is performed on the task labels, achieving markedly higher effectiveness as a result of the model's pre-acquired domain reasoning.

To address this issue, we propose a method for generating general-purpose, information-dense summaries that act as plain-text repositories of web content. Inspired by Hegel's dialectical method, our approach, denoted as Chain of Summaries (CoS), iteratively refines an initial summary (thesis) by identifying its limitations through questioning (antithesis), leading to a general-purpose summary (synthesis) that can satisfy current and anticipate future information needs. Experiments on the TriviaQA, TruthfulQA, and SQUAD datasets demonstrate that CoS outperforms zero-shot LLM baselines by up to 66% and specialized summarization methods such as BRIO and PEGASUS by up to 27%. CoS-generated summaries yield higher Q&A performance compared to the source content, while requiring substantially fewer tokens and being agnostic to the specific downstream LLM.

While LLMs excel at general-purpose code generation, the unique constraints of Smart Contracts, such as gas consumption, security, and determinism, raise open questions about the reliability of LLM-generated Solidity code. Existing studies lack a comprehensive evaluation of these critical functional and non-functional properties. We benchmark four state-of-the-art models under zero-shot and retrieval-augmented generation settings across 500 real-world functions. Our multi-faceted assessment employs code similarity metrics, semantic embeddings, automated test execution, gas profiling, and cognitive and cyclomatic complexity analysis. Results show that while LLMs produce code with high semantic similarity to real contracts, their functional correctness is low: only 20% to 26% of zero-shot generations behave identically to ground-truth implementations under testing. The generated code is consistently simpler, with significantly lower complexity and gas consumption, often due to omitted validation logic. Retrieval-Augmented Generation markedly improves performance, boosting functional correctness by up to 45% and yielding more concise and efficient code. Our findings reveal a significant gap between semantic similarity and functional plausibility in LLM-generated Smart Contracts.

The recently standardized Wireless Access Backhaul (WAB) architecture represents a key evolution, enabling cost-effective network densification through wireless relaying. This paper presents the first experimental realization of a multi-band WAB testbed, combining an FR2 backhaul and an FR1 access link using open-source software and commercial off-the-shelf components. The proposed framework validates the feasibility of end-to-end WAB operation and demonstrates its ability to extend FR2 coverage while maintaining compatibility with legacy FR1 user equipment. Experimental campaigns conducted in vehicular and outdoor-to-indoor scenarios confirm that WAB effectively mitigates the limitations of FR2 links, particularly in uplink and Non-Line-of-Sight conditions.

By merging the fields of transportation and manipulation into a coordinated swarm of magnetic robots (MagBots), we enable manufacturing systems to achieve significantly higher efficiency, adaptability, and compactness.

However, FL faces critical challenges related to communication overhead and local resource constraints, especially in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs) with billions of parameters. The sheer size of these models exacerbates both memory and communication constraints, making efficient transmission and processing essential for practical deployment. NVIDIA FLARE, an open-source SDK for federated learning, addresses these challenges by introducing advanced communication capabilities. Building upon existing solutions for large object streaming, we enhance FL workflows for LLMs through two key techniques: message quantization and container/file streaming. Quantization reduces message size, while streaming enables efficient memory management, improving scalability and integration with existing workflows.

Although extensively studied, existing UV unwrapping methods frequently struggle with AI-generated meshes, which are typically noisy, bumpy, and poorly conditioned. These methods often produce highly fragmented charts and suboptimal boundaries, introducing artifacts and hindering downstream tasks. We introduce PartUV, a part-based UV unwrapping pipeline that generates significantly fewer, part-aligned charts while maintaining low distortion. Built on top of a recent learning-based part decomposition method PartField, PartUV combines high-level semantic part decomposition with novel geometric heuristics in a top-down recursive framework. It ensures each chart's distortion remains below a user-specified threshold while minimizing the total number of charts. The pipeline integrates and extends parameterization and packing algorithms, incorporates dedicated handling of non-manifold and degenerate meshes, and is extensively parallelized for efficiency. Evaluated across four diverse datasets, including man-made, CAD, AI-generated, and Common Shapes, PartUV outperforms existing tools and recent neural methods in chart count and seam length, achieves comparable distortion, exhibits high success rates on challenging meshes, and enables new applications like part-specific multi-tiles packing.

The best previously known deterministic algorithm uses $\\tilde{O}(n^{1-1/k!})$ colors for general $k$ and $\\tilde{O}(n^{5/6})$ colors for $k = 4$, both given by Kierstead in 1998. In this paper, nearly thirty years later, we have finally made progress. Our results are summarized as follows:\n  (1) $k \\geq 5$ case. We provide a deterministic online algorithm to color $k$-colorable graphs with $\\tilde{O}(n^{1-2/(k(k-1))})$ colors, significantly improving the current upper bound of $\\tilde{O}(n^{1-1/k!})$\n  (2) $k = 4$ case.

Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has played a pivotal role in multimodal learning. However, its focus on single-label, single-granularity alignment limits its effectiveness in complex domains such as medical imaging, where images often correspond to multiple high-level labels (e.g., disease categories) across different annotation granularities (e.g., diagnostic description, clinical explanation). To address this, we propose Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL), a contrastive learning framework designed to improve both multi-label and cross-granularity alignment. MGLL leverages structured multi-label supervision, integrates textual descriptions across granularities, and introduces soft-label supervision with point-wise constraints to enhance alignment. MGLL employs smooth Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to ensure cross-granularity consistency while maintaining computational efficiency as a plug-and-play module for vision-language models. Pretrained on our constructed large-scale multi-granular datasets and evaluated across multiple datasets, MGLL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks.

In safety-critical environments such as construction sites, accident data often exists in multiple formats, such as written reports, inspection records, and site imagery, making it challenging to synthesize hazards using traditional approaches. To address this, this thesis proposed a multimodal AI framework that combines text and image analysis to assist in identifying safety hazards on construction sites. Two case studies were consucted to evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for automated hazard identification.The first case study introduces a hybrid pipeline that utilizes GPT 4o and GPT 4o mini to extract structured insights from a dataset of 28,000 OSHA accident reports (2000-2025). The second case study extends this investigation using Molmo 7B and Qwen2 VL 2B, lightweight, open-source VLMs. Using the public ConstructionSite10k dataset, the performance of the two models was evaluated on rule-level safety violation detection using natural language prompts. This experiment served as a cost-aware benchmark against proprietary models and allowed testing at scale with ground-truth labels.

Based on 19 semi-structured interviews with 20 experts (50 hours of transcripts) and a six-phase thematic analysis, we develop a taxonomy of 18 recurring annotation error types across three data-quality dimensions: completeness (e.g., attribute omission, missing feedback loops, edge-case omissions, selection bias), accuracy (e.g., mislabelling, bounding-box inaccuracies, granularity mismatches, bias-driven errors), and consistency (e.g., inter-annotator disagreement, ambiguous instructions, misaligned hand-offs, cross-modality inconsistencies). The taxonomy was validated with industry practitioners, who reported its usefulness for root-cause analysis, supplier quality reviews, onboarding, and improving annotation guidelines. They described it as a failure-mode catalogue similar to FMEA.

This survey looks at how well AI-based methods actually deliver on that promise. We organize the review around practical use cases.

To address this, we propose PIPHEN, an innovative distributed physical cognition-control framework. Its core idea is to replace \"raw data communication\" with \"semantic communication\" by performing \"semantic distillation\" at the robot edge, reconstructing high-dimensional perceptual data into compact, structured physical representations. This idea is primarily realized through two key components: (1) a novel Physical Interaction Prediction Network (PIPN), derived from large model knowledge distillation, to generate this representation; and (2) a Hamiltonian Energy Network (HEN) controller, based on energy conservation, to precisely translate this representation into coordinated actions. Experiments show that, compared to baseline methods, PIPHEN can compress the information representation to less than 5% of the original data volume and reduce collaborative decision-making latency from 315ms to 76ms, while significantly improving task success rates.

Classical distributed algorithms assume that nodes follow the prescribed protocol, but this assumption fails when nodes are strategic and may deviate if doing so increases their expected utility.\n  Standard MIS algorithms rely on honest randomness or unique identifiers to break symmetry. In rational settings, however, agents may manipulate randomness, and relying solely on identifiers can create unfairness, giving some nodes zero probability of joining the MIS and thus no incentive to participate. To address these issues, we propose two algorithms based on a utility model in which agents seek locally correct solutions while also having preferences over which solution is chosen. Randomness in our algorithms is generated through pairwise interactions between neighboring nodes, viewed as simple games in which no single node can unilaterally affect the outcome. This allows symmetry breaking while remaining compatible with rational behavior.\n  For both algorithms, we prove that at every stage of the execution, given any history, no agent can increase its expected utility through a unilateral deviation, assuming others follow the algorithm. This gives a stronger guarantee than Trembling-Hand Perfect Equilibrium. When all nodes follow the protocol, every node has a positive probability of joining the MIS, and the final output is a correct MIS.

However, computing it exactly on large graphs is highly challenging, as it requires inverting large graph matrices. Existing solutions mainly rely on approximate random-walk-based methods, which still need large sample sizes and lack strong theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose a new approach for approximating the Kemeny constant via 2-forest sampling. We first derive an unbiased estimator expressed through spanning trees by introducing a path mapping technique that establishes a direct correspondence between spanning trees and certain classes of 2-forests. Compared to random walk-based estimators, 2-forest-based estimators yield leads to a better theoretical bound. We further design efficient algorithms to sample and traverse spanning trees, leveraging data structures such as the Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) for optimization. Our theoretical analysis shows that the Kemeny constant can be approximated with relative error $\u03b5$ in $O\\left(\\frac{\u0394^2\\bar{d}^2}{\u03b5^2}(\u03c4+ n\\min(\\log n, \u0394))\\right)$ time, where $\u03c4$ is the tree-sampling time, $\\bar{d}$ is the average degree, and $\u0394$ is the graph diameter. This complexity is near-linear in practice. Moreover, existing methods largely target static graphs and lack efficient mechanisms for dynamic updates. To address this, we propose two sample maintenance strategies that partially update samples while preserving accuracy on dynamic graphs.

We propose an automated method to select standard 2D views from 3D cardiac ultrasound volumes, allowing physicians to interpret the data in their usual format while benefiting from the speed and usability of 3D scanning. Applying a deep learning view classifier and downstream heuristics based on anatomical landmarks together with heuristics provided by cardiologists, we reconstruct standard echocardiography views. This approach was validated by three cardiologists in blinded evaluation (96\\% accuracy in 1,600 videos from 2 hospitals).

While existing surveys often categorize recent progress based on input modality (e.g., text, image, video, or 3D), we argue that spatial ability is not solely determined by the input format. Instead, our survey introduces a taxonomy that organizes spatial intelligence from cognitive aspect and divides tasks in terms of reasoning complexity, linking them to several cognitive functions. We map existing benchmarks across text only, vision language, and embodied settings onto this taxonomy, and review evaluation metrics and methodologies for assessing spatial reasoning ability. This cognitive perspective enables more principled cross-task comparisons and reveals critical gaps between current model capabilities and human-like reasoning. In addition, we analyze methods for improving spatial ability, spanning both training-based and reasoning-based approaches.

Online Collaborative AI System (OL-CAIS) is a type of CPS that learn online in collaboration with humans to achieve a common goal, which makes it vulnerable to disruptive events that degrade performance. Decision-makers must therefore restore performance while limiting energy impact, creating a trade-off between resilience and greenness. This research addresses how to balance these two properties in OL-CAIS. It aims to model resilience for automatic state detection, develop agent-based policies that optimize the greenness-resilience trade-off, and understand catastrophic forgetting to maintain performance consistency. We model OL-CAIS behavior through three operational states: steady, disruptive, and final. To support recovery during disruptions, we introduce the GResilience framework, which provides recovery strategies through multi-objective optimization (one-agent), game-theoretic decision-making (two-agent), and reinforcement learning (RL-agent). We also design a measurement framework to quantify resilience and greenness. Empirical evaluation uses real and simulated experiments with a collaborative robot learning object classification from human demonstrations. Results show that the resilience model captures performance transitions during disruptions, and that GResilience policies improve green recovery by shortening recovery time, stabilizing performance, and reducing human dependency. RL-agent policies achieve the strongest results, although with a marginal increase in CO2 emissions. We also observe catastrophic forgetting after repeated disruptions, while our policies help maintain steadiness. A comparison with containerized execution shows that containerization cuts CO2 emissions by half. Overall, this research provides models, metrics, and policies that ensure the green recovery of OL-CAIS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faGResilience\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5e73\u8861OL-CAIS\u7684\u97e7\u6027\u4e0e\u7eff\u8272\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u7f29\u77ed\u6062\u590d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11CO2\u6392\u653e\u3002", "motivation": "OL-CAIS\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u7c7bCPS\uff0c\u5728\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6613\u53d7\u5e72\u6270\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u6062\u590d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9650\u5236\u80fd\u6e90\u5f71\u54cd\u4e4b\u95f4\u6743\u8861\u97e7\u6027\u4e0e\u7eff\u8272\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u5355\u4ee3\u7406\uff09\u3001\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u51b3\u7b56\uff08\u53cc\u4ee3\u7406\uff09\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\u4ee3\u7406\uff09\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86GResilience\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u97e7\u6027\u4e0e\u7eff\u8272\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cGResilience\u7b56\u7565\u7f29\u77ed\u6062\u590d\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0cRL\u4ee3\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff08\u5c3d\u7ba1CO2\u6392\u653e\u7565\u6709\u589e\u52a0\uff09\u3002\u5bb9\u5668\u5316\u6267\u884c\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u4e00\u534aCO2\u6392\u653e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aOL-CAIS\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u786e\u4fdd\u7eff\u8272\u6062\u590d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6307\u6807\u548c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u8861\u97e7\u6027\u4e0e\u7eff\u8272\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6062\u590d\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce DynaMimicGen (D-MG), a scalable dataset generation framework that enables policy training from minimal human supervision while uniquely supporting dynamic task settings. Given only a few human demonstrations, D-MG first segments the demonstrations into meaningful sub-tasks, then leverages Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) to adapt and generalize the demonstrated behaviors to novel and dynamically changing environments. Improving prior methods that rely on static assumptions or simplistic trajectory interpolation, D-MG produces smooth, realistic, and task-consistent Cartesian trajectories that adapt in real time to changes in object poses, robot states, or scene geometry during task execution. Our method supports different scenarios - including scene layouts, object instances, and robot configurations - making it suitable for both static and highly dynamic manipulation tasks. We show that robot agents trained via imitation learning on D-MG-generated data achieve strong performance across long-horizon and contact-rich benchmarks, including tasks like cube stacking and placing mugs in drawers, even under unpredictable environment changes. By eliminating the need for extensive human demonstrations and enabling generalization in dynamic settings, D-MG offers a powerful and efficient alternative to manual data collection, paving the way toward scalable, autonomous robot learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "DynaMimicGen (D-MG) \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u5373\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u3002D-MG \u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "D-MG \u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5c11\u91cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u5206\u5272\u4e3a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u57fa\u5143\uff08DMPs\uff09\u5c06\u6f14\u793a\u884c\u4e3a\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u4e14\u4efb\u52a1\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u5728 D-MG \u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u5806\u53e0\u548c\u5c06\u676f\u5b50\u653e\u5165\u62bd\u5c49\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "DynaMimicGen (D-MG) \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u6f14\u793a\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

We are given a set of jobs with their processing times and release times and seek to compute a (possibly preemptive) schedule for them on one machine. Each job incurs a cost that depends on its completion time in the computed schedule, as given by a separate job-dependent cost function for each job, and our objective is to minimize the total resulting cost of all jobs. The best known result for GSP is a polynomial time $O(\\log\\log P)$-approximation algorithm [Bansal and Pruhs, FOCS 2010, SICOMP 2014].\n  We give a quasi-polynomial time $(2+\u03b5)$-approximation algorithm for GSP, assuming that the jobs' processing times are quasi-polynomially bounded integers. For the special case of the weighted tardiness objective, we even obtain an improved approximation ratio of $1+\u03b5$. For this case, no better result had been known than the mentioned $O(\\log\\log P)$-approximation for the general case of GSP. Our algorithms use a reduction to an auxiliary geometric covering problem. In contrast to a related reduction for the special case of weighted flow time [Rohwedder, Wiese, STOC 2021][Armbruster, Rohwedder, Wiese, STOC 2023] for GSP it seems no longer possible to establish a tree-like structure for the rectangles to guide an algorithm that solves this geometric problem. Despite the lack of structure due to the problem itself, we show that an optimal solution can be transformed into a near-optimal solution that has certain structural properties.

These issues become especially critical in human-computer interaction settings, where data quality, semantic reliability, and annotation consistency vary across users and recording conditions. This thesis tackles these challenges by exploring uncertainty-resilient multimodal learning through consistency-guided cross-modal transfer. The central idea is to use cross-modal semantic consistency as a basis for robust representation learning. By projecting heterogeneous modalities into a shared latent space, the proposed framework mitigates modality gaps and uncovers structural relations that support uncertainty estimation and stable feature learning. Building on this foundation, the thesis investigates strategies to enhance semantic robustness, improve data efficiency, and reduce the impact of noise and imperfect supervision without relying on large, high-quality annotations. Experiments on multimodal affect-recognition benchmarks demonstrate that consistency-guided cross-modal transfer significantly improves model stability, discriminative ability, and robustness to noisy or incomplete supervision. Latent space analyses further show that the framework captures reliable cross-modal structure even under challenging conditions. Overall, this thesis offers a unified perspective on resilient multimodal learning by integrating uncertainty modeling, semantic alignment, and data-efficient supervision, providing practical insights for developing reliable and adaptive brain-computer interface systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u3001\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u6001\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u8111\u673a\u63a5\u53e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

We present MyAntFarm.ai, a reproducible containerized framework demonstrating that multi-agent orchestration fundamentally transforms LLM-based incident response quality. Through 348 controlled trials comparing single-agent copilot versus multi-agent systems on identical incident scenarios, we find that multi-agent orchestration achieves 100% actionable recommendation rate versus 1.7% for single-agent approaches, an 80 times improvement in action specificity and 140 times improvement in solution correctness. Critically, multi-agent systems exhibit zero quality variance across all trials, enabling production SLA commitments impossible with inconsistent single-agent outputs. Both architectures achieve similar comprehension latency (approx.40s), establishing that the architectural value lies in deterministic quality, not speed. We introduce Decision Quality (DQ), a novel metric capturing validity, specificity, and correctness properties essential for operational deployment that existing LLM metrics do not address.

However, existing methods that fine-tune CLIP for segmentation on limited seen categories often lead to overfitting and degrade the pretrained vision-language alignment. To stabilize modality alignment during fine-tuning, we propose InfoCLIP, which leverages an information-theoretic perspective to transfer alignment knowledge from pretrained CLIP to the segmentation task. Specifically, this transfer is guided by two novel objectives grounded in mutual information. First, we compress the pixel-text modality alignment from pretrained CLIP to reduce noise arising from its coarse-grained local semantic representations learned under image-text supervision. Second, we maximize the mutual information between the alignment knowledge of pretrained CLIP and the fine-tuned model to transfer compact local semantic relations suited for the segmentation task.

Moreover, their performance typically declines when addressing complex problems that require multi-step reasoning and analysis. In response to these challenges, we propose leveraging both LLMs and AI agents to develop education assistants aimed at enhancing undergraduate learning in biomechanics courses that focus on analyzing the force and moment in the musculoskeletal system of the human body. To achieve our goal, we construct a dual-module framework to enhance LLM performance in biomechanics educational tasks: 1) we apply Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the specificity and logical consistency of LLM's responses to the conceptual true/false questions; 2) we build a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to solve calculation-oriented problems involving multi-step reasoning and code execution. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of several LLMs, i.e., Qwen-1.0-32B, Qwen-2.5-32B, and Llama-70B, on a biomechanics dataset comprising 100 true/false conceptual questions and problems requiring equation derivation and calculation. Our results demonstrate that RAG significantly enhances the performance and stability of LLMs in answering conceptual questions, surpassing those of vanilla models. On the other hand, the MAS constructed using multiple LLMs demonstrates its ability to perform multi-step reasoning, derive equations, execute code, and generate explainable solutions for tasks that require calculation. These findings demonstrate the potential of applying RAG and MAS to enhance LLM performance for specialized courses in engineering curricula, providing a promising direction for developing intelligent tutoring in engineering education.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408RAG\u548cMAS\u7684\u53cc\u6a21\u5757\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLMs\u5728\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u7a0b\u6559\u80b2\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5bfc\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9LLMs\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f3a\u53e3\u548c\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u6559\u80b2\u52a9\u624b\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u672c\u79d1\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u6a21\u5757\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528RAG\u63d0\u9ad8LLMs\u5728\u56de\u7b54\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u7684\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b2) \u6784\u5efaMAS\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "RAG\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u56de\u7b54\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1bMAS\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u65b9\u7a0b\u63a8\u5bfc\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u548c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86RAG\u548cMAS\u5728\u63d0\u5347LLMs\u4e8e\u5de5\u7a0b\u6559\u80b2\u4e13\u4e1a\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Conventional robot cameras, with their small apertures and large depth of field, render both foreground obstacles and background objects in sharp focus, causing occluders to obscure critical scene information. This work establishes a formal connection between animal peering and synthetic aperture (SA) sensing from optical imaging. By having a robot execute a peering motion, its camera describes a wide synthetic aperture. Computational integration of the captured images synthesizes an image with an extremely shallow depth of field, effectively blurring out occluding elements while bringing the background into sharp focus. This efficient, wavelength-independent technique enables real-time, high-resolution perception across various spectral bands. We demonstrate that this approach not only restores basic scene understanding but also empowers advanced visual reasoning in large multimodal models, which fail with conventionally occluded imagery. Unlike feature-dependent multi-view 3D vision methods or active sensors like LiDAR, SA sensing via peering is robust to occlusion, computationally efficient, and immediately deployable on any mobile robot.

Inducing kinesthetic perception through wearable haptic devices has attracted attention, and various devices have been developed in the past. However, these have been limited to verifications on single body parts, and few have applied the same method to multiple body parts as well. In our previous study, we developed a technology that uses the contraction of artificial muscles to deform clothing in three dimensions. Using this technology, we developed a haptic suit that induces kinesthetic perception of 7 motions in multiple upper body. However, perceptual mixing caused by stimulating multiple human muscles has occurred between the shoulder and the elbow. In this paper, we established a new, simplified design policy and developed a novel haptic suit that induces kinesthetic perceptions in the trunk, shoulder, elbow, and wrist by stimulating joints and muscles independently. We experimentally demonstrated the induced kinesthetic perception and examined the relationship between stimulation and perceived kinesthetic perception under the new design policy. Experiments confirmed that Funabot-Upper successfully induces kinesthetic perception across multiple joints while reducing perceptual mixing observed in previous designs. The new suit improved recognition accuracy from 68.8% to 94.6% compared to the previous Funabot-Suit, demonstrating its superiority and potential for future haptic applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Funabot-Upper\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u89e6\u89c9\u5957\u88c5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7acb\u523a\u6fc0\u5173\u8282\u548c\u808c\u8089\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u5173\u8282\u52a8\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u89e6\u89c9\u8bbe\u5907\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u8eab\u4f53\u90e8\u4f4d\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u8bf1\u5bfc\u591a\u4e2a\u8eab\u4f53\u90e8\u4f4d\u52a8\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7acb\u523a\u6fc0\u5173\u8282\u548c\u808c\u8089\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89e6\u89c9\u5957\u88c5\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u89e6\u89c9\u5957\u88c5\u6210\u529f\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u5173\u8282\u7684\u52a8\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002", "conclusion": "Funabot-Upper\u6210\u529f\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u6dc6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece68.8%\u63d0\u5347\u81f394.6%\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u672a\u6765\u89e6\u89c9\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u548c\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, their inherent tendency toward hallucination often introduces functional errors into the generated HDL designs. To address this issue, we propose the framework CorrectHDL that leverages high-level synthesis (HLS) results as functional references to correct potential errors in LLM-generated HDL designs.The input to the proposed framework is a C/C++ program that specifies the target circuit's functionality. The program is provided to an LLM to directly generate an HDL design, whose syntax errors are repaired using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism. The functional correctness of the LLM-generated circuit is iteratively improved by comparing its simulated behavior with an HLS reference design produced by conventional HLS tools, which ensures the functional correctness of the result but can lead to suboptimal area and power efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that circuits generated by the proposed framework achieve significantly better area and power efficiency than conventional HLS designs and approach the quality of human-engineered circuits.

However, bipedal locomotion in different environments is still a challenge when it comes to performing stable and dynamic movements. This is where state estimation plays a crucial role, providing fast and accurate feedback of the robot's floating base state to the motion controller. Although classical state estimation methods such as Kalman filters are widely used in robotics, they require expert knowledge to fine-tune the noise parameters. Due to recent advances in the field of machine learning, deep learning methods are increasingly used for state estimation tasks. In this work, we propose the InEKFormer, a novel hybrid state estimation method that incorporates an invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF) and a Transformer network. We compare our method with the InEKF and the KalmanNet approaches on datasets obtained from the humanoid robot RH5.

Through systematic analysis, we find that conventional demonstration selection (DS) strategies fail to ensure fairness due to demographic imbalance in selected exemplars. To address this, we propose Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), which builds demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations via clustering-based sampling. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show that FADS consistently reduces gender-, race-, and ethnicity-related disparities while maintaining strong accuracy, offering an efficient and scalable path toward fair medical image reasoning.

However, this model-free paradigm often risks instability and unsafe exploration due to the time-varying nature of impedance gains. This work introduces Certified Gaussian Manifold Sampling (C-GMS), a novel trajectory-centric RL framework that learns combined DMP and VIC policies while guaranteeing Lyapunov stability and actuator feasibility by construction. Our approach reframes policy exploration as sampling from a mathematically defined manifold of stable gain schedules.

This problem becomes particularly challenging in the presence of long-tailed in-distribution (ID) datasets, often leading to high false positive rates (FPR) and low tail-class ID classification accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that exploiting inter-sample relationships using a graph-based representation can significantly improve OOD detection in long-tailed recognition of vision datasets. To this end, we use the feature space of a pre-trained model to initialize our graph structure. We account for the differences between the activation layer distribution of the pre-training vs. training data, and actively introduce Gaussianization to alleviate any deviations from a standard normal distribution in the activation layers of the pre-trained model. We then refine this initial graph representation using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to arrive at a feature space suitable for long-tailed OOD detection. This leads us to address the inferior performance observed in ID tail-classes within existing OOD detection methods.

Previous solutions have made progress in explicitly modeling the dynamic obstacle motion for avoidance, but this key dependency of decision-making is time-consuming and unreliable in highly dynamic scenarios with occlusions. On the contrary, without introducing object detection, tracking, and prediction, we empower the reinforcement learning (RL) with single LiDAR sensing to realize an autonomous flight system directly from point to motion. For exteroception, a depth sensing distance map achieving fixed-shape, low-resolution, and detail-safe is encoded from raw point clouds, and an environment change sensing point flow is adopted as motion features extracted from multi-frame observations. These two are integrated into a lightweight and easy-to-learn representation of complex dynamic environments. For action generation, the behavior of avoiding dynamic threats in advance is implicitly driven by the proposed change-aware sensing representation, where the policy optimization is indicated by the relative motion modulated distance field.

Wearable attacks offer a realistic threat model, yet existing approaches usually optimize textures frame by frame and therefore fail to maintain concealment across long video sequences with motion, pose changes, and garment deformation. In this work, a sequence-level optimization framework is introduced to generate natural, printable adversarial textures for shirts, trousers, and hats that remain effective throughout entire walking videos in both digital and physical settings. Product images are first mapped to UV space and converted into a compact palette and control-point parameterization, with ICC locking to keep all colors printable. A physically based human-garment pipeline is then employed to simulate motion, multi-angle camera viewpoints, cloth dynamics, and illumination variation. An expectation-over-transformation objective with temporal weighting is used to optimize the control points so that detection confidence is minimized across whole sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong and stable concealment, high robustness to viewpoint changes, and superior cross-model transferability. Physical garments produced with sublimation printing achieve reliable suppression under indoor and outdoor recordings, confirming real-world feasibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u6253\u5370\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8863\u7269\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u9690\u853d\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u7528\u4e8e\u4eba\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6781\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u64cd\u7eb5\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u76d1\u63a7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9010\u5e27\u4f18\u5316\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u6301\u9690\u853d\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5c06\u4ea7\u54c1\u56fe\u50cf\u6620\u5c04\u5230UV\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8c03\u8272\u677f\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u70b9\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528ICC\u9501\u5b9a\u786e\u4fdd\u6240\u6709\u989c\u8272\u53ef\u6253\u5370\u3002\u968f\u540e\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u670d\u88c5\u7ba1\u9053\u6a21\u62df\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u591a\u89d2\u5ea6\u6444\u50cf\u673a\u89c6\u89d2\u3001\u5e03\u6599\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u671f\u671b\u53d8\u6362\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u70b9\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6574\u4e2a\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u9690\u853d\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5347\u534e\u6253\u5370\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u7269\u7406\u670d\u88c5\u5728\u5ba4\u5185\u548c\u5ba4\u5916\u5f55\u5236\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6291\u5236\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u5176\u73b0\u5b9e\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u7136\u3001\u53ef\u6253\u5370\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u886c\u886b\u3001\u88e4\u5b50\u548c\u5e3d\u5b50\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7eb9\u7406\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u884c\u8d70\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u8fd8\u662f\u7269\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Practical domains, such as business management, require optimizing an open-ended and multi-faceted objective, actively learning environment dynamics from sparse experience, planning over long horizons in stochastic settings, and reasoning over spatial information. Yet existing human--AI benchmarks isolate subsets of these capabilities, limiting our ability to assess holistic decision-making competence. We introduce Mini Amusement Parks (MAPs), an amusement-park simulator designed to evaluate an agent's ability to model its environment, anticipate long-term consequences under uncertainty, and strategically operate a complex business. We provide human baselines and a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM agents, finding that humans outperform these systems by 6.5x on easy mode and 9.8x on medium mode. Our analysis reveals persistent weaknesses in long-horizon optimization, sample-efficient learning, spatial reasoning, and world modelling. By unifying these challenges within a single environment, MAPs offers a new foundation for benchmarking agents capable of adaptable decision making.

In humans, this self-monitoring or metacognition is crucial for learning, decision making and problem solving. For instance, they can evaluate how confident they are in performing a task, thus regulating their own behavior and allocating proper resources. Taking inspiration from neuroscience, we propose a robot metacognition architecture centered on confidence (a second-order judgment on decisions) and we demonstrate it on the use case of autonomous tool invention. We propose the use of confidence as a metacognitive measure within the robot decision making scheme.

In real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR), existing approaches mainly rely on fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images. However, these dense Real-ISR models are limited in their ability to adaptively capture the heterogeneous characteristics of complex real-world degraded samples or enable knowledge sharing between inputs under equivalent computational budgets. To address this, we investigate the integration of sparse MoE into Real-ISR and propose a Mixture-of-Ranks (MoR) architecture for single-step image super-resolution. We introduce a fine-grained expert partitioning strategy that treats each rank in LoRA as an independent expert. This design enables flexible knowledge recombination while isolating fixed-position ranks as shared experts to preserve common-sense features and minimize routing redundancy. Furthermore, we develop a degradation estimation module leveraging CLIP embeddings and predefined positive-negative text pairs to compute relative degradation scores, dynamically guiding expert activation. To better accommodate varying sample complexities, we incorporate zero-expert slots and propose a degradation-aware load-balancing loss, which dynamically adjusts the number of active experts based on degradation severity, ensuring optimal computational resource allocation.

This paper proposes a novel homogeneous Proportional-Integral-Derivative (hPID) control strategy tailored for MRMs to achieve robust and coordinated motion control. Unlike classical PID controllers, the hPID controller leverages the mathematical framework of homogeneous control theory to systematically enhance the stability and convergence properties of the closed-loop system, even in the presence of dynamic uncertainties and external disturbances involved into a system in a homogeneous way. A homogeneous PID structure is designed, ensuring improved convergence of tracking errors through a graded homogeneity approach that generalizes traditional PID gains to nonlinear, state-dependent functions. Stability analysis is conducted using Lyapunov-based methods, demonstrating that the hPID controller guarantees global asymptotic stability and finite-time convergence under mild assumptions. Experimental results on a representative MRM model validate the effectiveness of the hPID controller in achieving high-precision trajectory tracking for both the mobile base and manipulator arm, outperforming conventional linear PID controllers in terms of response time, steady-state error, and robustness to model uncertainties.

Speckle sensing has emerged as a promising method to monitor the cutting process and identify material types in real-time. This paper proposes a material classification technique using a speckle pattern of the material's surface based on deep learning to monitor and control the laser cutting process. The proposed method involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of laser speckle patterns to recognize distinct material types for safe and efficient cutting. Previous methods for material classification using speckle sensing may face issues when the color of the laser used to produce the speckle pattern is changed. Experiments conducted in this study demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in material classification, even when the laser color is changed.

Although incorporating action supervision can alleviate these distractions, its effectiveness is restricted by the scarcity of available action labels. Optical flow represents pixel-level motion between consecutive frames, naturally suppressing background elements and emphasizing moving objects. Motivated by this, we propose robust Latent Action learning with Optical Flow constraints, called LAOF, a pseudo-supervised framework that leverages the agent's optical flow as an action-driven signal to learn latent action representations robust to distractors. Experimental results show that the latent representations learned by LAOF outperform existing methods on downstream imitation learning and reinforcement learning tasks. This superior performance arises from optical flow constraints, which substantially stabilize training and improve the quality of latent representations under extremely label-scarce conditions, while remaining effective as the proportion of action labels increases to 10 percent.

However, extending 3DGS to sparse-view settings remains challenging because of supervision scarcity and overfitting caused by limited viewpoint coverage. In this paper, we present CuriGS, a curriculum-guided framework for sparse-view 3D reconstruction using 3DGS. CuriGS addresses the core challenge of sparse-view synthesis by introducing student views: pseudo-views sampled around ground-truth poses (teacher). For each teacher, we generate multiple groups of student views with different perturbation levels. During training, we follow a curriculum schedule that gradually unlocks higher perturbation level, randomly sampling candidate students from the active level to assist training. Each sampled student is regularized via depth-correlation and co-regularization, and evaluated using a multi-signal metric that combines SSIM, LPIPS, and an image-quality measure. For every teacher and perturbation level, we periodically retain the best-performing students and promote those that satisfy a predefined quality threshold to the training set, resulting in a stable augmentation of sparse training views. Experimental results show that CuriGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both rendering fidelity and geometric consistency across various synthetic and real sparse-view scenes.

Rather than relying solely on final answer correctness, our approach leverages fine grained uncertainty signals: 1) self-assessed confidence alignment, and 2) token-level entropy spikes to detect unreliable and unfaithful reasoning in real time. We design a composite reward function that penalizes unjustified high confidence and entropy spikes, while encouraging stable and accurate reasoning trajectories. These signals guide a reinforcement learning (RL) policy that makes the model more introspective and shapes the model's generation behavior through confidence-aware reward feedback, improving not just outcome correctness but the coherence and faithfulness of their intermediate reasoning steps.

While current slicing technologies offer advanced support strategies, they focus on post-processing optimizations rather than addressing the underlying need for support-efficient design during the model generation phase. This paper introduces SEG (\\textit{\\underline{S}upport-\\underline{E}ffective \\underline{G}eneration}), a novel framework that integrates Direct Preference Optimization with an Offset (ODPO) into the 3D generation pipeline to directly optimize models for minimal support material usage. By incorporating support structure simulation into the training process, SEG encourages the generation of geometries that inherently require fewer supports, thus reducing material waste and production time. We demonstrate SEG's effectiveness through extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, Thingi10k-Val and GPT-3DP-Val, showing that SEG significantly outperforms baseline models such as TRELLIS, DPO, and DRO in terms of support volume reduction and printability. Qualitative results further reveal that SEG maintains high fidelity to input prompts while minimizing the need for support structures.

This includes the collection of heterogeneous data across multiple platforms, with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) seeing significant usage due to their high performance in crop monitoring, forecasting, and prediction tasks. Similarly, satellite missions have been shown to be effective for agriculturally relevant tasks. In contrast to UAVs, such missions are bound to the limitation of spatial resolution, which hinders their effectiveness for modern farming systems focused on micro-plot management. In this work, we propose a cross modal learning strategy that enriches high-resolution satellite imagery with UAV level visual detail for crop canopy trait estimation. Using a dataset of approximately co registered satellite UAV image pairs collected from replicated plots of 84 hybrid maize varieties across five distinct locations in the U.S. Corn Belt, we train a model that learns fine grained spectral spatial correspondences between sensing modalities.

Prior work on LLM-as-a-judge frameworks typically relies on comparing candidate answers against ground-truth labels or other candidate answers using predefined metrics like entailment. However, this approach is inherently indirect and difficult to fully automate, offering limited support for fine-grained and scalable evaluation of reasoning outputs. In this work, we propose JudgeBoard, a novel evaluation pipeline that directly queries models to assess the correctness of candidate answers without requiring extra answer comparisons. We focus on two core reasoning domains: mathematical reasoning and science/commonsense reasoning, and construct task-specific evaluation leaderboards using both accuracy-based ranking and an Elo-based rating system across five benchmark datasets, enabling consistent model comparison as judges rather than comparators. To improve judgment performance in lightweight models, we propose MAJ (Multi-Agent Judging), a novel multi-agent evaluation framework that leverages multiple interacting SLMs with distinct reasoning profiles to approximate LLM-level judgment accuracy through collaborative deliberation. Experimental results reveal a significant performance gap between SLMs and LLMs in isolated judging tasks. However, our MAJ framework substantially improves the reliability and consistency of SLMs. On the MATH dataset, MAJ using smaller-sized models as backbones performs comparatively well or even better than their larger-sized counterparts.

In addition to this domain-shift problem, the real-world food datasets tend to be long-tailed distributed and some dishes of different categories exhibit subtle variations that are difficult to distinguish visually. In this paper, we present a framework empowered with large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges in food recognition. We first leverage LLMs to parse food images to generate food titles and ingredients. Then, we project the generated texts and food images from different domains to a shared embedding space to maximize the pair similarities. Finally, we take the aligned features of both modalities for recognition. With this simple framework, we show that our proposed approach can outperform the existing approaches tailored for long-tailed data distribution, domain adaptation, and fine-grained classification, respectively, on two food datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528LLMs\u751f\u6210\u98df\u7269\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e8e\u5171\u4eab\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u98df\u7269\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u957f\u5c3e\u3001\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u98df\u7269\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u9886\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u957f\u5c3e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u522b\u98df\u7269\u95f4\u89c6\u89c9\u5dee\u5f02\u7ec6\u5fae\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u5148\u5229\u7528LLMs\u89e3\u6790\u98df\u7269\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u98df\u7269\u6807\u9898\u548c\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u672c\u548c\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u98df\u7269\u56fe\u50cf\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u914d\u5bf9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5229\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u98df\u7269\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u957f\u5c3e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u89e3\u6790\u98df\u7269\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u98df\u7269\u6807\u9898\u548c\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u914d\u5bf9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u98df\u7269\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency. A hierarchical evaluation employing diverse teacher-model proxies reduces assessment costs, while modular interface design facilitates seamless system updates. Experimental results demonstrate that KRAL significantly outperforms traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods. It improves knowledge question-answering capability (Accuracy@1 on the external open-source benchmark MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG) and reasoning capability (Pass@1 on the external benchmark PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG), achieved at ~20% of SFT's long-term training costs.

It is generated through a highly autonomous, fully decoupled, and compositional simulation pipeline that enables long-horizon skill composition, flexible task assembly, and heterogeneous embodiments with minimal manual tuning.

While Key and Value (KV) caching in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively studied, next-scale prediction presents unique challenges, and KV caching design for next-scale based VAR transformers remains largely unexplored. A major bottleneck is the excessive KV memory growth with the increasing number of scales-severely limiting scalability. Our systematic investigation reveals that: (1) Attending to tokens from local scales significantly contributes to generation quality (2) Allocating a small amount of memory for the coarsest scales, termed as condensed scales, stabilizes multi-scale image generation (3) Strong KV similarity across finer scales is predominantly observed in cache-efficient layers, whereas cache-demanding layers exhibit weaker inter-scale similarity. Based on the observations, we introduce AMS-KV, a scale-adaptive KV caching policy for next-scale prediction in VAR models. AMS-KV prioritizes storing KVs from condensed and local scales, preserving the most relevant tokens to maintain generation quality. It further optimizes KV cache utilization and computational efficiency identifying cache-demanding layers through inter-scale similarity analysis. Compared to the vanilla next-scale prediction-based VAR models, AMS-KV reduces KV cache usage by up to 84.83% and self-attention latency by 60.48%. Moreover, when the baseline VAR-d30 model encounters out-of-memory failures at a batch size of 128, AMS-KV enables stable scaling to a batch size of 256 with improved throughput.", "AI": {"tldr": "AMS-KV\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9VAR\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3VAR\u6a21\u578b\u4e2dKV\u7f13\u5b58\u5185\u5b58\u589e\u957f\u8fc7\u5feb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165AMS-KV\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u51dd\u805a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4f18\u5316\u7f13\u5b58\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "result": "AMS-KV\u5c06KV\u7f13\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u51cf\u5c1184.83%\uff0c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e60.48%\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5927\u6279\u91cf\u5904\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "AMS-KV\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86VAR\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6279\u91cf\u5904\u7406\u3002"}}

This setup enables the learning of 3D point-based policies for multi-fingered hands that are robust to background changes and can be deployed directly without requiring any robot data (including online corrections, reinforcement learning, or simulation).

This task is inherently challenging due to the sensor's unique spherical geometry, the temporal sparsity of point clouds, and the complexity of dynamic scenes. To address these challenges, we present LiSTAR, a novel generative world model that operates directly on the sensor's native geometry. LiSTAR introduces a Hybrid-Cylindrical-Spherical (HCS) representation to preserve data fidelity by mitigating quantization artifacts common in Cartesian grids. To capture complex dynamics from sparse temporal data, it utilizes a Spatio-Temporal Attention with Ray-Centric Transformer (START) that explicitly models feature evolution along individual sensor rays for robust temporal coherence. Furthermore, for controllable synthesis, we propose a novel 4D point cloud-aligned voxel layout for conditioning and a corresponding discrete Masked Generative START (MaskSTART) framework, which learns a compact, tokenized representation of the scene, enabling efficient, high-resolution, and layout-guided compositional generation. Comprehensive experiments validate LiSTAR's state-of-the-art performance across 4D LiDAR reconstruction, prediction, and conditional generation, with substantial quantitative gains: reducing generation MMD by a massive 76%, improving reconstruction IoU by 32%, and lowering prediction L1 Med by 50%. This level of performance provides a powerful new foundation for creating realistic and controllable autonomous systems simulations.

However, these maps lack the open-vocabulary semantic understanding required for advanced robotic interaction. Integrating language features into SLAM remains a significant challenge, as storing high-dimensional features demands excessive memory and rendering overhead, while existing methods with static models lack adaptability for novel environments. To address these limitations, we propose LEGO-SLAM (Language-Embedded Gaussian Optimization SLAM), the first framework to achieve real-time, open-vocabulary mapping within a 3DGS-based SLAM system. At the core of our method is a scene-adaptive encoder-decoder that distills high-dimensional language embeddings into a compact 16-dimensional feature space. This design reduces the memory per Gaussian and accelerates rendering, enabling real-time performance. Unlike static approaches, our encoder adapts online to unseen scenes. These compact features also enable a language-guided pruning strategy that identifies semantic redundancy, reducing the map's Gaussian count by over 60\\% while maintaining rendering quality.

This study introduces SpectralTrain, a universal, architecture-agnostic training framework that enhances learning efficiency by integrating curriculum learning (CL) with principal component analysis (PCA)-based spectral downsampling. By gradually introducing spectral complexity while preserving essential information, SpectralTrain enables efficient learning of spectral -- spatial patterns at significantly reduced computational costs. The framework is independent of specific architectures, optimizers, or loss functions and is compatible with both classical and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Indian Pines, Salinas-A, and the newly introduced CloudPatch-7 -- demonstrate strong generalization across spatial scales, spectral characteristics, and application domains. The results indicate consistent reductions in training time by 2-7x speedups with small-to-moderate accuracy deltas depending on backbone. Its application to cloud classification further reveals potential in climate-related remote sensing, emphasizing training strategy optimization as an effective complement to architectural design in HSI models.

Methodology: The system uses a supervisedtrained BERT model to interpret player prompts. This model maps textual descriptions to one of many spell prefabs and balances their parameters (damage, cost, effects) to ensure competitive integrity. The game is developed in the Unity Game Engine, and the AI backend is in Python. Expected Results: We expect to deliver a functional prototype that demonstrates the generation of spells in real time, applied to an engaging gameplay loop, where player creativity is central to the experience, validating the use of AI as a direct gameplay mechanic.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faSpellForger\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u73a9\u5bb6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u6cd5\u672f\uff0c\u5229\u7528BERT\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1AI\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22AI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u6e38\u620f\u5171\u521b\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4e0e\u521b\u9020\u6027\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684BERT\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u6790\u73a9\u5bb6\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u9884\u8bbe\u6cd5\u672f\u6a21\u677f\u5e76\u5e73\u8861\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u4f24\u5bb3\u3001\u6210\u672c\u3001\u6548\u679c\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Unity\u5f15\u64ce\u5f00\u53d1\uff0cAI\u540e\u7aef\u7528Python\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u9884\u671f\u4ea4\u4ed8\u4e00\u4e2a\u529f\u80fd\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u6cd5\u672f\u5e76\u878d\u5165\u6e38\u620f\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1AI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76f4\u63a5\u6e38\u620f\u673a\u5236\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86SpellForger\u4f5c\u4e3aAI\u4e0e\u6e38\u620f\u5171\u521b\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Recent advances in visual in-context learning (VICL) demonstrate promising capabilities for solving downstream tasks by unified vision-language models (VLMs). When the visual prompt and the target images originate from different visual tasks, can VLMs still enable VICL? In the paper, we propose a fully collaborative pipeline, i.e. T2T-VICL, for VLMs to investigate the potential of cross-task VICL. Fundamentally, we design a mechanism to generate and select text prompts that best implicitly describe the differences between two distinct low-level vision tasks, and construct the first cross-task VICL dataset. Building upon this, we propose a novel inference framework that combines perceptual score-based reasoning with traditional evaluation metrics to perform cross-task VICL.

Despite its large success in scheduling, only three Constraint Programming (CP) models have been proposed for this problem considering minimum batch sizes, which is a common requirement in many practical settings, including the ion implantation area in semiconductor manufacturing. These existing CP models rely on a predefined virtual set of possible batches that suffers from the curse of dimensionality and adds complexity to the problem. This paper proposes a novel CP model that does not rely on this virtual set. Instead, it uses key alignment parameters that allow it to reason directly on the sequences of same-family jobs scheduled on the machines, resulting in a more compact formulation. This new model is further improved by exploiting the problem's structure with tailored search phases and strengthened inference levels of the constraint propagators. The extensive computational experiments on nearly five thousand instances compare the proposed models against existing methods in the literature, including mixed-integer programming formulations, tabu search meta-heuristics, and CP approaches. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed models on small-to-medium instances with up to 100 jobs, and their ability to find solutions up to 25\\% better than the ones produces by existing methods on large-scale instances with up to 500 jobs, 10 families, and 10 machines.", "AI": {"tldr": "A novel CP model for serial batch scheduling avoids complex virtual batches, outperforming existing methods by up to 25% on large instances.", "motivation": "Existing CP models for serial batch scheduling with minimum batch sizes rely on a predefined virtual set of batches, which introduces complexity and suffers from dimensionality issues.

We apply this framework to papers from the IJAIS special issue and recent AI-accounting research published in leading accounting journals to map existing studies and identify research opportunities. Using this same framework, we analyze how accounting researchers can leverage their expertise through strategic positioning and collaboration, revealing where accounting scholars' strengths create the most value. We further examine how GenAI and LLMs transform the research process itself, comparing the capabilities of human researchers and AI agents across the entire research workflow.

However, the latent capacity required to represent visual data primarily depends on content complexity, with scale serving only as an upper bound. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCS-LDM, a novel paradigm for visual generation that decouples information complexity from scale. DCS-LDM constructs a hierarchical, scale-independent latent space that models sample complexity through multi-level tokens and supports decoding to arbitrary resolutions and frame rates within a fixed latent representation.

Thus, most flow-based Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) methods first predict bidirectional flows at low resolution and then use high-magnification upsampling (e.g., bilinear) to obtain the high-resolution ones. However, this kind of upsampling strategy may cause blur or mosaic at the flows' edges. Additionally, the motion of fine pixels at high resolution cannot be adequately captured in motion estimation at low resolution, which leads to the misalignment of task-oriented flows. With such inaccurate flows, input frames are warped and combined pixel-by-pixel, resulting in ghosting and discontinuities in the interpolated frame. In this study, we propose a novel VFI pipeline, VTinker, which consists of two core components: guided flow upsampling (GFU) and Texture Mapping. After motion estimation at low resolution, GFU introduces input frames as guidance to alleviate the blurring details in bilinear upsampling flows, which makes flows' edges clearer. Subsequently, to avoid pixel-level ghosting and discontinuities, Texture Mapping generates an initial interpolated frame, referred to as the intermediate proxy. The proxy serves as a cue for selecting clear texture blocks from the input frames, which are then mapped onto the proxy to facilitate producing the final interpolated frame via a reconstruction module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VTinker achieves state-of-the-art performance in VFI.

Although extensive efforts have been devoted to detecting AI-generated images, out-of-distribution generalization remains a persistent challenge. We trace this weakness to spurious shortcuts exploited during training and we also observe that small feature-space perturbations can mitigate shortcut dominance. To address this problem in a more controllable manner, we propose the Positive-Incentive Noise for CLIP (PiN-CLIP), which jointly trains a noise generator and a detection network under a variational positive-incentive principle. Specifically, we construct positive-incentive noise in the feature space via cross-attention fusion of visual and categorical semantic features.

To address these gaps, we propose MR-RML (Multidimensional Rubric-oriented Reward Model Learning) via GPRC (Geometric Projection Reference Constraints), a novel alignment framework that integrates medical standards into a structured \"Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines\" matrix to guide data generation and model optimization. MR-RML introduces three core innovations: (1) a \"Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines\" medical standard system that embeds domain standards into the full training pipeline; (2) an independent multi-dimensional reward model that decomposes evaluation criteria, shifting from real-time rubric-based scoring to internalized reward modeling for improved consistency and cost-efficiency; (3) geometric projection reference constraints that transform medical cognitive logic into mathematical regularization, aligning scoring gradients with clinical reasoning and enabling synthetic data-driven training.

However, in real-world scenarios involving transcoding or transmission, QPs may be partially or entirely unknown, limiting the applicability of such approaches and motivating the development of blind QECV techniques. Current blind methods generate degradation vectors via classification models with cross-entropy loss, using them as channel attention to guide artifact removal. However, these vectors capture only global degradation information and lack spatial details, hindering adaptation to varying artifact patterns at different spatial positions. To address these limitations, we propose a pretrained Degradation Representation Learning (DRL) module that decouples and extracts high-dimensional, multiscale degradation representations from video content to guide the artifact removal. Additionally, both blind and non-blind methods typically employ uniform architectures across QPs, hence, overlooking the varying computational demands inherent to different compression levels. We thus introduce a hierarchical termination mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of artifact reduction stages based on the compression level. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances performance, achieving a PSNR improvement of 110% (from 0.31 dB to 0.65 dB) over a competing state-of-the-art blind method at QP = 22.

The annotation of structured sequences of events (who does what, when, and where) used for soccer analytics requires a holistic approach that integrates both STAD and MOT. However, current action recognition methods remain insufficient for constructing reliable play-by-play data and are typically used to assist rather than fully automate annotation. Parallel research has advanced tactical modeling, trajectory forecasting, and performance analysis, all grounded in game-state and play-by-play data. This motivates leveraging tactical knowledge as a prior to support computer-vision-based predictions, enabling more automated and reliable extraction of play-by-play data. We introduce Footovision Play-by-Play Action Spotting in Soccer Dataset (FOOTPASS), the first benchmark for play-by-play action spotting over entire soccer matches in a multi-modal, multi-agent tactical context.

We introduce a novel Spatial-prioritized and Rank-aware 3D object detection (SR3D) framework for indoor point clouds, to bridge the gap between how detectors are trained and how they are evaluated. This gap stems from the lack of spatial reliability and ranking awareness during training, which conflicts with the ranking-based prediction selection used as inference. Such a training-inference gap hampers the model's ability to learn representations aligned with inference-time behavior. To address the limitation, SR3D consists of two components tailored to the spatial nature of point clouds during training: a novel spatial-prioritized optimal transport assignment that dynamically emphasizes well-located and spatially reliable samples, and a rank-aware adaptive self-distillation scheme that adaptively injects ranking perception via a self-distillation paradigm.

Yet this rapid progress is largely performance-driven and opaque. Current LLM-based approaches rarely reveal why a generated algorithm works, which components matter or how design choices relate to underlying problem structures. This paper argues that the next breakthrough will come not from more automation, but from coupling automation with understanding from systematic benchmarking. We outline a vision for explainable automated algorithm design, built on three pillars: (i) LLM-driven discovery of algorithmic variants, (ii) explainable benchmarking that attributes performance to components and hyperparameters and (iii) problem-class descriptors that connect algorithm behaviour to landscape structure. Together, these elements form a closed knowledge loop in which discovery, explanation and generalisation reinforce each other. We argue that this integration will shift the field from blind search to interpretable, class-specific algorithm design, accelerating progress while producing reusable scientific insight into when and why optimisation strategies succeed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u95ee\u9898\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u5927\u652f\u67f1\u7684\u613f\u666f\uff1a(i) LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d8\u4f53\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c(ii) \u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c(iii) \u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u95ed\u73af\u77e5\u8bc6\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4ece\u76f2\u76ee\u641c\u7d22\u5230\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u7c7b\u7279\u5b9a\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3b\u5f20\u5c06\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63a8\u52a8\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7a81\u7834\u3002"}}

Recently, the scarcity of high spatial resolution datasets for WBCD restricts its application in urban and rural regions, which require more accurate positioning. Meanwhile, previous deep learning-based methods fail to comprehensively exploit the spatial semantic and structural information in deep features in the change detection networks. To resolve these concerns, we first propose a new dataset, HSRW-CD, with a spatial resolution higher than 3 meters for WBCD. Specifically, it contains a large number of image pairs, widely covering various water body types. Besides, a Spatial Semantics and Continuity Perception (SSCP) attention module is designed to fully leverage both the spatial semantics and structure of deep features in the WBCD networks, significantly improving the discrimination capability for water body. The proposed SSCP has three components: the Multi-Semantic spatial Attention (MSA), the Structural Relation-aware Global Attention (SRGA), and the Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA). The MSA enhances the spatial semantics of water body features and provides precise spatial semantic priors for the CSA. Then, the SRGA further extracts spatial structure to learn the spatial continuity of the water body. Finally, the CSA utilizes the spatial semantic and structural priors from the MSA and SRGA to compute the similarity across channels. Specifically designed as a plug-and-play module for water body deep features, the proposed SSCP allows integration into existing WBCD models.

Conventional reward models struggle to jointly optimize multiple, sometimes conflicting, preference dimensions (e.g., factuality, helpfulness, safety) and offer limited transparency into why a score is assigned. CRM addresses these issues by decomposing preference evaluation into domain-specific agents that each produce partial signals, alongside global evaluators such as ranker-based and embedding-similarity rewards. A centralized aggregator fuses these signals at each timestep, balancing factors like step-wise correctness, multi-agent agreement, and repetition penalties, yielding a single training reward compatible with standard RL pipelines.

ChemO features two key innovations for automated assessment: Assessment-Equivalent Reformulation (AER), which converts problems requiring visual outputs (e.g., drawing molecules) into computationally tractable formats, and Structured Visual Enhancement (SVE), a diagnostic mechanism to disentangle a model's visual perception capabilities from its core chemical reasoning. To tackle this benchmark, we propose ChemLabs, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that mimics human expert collaboration through specialized agents for problem decomposition, perception, reasoning, and auditing. Experiments on state-of-the-art multimodal models demonstrate that combining SVE with our multi-agent system yields dramatic performance gains.

While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can serve as strong embedding extractors, existing approaches treat embedding extraction as a direct encoding step, overlooking the fact that MLLMs possess the generative capability for reasoning that could be leveraged to enhance representation quality. In this work, we explore how to explicitly incorporate reasoning into the embedding process. To this end, we propose Reasoning Guided Embeddings (RGE), which preserves the generative rationale process of MLLMs and couples it with contrastive training. Our method first enables the model to perform structured rationale generation conditioned on the instruction, and then extracts representations after reasoning has unfolded. This simple design enhances the context-conditional inference signals within the embedding, leading to improved multimodal representation quality. Experiments on the MMEB benchmark show that reasoning-guided conditioning improves multimodal retrieval performance by 4.9% over the non-reasoning baseline, confirming that explicit reasoning can effectively enhance embedding quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "RGE\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u7ed3\u5408MLLMs\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5d4c\u5165\u63d0\u53d6\u89c6\u4e3a\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u7801\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86MLLMs\u7684\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800cRGE\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e00\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faReasoning Guided Embeddings (RGE)\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u518d\u63d0\u53d6\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728MMEB\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347\u4e864.9%\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\uff0cRGE\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose Pluggable Pruning with Contiguous Layer Distillation (PPCL), a flexible structured pruning framework specifically designed for DiT architectures. First, we identify redundant layer intervals through a linear probing mechanism combined with the first-order differential trend analysis of similarity metrics. Subsequently, we propose a plug-and-play teacher-student alternating distillation scheme tailored to integrate depth-wise and width-wise pruning within a single training phase. This distillation framework enables flexible knowledge transfer across diverse pruning ratios, eliminating the need for per-configuration retraining. Extensive experiments on multiple Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer architecture models demonstrate that PPCL achieves a 50\\% reduction in parameter count compared to the full model, with less than 3\\% degradation in key objective metrics. Notably, our method maintains high-quality image generation capabilities while achieving higher compression ratios, rendering it well-suited for resource-constrained environments.

We make threefold contributions. First, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis and uncover that item lifecycles in short-video platforms follow a compressed three-phase pattern, i.e., rapid growth, transient stability, and sharp decay, which significantly deviates from the classical four-stage model (introduction, growth, maturity, decline). Second, we introduce LHRL, a lifecycle-aware hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that dynamically harmonizes fairness and accuracy by leveraging phase-specific exposure dynamics. LHRL consists of two key components: (1) PhaseFormer, a lightweight encoder combining STL decomposition and attention mechanisms for robust phase detection; (2) a two-level HRL agent, where the high-level policy imposes phase-aware fairness constraints, and the low-level policy optimizes immediate user engagement. This decoupled optimization allows for effective reconciliation between long-term equity and short-term utility. Third, experiments on multiple real-world interactive recommendation datasets demonstrate that LHRL significantly improves both fairness and user engagement. Furthermore, the integration of lifecycle-aware rewards into existing RL-based models consistently yields performance gains, highlighting the generalizability and practical value of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u611f\u77e5\u7684LHRL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u534f\u8c03\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u516c\u5e73\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9879\u76ee\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u63a7\u5236\u70b9\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u5e73\u53f0\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0d\u7b26\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86LHRL\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bPhaseFormer\uff08\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff09\u548c\u4e24\u7ea7HRL\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u9ad8\u5c42\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4f4e\u5c42\u7b56\u7565\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eLHRL\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u73b0\u6709RL\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LHRL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u534f\u8c03\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Drawing inspiration from human perception mechanisms, existing studies attempt to construct a coherent spatial understanding via grid-based cognitive maps from multi-frame visual inputs. However, current grid-based map methods rely on discretized raster representations, which limit the model's ability in fine-grained spatial reasoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose Video2Layout, a framework for reconstructing metric-grounded spatial layouts from video. The framework employs continuous object boundary coordinates to quantify inter-object physical distances and object size. This empowers the model with quantitative spatial computation capabilities, effectively alleviating the inherent ambiguity when describing spatial relationships in natural language. Specifically, our method comprises two core stages. First, in supervised fine-tuning stage, we construct a high-quality dataset from the AI2THOR simulator, which enables the model to learn the mapping from visual inputs to precise boundary coordinates. Subsequently, a reinforcement fine-tuning stage further enhances the model's real-world generalization capabilities. To systematically evaluate the correlation between cognitive map accuracy and image quantity, as well as how the quantity of image inputs affects spatial reasoning accuracy, we introduce QVS-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark designed to analyze the relevant mechanisms. Evaluated on QVS-Bench and mainstream spatial reasoning benchmarks, our model, V2LO-7B achieves an average improvement of 4.92% over the model trained on grid maps, validating the superiority of our method.

A persistent challenge in this field is simultaneously preserving fine-grained details present in the input while ensuring the global structural integrity of the completed shape. While recent works leveraging local symmetry transformations via direct regression have significantly improved the preservation of geometric structure details, these methods suffer from two major limitations: (1) These regression-based methods are prone to overfitting which tend to memorize instant-specific transformations instead of learning a generalizable geometric prior. (2) Their reliance on point-wise transformation regression lead to high sensitivity to input noise, severely degrading their robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce Simba, a novel framework that reformulates point-wise transformation regression as a distribution learning problem.

The prototype explores how multiple organisations (represented here as a Clinic, Insurer, and Specialist Network) can cooperate securely via pseudonymised case tokens, local data lookups, and controlled operational boundaries.\n  The system uses Orpius as the underlying platform for multi-agent orchestration, tool execution, and privacy-preserving communication. All agents communicate through OperationRelay calls, exchanging concise natural-language summaries. Each agent operates on its own data (such as synthetic clinic records, insurance enrolment tables, and clinical guidance extracts), and none receives or reconstructs patient identity. The Clinic computes an HMAC-based pseudonymous token, the Insurer evaluates coverage rules and consults the Specialist agent, and the Specialist returns an appropriateness recommendation.\n  The goal of this prototype is intentionally limited: to demonstrate feasibility, not to provide a clinically validated, production-ready system. No clinician review was conducted, and no evaluation beyond basic functional runs was performed. The work highlights architectural patterns, privacy considerations, and communication flows that enable distributed reasoning among specialised agents while keeping data local to each organisation. We conclude by outlining opportunities for more rigorous evaluation and future research in decentralised multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4ee3\u7406\u95f4\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4f2a\u533f\u540d\u4ee4\u724c\u548c\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u4e2a\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff08\u5982\u8bca\u6240\u3001\u4fdd\u9669\u516c\u53f8\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4f2a\u533f\u540d\u6848\u4f8b\u4ee4\u724c\u3001\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\u67e5\u627e\u548c\u53d7\u63a7\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fb9\u754c\u5b89\u5168\u5408\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f7f\u7528Orpius\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7f16\u6392\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u6267\u884c\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u5e73\u53f0\u3002\u4ee3\u7406\u901a\u8fc7OperationRelay\u8c03\u7528\u4ea4\u6362\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u5404\u81ea\u64cd\u4f5c\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u5408\u6210\u8bca\u6240\u8bb0\u5f55\u3001\u4fdd\u9669\u6ce8\u518c\u8868\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6307\u5357\u6458\u5f55\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u63a5\u6536\u6216\u91cd\u5efa\u60a3\u8005\u8eab\u4efd\u3002\u8bca\u6240\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\u4e8eHMAC\u7684\u4f2a\u533f\u540d\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u4fdd\u9669\u516c\u53f8\u8bc4\u4f30\u8986\u76d6\u89c4\u5219\u5e76\u54a8\u8be2\u4e13\u5bb6\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8fd4\u56de\u9002\u5f53\u6027\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u539f\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4ee3\u7406\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u67b6\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u8003\u8651\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u4e13\u4e1a\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u636e\u672c\u5730\u5316\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4ee3\u7406\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u5728\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\u3002"}}

However, despite notable progress in visual reasoning, the lack of transparent and reproducible data curation and training strategies remains a major barrier to scalable research. In this work, we introduce OpenMMReasoner, a fully transparent two-stage recipe for multimodal reasoning spanning supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we construct an 874K-sample cold-start dataset with rigorous step-by-step validation, providing a strong foundation for reasoning capabilities. The subsequent RL stage leverages a 74K-sample dataset across diverse domains to further sharpen and stabilize these abilities, resulting in a more robust and efficient learning process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our training recipe not only surpasses strong baselines but also highlights the critical role of data quality and training design in shaping multimodal reasoning performance. Notably, our method achieves a 11.6% improvement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct baseline across nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks, establishing a solid empirical foundation for future large-scale multimodal reasoning research.

In particular, the number of tokens consumed during the generation process has emerged as a key evaluation metric.Prior studies have shown that specific inputs can induce VLMs to generate lengthy outputs with low information density, which significantly increases energy consumption, latency, and token costs. However, existing methods simply delay the occurrence of the EOS token to implicitly prolong output, and fail to directly maximize the output token length as an explicit optimization objective, lacking stability and controllability.To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel verbose-text induction attack (VTIA) to inject imperceptible adversarial perturbations into benign images via a two-stage framework, which identifies the most malicious prompt embeddings for optimizing and maximizing the output token of the perturbed images.Specifically, we first perform adversarial prompt search, employing reinforcement learning strategies to automatically identify adversarial prompts capable of inducing the LLM component within VLMs to produce verbose outputs. We then conduct vision-aligned perturbation optimization to craft adversarial examples on input images, maximizing the similarity between the perturbed image's visual embeddings and those of the adversarial prompt, thereby constructing malicious images that trigger verbose text generation. Comprehensive experiments on four popular VLMs demonstrate that our method achieves significant advantages in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faVTIA\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u9f50\u6270\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316VLM\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee4\u724c\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u5176\u90e8\u7f72\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u7a81\u51fa\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5ef6\u8fdfEOS\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u4ee5\u9690\u5f0f\u5ef6\u957f\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u76f4\u63a5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee4\u724c\u957f\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u8bf1\u5bfcVLM\u4e2dLLM\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4ea7\u751f\u5197\u957f\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\uff1b2) \u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u9f50\u6270\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u5236\u4f5c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6270\u52a8\u56fe\u50cf\u89c6\u89c9\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6784\u5efa\u89e6\u53d1\u5197\u957f\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6076\u610f\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u79cd\u6d41\u884c\u7684VLM\u4e0a\u7684\u5168\u9762\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5197\u957f\u6587\u672c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u653b\u51fb\uff08VTIA\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u4e0d\u6613\u5bdf\u89c9\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u6ce8\u5165\u826f\u6027\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6270\u52a8\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee4\u724c\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56db\u79cd\u6d41\u884c\u7684VLM\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Current VLA models suffer from stage hallucination, where agents exploit coarse evaluation signals to shortcut multi-step tasks, reporting high progress without truly completing them. We present EvoVLA, a self-supervised VLA framework that addresses this issue through three complementary components: Stage-Aligned Reward (SAR), which uses triplet contrastive learning with Gemini-generated hard negatives to prevent visual shortcuts; Pose-Based Object Exploration (POE), which grounds curiosity in relative object-gripper pose instead of raw pixels; and Long-Horizon Memory, which uses selective context retention and gated fusion to stabilize intrinsic shaping during extended rollouts. Extensive evaluations on Discoverse-L, a long-horizon manipulation benchmark with three multi-stage tasks, show that EvoVLA improves average task success by 10.2 percentage points over the strongest baseline (OpenVLA-OFT), reaching 69.2 percent. EvoVLA also achieves one-and-a-half times better sample efficiency and reduces stage hallucination from 38.5 percent to 14.8 percent. Real-world deployment on physical robots reaches an average success rate of 54.6 percent across four manipulation tasks, outperforming OpenVLA-OFT by 11 points, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer and strong generalization.

A key challenge is enhancing the multimodal dense prediction capability, specifically this pixel-level multimodal alignment. Although existing methods achieve promising results by leveraging CLIP's vision-language alignment, they rarely investigate the performance boundaries of CLIP for dense prediction from an interpretability mechanisms perspective. In this work, we systematically investigate CLIP's internal mechanisms and identify a critical phenomenon: analogous to human distraction, CLIP diverts significant attention resources from target regions to irrelevant tokens. Our analysis reveals that these tokens arise from dimension-specific over-activation; filtering them enhances CLIP's dense prediction performance. Consequently, we propose ReFocusing CLIP (RF-CLIP), a training-free approach that emulates human distraction-refocusing behavior to redirect attention from distraction tokens back to target regions, thereby refining CLIP's multimodal alignment granularity.

However, letting VLA directly predict high-dimensional visual states can distribute model capacity and incur prohibitive training cost, while compressing visual states into more compact supervisory signals inevitably incurs information bottlenecks. Moreover, existing methods often suffer from poor comprehension and reasoning capabilities due to the neglect of language supervision. This paper introduces Mantis, a novel framework featuring a Disentangled Visual Foresight (DVF) to tackle these issues. Specifically, Mantis decouples visual foresight prediction from the backbone with the combination of meta queries and a diffusion Transformer (DiT) head. With the current visual state provided to the DiT via a residual connection, a simple next-state prediction objective enables the meta queries to automatically capture the latent actions that delineate the visual trajectory, and hence boost the learning of explicit actions. The disentanglement reduces the burden of the VLA backbone, enabling it to maintain comprehension and reasoning capabilities through language supervision. Empirically, pretrained on human manipulation videos, robot demonstrations, and image-text pairs, Mantis achieves a 96.7% success rate on LIBERO benchmark after fine-tuning, surpassing powerful baselines while exhibiting high convergence speed. Real-world evaluations show that Mantis outperforms $\u03c0_{0.5}$, a leading open-source VLA model, particularly in instruction-following capability, generalization to unseen instructions, and reasoning ability.

Then, we design a novel two-stage model, i.e., Domain-Shared Learning and Gradual Alignment (DSLGA), to handle these discrepancies. In the first pre-training stage, DSLGA introduces a Domain-Shared Learning Strategy (DSLS) to mitigate ineffective pre-training caused by inter-domain modality discrepancies via exploiting shared information between the source and target domains. While, in the second fine-tuning stage, DSLGA designs a Gradual Alignment Strategy (GAS) to handle the cross-modality alignment challenges between visible and infrared data caused by the large intra-domain modality discrepancies through a cluster-to-holistic alignment way. Finally, a new UDA-VI-ReID testing method i.e., CMDA-XD, is constructed for training and testing different UDA-VI-ReID models.

However, as the core medium for assessing corpo- rate ESG performance, the ESG reports present significant challenges for large-scale understanding, due to chaotic read- ing order from slide-like irregular layouts and implicit hier- archies arising from lengthy, weakly structured content. To address these challenges, we propose Pharos-ESG, a uni- fied framework that transforms ESG reports into structured representations through multimodal parsing, contextual nar- ration, and hierarchical labeling. It integrates a reading-order modeling module based on layout flow, hierarchy-aware seg- mentation guided by table-of-contents anchors, and a multi- modal aggregation pipeline that contextually transforms vi- sual elements into coherent natural language.

Existing adaptation algorithms are typically trained iteratively, which incur significant communication costs and increase the susceptibility to potential attacks. Motivated by the one-shot federated training techniques that reduce client-server exchanges to a single round, developing a lightweight one-shot federated VLM adaptation method to alleviate these issues is particularly attractive. However, current one-shot approaches face certain challenges in adapting VLMs within federated settings: (1) insufficient exploitation of the rich multimodal information inherent in VLMs; (2) lack of specialized adaptation strategies to systematically handle the severe data heterogeneity; and (3) requiring additional training resource of clients or server. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Training-free One-shot Federated Adaptation framework for VLMs, named TOFA. To fully leverage the generalizable multimodal features in pre-trained VLMs, TOFA employs both visual and textual pipelines to extract task-relevant representations. In the visual pipeline, a hierarchical Bayesian model learns personalized, class-specific prototype distributions. For the textual pipeline, TOFA evaluates and globally aligns the generated local text prompts for robustness. An adaptive weight calibration mechanism is also introduced to combine predictions from both modalities, balancing personalization and robustness to handle data heterogeneity. Our method is training-free, not relying on additional training resources on either the client or server side. Extensive experiments across 9 datasets in various federated settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TOFA method.", "AI": {"tldr": "TOFA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u8054\u90a6VLM\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7ba1\u9053\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u8f7b\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684VLM\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u800c\u5f53\u524d\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u5229\u7528\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u5904\u7406\u548c\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "TOFA\u91c7\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u7ba1\u9053\uff08\u5206\u5c42\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7c7b\u522b\u539f\u578b\u5206\u5e03\uff09\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7ba1\u9053\uff08\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u5168\u5c40\u5bf9\u9f50\u672c\u5730\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6743\u91cd\u6821\u51c6\u673a\u5236\u5e73\u8861\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u57289\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86TOFA\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TOFA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7ba1\u9053\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VLM\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Early methods integrated representation learning and clustering within an iterative framework.

In this work, we build upon a recent multi-head clustering approach by introducing adaptive nearest neighbor selection and cluster ensembling strategies to improve clustering performance. Our method, \"Image Clustering through Cluster Ensembles\" (ICCE), begins with a clustering stage, where we train multiple clustering heads on a frozen backbone, producing diverse image clusterings. We then employ a cluster ensembling technique to consolidate these potentially conflicting results into a unified consensus clustering. Finally, we train an image classifier using the consensus clustering result as pseudo-labels. ICCE achieves state-of-the-art performance on ten image classification benchmarks, achieving 99.3% accuracy on CIFAR10, 89% on CIFAR100, and 70.4% on ImageNet datasets, narrowing the performance gap with supervised methods.

While caregivers may notice these changes informally, most computational tools are not designed to track such behavioral drift over time. This paper introduces PersonaDrift, a synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate machine learning and statistical methods for detecting progressive changes in daily communication, focusing on user responses to a digital reminder system. PersonaDrift simulates 60-day interaction logs for synthetic users modeled after real PLwD, based on interviews with caregivers. These caregiver-informed personas vary in tone, modality, and communication habits, enabling realistic diversity in behavior. The benchmark focuses on two forms of longitudinal change that caregivers highlighted as particularly salient: flattened sentiment (reduced emotional tone and verbosity) and off-topic replies (semantic drift). These changes are injected progressively at different rates to emulate naturalistic cognitive trajectories, and the framework is designed to be extensible to additional behaviors in future use cases. To explore this novel application space, we evaluate several anomaly detection approaches, unsupervised statistical methods (CUSUM, EWMA, One-Class SVM), sequence models using contextual embeddings (GRU + BERT), and supervised classifiers in both generalized and personalized settings. Preliminary results show that flattened sentiment can often be detected with simple statistical models in users with low baseline variability, while detecting semantic drift requires temporal modeling and personalized baselines.

Clinical notes, as unstructured documents rich with detailed patient observations, offer valuable context-specific insights and represent a promising yet underutilized source for ontology extension. Despite this potential, directly leveraging clinical notes for ontology extension remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose CLOZE, a novel framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract medical entities from clinical notes and integrate them into hierarchical medical ontologies. By capitalizing on the strong language understanding and extensive biomedical knowledge of pre-trained LLMs, CLOZE effectively identifies disease-related concepts and captures complex hierarchical relationships.

Existing methods typically connect parallel RGB and NIR branches to a shared backbone, which limits the comprehensive extraction of distinctive modality-specific features and fails to address the issue of object drift, especially in the presence of unreliable inputs. In this paper, we propose SwiTrack, a novel state-switching framework that redefines CMOT through the deployment of three specialized streams. Specifically, RGB frames are processed by the visual encoder, while NIR frames undergo refinement via a NIR gated adapter coupled with the visual encoder to progressively calibrate shared latent space features, thereby yielding more robust cross-modal representations. For invalid modalities, a consistency trajectory prediction module leverages spatio-temporal cues to estimate target movement, ensuring robust tracking and mitigating drift. Additionally, we incorporate dynamic template reconstruction to iteratively update template features and employ a similarity alignment loss to reinforce feature consistency. Experimental results on the latest benchmarks demonstrate that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance, boosting precision rate and success rate gains by 7.2\\% and 4.3\\%, respectively, while maintaining real-time tracking at 65 frames per second.

Such models are able to explain each decision by pointing to the prototypes that contributed the most to the final outcome. As the explanation is a core part of the prediction, they are often qualified as ``interpretable by design\". While promising, we show that such explanations are sometimes misleading, which hampers their usefulness in safety-critical contexts. In particular, several instances may lead to different predictions and yet have the same explanation. Drawing inspiration from the field of formal eXplainable AI (FXAI), we propose Abductive Latent Explanations (ALEs), a formalism to express sufficient conditions on the intermediate (latent) representation of the instance that imply the prediction. Our approach combines the inherent interpretability of case-based reasoning models and the guarantees provided by formal XAI. We propose a solver-free and scalable algorithm for generating ALEs based on three distinct paradigms, compare them, and present the feasibility of our approach on diverse datasets for both standard and fine-grained image classification.

While most existing datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating GUI agents are static and idealized, failing to reflect the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, particularly the presence of anomalies. To bridge this research gap, we propose D-GARA, a dynamic benchmarking framework, to evaluate Android GUI agent robustness in real-world anomalies. D-GARA introduces a diverse set of real-world anomalies that GUI agents commonly face in practice, including interruptions such as permission dialogs, battery warnings, and update prompts. Based on D-GARA framework, we construct and annotate a benchmark featuring commonly used Android applications with embedded anomalies to support broader community research. Comprehensive experiments and results demonstrate substantial performance degradation in state-of-the-art GUI agents when exposed to anomaly-rich environments, highlighting the need for robustness-aware learning.

However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: adapting MLLMs to output a single score misaligns with the generative nature of MLLMs and limits fine-grained requirement understanding, whereas autoregressively generating judging analyses is prohibitively slow in high-throughput settings. Observing that judgment reduces to verifying whether inputs satisfy a set of structured requirements, we propose YOFO, a template-conditioned method that judges all requirements in a single forward pass. Built on an autoregressive model, YOFO accepts a structured requirement template and, in one inference step, produces a binary yes/no decision for each requirement by reading the logits of the final token associated with that requirement. This design yields orders-of-magnitude speedups while preserving interpretability.

To address these limitations, we introduce Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization (DPPO), a metacognitive ``Metaloop'' training framework that dynamically alternates between supervised fine-tuning (competence expansion) and reinforcement learning (skill refinement). This enables automatic weakness identification and targeted resource allocation, specifically designed to maximize learning efficiency from sparse, finite data. Theoretically, DPPO can be formalised as a unified preference-learning framework. Empirically, training a vision-language embodied model with DPPO, referred to as Pelican-VL 1.0, yields a 20.3% performance improvement over the base model and surpasses open-source models at the 100B-parameter scale by 10.6%.

Although transformers show strong potential for clinical decision support, they remain prone to overconfidence, especially in ambiguous medical cases where calibrated uncertainty is critical. MedBayes-Lite embeds uncertainty quantification directly into existing transformer pipelines without any retraining or architectural rewiring, adding no new trainable layers and keeping parameter overhead under 3 percent. The framework integrates three components: (i) Bayesian Embedding Calibration using Monte Carlo dropout for epistemic uncertainty, (ii) Uncertainty-Weighted Attention that marginalizes over token reliability, and (iii) Confidence-Guided Decision Shaping inspired by clinical risk minimization. Across biomedical QA and clinical prediction benchmarks (MedQA, PubMedQA, MIMIC-III), MedBayes-Lite consistently improves calibration and trustworthiness, reducing overconfidence by 32 to 48 percent. In simulated clinical settings, it can prevent up to 41 percent of diagnostic errors by flagging uncertain predictions for human review.

Upsample Anything addresses these issues through a simple per-image optimization that learns an anisotropic Gaussian kernel combining spatial and range cues, effectively bridging Gaussian Splatting and Joint Bilateral Upsampling. The learned kernel acts as a universal, edge-aware operator that transfers seamlessly across architectures and modalities, enabling precise high-resolution reconstruction of features, depth, or probability maps.

We propose a fine-grained cognitive evaluation framework and conduct the first large-scale analysis of 170K traces from 17 models across text, vision, and audio modalities, alongside 54 human think-aloud traces, which we make publicly available. Our analysis reveals systematic structural differences: humans employ hierarchical nesting and meta-cognitive monitoring while models rely on shallow forward chaining, with divergence most pronounced on ill-structured problems. Meta-analysis of 1,598 LLM reasoning papers reveals the research community concentrates on easily quantifiable behaviors (sequential organization: 55%, decomposition: 60%) while neglecting meta-cognitive controls (self-awareness: 16%, evaluation: 8%) that correlate with success. Models possess behavioral repertoires associated with success but fail to deploy them spontaneously. Leveraging these patterns, we develop test-time reasoning guidance that automatically scaffold successful structures, improving performance by up to 60% on complex problems.

In contrast to previous approaches that rely on baking 2D multi-view images synthesized by geometry-conditioned Multi-View Diffusion models (MVDs), NaTex avoids several inherent limitations of the MVD pipeline. These include difficulties in handling occluded regions that require inpainting, achieving precise mesh-texture alignment along boundaries, and maintaining cross-view consistency and coherence in both content and color intensity. NaTex features a novel paradigm that addresses the aforementioned issues by viewing texture as a dense color point cloud. Driven by this idea, we propose latent color diffusion, which comprises a geometry-awared color point cloud VAE and a multi-control diffusion transformer (DiT), entirely trained from scratch using 3D data, for texture reconstruction and generation. To enable precise alignment, we introduce native geometry control that conditions the DiT on direct 3D spatial information via positional embeddings and geometry latents.

Recent hybrid approaches, which couple domain priors with modern deep neural architectures, have achieved strong performance but incur high computational cost, limiting their practicality in real-time scenarios. In this work, we propose WWE-UIE, a compact and efficient enhancement network that integrates three interpretable priors. First, adaptive white balance alleviates the strong wavelength-dependent color attenuation, particularly the dominance of blue-green tones. Second, a wavelet-based enhancement block (WEB) performs multi-band decomposition, enabling the network to capture both global structures and fine textures, which are critical for underwater restoration. Third, a gradient-aware module (SGFB) leverages Sobel operators with learnable gating to explicitly preserve edge structures degraded by scattering. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that WWE-UIE achieves competitive restoration quality with substantially fewer parameters and FLOPs, enabling real-time inference on resource-limited platforms.

Besides grappling with the complexity of data annotation and ensuring temporal consistency, it also confronts the scarcity of relevant data and the limitations imposed by the effective range of many technologies. This research substantiates that, in aerial positioning tasks, both the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and temporal consistency (TC) metrics are of paramount importance. It is demonstrated that fully labeled data is not the optimal choice, as selecting only key data lacks the enhancement in TC, leading to failures. Hence, a teacher-student architecture, coupled with key frame selection and key frame updating algorithms, is proposed. This framework successfully performs weakly supervised learning and TC knowledge distillation, overcoming the deficiencies of traditional TC training in aerial tasks. The experimental results reveal that our method utilizing merely 30\\% of labeled data, concurrently elevates mIoU and temporal consistency ensuring stable localization of terrain objects.

Existing visual methods often suffer from drift, scale ambiguity, and depend on fiducials or loop closure. This work introduces a real-time method for localizing a camera within a pre-captured, highly accurate colored LiDAR point cloud. By rendering synthetic views from this cloud, 2D-3D correspondences are established between live frames and the point cloud.

However, in real-world scenarios, the acquisition of strictly aligned RGB-D is hindered by inherent hardware limitations (e.g., physically separate RGB-D sensors) and unavoidable calibration drift induced by mechanical vibrations or temperature variations. Consequently, existing approaches often suffer inevitable performance degradation when applied to misaligned real-world scenes. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Order Matching Network (MOMNet), a novel alignment-free framework that adaptively retrieves and selects the most relevant information from misaligned RGB. Specifically, our method begins with a multi-order matching mechanism, which jointly performs zero-order, first-order, and second-order matching to comprehensively identify RGB information consistent with depth across multi-order feature spaces. To effectively integrate the retrieved RGB and depth, we further introduce a multi-order aggregation composed of multiple structure detectors. This strategy uses multi-order priors as prompts to facilitate the selective feature transfer from RGB to depth.

To address this, we introduce a novel fundamental unit for MoCap, the Rigid Body Marker (RBM), which provides unambiguous 6-DoF data and drastically simplifies setup. Leveraging this new data modality, we develop a deep-learning-based regression model that directly estimates SMPL parameters under a geodesic loss. This end-to-end approach matches the performance of optimization-based methods while requiring over an order of magnitude less computation.

Yet, most existing methods suffer from depth estimates that are inconsistent between overlapping images. Addressing this limitation, we propose a novel geometry-guided method for calibrated, time-synchronized multi-camera rigs that predicts dense, metric, and cross-view-consistent depth. Given the intrinsic and relative orientation parameters, a first depth map is predicted per image and the so-derived 3D points from all images are projected onto a shared unit cylinder, establishing neighborhood relations across different images. This produces a 2D position map for every image, where each pixel is assigned its projected position on the cylinder. Based on these position maps, we apply an explicit, non-learned spatial attention that aggregates features among pixels across images according to their distances on the cylinder, to predict a final depth map per image.

Deep learning models often struggle with occlusions, long-range dependencies, and capturing the fine-scale geometry of rare structures. This work addresses these challenges by introducing graph-based segmentation approaches that enhance spatial and semantic understanding in surgical scene analyses.\n  Methods: We propose two segmentation models integrating Vision Transformer (ViT) feature encoders with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to explicitly model spatial relationships between anatomical regions. (1) A static k Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) graph with a Graph Convolutional Network with Initial Residual and Identity Mapping (GCNII) enables stable long-range information propagation. (2) A dynamic Differentiable Graph Generator (DGG) with a Graph Attention Network (GAT) supports adaptive topology learning. Both models are evaluated on the Endoscapes-Seg50 and CholecSeg8k benchmarks.\n  Results: The proposed approaches achieve up to 7-8% improvement in Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and 6% improvement in Mean Dice (mDice) scores over state-of-the-art baselines. It produces anatomically coherent predictions, particularly on thin, rare and safety-critical structures.\n  Conclusion: The proposed graph-based segmentation methods enhance both performance and anatomical consistency in surgical scene segmentation.

Neves"], "title": "StreetView-Waste: A Multi-Task Dataset for Urban Waste Management", "comment": "Accepted at WACV 2026", "summary": "Urban waste management remains a critical challenge for the development of smart cities. Despite the growing number of litter detection datasets, the problem of monitoring overflowing waste containers, particularly from images captured by garbage trucks, has received little attention. While existing datasets are valuable, they often lack annotations for specific container tracking or are captured in static, decontextualized environments, limiting their utility for real-world logistics. To address this gap, we present StreetView-Waste, a comprehensive dataset of urban scenes featuring litter and waste containers. The dataset supports three key evaluation tasks: (1) waste container detection, (2) waste container tracking, and (3) waste overflow segmentation. Alongside the dataset, we provide baselines for each task by benchmarking state-of-the-art models in object detection, tracking, and segmentation. Additionally, we enhance baseline performance by proposing two complementary strategies: a heuristic-based method for improved waste container tracking and a model-agnostic framework that leverages geometric priors to refine litter segmentation. Our experimental results show that while fine-tuned object detectors achieve reasonable performance in detecting waste containers, baseline tracking methods struggle to accurately estimate their number; however, our proposed heuristics reduce the mean absolute counting error by 79.6%. Similarly, while segmenting amorphous litter is challenging, our geometry-aware strategy improves segmentation mAP@0.5 by 27% on lightweight models, demonstrating the value of multimodal inputs for this task.

Token pruning (keeping salient visual tokens and dropping redundant ones) has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), offering a solution for efficient VLA. However, these VLM-specific token pruning methods select tokens based solely on semantic salience metrics (e.g., prefill attention), while overlooking the VLA's intrinsic dual-system nature of high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution. Consequently, these methods bias token retention toward semantic cues, discard critical information for action generation, and significantly degrade VLA performance. To bridge this gap, we propose VLA-Pruner, a versatile plug-and-play VLA-specific token prune method that aligns with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploits the temporal continuity in robot manipulation. Specifically, VLA-Pruner adopts a dual-level importance criterion for visual token retention: vision-language prefill attention for semantic-level relevance and action decode attention, estimated via temporal smoothing, for action-level importance. Based on this criterion, VLA-Pruner proposes a novel dual-level token selection strategy that adaptively preserves a compact, informative set of visual tokens for both semantic understanding and action execution under given compute budget.

Although general video prediction models have achieved remarkable performance in standard scenarios, occlusion is still an inherent challenge in video prediction. We hypothesize that providing explicit information about motion (via point-flow) and geometric structure (via depth-maps) will enable video prediction models to perform better in situations with occlusion and the background motion. To investigate this, we present the first systematic study dedicated to occluded video prediction. We use a standard multi-object latent transformer architecture to predict future frames, but modify this to incorporate information from depth and point-flow. We evaluate this model in a controlled setting on both synthetic and real-world datasets with not only appearance-based metrics but also Wasserstein distances on object masks, which can effectively measure the motion distribution of the prediction.

However, registering CMCs to the target scene layout presents a challenging task. While manual registration with specialized tools is inefficient and costly, automatic registration with visual localization may yield poor results when visual ambiguity exists. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel solution for jointly mapping an indoor scene and registering CMCs to the scene layout. Our approach involves equipping a mobile agent with a head-mounted RGB-D camera to traverse the entire scene once and synchronize CMCs to capture this mobile agent. The egocentric videos generate world-coordinate agent trajectories and the scene layout, while the videos of CMCs provide pseudo-scale agent trajectories and CMC relative poses. By correlating all the trajectories with their corresponding timestamps, the CMC relative poses can be aligned to the world-coordinate scene layout. Based on this initialization, a factor graph is customized to enable the joint optimization of ego-camera poses, scene layout, and CMC poses.

Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) trains two neural networks in contrastive manner to align their image and text embeddings in a shared latent space. Recent results evaluating CLIP on negated or paraphrased text have shown mixed performance because negation changes meaning radically with minimal lexical changes, while paraphrasing can create very different textual expressions with the same intended meaning. This poses a significant challenge for improving the evaluation results and alignment of vision-language models. To address this challenge, this paper evaluates the combination of paraphrasing and negation, proposes a new CLIP contrastive loss function accounting for both paraphrasing and negation, and applies LLM-generated training triples consisting of original, paraphrased and negated textual captions to CLIP-like training models. The approach, called SemCLIP, is shown to move paraphrased captions towards the original image embeddings while pushing negated captions further away in embedding space. Empirically, SemCLIP is shown to be capable of preserving CLIP's performance while increasing considerably the distances to negated captions. On the CC-Neg benchmark using an original over negation image-retrieval accuracy metric, SemCLIP improves accuracy from 68.1% to 78.1%. Although results are mixed when compared with CLIP on the Sugarcrepe++ benchmark, SemCLIP's performance is generally better than the models trained with negated captions. This robustness to negation extends to downstream zero-shot classification tasks where SemCLIP pre-trained on Sugarcrepe++ performs better than CLIP on all tested downstream tasks. These results indicate that SemCLIP can achieve significant robustness to semantic transformations.", "AI": {"tldr": "SemCLIP enhances CLIP by addressing negation and paraphrasing challenges, improving accuracy and robustness in vision-language tasks.", "motivation": "Address the challenge of mixed performance in CLIP when evaluating negated or paraphrased text, aiming to improve evaluation results and alignment.", "method": "Proposes a new CLIP contrastive loss function and uses LLM-generated training triples (original, paraphrased, negated captions) to enhance alignment.", "result": "SemCLIP improves accuracy from 68.1% to 78.1% on CC-Neg benchmark and shows better performance on downstream zero-shot classification tasks compared to CLIP.", "conclusion": "SemCLIP demonstrates significant robustness to semantic transformations, improving performance on negated and paraphrased text while maintaining CLIP's original capabilities."}}

Processing long videos demands both an efficient model architecture and an effective mechanism for handling extended temporal contexts. To this end, TimeViper adopts a hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone that combines the efficiency of state-space models with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Through this hybrid design, we reveal the vision-to-text information aggregation phenomenon, where information progressively flows from vision tokens to text tokens across increasing LLM depth, resulting in severe vision token redundancy. Motivated by this observation, we propose TransV, a token information transfer module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens while maintaining multimodal understanding capabilities. This design enables TimeViper to process hour-long videos exceeding 10,000 frames.

Despite considerable progress in multi-camera tracking algorithms, tracking gymnasts presents unique challenges: (i) due to space restrictions, only a limited number of cameras can be installed in the gymnastics stadium; and (ii) due to variations in lighting, background, uniforms, and occlusions, multi-camera gymnast detection may fail in certain views and only provide valid detections from two opposing views. These factors complicate the accurate determination of a gymnast's 3D trajectory using conventional multi-camera triangulation. To alleviate this issue, we incorporate gymnastics domain knowledge into our tracking solution. Given that a gymnast's 3D center typically lies within a predefined vertical plane during \\revised{much of their} performance, we can apply a ray-plane intersection to generate coplanar 3D trajectory candidates for opposing-view detections. More specifically, we propose a novel cascaded data association (DA) paradigm that employs triangulation to generate 3D trajectory candidates when cross-view detections are sufficient, and resort to the ray-plane intersection when they are insufficient. Consequently, coplanar candidates are used to compensate for uncertain trajectories, thereby minimizing tracking failures. The robustness of our method is validated through extensive experimentation, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in challenging scenarios. Furthermore, our gymnastics judging system, equipped with this tracking method, has been successfully applied to recent Gymnastics World Championships, earning significant recognition from the International Gymnastics Federation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4f53\u64cd\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u591a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea7\u8054\u6570\u636e\u5173\u8054\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u5347\u8ddf\u8e2a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5df2\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u56fd\u9645\u8d5b\u4e8b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f53\u64cd\u8fd0\u52a8\u5458\u8ddf\u8e2a\u9762\u4e34\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5982\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u6570\u91cf\u6709\u9650\u3001\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u590d\u6742\u3001\u906e\u6321\u7b49\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u4e09\u89d2\u6d4b\u91cf\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u786e\u5b9a3D\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u7ea7\u8054\u6570\u636e\u5173\u8054\uff08DA\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e09\u89d2\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u5c04\u7ebf-\u5e73\u9762\u76f8\u4ea4\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u751f\u62103D\u8f68\u8ff9\u5019\u9009\u3002\u5f53\u4ea4\u53c9\u89c6\u89d2\u68c0\u6d4b\u8db3\u591f\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u89d2\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u4e0d\u8db3\u65f6\u5219\u91c7\u7528\u5c04\u7ebf-\u5e73\u9762\u76f8\u4ea4\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5df2\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4f53\u64cd\u4e16\u754c\u9526\u6807\u8d5b\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u56fd\u9645\u4f53\u64cd\u8054\u5408\u4f1a\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8ba4\u53ef\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4f53\u64cd\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u591a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u4f53\u64cd\u8fd0\u52a8\u5458\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea7\u8054\u6570\u636e\u5173\u8054\u8303\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u4e09\u89d2\u6d4b\u91cf\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

However, real-world scenarios introduce the challenge of long-tailed distributions, where numerous categories contain only a few instances. This inherent class imbalance biases detection models towards the more frequent classes, degrading performance on rare categories. In this paper, we tackle the problem of long-tailed 2D object detection using the LVISv1 dataset, which consists of 1,203 categories and 164,000 images. We employ a two-stage Faster R-CNN architecture and propose enhancements to the Balanced Group Softmax (BAGS) framework to mitigate class imbalance. Our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 24.5%, surpassing the previous benchmark of 24.0%.\n  Additionally, we hypothesize that tail class features may form smaller, denser clusters within the feature space of head classes, making classification challenging for regression-based classifiers.

To address this challenge, we introduce a novel teacher-guided pruning framework that tightly integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) with importance score estimation. Unlike prior approaches that apply KD as a post-pruning recovery step, our method leverages gradient signals informed by the teacher during importance score calculation to identify and retain parameters most critical for both task performance and knowledge transfer. Our method facilitates a one-shot global pruning strategy that efficiently eliminates redundant weights while preserving essential representations.

However, progressive multi-scale generation incurs substantial memory overhead due to cumulative KV caching, limiting practical deployment.\n  We observe a scale-depth asymmetric dependency in VAR: early scales exhibit extreme sensitivity to network depth, while later scales remain robust to depth reduction. Inspired by this, we propose VARiant: by equidistant sampling, we select multiple subnets ranging from 16 to 2 layers from the original 30-layer VAR-d30 network. Early scales are processed by the full network, while later scales utilize subnet. Subnet and the full network share weights, enabling flexible depth adjustment within a single model.\n  However, weight sharing between subnet and the entire network can lead to optimization conflicts. To address this, we propose a progressive training strategy that breaks through the Pareto frontier of generation quality for both subnets and the full network under fixed-ratio training, achieving joint optimality.\n  Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that, compared to the pretrained VAR-d30 (FID 1.95), VARiant-d16 and VARiant-d8 achieve nearly equivalent quality (FID 2.05/2.12) while reducing memory consumption by 40-65%. VARiant-d2 achieves 3.5 times speedup and 80% memory reduction at moderate quality cost (FID 2.97).

They incorporate textual reasoning, i.e., think, either before (as pre-planning) or after (as post-refinement) the generation process, yet they lack on-the-fly multimodal interaction during the generation itself. In this preliminary study, we introduce Thinking-while-Generating (TwiG), the first interleaved framework that enables co-evolving textual reasoning throughout the visual generation process. As visual content is progressively generating, textual reasoning is interleaved to both guide upcoming local regions and reflect on previously synthesized ones. This dynamic interplay produces more context-aware and semantically rich visual outputs. To unveil the potential of this framework, we investigate three candidate strategies, zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our curated TwiG-50K dataset, and reinforcement learning (RL) via a customized TwiG-GRPO strategy, each offering unique insights into the dynamics of interleaved reasoning.

Project page: https://linear-gradient-matching.github.io/ Code: https://github.com/GeorgeCazenavette/linear-gradient-matching", "summary": "The task of dataset distillation aims to find a small set of synthetic images such that training a model on them reproduces the performance of the same model trained on a much larger dataset of real samples. Existing distillation methods focus on synthesizing datasets that enable training randomly initialized models. In contrast, state-of-the-art vision approaches are increasingly building on large, pre-trained self-supervised models rather than training from scratch. In this paper, we investigate the problem of distilling datasets that enable us to optimally train linear probes on top of such large, pre-trained vision models. We introduce a method of dataset distillation for this task called Linear Gradient Matching that optimizes the synthetic images such that, when passed through a pre-trained feature extractor, they induce gradients in the linear classifier similar to those produced by the real data. Our method yields synthetic data that outperform all real-image baselines and, remarkably, generalize across pre-trained vision models, enabling us, for instance, to train a linear CLIP probe that performs competitively using a dataset distilled via a DINO backbone. Further, we show that our distilled datasets are exceptionally effective for fine-grained classification and provide a valuable tool for model interpretability, predicting, among other things, how similar two models' embedding spaces are under the platonic representation hypothesis or whether a model is sensitive to spurious correlations in adversarial datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7ebf\u6027\u68af\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u84b8\u998f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4f18\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5408\u6210\u80fd\u591f\u8bad\u7ec3\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u800c\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u6cd5\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u84b8\u998f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u68af\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u540e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DINO\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bad\u7ec3\u51fa\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u7ebf\u6027CLIP\u63a2\u9488\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u84b8\u998f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u68af\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u84b8\u998f\u540e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Point maps encode explicit 3D coordinates on a structured 2D grid, preserving global 3D geometry while remaining compatible with the input format of 2D foundation models. To transfer rich 2D priors into POMA-3D, a view-to-scene alignment strategy is designed. Moreover, as point maps are view-dependent with respect to a canonical space, we introduce POMA-JEPA, a joint embedding-predictive architecture that enforces geometrically consistent point map features across multiple views. Additionally, we introduce ScenePoint, a point map dataset constructed from 6.5K room-level RGB-D scenes and 1M 2D image scenes to facilitate large-scale POMA-3D pretraining. Experiments show that POMA-3D serves as a strong backbone for both specialist and generalist 3D understanding. It benefits diverse tasks, including 3D question answering, embodied navigation, scene retrieval, and embodied localization, all achieved using only geometric inputs (i.e., 3D coordinates). Overall, our POMA-3D explores a point map way to 3D scene understanding, addressing the scarcity of pretrained priors and limited data in 3D representation learning.

To address these issues, we propose a novel framework with a primary 3DHS branch and an auxiliary discrimination branch. Specifically, to alleviate the multi-hierarchy conflicts, we propose a late-decoupled 3DHS framework which employs multiple decoders with the coarse-to-fine hierarchical guidance and consistency. The late-decoupled architecture can mitigate the underfitting and overfitting conflicts among multiple hierarchies and can also constrain the class imbalance problem in each individual hierarchy. Moreover, we introduce a 3DHS-oriented semantic prototype based bi-branch supervision mechanism, which additionally learns class-wise discriminative point cloud features and performs mutual supervision between the auxiliary and 3DHS branches, to enhance the class-imbalance segmentation.

In this work, we conduct a critical analysis of Cambrian-S across both these fronts. First, we introduce a simple baseline, NoSense, which discards almost all temporal structure and uses only a bag-of-words SigLIP model, yet near-perfectly solves VSR, achieving 95% accuracy even on 4-hour videos. This shows benchmarks like VSR can be nearly solved without spatial cognition, world modeling or spatial supersensing. Second, we hypothesize that the tailored inference methods proposed by Cambrian-S likely exploit shortcut heuristics in the benchmark. We illustrate this with a simple sanity check on the VSC benchmark, called VSC-Repeat: We concatenate each video with itself 1-5 times, which does not change the number of unique objects. However, this simple perturbation entirely collapses the mean relative accuracy of Cambrian-S from 42% to 0%. A system that performs spatial supersensing and integrates information across experiences should recognize views of the same scene and keep object-count predictions unchanged; instead, Cambrian-S inference algorithm relies largely on a shortcut in the VSC benchmark that rooms are never revisited. Taken together, our findings suggest that (i) current VSI-Super benchmarks do not yet reliably measure spatial supersensing, and (ii) predictive-sensing inference recipes used by Cambrian-S improve performance by inadvertently exploiting shortcuts rather than from robust spatial supersensing.

Despite notable efforts in 4D generative modeling, existing methods exhibit fundamental limitations that impede their broader applicability, including temporal and geometric inconsistencies, perceptual artifacts, motion irregularities, high computational costs, and limited control over dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose TriDiff-4D, a novel 4D generative pipeline that employs diffusion-based triplane re-posing to produce high-quality, temporally coherent 4D avatars. Our model adopts an auto-regressive strategy to generate 4D sequences of arbitrary length, synthesizing each 3D frame with a single diffusion process. By explicitly learning 3D structure and motion priors from large-scale 3D and motion datasets, TriDiff-4D enables skeleton-driven 4D generation that excels in temporal consistency, motion accuracy, computational efficiency, and visual fidelity. Specifically, TriDiff-4D first generates a canonical 3D avatar and a corresponding motion sequence from a text prompt, then uses a second diffusion model to animate the avatar according to the motion sequence, supporting arbitrarily long 4D generation. Experimental results demonstrate that TriDiff-4D significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing generation time from hours to seconds by eliminating the optimization process, while substantially improving the generation of complex motions with high-fidelity appearance and accurate 3D geometry.", "AI": {"tldr": "TriDiff-4D\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b4D\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u76844D\u5934\u50cf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67094D\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u4f2a\u5f71\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0cTriDiff-4D\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "TriDiff-4D \u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u4e09\u5e73\u9762\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a213D\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9aa8\u67b6\u9a71\u52a8\u76844D\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTriDiff-4D\u5728\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\uff08\u4ece\u5c0f\u65f6\u7f29\u77ed\u5230\u79d2\uff09\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff08\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u51c6\u786e3D\u51e0\u4f55\uff09\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TriDiff-4D \u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e864D\u5934\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, achieving simultaneous control over the 9D poses (location, size, and orientation) of multiple objects remains an open challenge. Despite recent progress, existing methods often suffer from limited controllability and degraded quality, falling short of comprehensive multi-object 9D pose control. To address these limitations, we propose SceneDesigner, a method for accurate and flexible multi-object 9-DoF pose manipulation. SceneDesigner incorporates a branched network to the pre-trained base model and leverages a new representation, CNOCS map, which encodes 9D pose information from the camera view. This representation exhibits strong geometric interpretation properties, leading to more efficient and stable training. To support training, we construct a new dataset, ObjectPose9D, which aggregates images from diverse sources along with 9D pose annotations. To further address data imbalance issues, particularly performance degradation on low-frequency poses, we introduce a two-stage training strategy with reinforcement learning, where the second stage fine-tunes the model using a reward-based objective on rebalanced data. At inference time, we propose Disentangled Object Sampling, a technique that mitigates insufficient object generation and concept confusion in complex multi-object scenes. Moreover, by integrating user-specific personalization weights, SceneDesigner enables customized pose control for reference subjects. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that SceneDesigner significantly outperforms existing approaches in both controllability and quality.

Motivated by video's inherent capacity to demonstrate physical-world information that is difficult to convey through language alone (e.g., imagine teaching someone to tie a tie using only text), we identify an underutilized opportunity to extend video as a new answer modality for Next-Event Prediction (NEP), formalized as Video-Next-Event Prediction (VNEP). While the established NEP task takes a video with a procedural or predictive question as input to predict the next event in text, VNEP requires dynamic video responses. This shift from telling to showing unlocks more intuitive and customized answers for procedural learning and creative exploration. However, this task remains challenging for existing models, as it demands an understanding of multimodal input, instruction-conditioned reasoning, and the generation of video with visual and semantic consistency. To address this, we introduce VANS, a model that leverages reinforcement learning to align a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) for VNEP. The core of VANS is our proposed Joint-GRPO that orchestrates the VLM and VDM to function as a unit. Driven by a shared reward on their respective output, it optimizes the VLM to produce captions that are both accurate and friendly to visualize, while guiding the VDM to generate videos that are faithful to these captions and the input visual context. To enable this learning, we craft VANS-Data-100K, a dedicated dataset for the VNEP task.

Such a two-system thinking mechanism allows us to efficiently allocate cognitive resources, enabling quick decision-making for straightforward issues while reserving deeper analytical thinking for more intricate challenges. However, existing reasoning-oriented visual language models (VLMs), whether trained with explicit chain-of-thought annotations or rule-based RL rewards, mainly pursue lengthy, detailed reasoning chains, which often lead to excessive computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple RL approach, which enables VLMs to automatically switch between fast and slow thinking modes depending on task difficulty. The approach consists of two stages: in the first stage, we label data as either requiring fast thinking or slow thinking based on the model output length, which is inspired by the observation that pre-trained VLMs typically produce answers of varying lengths for different types of questions; in the second stage, we train the model using GRPO along with the thinking mode labels to develop dual-mode thinking. Despite its simplicity, our model, named DualMindVLM, significantly outperforms the base model and achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art visual reasoning models, while maintaining exceptionally high token efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDualMindVLM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u6162\u601d\u7ef4\u81ea\u52a8\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8ffd\u6c42\u5197\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u6839\u636e\u95ee\u9898\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7075\u6d3b\u5206\u914d\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u673a\u5236\u5177\u6709\u542f\u53d1\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u6839\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u957f\u5ea6\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u5feb\u6162\u601d\u7ef4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528GRPO\u548c\u601d\u7ef4\u6a21\u5f0f\u6807\u7b7e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "DualMindVLM\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8token\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "DualMindVLM\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5feb\u6162\u601d\u7ef4\u6a21\u5f0f\u95f4\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684token\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002"}}

In this work, we strive to improve LMM reasoning capabilities in a purely unsupervised fashion (without any annotated data or reward distillation). To this end, we propose a self-evolving framework, named EvoLMM, that instantiates two cooperative agents from a single backbone model: a Proposer, which generates diverse, image-grounded questions, and a Solver, which solves them through internal consistency, where learning proceeds through a continuous self-rewarding process. This dynamic feedback encourages both the generation of informative queries and the refinement of structured reasoning without relying on ground-truth or human judgments. When using the popular Qwen2.5-VL as the base model, our EvoLMM yields consistent gains upto $\\sim$3\\% on multimodal math-reasoning benchmarks, including ChartQA, MathVista, and MathVision, using only raw training images. We hope our simple yet effective approach will serve as a solid baseline easing future research in self-improving LMMs in a fully-unsupervised fashion.

For this task, beyond a set of images, many prior state-of-the-art methods use accurate \"ground-truth\" camera poses and human poses as input to guide reconstruction at test-time. We show that pose-dependent reconstruction degrades results significantly if pose estimates are noisy. To overcome this, we introduce NoPo-Avatar, which reconstructs avatars solely from images, without any pose input. By removing the dependence of test-time reconstruction on human poses, NoPo-Avatar is not affected by noisy human pose estimates, making it more widely applicable. Experiments on challenging THuman2.0, XHuman, and HuGe100K data show that NoPo-Avatar outperforms existing baselines in practical settings (without ground-truth poses) and delivers comparable results in lab settings (with ground-truth poses).", "AI": {"tldr": "NoPo-Avatar\u65e0\u9700\u59ff\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u5373\u53ef\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa3D\u4eba\u4f53\u5316\u8eab\uff0c\u6297\u566a\u58f0\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u51c6\u786e\u59ff\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86NoPo-Avatar\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u59ff\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u5bf9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u56e0\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u566a\u58f0\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "result": "\u5728THuman2.0\u3001XHuman\u548cHuGe100K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cNoPo-Avatar\u5728\u65e0\u771f\u5b9e\u59ff\u6001\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff08\u6709\u771f\u5b9e\u59ff\u6001\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "NoPo-Avatar\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u59ff\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u6216\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u53ef\u52a8\u753b\u5316\u76843D\u4eba\u4f53\u5316\u8eab\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u65e0\u771f\u5b9e\u59ff\u6001\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}
