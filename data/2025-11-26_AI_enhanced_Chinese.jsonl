Production architecture and benchmark evaluation of browser agents", "summary": "Browser agents enable autonomous web interaction but face critical reliability and security challenges in production. This paper presents findings from building and operating a production browser agent. The analysis examines where current approaches fail and what prevents safe autonomous operation. The fundamental insight: model capability does not limit agent performance; architectural decisions determine success or failure. Security analysis of real-world incidents reveals prompt injection attacks make general-purpose autonomous operation fundamentally unsafe. The paper argues against developing general browsing intelligence in favor of specialized tools with programmatic constraints, where safety boundaries are enforced through code instead of large language model (LLM) reasoning. Through hybrid context management combining accessibility tree snapshots with selective vision, comprehensive browser tooling matching human interaction capabilities, and intelligent prompt engineering, the agent achieved approximately 85% success rate on the WebGames benchmark across 53 diverse challenges (compared to approximately 50% reported for prior browser agents and 95.7% human baseline).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u751f\u4ea7\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e13\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b085%\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u53ca\u963b\u788d\u5b89\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u6811\u5feb\u7167\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u5339\u914d\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5168\u9762\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u5de5\u5177\u4ee5\u53ca\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8685%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u4ee3\u7406\u5728WebGames\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ea685%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff08\u5148\u524d\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u4ee3\u7406\u7ea6\u4e3a50%\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e3a95.7%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3b\u5f20\u53cd\u5bf9\u5f00\u53d1\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6d4f\u89c8\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u8f6c\u800c\u652f\u6301\u5177\u6709\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7801\u800c\u975e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u6765\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u8fb9\u754c\u3002"}}

However, with the rapid growth of enterprise-scale MCP services, efficiently and accurately matching target functionalities among thousands of heterogeneous tools has become a core challenge restricting system practicality. Existing approaches generally rely on full-prompt injection or static semantic retrieval, facing issues including semantic disconnection between user queries and tool descriptions, context inflation in LLM input, and high inference latency. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Z-Space, a data-generation-oriented multi-agent collaborative tool invocation framework Z-Space. The Z-Space framework establishes a multi-agent collaborative architecture and tool filtering algorithm: (1) A structured semantic understanding of user queries is achieved through an intent parsing model; (2) A tool filtering module (FSWW) based on fused subspace weighted algorithm realizes fine-grained semantic alignment between intents and tools without parameter tuning; (3) An inference execution agent is constructed to support dynamic planning and fault-tolerant execution for multi-step tasks. This framework has been deployed in the Eleme platform's technical division, serving large-scale test data generation scenarios across multiple business units including Taotian, Gaode, and Hema.

Consequently, memory competition leads to inevitable page swapping in memory-constrained mixed-criticality edge devices, causing slow storage I/O and thus performance degradation. In such scenarios, inefficient memory allocation disrupts the balance between application performance, causing soft real-time (soft RT) tasks to miss deadlines or preventing non-real-time (non-RT) applications from optimizing throughput. Meanwhile, we observe unpredictable, long system-level stalls (called long stalls) under high memory and I/O pressure, which further degrade performance. In this work, we propose a Stall-Aware Real-Time Memory Allocator (SARA), which discovers opportunities for performance balance by allocating just enough memory to soft RT tasks to meet deadlines and, at the same time, optimizing the remaining memory for non-RT applications. To minimize the memory usage of soft RT tasks while meeting real-time requirements, SARA leverages our insight into how latency, caused by memory insufficiency and measured by our proposed PSI-based metric, affects the execution time of each soft RT job, where a job runs per period and a soft RT task consists of multiple periods. Moreover, SARA detects long stalls using our definition and proactively drops affected jobs, minimizing stalls in task execution. Experiments show that SARA achieves an average of 97.13% deadline hit ratio for soft RT tasks and improves non-RT application throughput by up to 22.32x over existing approaches, even with memory capacity limited to 60% of peak demand.", "AI": {"tldr": "SARA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5185\u5b58\u53d7\u9650\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5185\u5b58\u5206\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5185\u5b58\u5206\u914d\u548c\u957f\u505c\u987f\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8f6f\u5b9e\u65f6\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u975e\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u56e0\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u8f6f\u5b9e\u65f6\u4efb\u52a1\u9519\u8fc7\u622a\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u6216\u975e\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u957f\u505c\u987f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8ePSI\u6307\u6807\u7684\u8f6f\u5b9e\u65f6\u4efb\u52a1\u5185\u5b58\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u957f\u505c\u987f\u68c0\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u4e22\u5f03\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u4f5c\u4e1a\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cSARA\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u5bb9\u91cf\u4ec5\u4e3a\u5cf0\u503c\u9700\u6c42\u768460%\u65f6\uff0c\u8f6f\u5b9e\u65f6\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u622a\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u5e73\u5747\u8fbe97.13%\uff0c\u975e\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534722.32\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "SARA\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u5185\u5b58\u5206\u914d\u548c\u957f\u505c\u987f\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u8f6f\u5b9e\u65f6\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u975e\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In an online fashion, workloads arrive on some of the $n$ processors and are stored in an input buffer. Processors can run and reduce these workloads, but conflicts between pairs of processors restrict simultaneous task execution. Conflicts are represented by a graph, where vertices correspond to processors and edges indicate conflicting pairs. An online algorithm must decide which processors are run at a time; so provide a valid schedule respecting the conflict constraints.\n  The objective is to minimize the maximal workload observed across all processors during the schedule. Unlike the original model, where workloads arrive as discrete blocks at specific time points, the flow model assumes workloads arrive continuously over intervals or not at all. We present tight bounds for all graphs with four vertices (except the path, which has been solved previously) and for the families of general complete graphs and complete bipartite graphs.

The primary obstacle to this representation is to obtain the difficult-to-construct vector ground-truth (GT).

To address the low inference efficiency of LLMs across diverse heterogeneous platforms, this paper proposes a practical optimization method, Opt4GPTQ, designed for 4-bit GPTQ quantized LLMs inference on heterogeneous AI accelerators. Built upon the vLLM serving system, Opt4GPTQ integrates three platform-level optimization strategies: Shared Memory Buffering optimization (SMB-Opt), which caches data in shared memory and employs single-threaded writes; Vectorized Memory Loading optimization (VML-Opt), which utilizes vectorized memory operations for efficient data loading; and Inline Assembly optimization (ILAOpt), which directly leverages hardware-native vector halfprecision addition and fused multiply-accumulate instructions for efficient execution. Experimental results show that Opt4GPTQ effectively improves inference performance across different models, achieving up to 84.42% throughput improvement and up to 51.35% latency reduction. This work highlights the critical role of platform-level engineering optimizations in enabling efficient LLMs inference on emerging heterogeneous AI acceleration architectures and provides valuable deployment experience and methodologies for future heterogeneous platform adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Opt4GPTQ \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf94\u4f4dGPTQ\u91cf\u5316LLMs\u5728\u5f02\u6784AI\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u4e0a\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u5e73\u53f0\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5f02\u6784\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "Opt4GPTQ \u57fa\u4e8evLLM\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u5e73\u53f0\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5b58\u7f13\u51b2\u4f18\u5316\uff08SMB-Opt\uff09\u3001\u5411\u91cf\u5316\u5185\u5b58\u52a0\u8f7d\u4f18\u5316\uff08VML-Opt\uff09\u548c\u5185\u8054\u6c47\u7f16\u4f18\u5316\uff08ILA-Opt\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cOpt4GPTQ \u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8684.42%\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u548c51.35%\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "Opt4GPTQ \u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5e73\u53f0\u7ea7\u5de5\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u5f02\u6784AI\u52a0\u901f\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5f02\u6784\u5e73\u53f0\u9002\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9d\u8d35\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u7ecf\u9a8c\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u3002"}}

Most current data is obtained via human teleoperation, which is expensive and difficult to scale. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods learn useful skills through autonomous exploration, making them a viable approach for generating data. However, standard RL training collapses to a narrow execution pattern, limiting its utility for large-scale pre-training. We propose Discover, Lea rn and Reinforce (DLR), an information-theoretic pattern discovery framework that generates multiple distinct, high-success behavioral patterns for VLA pretraining. Empirically, DLR generates a markedly more diverse trajectory corpus on LIBERO. Specifically, it learns multiple distinct, high-success strategies for the same task where standard RL discovers only one, and hence it covers substantially broader regions of the state-action space. When adapted to unseen downstream task suites, VLA models pretrained on our diverse RL data surpass counterparts trained on equal-sized standard RL datasets. Moreover, DLR exhibits positive data-scaling behavior that single-pattern RL lacks.

Currently, there is a paucity of evidence-based integrated treatments for CP and OUD among individuals receiving medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Wearable devices have the potential to monitor complex patient information and inform treatment development for persons with OUD and CP, including pain variability (e.g., exacerbations of pain or pain spikes) and clinical correlates (e.g., perceived stress). However, the application of large language models (LLMs) with wearable data for understanding pain spikes, remains unexplored. Consequently, the aim of this pilot study was to examine the clinical correlates of pain spikes using a range of AI approaches. We found that machine learning models achieved relatively high accuracy (>0.7) in predicting pain spikes, while LLMs were limited in providing insights on pain spikes. Real-time monitoring through wearable devices, combined with advanced AI models, could facilitate early detection of pain spikes and support personalized interventions that may help mitigate the risk of opioid relapse, improve adherence to MOUD, and enhance the integration of CP and OUD care.

Yet studies consistently show that a significant proportion of published workflows suffer from decay over time. This problem is particularly acute for legacy workflow systems like Taverna, where discontinued services, obsolete dependencies, and system retirement render previously functional workflows unusable. We present a novel legacy workflow migration system, called CodeR$^3$ (stands for Code Repair, Revival and Reuse), that leverages generative AI to analyze the characteristics of decayed workflows, reproduce them into modern workflow technologies like Snakemake and VisFlow. Our system additionally integrates stepwise workflow analysis visualization, automated service substitution, and human-in-the-loop validation. Through several case studies of Taverna workflow revival, we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach while identifying key challenges that require human oversight. Our findings reveal that automation significantly reduces manual effort in workflow parsing and service identification.

However, existing multimodal learning frameworks, focused on vision and language, lack physical consistency and overlook the intrinsic causal relationships among an object's geometry, material, vibration modes, and the sounds it produces. We introduce VibraVerse, a large-scale geometry-acoustics alignment dataset that explicitly bridges the causal chain from 3D geometry -> physical attributes -> modal parameters -> acoustic signals. Each 3D model has explicit physical properties (density, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio) and volumetric geometry, from which modal eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors are computed for impact sound synthesis under controlled excitations. To establish this coherence, we introduce CLASP, a contrastive learning framework for cross-modal alignment that preserves the causal correspondence between an object's physical structure and its acoustic response. This framework enforces physically consistent alignment across modalities, ensuring that every sample is coherent, traceable to the governing equations, and embedded within a unified representation space spanning shape, image, and sound. Built upon VibraVerse, we define a suite of benchmark tasks for geometry-to-sound prediction, sound-guided shape reconstruction, and cross-modal representation learning. Extensive validations on these tasks demonstrate that models trained on VibraVerse exhibit superior accuracy, interpretability, and generalization across modalities. These results establish VibraVerse as a benchmark for physically consistent and causally interpretable multimodal learning, providing a foundation for sound-guided embodied perception and a deeper understanding of the physical world.

This paper investigates the performance of UL-MIMO and UL-256QAM for HD live-streaming over a commercial 5G network using the Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP).

In this work, we present PIGReward, a personalized reward model that dynamically generates user-conditioned evaluation dimensions and assesses images through CoT reasoning. To address the scarcity of user data, PIGReward adopt a self-bootstrapping strategy that reasons over limited reference data to construct rich user contexts, enabling personalization without user-specific training. Beyond evaluation, PIGReward provides personalized feedback that drives user-specific prompt optimization, improving alignment between generated images and individual intent. We further introduce PIGBench, a per-user preference benchmark capturing diverse visual interpretations of shared prompts.

We present Agint, an agentic graph compiler, interpreter, and runtime that incrementally and hierarchically converts natural-language instructions into typed, effect-aware code DAGs. Agint introduces explicit type floors (text to data to spec to code) grounded in semantic graph transformations and a hybrid LLM and function-based JIT runtime. This enables dynamic graph refinement, reproducible and optimizable execution, speculative evaluation, and interoperability with existing developer tools. Agint's typed graph bindings improve reliability and allow concurrent composition of concurrent codebases by construction, supporting accelerated development with smaller and faster models, lower latency, efficient context utilization, and higher throughput. Hierarchical compilation allows scalable graph edits, while the graph structure supports reproducibility and efficient parallel generation. Agint provides a composable unix-style toolchain: dagify (DAG compiler), dagent (hybrid JIT runtime), schemagin (schema generator), and datagin (data transformer) for realtime, low-latency code and dataflow creation. Human developers and coding agents refine graphs through the Agint CLI, while non-technical users use Agint Flow GUI for visual editing, conversational refinement, and debugging to promote prototype agentic workflows to production code. This continuous co-creation model allows teams to prototype quickly, refine seamlessly, and deploy reliably, bridging natural language, compiler methods, and developer tooling to enable a new generation of composable, team-centric coding agents at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "Agint\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7f16\u8bd1\u548c\u56fe\u5f62\u5316\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c7b\u578b\u5316DAG\u548c\u6df7\u5408JIT\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347LLM\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524dLLM\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5f00\u53d1\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "Agint\u91c7\u7528\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7f16\u8bd1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u9010\u6b65\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7c7b\u578b\u5316\u3001\u6548\u679c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4ee3\u7801DAG\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u56fe\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u6df7\u5408LLM\u4e0e\u51fd\u6570\u7684JIT\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u3002", "result": "Agint\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u6267\u884c\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u53d1\u5de5\u5177\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "Agint\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7f16\u8bd1\u548c\u56fe\u5f62\u5316\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5feb\u901f\u539f\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u751f\u4ea7\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u65e0\u7f1d\u8f6c\u6362\u3002"}}

This paper considers a generalisation of this problem to \\emph{temporal graphs}, i.e., to graphs whose structure changes according to an ordered sequence of edge sets. In the simultaneous resource updating problem on temporal graphs, the resources which can be accessed will change, however, the necessity of symmetry breaking to avoid conflicts remains.\n  In this paper, we focus on the problem of \\emph{maintaining proper colourings} on temporal graphs in general, with a particular focus on bipartite colourings. Our aim is to minimise the total number of times that the vertices change colour, or, in the form of a decision problem, whether we can maintain a proper colouring by allowing not more colour changes than some given \\emph{budget}. On the negative side, we show that, despite bipartite colouring being easy on static graphs, the problem of maintaining such a colouring on graphs that are bipartite in each snapshot is NP-Hard to even approximate within \\emph{any} constant factor unless the Unique Games Conjecture fails. On the positive side, we provide an exact algorithm for a temporal graph with $n$ vertices, a lifetime $T$ and at most $k$ components in any given snapshot in $O(T \\vert E \\vert 2^{k} + n T 2^{2k})$ time, and an $O\\left(\\sqrt{\\log(nT)}\\right)$-factor approximation algorithm running in $\\tilde{O}((nT)^3)$ time.\n  Our results contribute to the structural complexity of networks that change with time with respect to a fundamental computational problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65f6\u6001\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u7740\u8272\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176NP\u96be\u89e3\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u65f6\u6001\u56fe\u7740\u8272\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u7f51\u7edc\u51b2\u7a81\u907f\u514d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u65f6\u6001\u56fe\u4e2d\u7ef4\u62a4\u9002\u5f53\u7740\u8272\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\u7684NP\u96be\u89e3\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cbe\u786e\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u6001\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u7740\u8272\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65f6\u6001\u56fe\u4e2d\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e8c\u5206\u7740\u8272\u7684NP\u96be\u89e3\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aO(T|E|2^k + nT2^{2k})\uff09\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u8fd1\u4f3c\u56e0\u5b50\u4e3aO(\u221alog(nT))\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aO\u0303((nT)^3)\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u65f6\u6001\u56fe\u4e2d\u7ef4\u62a4\u9002\u5f53\u7740\u8272\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5feb\u7167\u90fd\u662f\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u4e5f\u662fNP\u96be\u89e3\u7684\uff0c\u9664\u975e\u552f\u4e00\u6e38\u620f\u731c\u60f3\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Recent research has explored motion controllability as a means to enhance text-to-video generation or image animation; however, we identify precise motion control as a promising yet under-explored paradigm for editing existing videos. In this work, we propose modifying video motion by directly editing sparse trajectories extracted from the input. We term the deviation between input and output trajectories a \"motion edit\" and demonstrate that this representation, when coupled with a generative backbone, enables powerful video editing capabilities. To achieve this, we introduce a pipeline for generating \"motion counterfactuals\", video pairs that share identical content but distinct motion, and we fine-tune a motion-conditioned video diffusion architecture on this dataset. Our approach allows for edits that start at any timestamp and propagate naturally. In a four-way head-to-head user study, our model achieves over 65 percent preference against prior work.

With the introduction of 5G, the support of UL-256QAM has been greatly improved due to a big re-haul of RAN by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs). However, many RAN manufacturers charge MNOs for licenses to enable UL-256QAM per cell basis. This led to some MNOs hesitating to enable the feature on some of their gNodeB or cells to save cost.\n  Since it's known that 256QAM modulation requires a very good channel condition to operate, but UE has a very limited transmission power budget. In this paper, 256QAM utilization, throughput and latency impact from enabling UL-256QAM will be evaluated on commercial 5G Standalone (SA) networks in two countries: Japan and Thailand on various frequency bands, mobility characteristics, and deployment schemes. By modifying the modem firmware, UL-256QAM can be turned off and compared to the conventional UL-64QAM. The results show that UL-256QAM utilization was less than 20% when deployed on a passive antenna network resulting in an average of 8.22% improvement in throughput. However, with Massive MIMO deployment, more than 50% utilization was possible on commercial networks. Furthermore, despite a small uplink throughput gain, enabling UL-256QAM can lower the latency when the link is fully loaded with an average improvement of 7.97 ms in TCP latency observed across various test cases with two TCP congestion control algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "UL-256QAM\u57285G Massive MIMO\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4f46\u88ab\u52a8\u5929\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1UL-256QAM\u81ea2016\u5e74\u5f15\u5165\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8eRAN\u548cUE\u5382\u5546\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u8db3\u53ca\u8bb8\u53ef\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u5bf9\u5176\u542f\u7528\u72b9\u8c6b\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u57285G\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u8c03\u5236\u89e3\u8c03\u5668\u56fa\u4ef6\uff0c\u5728\u5546\u4e1a5G SA\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6bd4UL-256QAM\u548cUL-64QAM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u540c\u9891\u6bb5\u3001\u79fb\u52a8\u7279\u6027\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u88ab\u52a8\u5929\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2dUL-256QAM\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e20%\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u53478.22%\uff1bMassive MIMO\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u7387\u8d85\u8fc750%\uff0c\u4e14\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e7.97 ms\u3002", "conclusion": "\u542f\u7528UL-256QAM\u5728Massive MIMO\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff08\u8d85\u8fc750%\uff09\u548c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff08\u5e73\u57478.22%\u63d0\u5347\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9ad8\u8d1f\u8f7d\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff08\u5e73\u57477.97 ms\uff09\u3002"}}

Assuncao", "Kaiwen Zhang"], "title": "AI-driven Predictive Shard Allocation for Scalable Next Generation Blockchains", "comment": null, "summary": "Sharding has emerged as a key technique to address blockchain scalability by partitioning the ledger into multiple shards that process transactions in parallel. Although this approach improves throughput, static or heuristic shard allocation often leads to workload skew, congestion, and excessive cross-shard communication diminishing the scalability benefits of sharding. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Predictive Shard Allocation Protocol (PSAP), a dynamic and intelligent allocation framework that proactively assigns accounts and transactions to shards based on workload forecasts. PSAP integrates a Temporal Workload Forecasting (TWF) model with a safety-constrained reinforcement learning (Safe-PPO) controller, jointly enabling multi-block-ahead prediction and adaptive shard reconfiguration. The protocol enforces deterministic inference across validators through a synchronized quantized runtime and a safety gate that limits stake concentration, migration gas, and utilization thresholds. By anticipating hotspot formation and executing bounded, atomic migrations, PSAP achieves stable load balance while preserving Byzantine safety. Experimental evaluation on heterogeneous datasets, including Ethereum, NEAR, and Hyperledger Fabric mapped via address-clustering heuristics, demonstrates up to 2x throughput improvement, 35\\% lower latency, and 20\\% reduced cross-shard overhead compared to existing dynamic sharding baselines.

The messy, real-world data encountered during deployment (e.g. occluded or multilingual text) remains massively underrepresented in existing corpora. Robots, as embodied agents, are uniquely positioned to close this gap: they can act in physical environments to collect large-scale, real-world data that enriches FM training with precisely the examples current models lack. We introduce the Robot-Powered Data Flywheel, a framework that transforms robots from FM consumers into data generators. By deploying robots equipped with FMs in the wild, we enable a virtuous cycle: robots perform useful tasks while collecting real-world data that improves both domain-specific adaptation and domain-adjacent generalization. We instantiate this framework with Scanford, a mobile manipulator deployed in the East Asia Library for 2 weeks. Scanford autonomously scans shelves, identifies books using a vision-language model (VLM), and leverages the library catalog to label images without human annotation. This deployment both aids librarians and produces a dataset to finetune the underlying VLM, improving performance on the domain-specific in-the-wild library setting and on domain-adjacent multilingual OCR benchmarks. Using data collected from 2103 shelves, Scanford improves VLM performance on book identification from 32.0% to 71.8% and boosts domain-adjacent multilingual OCR from 24.8% to 46.6% (English) and 30.8% to 38.0% (Chinese), while saving an ~18.7 hrs of human time. These results highlight how robot-powered data flywheels can both reduce human effort in real deployments and unlock new pathways for continually adapting FMs to the messiness of reality.

Though the influence function was proposed for attributing how infinitesimal up-weighting or removal of individual training examples affects model outputs, its implementation is still challenging in deep-learning vision models: inverse-curvature computations are expensive, and training non-stationarity invalidates static approximations. Prior works use iterative solvers and low-rank surrogates to reduce cost, but offline computation lags behind training dynamics, and missing confidence calibration yields fragile rankings that misidentify critical examples. To address these challenges, we introduce a Stability-Guided Online Influence Framework (SG-OIF), the first framework that treats algorithmic stability as a real-time controller, which (i) maintains lightweight anchor IHVPs via stochastic Richardson and preconditioned Neumann; (ii) proposes modular curvature backends to modulate per-example influence scores using stability-guided residual thresholds, anomaly gating, and confidence. Experimental results show that SG-OIF achieves SOTA (State-Of-The-Art) on noise-label and out-of-distribution detection tasks across multiple datasets with various corruption.

MCIs mislead reviewers, hinder maintenance, contaminate research datasets, and may obscure security patches. Yet, no dedicated benchmark exists to evaluate models for MCI detection. We introduce CODEFUSE-COMMITEVAL, the first benchmark designed for MCI detection using large language models (LLMs). Built on the ApacheCM dataset for diversity and quality, we generate seven types of inconsistent messages through rule-guided mutations of originally consistent commits and apply two-fold validation to verify both positive and negative samples. Using this labeled dataset of message-diff pairs, we evaluate six state-of-the-art open-source LLMs under a vanilla setting and with three augmentation strategies: few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought, and extended context. Results show models detect inconsistent commits more reliably than consistent ones (average Recall 85.95%, Precision 80.28%, Specificity 63.8%); gpt-oss-20B performs best overall but uses over twice the tokens of others. Augmentation effects vary: adjacent context helps larger models but adds noise for smaller ones; few-shot improves accuracy and reduces token use, yet increases universally incorrect predictions; chain-of-thought boosts precision and specificity at the cost of recall and higher token consumption. Type-wise analysis reveals higher detectability for component, file-path, and operation inconsistencies, but lower accuracy and higher token cost for intent-level \"purpose\" inconsistencies.

In this model, $d = n^{\u03a9(1)}$ cliques of size approximately $k$ are randomly planted by choosing the vertices to participate in each clique independently with probability $\u03b4$. While there has been extensive work on recovering one, or multiple disjointly planted cliques in random graphs, the natural extension of this question to recovering overlapping cliques has been, surprisingly, largely unexplored. Moreover, because every vertex can be part of polynomially many cliques, this task is significantly harder than in case of disjointly planted cliques (as recently studied by Kothari, Vempala, Wein and Xu [COLT'23]) and manifests in the failure of simple combinatorial and even spectral algorithms.\n  In this work we obtain the first efficient algorithms for recovering the community structure of RIGs both from the perspective of exact and approximate recovery.

With the growing complexity of modern control problems, CBFs have received increasing attention in both optimization-based and learning-based control communities as a safety filter, owing to their provable guarantees. However, success in transferring these guarantees to real-world systems is critically tied to model accuracy. For example, payloads or wind disturbances can significantly influence the dynamics of an aerial vehicle and invalidate the safety guarantee. In this work, we propose an efficient yet flexible online learning-enhanced high-order adaptive control barrier function using Neural ODEs. Our approach improves the safety of a CBF-certified system on the fly, even under complex time-varying model perturbations.

In this paper, we introduce Pistachio, a new VAD/VAU benchmark constructed entirely through a controlled, generation-based pipeline. By leveraging recent advances in video generation models, Pistachio provides precise control over scenes, anomaly types, and temporal narratives, effectively eliminating the biases and limitations of Internet-collected datasets. Our pipeline integrates scene-conditioned anomaly assignment, multi-step storyline generation, and a temporally consistent long-form synthesis strategy that produces coherent 41-second videos with minimal human intervention.

Curticapean and Marx (FOCS'14) show that if the graph $H$ has vertex cover number $\u03c4$, subgraph counting has time complexity $O(|H|^{2^{O(\u03c4)}} |G|^{\u03c4+ O(1)})$. This raises the question of whether this upper bound can be improved for input graphs $G$ from a restricted family of graphs. Earlier work by Eppstein~(IPL'94) shows that this is indeed possible, by proving that when $G$ is a $d$-degenerate graph and $H$ is a biclique of arbitrary size, subgraph counting has time complexity $O(d 3^{d/3} |G|)$. We show that if the input is restricted to $d$-degenerate graphs, the upper bound of Curticapean and Marx can be improved for a family of graphs $H$ that includes all bicliques and satisfies a property we call $(c,d)$-locatable. Importantly, our algorithm's running time only has a polynomial dependence on the size of~$H$. A key feature of $(c,d)$-locatable graphs $H$ is that they admit a vertex cover of size at most $cd$.

While Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) have been used to model uncertainty, they assume full state observability - an assumption that breaks down in partitioned DTNs, where each node operates with inherently partial knowledge of the network state. In this work, we investigate the role of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) for DTN routing under uncertainty. We introduce and evaluate a novel model: Dependent Node Failures (DNF), which captures correlated node failures via repairable node states modeled as Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs). We implement the model using JuliaPOMDP and integrate it with DTN simulations via DtnSim. Our evaluation demonstrates that POMDP-based routing yields improved delivery ratios and delay performance under uncertain conditions while maintaining scalability.

Despite their shared objective, existing approaches often tackle these tasks using specialized architectures or modality-specific parameters, limiting their generalization and scalability. Recent efforts have attempted to unify multiple tracking and segmentation subtasks from the perspectives of any modality input or multi-task inference. However, these approaches tend to overlook two critical challenges: the distributional gap across different modalities and the feature representation gap across tasks. These issues hinder effective cross-task and cross-modal knowledge sharing, ultimately constraining the development of a true generalist model. To address these limitations, we propose a universal tracking and segmentation framework named SATA, which unifies a broad spectrum of tracking and segmentation subtasks with any modality input. Specifically, a Decoupled Mixture-of-Expert (DeMoE) mechanism is presented to decouple the unified representation learning task into the modeling process of cross-modal shared knowledge and specific information, thus enabling the model to maintain flexibility while enhancing generalization. Additionally, we introduce a Task-aware Multi-object Tracking (TaMOT) pipeline to unify all the task outputs as a unified set of instances with calibrated ID information, thereby alleviating the degradation of task-specific knowledge during multi-task training.

Traditional human alignment reviews are accurate but slow and labor-intensive, especially across large item banks. This study examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can accelerate this process without sacrificing accuracy. Using over 12,000 item-skill pairs in grades K-5, we tested three LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o) across three tasks that mirror real-world challenges: identifying misaligned items, selecting the correct skill from the full set of standards, and narrowing candidate lists prior to classification. In Study 1, GPT-4o-mini correctly identified alignment status in approximately 83-94% of cases, including subtle misalignments. In Study 2, performance remained strong in mathematics but was lower for reading, where standards are more semantically overlapping. Study 3 demonstrated that pre-filtering candidate skills substantially improved results, with the correct skill appearing among the top five suggestions more than 95% of the time. These findings suggest that LLMs, particularly when paired with candidate filtering strategies, can significantly reduce the manual burden of item review while preserving alignment accuracy. We recommend the development of hybrid pipelines that combine LLM-based screening with human review in ambiguous cases, offering a scalable solution for ongoing item validation and instructional alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\uff08\u5982GPT-4o-mini\uff09\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u6559\u80b2\u9879\u76ee\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u7b5b\u9009\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u6838\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ba1\u6838\u51c6\u786e\u4f46\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9879\u76ee\u5e93\u4e2d\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8LLMs\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u800c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8d85\u8fc712,000\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee-\u6280\u80fd\u5bf9\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u4e09\u79cdLLMs\uff08GPT-3.5 Turbo\u3001GPT-4o-mini\u548cGPT-4o\uff09\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1a\u8bc6\u522b\u672a\u5bf9\u9f50\u9879\u76ee\u3001\u4ece\u5b8c\u6574\u6807\u51c6\u96c6\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\u6280\u80fd\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u524d\u7f29\u5c0f\u5019\u9009\u5217\u8868\u3002", "result": "GPT-4o-mini\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9\u9f50\u72b6\u6001\u65f6\u6b63\u786e\u7387\u7ea6\u4e3a83-94%\uff1b\u6570\u5b66\u8868\u73b0\u5f3a\u52b2\uff0c\u9605\u8bfb\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u4f4e\uff1b\u9884\u7b5b\u9009\u5019\u9009\u6280\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\u6280\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u524d\u4e94\u5efa\u8bae\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u7387\u8d85\u8fc795%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u5019\u9009\u7b5b\u9009\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u6838\u7684\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u9f50\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u5f00\u53d1\u6df7\u5408\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u7b5b\u9009\u4e0e\u6a21\u7cca\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u6838\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u6559\u5b66\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In contrast, LLM-based techniques are prohibitively expensive due to their reliance on frontier models (without which they cannot reliably generate compilable translations), thus limiting scalability. This paper proposes Rustine, a fully automated pipeline for effective and efficient repository-level C to idiomatic safe Rust translation. Evaluating on a diverse set of 23 C programs, ranging from 27 to 13,200 lines of code, Rustine can generate fully compilable Rust code for all and achieve 87% functional equivalence (passing 1,063,099 assertions out of 1,221,192 in test suites with average function and line coverage of 74.7% and 72.2%). Compared to six prior repository-level C to Rust translation techniques, the translations by Rustine are overall safer (fewer raw pointers, pointer arithmetic, and unsafe constructs), more idiomatic (fewer Rust linter violations), and more readable. When the translations cannot pass all tests to fulfill functional equivalence, human developers were able to complete the task in 4.5 hours, on average, using Rustine as debugging support.", "AI": {"tldr": "Rustine \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316 C \u5230 Rust \u7ffb\u8bd1\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u4e60\u60ef\u4e14\u53ef\u8bfb\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u529f\u80fd\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u8fbe 87%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709 C \u5230 Rust \u7ffb\u8bd1\u6280\u672f\u65e0\u6cd5\u517c\u987e\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6c\u8bd1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4f46\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u4e60\u60ef\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e LLM \u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u800c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "method": "Rustine \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u4e60\u60ef\u4e14\u5b89\u5168\u7684 Rust \u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30 23 \u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684 C \u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0827 \u81f3 13,200 \u884c\u4ee3\u7801\uff09\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u53ef\u7f16\u8bd1\u6027\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u3002", "result": "Rustine \u5728\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u7f16\u8bd1\u7684 Rust \u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u529f\u80fd\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u8fbe 87%\uff08\u901a\u8fc7 1,063,099/1,221,192 \u65ad\u8a00\uff09\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u884c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4e3a 74.7% \u548c 72.2%\u3002\u5176\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4e60\u60ef\u4e14\u66f4\u53ef\u8bfb\u3002\u82e5\u7ffb\u8bd1\u672a\u901a\u8fc7\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5e73\u5747\u4ec5\u9700 4.5 \u5c0f\u65f6\u5373\u53ef\u5b8c\u6210\u8c03\u8bd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Rustine \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4ed3\u5e93\u7ea7\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684 C \u5230 Rust \u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u7b26\u5408\u4e60\u60ef\u4e14\u53ef\u8bfb\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

These agents, modelled as autonomous physical or software entities, possess local computation power, finite memory and have the ability to traverse a graph, offering efficient solutions to a range of classical problems. In this work, we focus on the problem of computing a \\emph{minimal dominating set} (mDS) in anonymous graphs using mobile agents. Building on the recently proposed optimal dispersion algorithm on the synchronous mobile agent model, we design two new algorithms that achieve a \\emph{linear-time} solution for this problem in the synchronous setting. Specifically, given a connected $n$-node graph with $n$ agents initially placed in either rooted or arbitrary configurations, we show that an mDS can be computed in $O(n)$ rounds using only $O(\\log n)$ bits of memory per agent, without using any prior knowledge of any global parameters. This improves upon the best-known complexity results in the literature over the same model. In addition, as natural by-products of our methodology, our algorithms also construct a spanning tree and elect a unique leader in $O(n)$ rounds, which are also important results of independent interest in the mobile-agent framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u533f\u540d\u56fe\u4e2d\u79fb\u52a8\u4ee3\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u5c0f\u652f\u914d\u96c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u9644\u5e26\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6811\u548c\u552f\u4e00\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u9009\u4e3e\u3002", "motivation": "\u79fb\u52a8\u4ee3\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u533f\u540d\u56fe\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u5c0f\u652f\u914d\u96c6\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u540c\u6b65\u79fb\u52a8\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u6563\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u540c\u6b65\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728O(n)\u8f6e\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u4ec5\u9700O(log n)\u4f4d\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5168\u5c40\u53c2\u6570\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u533f\u540d\u56fe\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u79fb\u52a8\u4ee3\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u5c0f\u652f\u914d\u96c6\uff08mDS\uff09\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

The relative orientation of a 3D reference object can be determined from a 3D rotated version of that object, or from a projection of the rotated object to a 2D planar image. This projection can be a perspective projection (the PnP problem) or an orthographic projection (the OnP problem). We restrict our attention here to the OnP problem and the full 3D pose estimation task (the EnP problem). Here we solve the least squares systems for both the error-free EnP and OnP problems in terms of the determinant ratio matrix (DRaM) approach. The noisy-data case can be addressed with a straightforward rotation correction scheme. While the SVD and optimal quaternion eigensystem methods solve the noisy EnP 3D-3D alignment exactly, the noisy 3D-2D orthographic (OnP) task has no known comparable closed form, and can be solved by DRaM-class methods. We note that while previous similar work has been presented in the literature exploiting both the QR decomposition and the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse transformations, here we place these methods in a larger context that has not previously been fully recognized in the absence of the corresponding DRaM solution. We term this class of solutions as the DRaM family, and conduct comparisons of the behavior of the families of solutions for the EnP and OnP rotation estimation problems. Overall, this work presents both a new solution to the 3D and 2D orthographic pose estimation problems and provides valuable insight into these classes of problems.

Existing methods face a trad-off: online planners and controllers lack formal safety guarantees, while offline planners lack adaptability to changes in the number of agents or desired formation. To address this gap, we propose a hybrid architecture where a single leader tracks a pre-computed, safe trajectory, which serves as a shared trajectory backup set for all follower agents. Followers execute a nominal formation-keeping tracking controller, and are guaranteed to remain safe by always possessing a known-safe backup maneuver along the leader's path. We formally prove this method ensures collision avoidance with both static obstacles and other agents. The primary contributions are: (1) the multi-agent gatekeeper algorithm, which extends our single-agent gatekeeper framework to multi-agent systems; (2) the trajectory backup set for provably safe inter-agent coordination for leader-follower formation control; and (3) the first application of the gatekeeper framework in a 3D environment. We demonstrate our approach in a simulated 3D urban environment, where it achieved a 100% collision-avoidance success rate across 100 randomized trials, significantly outperforming baseline CBF and NMPC methods.

While automatic 3D generation, such as image-to-3d, has made significant strides in recent years, it often struggles to achieve fast, detailed, and high-fidelity generation simultaneously. In this work, we introduce LatentDreamer, a novel framework for generating 3D objects from single images. The key to our approach is a pre-trained variational autoencoder that maps 3D geometries to latent features, which greatly reducing the difficulty of 3D generation. Starting from latent features, the pipeline of LatentDreamer generates coarse geometries, refined geometries, and realistic textures sequentially. The 3D objects generated by LatentDreamer exhibit high fidelity to the input images, and the entire generation process can be completed within a short time (typically in 70 seconds).

This approach allows emergent, physically consistent whole-body behaviors that account for the system's dynamics and physical constraints.

While personalized multidisciplinary interventions have the potential to slow disease progression and enhance quality of life, they typically require substantial medical resources and expertise, making them difficult to implement in resource-limited settings. To address this challenge, we developed KOM, a multi-agent system designed to automate KOA evaluation, risk prediction, and treatment prescription. This system assists clinicians in performing essential tasks across the KOA care pathway and supports the generation of tailored management plans based on individual patient profiles, disease status, risk factors, and contraindications. In benchmark experiments, KOM demonstrated superior performance compared to several general-purpose large language models in imaging analysis and prescription generation. A randomized three-arm simulation study further revealed that collaboration between KOM and clinicians reduced total diagnostic and planning time by 38.5% and resulted in improved treatment quality compared to each approach used independently. These findings indicate that KOM could help facilitate automated KOA management and, when integrated into clinical workflows, has the potential to enhance care efficiency. The modular architecture of KOM may also offer valuable insights for developing AI-assisted management systems for other chronic conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "KOM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316KOA\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u63d0\u5347\u4e34\u5e8a\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u51cf\u5c1138.5%\u5de5\u4f5c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0bKOA\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5e72\u9884\u5b9e\u65bd\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4e34\u5e8a\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86KOM\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316KOA\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u5904\u65b9\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u4e09\u81c2\u968f\u673a\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "KOM\u5728\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5904\u65b9\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u534f\u4f5c\u53ef\u5c06\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1138.5%\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6cbb\u7597\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "KOM\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316KOA\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u5904\u65b9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5176\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u4e3a\u5176\u4ed6\u6162\u6027\u75c5\u7684AI\u8f85\u52a9\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9d\u8d35\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

Recently, since text-only CoT struggles to adequately capture scene details in complex spatial environments, a highly promising strategy involves leveraging visual priors to guide robotic action generation. Nevertheless, these strategies face two inherent challenges: (i) a modality gap between visual observations and low-level actions, and (ii) unstable training due to competing objectives between visual prediction and action generation. To address these challenges, we propose a Vision-Integrated Trajectory Alignment (VITA) framework that learns a shared discrete latent space for vision and action, enabling joint modeling of perception and motor control. VITA introduces a implicit visual CoT: autoregressively generated tokens is simultaneously decoded into future frames predictions and robot actions, thereby internalizing visual dynamics as an inductive bias for motion planning. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world environments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. VITA improves 14.5\\%, 9.6\\% and 12.1\\% over existing baselines on CALVIN, LIBERO and SimplerEnv.

Existing methods typically rely on extensive task-specific annotations and fine-tuning, limiting their ability to generalize effectively to novel or out-of-distribution scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce GroundingAgent, a novel agentic visual grounding framework that operates without any task-specific fine-tuning. GroundingAgent employs a structured, iterative reasoning mechanism that integrates pretrained open-vocabulary object detectors, multimodal large language models (MLLMs), and large language models (LLMs) to progressively refine candidate regions through joint semantic and spatial analyses. Remarkably, GroundingAgent achieves an average zero-shot grounding accuracy of 65.1 % on widely-used benchmarks (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg), entirely without fine-tuning. Furthermore, by substituting MLLM-generated captions with the original query texts, the accuracy at the selection stage alone reaches approximately 90 %, closely matching supervised performance and underscoring the critical role of LLM reasoning capabilities.

Existing query-dependent approaches rely on unstable textual feedback or black-box reward models, providing weak and uninterpretable optimization signals. More fundamentally, prompt quality itself lacks a unified, systematic definition, resulting in fragmented and unreliable evaluation signals. Our approach first establishes a performance-oriented, systematic, and comprehensive prompt evaluation framework. Furthermore, we develop and finetune an execution-free evaluator that predicts multi-dimensional quality scores directly from text. The evaluator then instructs a metric-aware optimizer that diagnoses failure modes and rewrites prompts in an interpretable, query-dependent manner. Our evaluator achieves the strongest accuracy in predicting prompt performance, and the evaluation-instructed optimization consistently surpass both static-template and query-dependent baselines across eight datasets and on three backbone models. Overall, we propose a unified, metric-grounded perspective on prompt quality, and demonstrated that our evaluation-instructed optimization pipeline delivers stable, interpretable, and model-agnostic improvements across diverse tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u7ef4\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u6570\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f18\u5316\u5355\u4e00\u7684\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7528\u6237\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u4f9d\u8d56\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6587\u672c\u53cd\u9988\u6216\u9ed1\u76d2\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u662f\u5f31\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u66f4\u6839\u672c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u662f\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u672c\u8eab\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u6563\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u9996\u5148\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee5\u6027\u80fd\u4e3a\u5bfc\u5411\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e14\u5168\u9762\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u968f\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u5fae\u8c03\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u6267\u884c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\uff0c\u8be5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u7ef4\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u6570\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u968f\u540e\u6307\u5bfc\u4e00\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u67e5\u8be2\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8bca\u65ad\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u91cd\u5199\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u677f\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u6807\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u5bfc\u4f18\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

The Sun is by far the largest energy source in our solar system, and thus it warrants consideration how future AI infrastructure could most efficiently tap into that power. This work explores a scalable compute system for machine learning in space, using fleets of satellites equipped with solar arrays, inter-satellite links using free-space optics, and Google tensor processing unit (TPU) accelerator chips. To facilitate high-bandwidth, low-latency inter-satellite communication, the satellites would be flown in close proximity. We illustrate the basic approach to formation flight via a 81-satellite cluster of 1 km radius, and describe an approach for using high-precision ML-based models to control large-scale constellations. Trillium TPUs are radiation tested. They survive a total ionizing dose equivalent to a 5 year mission life without permanent failures, and are characterized for bit-flip errors.

Existing compression methods often rely on heuristic importance metrics or empirical pruning rules, lacking theoretical guarantees about information preservation. In this work, we propose InfoPrune, an information-theoretic framework for adaptive structural compression of VLMs. Grounded in the Information Bottleneck principle, we formulate pruning as a trade-off between retaining task-relevant semantics and discarding redundant dependencies. To quantify the contribution of each attention head, we introduce an entropy-based effective rank (eRank) and employ the Kolmogorov--Smirnov (KS) distance to measure the divergence between original and compressed structures. This yields a unified criterion that jointly considers structural sparsity and informational efficiency. Building on this foundation, we further design two complementary schemes: (1) a training-based head pruning guided by the proposed information loss objective, and (2) a training-free FFN compression via adaptive low-rank approximation. Extensive experiments on VQAv2, TextVQA, and GQA demonstrate that InfoPrune achieves up to 3.2x FLOP reduction and 1.8x acceleration with negligible performance degradation, establishing a theoretically grounded and practically effective step toward efficient multimodal large models.", "AI": {"tldr": "InfoPrune\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u51fa\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7eRank\u548cKS\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f18\u5316\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u635f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u51fa\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u79e9\uff08eRank\uff09\u548cKolmogorov-Smirnov\u8ddd\u79bb\u91cf\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bad\u7ec3\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5934\u526a\u679d\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u7684FFN\u4f4e\u79e9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5728VQAv2\u3001TextVQA\u548cGQA\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cInfoPrune\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e863.2\u500d\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u548c1.8\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "InfoPrune \u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u539f\u5219\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u53bb\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Even still, measuring performance by a single scalar (be it reward or satisfaction probability) masks safety-performance trade-offs that arise in settings with a tolerable level of risk.\n  We address both limitations simultaneously by combining $\u03c9$-regular objectives with explicit constraints, allowing safety requirements and optimisation targets to be treated separately. We develop a model-based RL algorithm based on linear programming, which in the limit produces a policy maximising the probability of satisfying an $\u03c9$-regular objective while also adhering to $\u03c9$-regular constraints within specified thresholds.

Recent approaches have shifted from focusing solely on common scenarios to addressing complex, long-tail situations such as subtle human behaviors, traffic accidents, and non-compliant driving patterns. Given the demonstrated capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in understanding visual and natural language inputs and following instructions, recent methods have integrated LLMs into autonomous driving systems to enhance reasoning, interpretability, and performance across diverse scenarios. However, existing methods typically rely either on real-world data, which is suitable for industrial deployment, or on simulation data tailored to rare or hard case scenarios. Few approaches effectively integrate the complementary advantages of both data sources. To address this limitation, we propose a novel VLM-guided, end-to-end adversarial transfer framework for autonomous driving that transfers long-tail handling capabilities from simulation to real-world deployment, named CoC-VLA. The framework comprises a teacher VLM model, a student VLM model, and a discriminator. Both the teacher and student VLM models utilize a shared base architecture, termed the Chain-of-Causality Visual-Language Model (CoC VLM), which integrates temporal information via an end-to-end text adapter. This architecture supports chain-of-thought reasoning to infer complex driving logic. The teacher and student VLM models are pre-trained separately on simulated and real-world datasets.

We introduce the Eyelid Angle (ELA), a novel, reproducible metric of eye openness derived from 3D facial landmarks. Unlike conventional binary eye state estimators or 2D measures, such as the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), the ELA provides a stable geometric description of eyelid motion that is robust to variations in camera angle. Using the ELA, we design a blink detection framework that extracts temporal characteristics, including the closing, closed, and reopening durations, which are shown to correlate with drowsiness levels. To address the scarcity and risk of collecting natural drowsiness data, we further leverage ELA signals to animate rigged avatars in Blender 3D, enabling the creation of realistic synthetic datasets with controllable noise, camera viewpoints, and blink dynamics. Experimental results in public driver monitoring datasets demonstrate that the ELA offers lower variance under viewpoint changes compared to EAR and achieves accurate blink detection. At the same time, synthetic augmentation expands the diversity of training data for drowsiness recognition. Our findings highlight the ELA as both a reliable biometric measure and a powerful tool for generating scalable datasets in driver state monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u773c\u7751\u89d2\u5ea6\uff08ELA\uff09\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u75b2\u52b3\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u75b2\u52b3\u5bf9\u63d0\u9ad8\u9053\u8def\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u7ea7\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08ADAS\uff09\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc73D\u9762\u90e8\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\u63d0\u53d6\u773c\u7751\u89d2\u5ea6\uff08ELA\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7728\u773c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u75b2\u52b3\u6c34\u5e73\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5229\u7528ELA\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728Blender 3D\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u753b\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u63a7\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u76f8\u673a\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u7728\u773c\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5171\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u76d1\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0cELA\u5728\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u6bd4EAR\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7728\u773c\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u75b2\u52b3\u8bc6\u522b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ELA\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u751f\u7269\u7279\u5f81\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u662f\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u72b6\u6001\u76d1\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

This paper introduces MicroSims a novel framework for creating lightweight, interactive educational simulations that can be rapidly generated using artificial intelligence, universally embedded across digital learning platforms, and easily customized without programming knowledge. MicroSims occupy a unique position at the intersection of three key innovations: (1) standardized design patterns that enable AI-assisted generation, (2) iframe-based architecture that provides universal embedding and sandboxed security, and (3) transparent, modifiable code that supports customization and pedagogical transparency. We present a comprehensive framework encompassing design principles, technical architecture, metadata standards, and development workflows. Drawing on empirical research from physics education studies and meta-analyses across STEM disciplines, we demonstrate that interactive simulations can improve conceptual understanding by up to 30-40\\% compared to traditional instruction. MicroSims extend these benefits while addressing persistent barriers of cost, technical complexity, and platform dependence. This work has significant implications for educational equity, and low-cost intelligent interactive textbooks that enabling educators worldwide to create customized, curriculum-aligned simulations on demand.

However, workflow scheduling on HPC infrastructures remains challenging due to the prevalence of non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architectures. These systems require schedulers to account for data locality not only across distributed environments but also within each node. Modern HPC nodes integrate multiple NUMA domains and heterogeneous memory regions, such as high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and DRAM, and frequently attach accelerators (GPUs or FPGAs) and network interface cards (NICs) to specific NUMA nodes. This design increases the variability of data-access latency and complicates the placement of both tasks and data. Despite these constraints, most workflow scheduling strategies were originally developed for Grid or Cloud environments and rarely incorporate NUMA-aware considerations. To address this gap, this work introduces nFlows, a NUMA-aware Workflow Execution Runtime System that enables the modeling, bare-metal execution, simulation, and validation of scheduling algorithms for data-intensive workflows on NUMA-based HPC systems. The system's design, implementation, and validation methodology are presented. nFlows supports the construction of simulation models and their direct execution on physical systems, enabling studies of NUMA effects on scheduling, the design of NUMA-aware algorithms, the analysis of data-movement behavior, the identification of performance bottlenecks, and the exploration of in-memory workflow execution.", "AI": {"tldr": "nFlows\u662f\u4e00\u4e2aNUMA\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6267\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86HPC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2dNUMA\u67b6\u6784\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u79d1\u5b66\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u4f9d\u8d56HPC\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0cNUMA\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u4f7f\u5f97\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u8c03\u5ea6\u9762\u4e34\u65b0\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651NUMA\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u653e\u7f6e\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86nFlows\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u652f\u6301\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u62df\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5728\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u76f4\u63a5\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u4ee5\u7814\u7a76NUMA\u5bf9\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1NUMA\u611f\u77e5\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u79fb\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a2\u7d22\u5185\u5b58\u4e2d\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "nFlows\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301NUMA-aware\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u8c03\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6267\u884c\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316HPC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "nFlows\u662f\u4e00\u4e2aNUMA\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6267\u884c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3HPC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8eNUMA\u67b6\u6784\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u6311\u6218\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u652f\u6301\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u88f8\u673a\u6267\u884c\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5728NUMA-based HPC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Existing approaches typically model it as a discrete and static process, while real-world applications involve continuous gravity-driven interactions. This idealized simplification leads to infeasible deployments (e.g., unstable packing) in practice. Simulations with physical engine offer an opportunity to emulate continuous gravity effects, enabling the training of reinforcement learning (RL) agents to address such limitations and improve packing stability. However, a simulation-to-reality gap persists due to dynamic variations in physical properties of real-world objects, such as various friction coefficients, elasticity, and non-uniform weight distributions. To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid RL framework that collaborates with physical simulation with real-world data feedback. Firstly, domain randomization is applied during simulation to expose agents to a spectrum of physical parameters, enhancing their generalization capability. Secondly, the RL agent is fine-tuned with real-world deployment feedback, further reducing collapse rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves lower collapse rates in both simulated and real-world scenarios. Large-scale deployments in logistics systems validate the practical effectiveness, with a 35\\% reduction in packing collapse compared to baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Hybrid RL framework with simulation randomization and real-world feedback reduces packing collapse by 35%, addressing the gap between idealized models and practical dynamics.", "motivation": "Existing approaches oversimplify the 3D bin packing problem as discrete/static, leading to unstable packing in practice due to ignoring continuous gravity effects and real-world physical variations.", "method": "A hybrid RL framework combining domain randomization during simulation and fine-tuning with real-world feedback to address dynamic physical variations.", "result": "Extensive experiments show lower collapse rates in both simulated and real-world scenarios, with significant practical improvements in logistics systems.", "conclusion": "The proposed hybrid RL framework effectively bridges the simulation-to-reality gap, achieving a 35% reduction in packing collapse rates compared to baseline methods, as validated by large-scale logistics deployments."}}

However, most of them adopt static and non-learnable tool invocation mechanisms, which limit the discovery of diverse clues essential for robust perception and reasoning regarding temporally or spatially complex videos. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Multi-agent system for video understanding, namely VideoChat-M1. Instead of using a single or fixed policy, VideoChat-M1 adopts a distinct Collaborative Policy Planning (CPP) paradigm with multiple policy agents, which comprises three key processes. (1) Policy Generation: Each agent generates its unique tool invocation policy tailored to the user's query; (2) Policy Execution: Each agent sequentially invokes relevant tools to execute its policy and explore the video content; (3) Policy Communication: During the intermediate stages of policy execution, agents interact with one another to update their respective policies. Through this collaborative framework, all agents work in tandem, dynamically refining their preferred policies based on contextual insights from peers to effectively respond to the user's query. Moreover, we equip our CPP paradigm with a concise Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) method. Consequently, the team of policy agents can be jointly optimized to enhance VideoChat-M1's performance, guided by both the final answer reward and intermediate collaborative process feedback. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoChat-M1 achieves SOTA performance across eight benchmarks spanning four tasks.

Six-axis force-torque sensors are commonly used to obtain contact feedback, but their high cost and fragility have discouraged many researchers from adopting them in contact-rich tasks. To offer a more cost-efficient and easy-accessible source of contact feedback, we present ShapeForce, a low-cost, plug-and-play soft wrist that provides force-like signals for contact-rich robotic manipulation. Inspired by how humans rely on relative force changes in contact rather than precise force magnitudes, ShapeForce converts external force and torque into measurable deformations of its compliant core, which are then estimated via marker-based pose tracking and converted into force-like signals. Our design eliminates the need for calibration or specialized electronics to obtain exact values, and instead focuses on capturing force and torque changes sufficient for enabling contact-rich manipulation. Extensive experiments across diverse contact-rich tasks and manipulation policies demonstrate that ShapeForce delivers performance comparable to six-axis force-torque sensors at an extremely low cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "ShapeForce \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8f6f\u624b\u8155\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5f62\u6d4b\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u7c7b\u529b\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u516d\u8f74\u529b\u626d\u77e9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u516d\u8f74\u529b\u626d\u77e9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u867d\u7136\u5e38\u7528\u4e8e\u63a5\u89e6\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6613\u635f\u6027\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u63a5\u89e6\u5bc6\u96c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0cShapeForce \u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7ecf\u6d4e\u3001\u6613\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "ShapeForce \u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5916\u529b\u626d\u77e9\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5176\u67d4\u6027\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u53d8\u5f62\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6280\u672f\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u5f62\uff0c\u5e76\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7c7b\u529b\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cShapeForce \u5728\u591a\u79cd\u63a5\u89e6\u5bc6\u96c6\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u6781\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "ShapeForce \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u516d\u8f74\u529b\u626d\u77e9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u63a5\u89e6\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

While this form of reasoning is fundamental to human cognition, current vision-language benchmarks lack comprehensive evaluation of this ability and instead focus on surface-level recognition or image-text alignment.\n  To address this gap, we introduce Perceptual Taxonomy, a benchmark for physically grounded visual reasoning. We annotate 3173 objects with four property families covering 84 fine-grained attributes. Using these annotations, we construct a multiple-choice question benchmark with 5802 images across both synthetic and real domains. The benchmark contains 28033 template-based questions spanning four types (object description, spatial reasoning, property matching, and taxonomy reasoning), along with 50 expert-crafted questions designed to evaluate models across the full spectrum of perceptual taxonomy reasoning.\n  Experimental results show that leading vision-language models perform well on recognition tasks but degrade by 10 to 20 percent on property-driven questions, especially those requiring multi-step reasoning over structured attributes. These findings highlight a persistent gap in structured visual understanding and the limitations of current models that rely heavily on pattern matching.

GSES responses were highly stable across repeated administrations and randomized item orders. However, models showed significantly different self-efficacy levels across conditions, with aggregate scores lower than human norms. All models achieved perfect accuracy on computational and social questions, whereas summarization performance varied widely. Self-assessment did not reliably reflect ability: several low-scoring models performed accurately, while some high-scoring models produced weaker summaries. Follow-up confidence prompts yielded modest, mostly downward revisions, suggesting mild overestimation in first-pass assessments.

The online construction of HD maps offers a scalable approach to generate local maps from on-board sensors. However, existing methods typically rely on costly 3D map annotations for training, which limits their generalization and scalability across diverse driving environments. In this work, we propose MapRF, a weakly supervised framework that learns to construct 3D maps using only 2D image labels. To generate high-quality pseudo labels, we introduce a novel Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) module conditioned on map predictions, which reconstructs view-consistent 3D geometry and semantics. These pseudo labels are then iteratively used to refine the map network in a self-training manner, enabling progressive improvement without additional supervision. Furthermore, to mitigate error accumulation during self-training, we propose a Map-to-Ray Matching strategy that aligns map predictions with camera rays derived from 2D labels. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2 and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that MapRF achieves performance comparable to fully supervised methods, attaining around 75% of the baseline while surpassing several approaches using only 2D labels. This highlights the potential of MapRF to enable scalable and cost-effective online HD map construction for autonomous driving.", "AI": {"tldr": "MapRF\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ec5\u75282D\u56fe\u50cf\u6807\u7b7e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7NeRF\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u7ebf\u9ad8\u6e05\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u76843D\u5730\u56fe\u6807\u6ce8\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9a7e\u9a76\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMapRF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6761\u4ef6NeRF\u6a21\u5757\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Map-to-Ray\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u51cf\u5c11\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002", "result": "\u5728Argoverse 2\u548cnuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMapRF\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u57fa\u7ebf\u7ea675%\uff0c\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75282D\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MapRF\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75282D\u56fe\u50cf\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u9ad8\u6e05\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To tackle these problems, we propose RPM-MCTS, an effective method that utilizes Knowledge-Retrieval as Process Reward Model based on Monte Carlo Tree Search to evaluate intermediate algorithmic steps. By utilizing knowledge base retrieval, RPM-MCTS avoids the complex training of process reward models. During the expansion phase, similarity filtering is employed to remove redundant nodes, ensuring diversity in reasoning paths. Furthermore, our method utilizes sandbox execution feedback to locate erroneous algorithmic steps during generation, enabling timely and targeted corrections. Extensive experiments on four public code generation benchmarks demonstrate that RPM-MCTS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods while achieving an approximately 15% reduction in token consumption.

While cloud-native RDBMSs provide elastic computing resources via disaggregated computing and storage, storage costs remain a critical user concern. Consequently, data compression emerges as an effective strategy to reduce storage costs. However, existing compression approaches in RDBMSs present a stark trade-off: software-based approaches incur significant performance overheads, while hardware-based alternatives lack the flexibility required for diverse database workloads. In this paper, we present PolarStore, a compressed shared storage system for cloud-native RDBMSs. PolarStore employs a dual-layer compression mechanism that combines in-storage compression in PolarCSD hardware with lightweight compression in software. This design leverages the strengths of both approaches. PolarStore also incorporates database-oriented optimizations to maintain high performance on critical I/O paths. Drawing from large-scale deployment experiences, we also introduce hardware improvements for PolarCSD to ensure host-level stability and propose a compression-aware scheduling scheme to improve cluster-level space efficiency. PolarStore is currently deployed on thousands of storage servers within PolarDB, managing over 100 PB of data. It achieves a compression ratio of 3.55 and reduces storage costs by approximately 60%. Remarkably, these savings are achieved while maintaining performance comparable to uncompressed clusters.", "AI": {"tldr": "PolarStore\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e91\u539f\u751fRDBMS\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u5171\u4eab\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u538b\u7f29\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e91\u539f\u751fRDBMS\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\u4ecd\u662f\u7528\u6237\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u91cd\u70b9\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "PolarStore\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5c42\u538b\u7f29\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408PolarCSD\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u5185\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5173\u952eI/O\u8def\u5f84\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "PolarStore\u5df2\u5728PolarDB\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u7ba1\u7406\u8d85\u8fc7100 PB\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u8fbe3.55\uff0c\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea660%\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u672a\u538b\u7f29\u96c6\u7fa4\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "PolarStore\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u538b\u7f29\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4e91\u539f\u751fRDBMS\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4e0e\u672a\u538b\u7f29\u96c6\u7fa4\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Vidi models continue to evolve toward next-generation video creation and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in multimodal temporal retrieval (TR). In its second release, Vidi2 advances video understanding with fine-grained spatio-temporal grounding (STG) and extends its capability to video question answering (Video QA), enabling comprehensive multimodal reasoning. Given a text query, Vidi2 can identify not only the corresponding timestamps but also the bounding boxes of target objects within the output time ranges. This end-to-end spatio-temporal grounding capability enables potential applications in complex editing scenarios, such as plot or character understanding, automatic multi-view switching, and intelligent, composition-aware reframing and cropping. To enable comprehensive evaluation of STG in practical settings, we introduce a new benchmark, VUE-STG, which offers four key improvements over existing STG datasets: 1) Video duration: spans from roughly 10s to 30 mins, enabling long-context reasoning; 2) Query format: queries are mostly converted into noun phrases while preserving sentence-level expressiveness; 3) Annotation quality: all ground-truth time ranges and bounding boxes are manually annotated with high accuracy; 4) Evaluation metric: a refined vIoU/tIoU/vIoU-Intersection scheme. In addition, we upgrade the previous VUE-TR benchmark to VUE-TR-V2, achieving a more balanced video-length distribution and more user-style queries. Remarkably, the Vidi2 model substantially outperforms leading proprietary systems, such as Gemini 3 Pro (Preview) and GPT-5, on both VUE-TR-V2 and VUE-STG, while achieving competitive results with popular open-source models with similar scale on video QA benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Vidi2\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65f6\u7a7a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e13\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u7ade\u4e89\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u89c6\u9891\u6210\u4e3a\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u521b\u4f5c\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5a92\u4ecb\uff0c\u5bf9\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u4ea7\u9700\u6c42\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86Vidi\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "Vidi2\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6VUE-STG\u548c\u5347\u7ea7\u7684VUE-TR-V2\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "Vidi2\u5728VUE-TR-V2\u548cVUE-STG\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eGemini 3 Pro\u548cGPT-5\u7b49\u4e13\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e0e\u7c7b\u4f3c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u7ade\u4e89\u3002", "conclusion": "Vidi2\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff08STG\uff09\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\uff08Video QA\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4e3b\u6d41\u4e13\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u7ade\u4e89\u6fc0\u70c8\u3002"}}

However, there is evidence that current semantic similarity methods may capture syntactic or lexical forms over semantic content. While benchmarks exist for semantic equivalence, they often suffer from high generation costs due to reliance on subjective human judgment, limited availability for domain-specific applications, and unclear definitions of equivalence. This paper introduces a novel method for generating benchmarks to evaluate semantic similarity methods for LLM outputs, specifically addressing these limitations. Our approach leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to generate pairs of natural-language statements that are semantically similar or dissimilar, with dissimilar pairs categorized into one of four sub-types. We generate benchmark datasets in four different domains (general knowledge, biomedicine, finance, biology), and conduct a comparative study of semantic similarity methods including traditional natural language processing scores and LLM-as-a-judge predictions. We observe that the sub-type of semantic variation, as well as the domain of the benchmark impact the performance of semantic similarity methods, with no method being consistently superior. Our results present important implications for the use of LLM-as-a-judge in detecting the semantic content of text.

A generic control framework is therefore essential, and a key obstacle lies in the persistent use of rigid-body control logic, which relies on precise models and strict low-level execution. Such a paradigm is effective for rigid robots but fails for soft robots, where the ability to tolerate and exploit approximate action representations, i.e., control compliance, is the basis of robustness and adaptability rather than a disturbance to be eliminated. Control should thus shift from suppressing compliance to explicitly exploiting it. Human motor control exemplifies this principle: instead of computing exact dynamics or issuing detailed muscle-level commands, it expresses intention through high-level movement tendencies, while reflexes and biomechanical mechanisms autonomously resolve local details. This architecture enables robustness, flexibility, and cross-task generalization. Motivated by this insight, we propose a generic soft-robot control framework grounded in control compliance and validate it across robots with diverse morphologies and actuation mechanisms. The results demonstrate stable, safe, and cross-platform transferable behavior, indicating that embracing control compliance, rather than resisting it, may provide a widely applicable foundation for unified soft-robot control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236\u987a\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6563\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u521a\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u63a7\u5236\u987a\u5e94\u6027\u800c\u975e\u6291\u5236\u5b83\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236\u987a\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u4e14\u53ef\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a5\u53d7\u800c\u975e\u62b5\u6297\u63a7\u5236\u987a\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Using this taxonomy, we analyze the growing gap in evaluation and monitoring practices: existing benchmarks measure knowledge or reasoning but provide little insight into stability, reproducibility, drift, or workflow integration. We further examine the production challenges associated with deploying LLMs - including observability limitations, cost constraints, and update-induced regressions - and outline high-level design principles for building reliable, maintainable, and cost-aware LLM systems. Finally, we outline high-level design principles for building reliable, maintainable, and cost-aware LLM-based systems.

While LLMs offer promise for automation, both general-purpose and finetuned LLMs suffer from two fundamental and conflicting limitations: correctness and efficiency. The key reason is that existing LLM-based approaches directly generate the entire optimized low-level programs, requiring exploration of an extremely vast space encompassing both optimization policies and implementation codes. To address the challenge of exploring an intractable space, we propose Macro Thinking Micro Coding (MTMC), a hierarchical framework inspired by the staged optimization strategy of human experts. It decouples optimization strategy from implementation details, ensuring efficiency through high-level strategy and correctness through low-level implementation. Specifically, Macro Thinking employs reinforcement learning to guide lightweight LLMs in efficiently exploring and learning semantic optimization strategies that maximize hardware utilization. Micro Coding leverages general-purpose LLMs to incrementally implement the stepwise optimization proposals from Macro Thinking, avoiding full-kernel generation errors. Together, they effectively navigate the vast optimization space and intricate implementation details, enabling LLMs for high-performance GPU kernel generation. Comprehensive results on widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of MTMC on GPU kernel generation in both accuracy and running time. On KernelBench, MTMC achieves near 100% and 70% accuracy at Levels 1-2 and 3, over 50% than SOTA general-purpose and domain-finetuned LLMs, with up to 7.3x speedup over LLMs, and 2.2x over expert-optimized PyTorch Eager kernels.

However, achieving robust and precise motion with strong force interaction remains a significant challenge. Based on the above limitations, this paper proposes HAFO, a dual-agent reinforcement learning control framework that simultaneously optimizes both a robust locomotion strategy and a precise upper-body manipulation strategy through coupled training under external force interaction environments. Simultaneously, we explicitly model the external pulling disturbances through a spring-damper system and achieve fine-grained force control by manipulating the virtual spring. During this process, the reinforcement-learning policy spontaneously generates disturbance-rejection response by exploiting environmental feedback. Moreover, HAFO employs an asymmetric Actor-Critic framework in which the Critic-network access to privileged spring-damping forces guides the actor-network to learn a generalizable, robust policy for resisting external disturbances. The experimental results demonstrate that HAFO achieves stable control of humanoid robot under various strong force interactions, showing remarkable performance in load tasks and ensuring stable robot operation under rope tension disturbances.

Heritage institutions worldwide have digitized more than one million maps, and automated techniques now enable large-scale recognition and extraction of map content. Yet these methods have engaged little with the history of cartography, or the view that maps are semantic-symbolic systems, and cultural objects reflecting political and epistemic expectations. This work leverages a diverse corpus of 771,561 map records and 99,715 digitized images aggregated from 38 digital catalogs. After normalization, the dataset includes 236,925 contributors and spans six centuries, from 1492 to 1948. These data make it possible to chart geographic structures and the global chronology of map publication. The spatial focus of cartography is analyzed in relation to political dynamics, evidencing links between Atlantic maritime charting, the triangular trade, and colonial expansion. Further results document the progression of national, domestic focus and the impact of military conflicts on publication volumes. The research introduces semantic segmentation techniques and object detection models for the generic recognition of land classes and cartographic signs, trained on annotated data and synthetic images. The analysis of land classes shows that maps are designed images whose framing and composition emphasize features through centering and semantic symmetries. The study of cartographic figuration encodes 63 M signs and 25 M fragments into a latent visual space, revealing figurative shifts such as the replacement of relief hachures by terrain contours and showing that signs tend to form locally consistent systems.

Despite impressive performance, existing multi-agent systems inherently incur substantial token overhead and increased computational costs, posing challenges for large-scale deployment. To address these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Multi-agent hierarchical communication graph PRUNING framework, termed M$^3$Prune. Our framework eliminates redundant edges across different modalities, achieving an optimal balance between task performance and token overhead. Specifically, M$^3$Prune first applies intra-modal graph sparsification to textual and visual modalities, identifying the edges most critical for solving the task. Subsequently, we construct a dynamic communication topology using these key edges for inter-modal graph sparsification. Finally, we progressively prune redundant edges to obtain a more efficient and hierarchical topology.

Although high-bandwidth memory (HBM) on GPUs offers fast access, its limited capacity necessitates reliance on host memory (CPU DRAM) to support larger working sets such as the KVCache. However, the maximum DRAM capacity is constrained by the limited number of memory channels per CPU socket. To overcome this limitation, current systems often adopt RDMA-based disaggregated memory pools, which introduce significant challenges including high access latency, complex communication protocols, and synchronization overhead. Fortunately, the emerging CXL technology introduces new opportunities in KVCache design. In this paper, we propose Beluga, a novel memory architecture that enables GPUs and CPUs to access a shared, large-scale memory pool through CXL switches. By supporting native load/store access semantics over the CXL fabric, our design delivers near-local memory latency, while reducing programming complexity and minimizing synchronization overhead. We conduct a systematic characterization of a commercial CXL switch-based memory pool and propose a set of design guidelines. Based on Beluga, we design and implement Beluga-KVCache, a system tailored for managing the large-scale KVCache in LLM inference. Beluga-KVCache achieves an 89.6% reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and 7.35x throughput improvement in the vLLM inference engine compared to RDMA-based solutions.

Existing approaches to GS deformation typically rely on deformation proxies such as cages or meshes, but they suffer from dependency on proxy quality and additional computational overhead. An alternative is to directly apply Laplacian-based deformation techniques by treating splats as point clouds. However, this often fail to properly capture surface information due to lack of explicit structure. To address this, we propose a novel method that constructs a surface-aware splat graph, enabling the Laplacian operator derived from it to support more plausible deformations that preserve details and topology. Our key idea is to leverage the spatial arrangement encoded in splats, defining neighboring splats not merely by the distance between their centers, but by their intersections. Furthermore, we introduce a Gaussian kernel adaptation technique that preserves surface structure under deformation, thereby improving rendering quality after deformation. In our experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to both proxy-based and proxy-free baselines, evaluated on 50 challenging objects from the ShapeNet, Objaverse, and Sketchfab datasets, as well as the NeRF-Synthetic dataset.

We revisit this bottleneck through the lens of speculation. While traditional predict-verify speculation paradigm can break serial execution, its benefit remains limited, as it retains the full original workload and adds extra inference overhead. We observe that early agent steps often involve simple evidence-gathering, where correct actions can often be predicted without full reasoning. Building on these observations, we present SPAgent, an algorithm-system co-design framework that expands the role of speculation in search agents to reduce latency. Algorithmically, SPAgent introduces a two-phase adaptive speculation mechanism that selectively omits verification when safe. System-wise, a two-level scheduler regulates speculative requests based on engine load to ensure speculation remains beneficial. We implement SPAgent in real-world systems.

This study explores human-robot interactions during handover tasks using Virtual Reality (VR) to investigate differences in human motor performance across various task dynamics and robot kinematics. A VR-based robot handover simulation afforded safe and controlled assessments of human-robot interactions. In separate experiments, four potential influences on human performance were examined (1) control over task initiation and robot movement synchrony (temporal and spatiotemporal); (2) partner appearance (human versus robotic); (3) robot velocity profiles (minimum jerk, constant velocity, constant acceleration, and biphasic); and (4) the timing of rotational object motion. Findings across experiments emphasize humans benefit from robots providing early and salient visual information about task-relevant object motion, and advantages of human-like smooth robot trajectories. To varying degrees, these manipulations improved predictive accuracy and synchronization during interaction. This suggests that human-robot interactions should be designed to allow humans to leverage their natural capabilities for detecting biological motion, which conversely may reduce the need for costly robotic computations or added cognitive adaptation on the human side.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7VR\u6a21\u62df\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ea4\u63a5\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u672f\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u5de5\u4f5c\u573a\u6240\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\uff08VR\uff09\u6280\u672f\u6a21\u62df\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ea4\u63a5\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e9\u671f\u548c\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7269\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u4eba\u7c7b\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e94\u5141\u8bb8\u4eba\u7c7b\u5229\u7528\u5176\u81ea\u7136\u80fd\u529b\u68c0\u6d4b\u751f\u7269\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8ba1\u7b97\u6216\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Recent AI-based frameworks have been developed to analyze large volumes of aerial imagery collected by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, providing actionable insights rapidly. However, creating and annotating data for training these models is costly and time-consuming, resulting in datasets that are limited in size and diversity. Furthermore, most existing approaches rely on traditional classification-based frameworks with fixed answer spaces, restricting their ability to provide new information without additional data collection or model retraining. Using pre-trained generative models built on in-context learning (ICL) allows for flexible and open-ended answer spaces. However, these models often generate hallucinated outputs or produce generic responses that lack domain-specific relevance. To address these limitations, we propose ThiFAN-VQA, a two-stage reasoning-based framework for visual question answering (VQA) in disaster scenarios. ThiFAN-VQA first generates structured reasoning traces using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and ICL to enable interpretable reasoning under limited supervision.

This paper proposes an optimized hybrid K-means clustering and Genetic Algorithm (SK-means GA) to improve the pilot assignment efficiency, achieving a 29.3% reduction in convergence time (82s vs. 116s for conventional GA). A parallel implementation (PK-means GA) is developed on an FPGA using Vivado High-Level Synthesis Tools (HLST) to further enhance the run-time performance, accelerating convergence to 3.5 milliseconds. Within Vivado implementation, different optimization techniques such as loop unrolling, pipelining, and function inlining are applied to realize the reported speedup.

The architecture comprises a Native Vision Transformer (ViT) and a lightweight LLM connected via an MLP adapter. HunyuanOCR demonstrates superior performance, outperforming commercial APIs, traditional pipelines, and larger models (e.g., Qwen3-VL-4B). Specifically, it surpasses current public solutions in perception tasks (Text Spotting, Parsing) and excels in semantic tasks (IE, Text Image Translation), securing first place in the ICDAR 2025 DIMT Challenge (Small Model Track). Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on OCRBench among VLMs with fewer than 3B parameters.\n  HunyuanOCR achieves breakthroughs in three key aspects: 1) Unifying Versatility and Efficiency: We implement comprehensive support for core capabilities including spotting, parsing, IE, VQA, and translation within a lightweight framework. This addresses the limitations of narrow \"OCR expert models\" and inefficient \"General VLMs\". 2) Streamlined End-to-End Architecture: Adopting a pure end-to-end paradigm eliminates dependencies on pre-processing modules (e.g., layout analysis). This fundamentally resolves error propagation common in traditional pipelines and simplifies system deployment. 3) Data-Driven and RL Strategies: We confirm the critical role of high-quality data and, for the first time in the industry, demonstrate that Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategies yield significant performance gains in OCR tasks.\n  HunyuanOCR is officially open-sourced on HuggingFace. We also provide a high-performance deployment solution based on vLLM, placing its production efficiency in the top tier.

Through a stack-based reasoning structure and a modular MCP-compatible tool suite, VICoT enables LLMs to efficiently perform multi-round, interleaved vision-language reasoning tasks with strong generalization and flexibility.We also propose the Reasoning Stack distillation method to migrate complex Agent behaviors to small, lightweight models, which ensures the reasoning capability while significantly reducing complexity.

In particular, our approach introduces new and efficient methods for view generation and selection of viewpoint candidates that are adaptive to the user-defined quality requirements, fully exploiting the uncertainty encoded in a Truncated Signed Distance field (TSDF) representation of the environment. This results in informed and efficient exploration decisions tailored towards the predetermined objective. Finally, we validate our method via extensive simulations in realistic environments.

Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) serves as the frontline imaging tool, yet it often fails to reveal the subtle ischemic changes present in the early, hyperacute phase. This limitation can delay crucial interventions. To address this diagnostic challenge, we introduce a semi-supervised segmentation method using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to accurately delineate early ischemic stroke regions. The proposed method employs an adversarial framework to effectively learn from a limited number of annotated NCCT scans, while simultaneously leveraging a larger pool of unlabeled scans. By employing Dice loss, cross-entropy loss, a feature matching loss and a self-training loss, the model learns to identify and delineate early infarcts, even when they are faint or their size is small. Experiments on the publicly available Acute Ischemic Stroke Dataset (AISD) demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to enhance diagnostic capabilities, reduce the burden of manual annotation, and support more efficient clinical decision-making in stroke care.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eGANs\u7684\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u65e9\u671f\u7f3a\u8840\u6027\u5352\u4e2d\u7684NCCT\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u975e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u589e\u5f3aCT\uff08NCCT\uff09\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u7f3a\u8840\u6027\u5352\u4e2d\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u663e\u793a\u7ec6\u5fae\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5173\u952e\u5e72\u9884\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GANs\uff09\u7684\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Dice\u635f\u5931\u3001\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u5339\u914d\u635f\u5931\u548c\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6807\u6ce8NCCT\u626b\u63cf\u548c\u5927\u91cf\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u626b\u63cf\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u7684AISD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u52fe\u753b\u65e9\u671f\u6897\u6b7b\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7GANs\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e9\u671f\u7f3a\u8840\u6027\u5352\u4e2d\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

However, real-time adaptability in dynamic environments remains a critical challenge for autonomous navigation, particularly when robots must generate collision-free, smooth, and efficient trajectories under complex constraints. By analyzing the difficulties in dynamic path planning, the Wind Driven Optimization (WDO) algorithm emerges as a promising framework owing to its physically interpretable search dynamics. Motivated by these observations, this work revisits the WDO principle and proposes a variant formulation, Multi-hierarchical adaptive wind driven optimization(MAWDO), that improves adaptability and robustness in time-varying environments. To mitigate instability and premature convergence, a hierarchical-guidance mechanism divides the population into multiple groups guided by individual, regional, and global leaders to balance exploration and exploitation. Extensive evaluations on sixteen benchmark functions show that MAWDO achieves superior optimization accuracy, convergence stability, and adaptability over state-of-the art metaheuristics. In dynamic path planning, MAWDO shortens the path length to 469.28 pixels, improving over Multi-strategy ensemble wind driven optimization(MEWDO), Adaptive wind driven optimization(AWDO) and WDO by 3.51\\%, 11.63\\% and 14.93\\%, and achieves the smallest optimality gap (1.01) with smoothness 0.71 versus 13.50 and 15.67 for AWDO and WDO, leading to smoother, shorter, and collision-free trajectories that confirm its effectiveness for real-time path planning in complex environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "MAWDO\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u6539\u8fdb\u98ce\u9a71\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u77ed\u3001\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u662f\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u98ce\u9a71\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\uff08WDO\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u65e9\u719f\u6536\u655b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u5c42\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u98ce\u9a71\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\uff08MAWDO\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u79cd\u7fa4\u5206\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u7ec4\uff0c\u7531\u4e2a\u4f53\u3001\u533a\u57df\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "result": "MAWDO\u572816\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u6536\u655b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\uff0cMAWDO\u5c06\u8def\u5f84\u957f\u5ea6\u7f29\u77ed\u81f3469.28\u50cf\u7d20\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eMEWDO\u3001AWDO\u548cWDO\uff0c\u4e14\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u6700\u5c0f\uff081.01\uff09\uff0c\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\u4e3a0.71\u3002", "conclusion": "MAWDO\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u77ed\u3001\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e14\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u3002"}}

Imaging Systems and Techniques (IST 2025), Strasburg, France", "summary": "Gastrointestinal (GI) imaging via Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) generates a large number of images requiring manual screening. Deep learning-based Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems can assist screening, yet their performance relies on the existence of large, diverse, training medical datasets. However, the scarcity of such data, due to privacy constraints and annotation costs, hinders CDS development. Generative machine learning offers a viable solution to combat this limitation. While current Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) methods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks and Variational Autoencoders have been explored, they often face challenges with training stability and capturing sufficient visual diversity, especially when synthesizing abnormal findings. This work introduces a novel VAE-based methodology for medical image synthesis and presents its application for the generation of WCE images. The novel contributions of this work include a) multiscale extension of the Vector Quantized VAE model, named as Multiscale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MSVQ-VAE); b) unlike other VAE-based SDG models for WCE image generation, MSVQ-VAE is used to seamlessly introduce abnormalities into normal WCE images; c) it enables conditional generation of synthetic images, enabling the introduction of different types of abnormalities into the normal WCE images; d) it performs experiments with a variety of abnormality types, including polyps, vascular and inflammatory conditions. The utility of the generated images for CDS is assessed via image classification. Comparative experiments demonstrate that training a CDS classifier using the abnormal images generated by the proposed methodology yield comparable results with a classifier trained with only real data. The generality of the proposed methodology promises its applicability to various domains related to medical multimedia.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMSVQ-VAE\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u5e26\u5f02\u5e38\u7684WCE\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3CDS\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u5ab2\u7f8e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u56e0\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347CDS\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eVAE\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08MSVQ-VAE\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210WCE\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u591f\u65e0\u7f1d\u5f15\u5165\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528MSVQ-VAE\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u56fe\u50cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684CDS\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MSVQ-VAE\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5e26\u6709\u5f02\u5e38\u7684WCE\u56fe\u50cf\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3CDS\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Although existing unlearning methods can remove such knowledge, they fail to achieve benign forgetting because they often degrade the model's general image understanding performance. To address this, we propose the Sculpted Memory Forgetting Adapter (SMFA), which confines forgetting to targeted memory regions while preserving overall capabilities. SMFA first fine-tunes the model to replace sensitive responses with refusals, yielding a memory forgetting adapter, and then applies a retaining anchor-guided masking mechanism to prevent interference with unrelated knowledge and understanding ability. To systematically evaluate selective MLLM unlearning, we introduce S-MLLMUn Bench, the first benchmark designed to jointly assess the removal of sensitive knowledge and retention of general visual understanding.

We introduce SkillSight for power-efficient skill assessment from first-person data. Central to our approach is the hypothesis that skill level is evident not only in how a person performs an activity (video), but also in how they direct their attention when doing so (gaze). Our two-stage framework first learns to jointly model gaze and egocentric video when predicting skill level, then distills a gaze-only student model. At inference, the student model requires only gaze input, drastically reducing power consumption by eliminating continuous video processing.

We propose a simple yet effective framework that unifies improvements across both GPU Track and API Track. Our method centers on two key components. First, Context Engineering applies dynamic tool pruning and persona clipping for input compression, combined with post-processing techniques such as parameter normalization and function merging. Together with manually refined prompts, this design improves tool call stability, execution reliability, and role-playing guidance. Second, in the GPU Track, we further adopt GRPO training, replacing supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning directly optimized by reward signals. This mitigates small-sample overfitting and significantly enhances task-oriented dialogue performance. In the final evaluation, our team ranks 1st in Task 2 API, 2nd in Task 1 API, and 3rd in both Task 3 API and GPU track, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Methods: We proposed a semantic distribution-guided reconstruction framework that uses a pre-trained vision-language foundation model to encode both the reconstructed image and auxiliary information into high-level semantic features. A contrastive objective aligns the reconstructed representation with the target semantic distribution, ensuring consistency with high-level perceptual cues. The proposed objective works with various deep learning-based reconstruction methods and can flexibly incorporate semantic priors from multimodal sources. To test the effectiveness of these semantic priors, we evaluated reconstruction results guided by priors derived from either image-only or image-language auxiliary information. Results: Experiments on knee and brain datasets demonstrate that semantic priors from images preserve fine anatomical structures and achieve superior perceptual quality, as reflected in lower LPIPS values, higher Tenengrad scores, and improved scores in the reader study, compared with conventional regularization. The image-language information further expands the semantic distribution and enables high-level control over reconstruction attributes. Across all evaluations, the contrastive objective consistently guided the reconstructed features toward the desired semantic distributions while maintaining data fidelity, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework.

This paper tackles this problem and allows to extend existing rigid-body pose estimation methods to non-rigid systems. Our approach hinges on two core assumptions: first, the elastic properties are captured by an injective deformation-force model, efficiently learned via a Multi-Layer Perceptron; second, we solve the platform's inherently smooth motion using continuous-time B-spline kinematic models. By continuously applying Newton's Second Law, our method establishes a physical link between visually-derived trajectory acceleration and predicted deformation-induced acceleration. We demonstrate that our approach not only enables robust and accurate pose estimation on non-rigid platforms, but that the properly modeled platform physics instigate inertial sensing properties.

However, prior studies have used either low-resolution thumbnails or random patches, which likely underestimated model performance. Here, we ask whether LMMs can be adapted to reason coherently and accurately in the evaluation of such images. In this study, we introduce Gigapixel Image Agent for Navigating Tissue (GIANT), the first framework that allows LMMs to iteratively navigate whole-slide images (WSIs) like a pathologist. Accompanying GIANT, we release MultiPathQA, a new benchmark, which comprises 934 WSI-level questions, encompassing five clinically-relevant tasks ranging from cancer diagnosis to open-ended reasoning. MultiPathQA also includes 128 questions, authored by two professional pathologists, requiring direct slide interpretation. Using MultiPathQA, we show that our simple agentic system substantially outperforms conventional patch- and thumbnail-based baselines, approaching or surpassing the performance of specialized models trained on millions of images. For example, on pathologist-authored questions, GPT-5 with GIANT achieves 62.5% accuracy, outperforming specialist pathology models such as TITAN (43.8%) and SlideChat (37.5%).

On the BNCI2014 motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) dataset with 9 subjects and 5,184 trials, the system performs at a high safety rate of 94-97% even with lightweight decoder architectures with low test accuracies (27-46%) and high ECE confidence miscalibration (0.22-0.41).

However, we show that high final-answer accuracy often hides unfaithful visual reasoning: models may invoke tools on irrelevant regions or ignore tool outputs entirely, yet still guess the correct answer. In this work, we first propose a faithfulness evaluation protocol that measures whether intermediate visual tool outputs (e.g., crops) actually contain the queried evidence. This reveals that recent visual agents achieve high final-answer accuracy but exhibit low rates of faithful tool-use on visual search benchmarks. We then introduce CodeV, a code-based visual agent trained with Tool-Aware Policy Optimization (TAPO). TAPO is a process-level RL framework that augments GRPO with dense rewards defined directly on visual tool inputs and outputs, rather than on chain-of-thought tokens, making supervision easier to verify and less susceptible to reward hacking. CodeV represents visual tools as executable Python code, and TAPO assigns step-wise rewards based solely on the question and tool output, encouraging both necessary and evidence-consistent tool use. In a two-stage SFT+RL pipeline, CodeV achieves competitive or superior accuracy while substantially increasing faithful tool-use rates on related visual search benchmarks. Beyond visual search, CodeV attains strong performance on a range of multimodal reasoning and math benchmarks, suggesting that explicitly supervising intermediate tool behavior is crucial for building trustworthy, agentic visual reasoning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "CodeV\u901a\u8fc7TAPO\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8c03\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u64cd\u4f5c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u65e0\u5173\u533a\u57df\u8c03\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u6216\u5b8c\u5168\u5ffd\u7565\u5de5\u5177\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u80fd\u731c\u6d4b\u51fa\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u7387\u3002", "method": "CodeV\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u91c7\u7528TAPO\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002TAPO\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ea7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0a\u5b9a\u4e49\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u6765\u589e\u5f3aGRPO\u3002CodeV\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u5de5\u5177\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684Python\u4ee3\u7801\uff0cTAPO\u6839\u636e\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u914d\u9010\u6b65\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "result": "CodeV\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u641c\u7d22\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6216\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u7387\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cCodeV\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "CodeV\u901a\u8fc7Tool-Aware Policy Optimization\uff08TAPO\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5bf9\u4e2d\u95f4\u5de5\u5177\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Employing an attention-based encoder-decoder backbone, it jointly segments four ROIs - masses, calcifications, axillary findings, and breast tissues - with state-of-the-art accuracy and robustly predicts ten structured clinical features: mass morphology, calcification type, ACR breast density, and BI-RADS categories. To fuse imaging and clinical insights, we developed two late-fusion strategies. By utilizing complementary multimodal data, late fusion strategies improve diagnostic precision and reduce inter-observer variability. Operationalized as a secure, user-friendly web application, OncoVision produces structured reports with dual-confidence scoring and attention-weighted visualizations for real-time diagnostic support to improve clinician trust and facilitate medical teaching. It can be easily incorporated into the clinic, making screening available in underprivileged areas around the world, such as rural South Asia.

However, despite their versatility, current training paradigms for model weight optimization methods, like PPO and GRPO, remain relatively impractical with their high computational overhead for rollout convergence. In addition, the resulting agent policies are difficult to interpret, adapt, or incrementally improve. To address this, we investigate creating and refining structured memory of experiential learning of an agent from its environment as an alternative route to agent optimization. We introduce BREW (Bootstrapping expeRientially-learned Environmental knoWledge), a framework for agent optimization for downstream tasks via KB construction and refinement. In our formulation, we introduce an effective method for partitioning agent memory for more efficient retrieval and refinement. BREW uses task graders and behavior rubrics to learn insights while leveraging state-space search for ensuring robustness from the noise and non-specificity in natural language. Empirical results on real world, domain-grounded benchmarks -- OSWorld, $\u03c4^2$Bench, and SpreadsheetBench -- show BREW achieves $10-20\\%$ improvement in task precision, $10-15\\%$ reduction in API/tool calls leading to faster execution time, all while maintaining computational efficiency on par with base models.

However, most VLAs are trained purely by imitation, which overfits to demonstrations, and is brittle under distribution shift. Reinforcement learning (RL) directly optimizes task reward and thus addresses this misalignment, but real-robot interaction is expensive and conventional simulators are hard to engineer and transfer. We address both data efficiency and optimization stability in VLA post-training via a learned world model and an RL procedure tailored to flow-based action heads. Specifically, we introduce Prophet, a unified action-to-video robot actuation pretrained across large-scale, heterogeneous robot data to learn reusable action-outcome dynamics. It is able to few-shot adapt to new robots, objects, and environments, yielding a rollout-ready simulator. Upon Prophet, we reinforce action policies with Flow-action-GRPO (FA-GRPO), which adapts Flow-GRPO to operate on VLA actions, and with FlowScale, a stepwise reweighting that rescales per-step gradients in the flow head. Together, Prophet, FA-GRPO, and FlowScale constitute ProphRL, a practical, data- and compute-efficient path to VLA post-training.

In a teacher-student setup, this translates into collecting a dataset of the teacher mapping -- querying the teacher -- and fitting a student to imitate such mapping. A sensible choice of queries is the dataset the teacher is trained on. But current methods fail when the teacher parameters are more numerous than the training data, because the student overfits to the queries instead of aligning its parameters to the teacher. In this work, we explore augmentation techniques to best sample the input-output mapping of a teacher network, with the goal of eliciting a rich set of representations from the teacher hidden layers. We discover that standard augmentations such as rotation, flipping, and adding noise, bring little to no improvement to the identification problem.

We propose a novel prototype-based method for interpretable cell counting via density map estimation. Our approach integrates a prototype layer into the density estimation network, enabling the model to learn representative visual patterns for both cells and background artifacts. The learned prototypes were evaluated through a survey of biologists, who confirmed the relevance of the visual patterns identified, further validating the interpretability of the model. By generating interpretations that highlight regions in the input image most similar to each prototype, our method offers a clear understanding of how the model identifies and counts cells. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves interpretability without compromising counting effectiveness.

We present NNGPT, an open-source framework that turns a large language model (LLM) into a self-improving AutoML engine for neural network development, primarily for computer vision. Unlike previous frameworks, NNGPT extends the dataset of neural networks by generating new models, enabling continuous fine-tuning of LLMs based on closed-loop system of generation, assessment, and self-improvement. It integrates within one unified workflow five synergistic LLM-based pipelines: zero-shot architecture synthesis, hyperparameter optimization (HPO), code-aware accuracy/early-stop prediction, retrieval-augmented synthesis of scope-closed PyTorch blocks (NN-RAG), and reinforcement learning. Built on the LEMUR dataset as an audited corpus with reproducible metrics, NNGPT emits from a single prompt and validates network architecture, preprocessing code, and hyperparameters, executes them end-to-end, and learns from result. The PyTorch adapter makes NNGPT framework-agnostic, enabling strong performance: NN-RAG achieves 73% executability on 1,289 targets, 3-shot prompting boosts accuracy on common datasets, and hash-based deduplication saves hundreds of runs. One-shot prediction matches search-based AutoML, reducing the need for numerous trials.

By integrating altitude-dependent scaling with an adaptive tiling factor, we reduce unnecessary computation while maintaining detection performance. Tested on the SeaDronesSee dataset [1] with YOLOv5 [2] and Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) framework [3], our approach improves Mean Average Precision (mAP) for small objects by 38% compared to a baseline and achieves more than double the inference speed compared to static tiling.

Existing approaches either rely on limited segmentation training data, which hinders generalization, or apply zero-shot heuristics to vision-language models (e.g CLIP), while the most competitive approaches combine multiple models to improve performance at the cost of high computational and memory demands. In this work, we leverage an overlooked agglomerative vision foundation model, RADIO, to improve zero-shot OVSS along three key axes simultaneously: mIoU, latency, and parameter efficiency. We present the first comprehensive study of RADIO for zero-shot OVSS and enhance its performance through self-correlating recursive attention, self-correlating global aggregation, and computationally efficient mask refinement. Our approach, RADSeg, achieves 6-30% mIoU improvement in the base ViT class while being 3.95x faster and using 2.5x fewer parameters.

We propose Prune-Then-Plan, a simple and effective framework that stabilizes exploration through step-level calibration. Instead of trusting raw VLM scores, our method prunes implausible frontier choices using a Holm-Bonferroni inspired pruning procedure and then delegates final decisions to a coverage-based planner.

This leaves an underexplored research question: can we reduce the number of stacked transformer layers while maintaining comparable representational capacity? To answer this, we propose a branch-based structural reparameterization technique that operates during the training phase. Our approach leverages parallel branches within transformer blocks that can be systematically consolidated into streamlined single-path models suitable for inference deployment. The consolidation mechanism works by gradually merging branches at the entry points of nonlinear components, enabling both feed-forward networks (FFN) and multi-head self-attention (MHSA) modules to undergo exact mathematical reparameterization without inducing approximation errors at test time. When applied to ViT-Tiny, the framework successfully reduces the original 12-layer architecture to 6, 4, or as few as 3 layers while maintaining classification accuracy on ImageNet-1K.

In this paper, we propose DRAFT-RL, a novel framework that integrates Chain-of-Draft (CoD) reasoning into multi-agent RL training. Instead of generating single responses, each agent produces multiple drafts per query, which are then evaluated by peer agents and a learned reward model to identify the most promising trajectory. These selected drafts are used to refine future reasoning strategies through actor-critic learning.DRAFT-RL enables explicit multi-path exploration, peer-guided reflection, and reward-aligned selection, resulting in more robust and interpretable LLM agent behavior.

However, existing reasoning models focus on conventional problem-solving and do not necessarily generate creative solutions by ``creative reasoning''. In domains where the solution space is expansive and conventional solutions are suboptimal, such as drug discovery or business strategization, creative reasoning to discover innovative solutions is crucial. To address this gap, first we introduce a computational framework for creative reasoning inspired by established cognitive science principles. With this framework, we propose three core creative reasoning paradigms, namely, \\textit{combinational}, \\textit{exploratory}, and \\textit{transformative} reasoning, where each offers specific directions for systematic exploration of the universe of thoughts to generate creative solutions. Next, to materialize this framework using LLMs, we introduce the \\textit{Universe of Thoughts} (or \\textit{UoT}, for short), a novel set of methods to implement the aforementioned three creative processes. Finally, we introduce three novel tasks that necessitate creative problem-solving, along with an evaluation benchmark to assess creativity from three orthogonal perspectives: feasibility as constraint, and utility and novelty as metrics.

Existing fixes -- freezing modules or applying uniform regularization -- either overconstrain adaptation or ignore the differing roles of VLA components. We present MAPS (Module-Wise Proximity Scheduling), the first robust fine-tuning framework for VLAs. Through systematic analysis, we uncover an empirical order in which proximity constraints should be relaxed to balance stability and flexibility. MAPS linearly schedules this relaxation, enabling visual encoders to stay close to their pretrained priors while action-oriented language layers adapt more freely.

The computation cost of OT, however, hinders its scalability. Slice-based transport plans have recently shown promise for reducing the computational cost by leveraging the closed-form solutions of 1D OT problems. These methods optimize a one-dimensional projection (slice) to obtain a conditional transport plan that minimizes the transport cost in the ambient space. While efficient, these methods leave open the question of whether learned optimal slicers can transfer to new distribution pairs under distributional shift. Understanding this transferability is crucial in settings with evolving data or repeated OT computations across closely related distributions. In this paper, we study the min-Sliced Transport Plan (min-STP) framework and investigate the transferability of optimized slicers: can a slicer trained on one distribution pair yield effective transport plans for new, unseen pairs? Theoretically, we show that optimized slicers remain close under slight perturbations of the data distributions, enabling efficient transfer across related tasks. To further improve scalability, we introduce a minibatch formulation of min-STP and provide statistical guarantees on its accuracy. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transferable min-STP achieves strong one-shot matching performance and facilitates amortized training for point cloud alignment and flow-based generative modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "min-STP\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5207\u7247\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u70b9\u4e91\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5207\u7247\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u662f\u5426\u5177\u6709\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u6570\u636e\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u6216\u91cd\u590d\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86min-Sliced Transport Plan\uff08min-STP\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5c0f\u6279\u91cfmin-STP\u516c\u5f0f\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5207\u7247\u5668\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e2d\u5728\u70b9\u4e91\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5207\u7247\u5668\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u8f7b\u5fae\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002min-STP\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u70b9\u4e91\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

However, synthetic traffic is not inherently privacy-preserving, and the extent to which it leaks sensitive information, and how to measure such leakage, remain largely unexplored. This challenge is further compounded by the diversity of model architectures, which shape how traffic is represented and synthesized. We introduce a comprehensive set of privacy metrics for synthetic network traffic, combining standard approaches like membership inference attacks (MIA) and data extraction attacks with network-specific identifiers and attributes. Using these metrics, we systematically evaluate the vulnerability of different representative generative models and examine the factors that influence attack success. Our results reveal substantial variability in privacy risks across models and datasets. MIA success ranges from 0% to 88%, and up to 100% of network identifiers can be recovered from generated traffic, highlighting serious privacy vulnerabilities. We further identify key factors that significantly affect attack outcomes, including training data diversity and how well the generative model fits the training data. These findings provide actionable guidance for designing and deploying generative models that minimize privacy leakage, establishing a foundation for safer synthetic network traffic generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0cMIA\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe88%\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u6062\u590d\u7387\u53ef\u8fbe100%\u3002\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u5982\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u62df\u5408\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u653b\u51fb\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7a00\u7f3a\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5408\u6210\u6d41\u91cf\u672c\u8eab\u5e76\u4e0d\u5177\u5907\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5173\u4e8e\u5176\u6cc4\u6f0f\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u8861\u91cf\u8fd9\u79cd\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5408\u6210\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\u9690\u79c1\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\uff08MIA\uff09\u548c\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u653b\u51fb\u7b49\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f51\u7edc\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u5dee\u5f02\uff0cMIA\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ece0%\u523088%\u4e0d\u7b49\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u7684\u6062\u590d\u7387\u53ef\u8fbe100%\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u653b\u51fb\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5982\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u62df\u5408\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\uff08MIA\uff09\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ece0%\u523088%\u4e0d\u7b49\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u7684\u6062\u590d\u7387\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u8fbe100%\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u5408\u6210\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we introduce PathFMTools, a lightweight, extensible Python package that enables efficient execution, analysis, and visualization of pathology foundation models. We use this tool to interface with and evaluate two state-of-the-art vision-language foundation models, CONCH and MUSK, on the task of histological grading in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), a critical criterion that informs cSCC staging and patient management. Using a cohort of 440 cSCC H&E WSIs, we benchmark multiple adaptation strategies, demonstrating trade-offs across prediction approaches and validating the potential of using foundation model embeddings to train small specialist models.

While fragment-based models handle limited data better than atom-based approaches, existing heuristic fragmentation limits diversity and misses key fragments. Additionally, model tuning typically requires slow, indirect collaboration between medicinal chemists and AI engineers. We introduce FRAGMENTA, an end-to-end framework for drug lead optimization comprising: 1) a novel generative model that reframes fragmentation as a \"vocabulary selection\" problem, using dynamic Q-learning to jointly optimize fragmentation and generation; and 2) an agentic AI system that refines objectives via conversational feedback from domain experts. This system removes the AI engineer from the loop and progressively learns domain knowledge to eventually automate tuning. In real-world cancer drug discovery experiments, FRAGMENTA's Human-Agent configuration identified nearly twice as many high-scoring molecules as baselines.

The proposed model employs a set of learnable action queries, initialized via Gaussian sampling from ground-truth trajectories within the training corpus. These learnable queries interact with reasoning-enhanced vision-language features to generate continuous action trajectories in parallel. To promote robust generalization, we consolidate eight publicly available autonomous driving datasets into a standardized, Chain-of-Thought reasoning-based, and easy-to-use data format for model training.

Multimodal neural networks have seen increasing use for identifying species to help automate this task, but they have two major drawbacks. First, their black-box nature prevents the interpretability of their decision making process. Second, collecting genetic data is often expensive and requires invasive procedures, often necessitating researchers to capture or kill the target specimen. We address both of these problems by extending prototype networks (ProtoPNets), which are a popular and interpretable alternative to traditional neural networks, to the multimodal, cost-aware setting. We ensemble prototypes from each modality, using an associated weight to determine how much a given prediction relies on each modality. We further introduce methods to identify cases for which we do not need the expensive genetic information to make confident predictions.

Objective: This study aimed to compare the performance of two LLMs: ChatGPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 on real questions from the Chinese Pharmacist Licensing Examination (2017-2021), and to discuss the implications of these performance differences for AI-enabled formative evaluation. Methods: A total of 2,306 multiple-choice (text-only) questions were compiled from official exams, training materials, and public databases. Questions containing tables or images were excluded. Each item was input in its original Chinese format, and model responses were evaluated for exact accuracy. Pearson's Chi-squared test was used to compare overall performance, and Fisher's exact test was applied to year-wise multiple-choice accuracy. Results: DeepSeek-R1 outperformed ChatGPT-4o with a significantly higher overall accuracy (90.0% vs. 76.1%, p < 0.001). Unit-level analyses revealed consistent advantages for DeepSeek-R1, particularly in foundational and clinical synthesis modules. While year-by-year multiple-choice performance also favored DeepSeek-R1, this performance gap did not reach statistical significance in any specific unit-year (all p > 0.05). Conclusion: DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated robust alignment with the structural and semantic demands of the pharmacist licensure exam.

Recent end-to-end systems and world-model-based planners predict rich multi-modal trajectories, but typically rely on handcrafted anchors or reinforcement learning to select a single best mode for training and control. This selection discards information about alternative futures and complicates optimization. We propose MAP-World, a prior-free multi-modal planning framework that couples masked action planning with a path-weighted world model. The Masked Action Planning (MAP) module treats future ego motion as masked sequence completion: past waypoints are encoded as visible tokens, future waypoints are represented as mask tokens, and a driving-intent path provides a coarse scaffold. A compact latent planning state is expanded into multiple trajectory queries with injected noise, yielding diverse, temporally consistent modes without anchor libraries or teacher policies. A lightweight world model then rolls out future BEV semantics conditioned on each candidate trajectory. During training, semantic losses are computed as an expectation over modes, using trajectory probabilities as discrete path weights, so the planner learns from the full distribution of plausible futures instead of a single selected path.

Meanwhile, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization and few-shot capabilities across diverse visual domains. In this work, we integrate VLM-based segmentation into semi-supervised medical image segmentation by introducing a Vision-Language Enhanced Semi-supervised Segmentation Assistant (VESSA) that incorporates foundation-level visual-semantic understanding into SSL frameworks. Our approach consists of two stages. In Stage 1, the VLM-enhanced segmentation foundation model VESSA is trained as a reference-guided segmentation assistant using a template bank containing gold-standard exemplars, simulating learning from limited labeled data. Given an input-template pair, VESSA performs visual feature matching to extract representative semantic and spatial cues from exemplar segmentations, generating structured prompts for a SAM2-inspired mask decoder to produce segmentation masks. In Stage 2, VESSA is integrated into a state-of-the-art SSL framework, enabling dynamic interaction with the student model: as student predictions become more refined, they are fed back to VESSA as prompts, allowing it to generate higher-quality pseudo-labels and stronger guidance. Extensive experiments across multiple segmentation datasets and domains show that VESSA-augmented SSL significantly enhances segmentation accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines under extremely limited annotation conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "VESSA\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3a\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u51cf\u5c11\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u5bf9\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "VESSA\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u677f\u5e93\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u5f15\u5bfc\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5c06\u5176\u96c6\u6210\u81f3\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cVESSA\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6781\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "VESSA\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

This single-dimensional feature provides directionality information equivalent to normal vectors for concrete surface defect characteristics. Through entropy-based feature evaluation, this study demonstrates the ability of relative angle to filter out redundant information in undamaged sections while retaining effective information in damaged sections. By training and testing with PointNet++, models based on the relative angles achieved similar performance to that of models based on normal vectors while delivering 27.6% storage reduction and 83% input channel compression.

Submitted to IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV) 2026 for possible publication", "summary": "3D reconstruction for Digital Twins often relies on LiDAR-based methods, which provide accurate geometry but lack the semantics and textures naturally captured by cameras. Traditional LiDAR-camera fusion approaches require complex calibration and still struggle with certain materials like glass, which are visible in images but poorly represented in point clouds. We propose a camera-only pipeline that reconstructs scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting from multi-view images, extracts semantic material masks via vision models, converts Gaussian representations to mesh surfaces with projected material labels, and assigns physics-based material properties for accurate sensor simulation in modern graphics engines and simulators. This approach combines photorealistic reconstruction with physics-based material assignment, providing sensor simulation fidelity comparable to LiDAR-camera fusion while eliminating hardware complexity and calibration requirements. We validate our camera-only method using an internal dataset from an instrumented test vehicle, leveraging LiDAR as ground truth for reflectivity validation alongside image similarity metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u76f8\u673a-only\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u65af\u6563\u5c04\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6750\u6599\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfLiDAR-camera\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u6821\u51c6\u4e14\u5bf9\u67d0\u4e9b\u6750\u6599\uff08\u5982\u73bb\u7483\uff09\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800cLiDAR\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f8\u673a\u6355\u6349\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u76843D\u9ad8\u65af\u6563\u5c04\u91cd\u5efa\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u8bed\u4e49\u6750\u6599\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5c06\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5e26\u6709\u6750\u6599\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u8868\u9762\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u914d\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u6750\u6599\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528LiDAR\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53cd\u5c04\u7387\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u673a-only\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u54083D\u9ad8\u65af\u6563\u5c04\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6750\u6599\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u6821\u51c6\u7684LiDAR-camera\u878d\u5408\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

We revisit the SegFormer decoder and show that three small, synergistic changes make weak supervision markedly more effective-without altering the MiT backbone or relying on heavy post-processing. Our method, CrispFormer, augments the decoder with: (1) a boundary branch that supervises thin object contours using a lightweight edge head and a boundary-aware loss; (2) an uncertainty-guided refiner that predicts per-pixel aleatoric uncertainty and uses it to weight losses and gate a residual correction of the segmentation logits; and (3) a dynamic multi-scale fusion layer that replaces static concatenation with spatial softmax gating over multi-resolution features, optionally modulated by uncertainty. The result is a single-pass model that preserves crisp boundaries, selects appropriate scales per location, and resists label noise from weak cues. Integrated into a standard WSSS pipeline (seed, student, and EMA relabeling), CrispFormer consistently improves boundary F-score, small-object recall, and mIoU over SegFormer baselines trained on the same seeds, while adding minimal compute.

While diffusion models can generate diverse and expressive motions conditioned on text and scene context, they often produce physically implausible outputs, leading to execution drift during simulation. To address this, BRIC dynamically adapts the physics controller to noisy motion plans at test time, while preserving pre-trained skills via a loss function that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. In addition, BRIC introduces a lightweight test-time guidance mechanism that steers the diffusion model in the signal space without updating its parameters. By combining both adaptation strategies, BRIC ensures consistent and physically plausible long-term executions across diverse environments in an effective and efficient manner.

When tokens from different spatial grids are mixed, the attention mechanism collapses. The issue is structural. Linear coordinate remapping forces a single attention head to compare RoPE phases sampled at incompatible rates, creating phase aliasing that destabilizes the score landscape. Pretrained DiTs are especially brittle-many heads exhibit extremely sharp, periodic phase selectivity-so even tiny cross-rate inconsistencies reliably cause blur, artifacts, or full collapse.\n  To this end, our main contribution is Cross-Resolution Phase-Aligned Attention (CRPA), a training-free drop-in fix that eliminates this failure at its source. CRPA modifies only the RoPE index map for each attention call: all Q/K positions are expressed on the query's stride so that equal physical distances always induce identical phase increments. This restores the precise phase patterns that DiTs rely on. CRPA is fully compatible with pretrained DiTs, stabilizes all heads and layers uniformly.

A promising path forward is high-fidelity simulation that combines photorealistic sensor rendering with geometrically grounded interaction in complex, open-world urban environments. Although recent video-3DGS methods ease open-world scene capturing, they are still unsuitable for benchmarking due to large visual and geometric sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Wanderland, a real-to-sim framework that features multi-sensor capture, reliable reconstruction, accurate geometry, and robust view synthesis. Using this pipeline, we curate a diverse dataset of indoor-outdoor urban scenes and systematically demonstrate how image-only pipelines scale poorly, how geometry quality impacts novel view synthesis, and how all of these adversely affect navigation policy learning and evaluation reliability.

For example, OCR errors like misreading \"50 mph\" as \"60 mph\" could cause severe traffic accidents. This leads us to ask: Can VLMs know when they can't see? Existing abstention methods suggest pessimistic answers: they either rely on miscalibrated output probabilities or require semantic agreement unsuitable for OCR tasks. However, this failure may indicate we are looking in the wrong place: uncertainty signals could be hidden in VLMs' internal representations.\n  Building on this insight, we propose Latent Representation Probing (LRP): training lightweight probes on hidden states or attention patterns. We explore three probe designs: concatenating representations across all layers, aggregating attention over visual tokens, and ensembling single layer probes by majority vote. Experiments on four benchmarks across image and video modalities show LRP improves abstention accuracy by 7.6\\% over best baselines. Our analysis reveals: probes generalize across various uncertainty sources and datasets, and optimal signals emerge from intermediate rather than final layers. This establishes a principled framework for building deployment-ready AI systems by detecting confidence signals from internal states rather than unreliable outputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "LRP\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u6d4bVLM\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u5347STVQA\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5f03\u6743\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad87.6%\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740VLM\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u65f6\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728STVQA\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u6982\u7387\u6216\u4e0d\u9002\u5408OCR\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u8868\u660e\u6211\u4eec\u627e\u9519\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\uff1a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u80fd\u9690\u85cf\u5728VLM\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Latent Representation Probing (LRP)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u6216\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u63a2\u9488\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a\u8de8\u5c42\u8fde\u63a5\u8868\u793a\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u96c6\u6210\u5355\u5c42\u63a2\u9488\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cLRP\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e867.6%\u7684\u5f03\u6743\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63a2\u9488\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u5404\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u6e90\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e14\u6700\u4f73\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u81ea\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u800c\u975e\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u3002", "conclusion": "LRP\u901a\u8fc7\u4eceVLM\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7f6e\u4fe1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Low-diversity models tend to generate repetitive outputs, increasing sampling redundancy and hindering both creative exploration and downstream applications. A primary cause is that generation often collapses toward a strong mode in the learned distribution. Existing attempts to improve diversity, such as noise resampling, prompt rewriting, or steering-based guidance, often still collapse to dominant modes or introduce distortions that degrade image quality. In light of this, we propose Token-Prompt embedding Space Optimization (TPSO), a training-free and model-agnostic module. TPSO introduces learnable parameters to explore underrepresented regions of the token embedding space, reducing the tendency of the model to repeatedly generate samples from strong modes of the learned distribution. At the same time, the prompt-level space provides a global semantic constraint that regulates distribution shifts, preventing quality degradation while maintaining high fidelity. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and three diffusion backbones show that TPSO significantly enhances generative diversity, improving baseline performance from 1.10 to 4.18 points, without sacrificing image quality.

Attention sparsity reduces computational costs by focusing on critical tokens while ignoring non-critical tokens. However, existing methods suffer from severe performance degradation. In this paper, we revisit attention sparsity and reveal that existing methods induce systematic biases in attention allocation: (1) excessive focus on critical tokens amplifies their attention weights; (2) complete neglect of non-critical tokens causes the loss of relevant attention weights. To address these issues, we propose Rectified SpaAttn, which rectifies attention allocation with implicit full attention reference, thereby enhancing the alignment between sparse and full attention maps. Specifically: (1) for critical tokens, we show that their bias is proportional to the sparse attention weights, with the ratio governed by the amplified weights. Accordingly, we propose Isolated-Pooling Attention Reallocation, which calculates accurate rectification factors by reallocating multimodal pooled weights. (2) for non-critical tokens, recovering attention weights from the pooled query-key yields attention gains but also introduces pooling errors. Therefore, we propose Gain-Aware Pooling Rectification, which ensures that the rectified gain consistently surpasses the induced error. Moreover, we customize and integrate the Rectified SpaAttn kernel using Triton, achieving up to 3.33 and 2.08 times speedups on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1, respectively, while maintaining high generation quality.

Unlike traditional 2D visual generation, World Models aim to construct realistic, dynamic, and physically consistent 3D/4D worlds from images, videos, or text. These models not only need to produce high-fidelity visual content but also maintain coherence across space, time, physics, and instruction control, enabling applications in virtual reality, autonomous driving, embodied intelligence, and content creation. However, prior benchmarks emphasize different evaluation dimensions and lack a unified assessment of world-realism capability. To systematically evaluate World Models, we introduce the 4DWorldBench, which measures models across four key dimensions: Perceptual Quality, Condition-4D Alignment, Physical Realism, and 4D Consistency. The benchmark covers tasks such as Image-to-3D/4D, Video-to-4D, Text-to-3D/4D. Beyond these, we innovatively introduce adaptive conditioning across multiple modalities, which not only integrates but also extends traditional evaluation paradigms. To accommodate different modality-conditioned inputs, we map all modality conditions into a unified textual space during evaluation, and further integrate LLM-as-judge, MLLM-as-judge, and traditional network-based methods. This unified and adaptive design enables more comprehensive and consistent evaluation of alignment, physical realism, and cross-modal coherence. Preliminary human studies further demonstrate that our adaptive tool selection achieves closer agreement with subjective human judgments.

However, fine-tuned models suffer from catastrophic forgetting. We create models that perform four tasks (object recognition, face recognition from high- and low-quality images, and person recognition from whole-body images) in a single embedding space -- without incurring substantial catastrophic forgetting. To accomplish this, we introduce two variants of the Interleaved Multi-Domain Identity Curriculum (IMIC): a gradient-coupled, interleaving training schedule that fine-tunes a foundation backbone simultaneously on all four tasks. The IMIC method proved effective with three foundation model bases: DINOv3, CLIP, and EVA-02. Two of these (EVA-02 and CLIP) performed comparably with domain experts on all four tasks concurrently and were more accurate than humans at multi-tasking across face, body, and object datasets.

Moreover, they lack specialized strategies to handle frequently occluded regions (e.g., mouth interiors, eyelids). To address these limitations, we propose STAvatar, which consists of two key components: (1) a UV-Adaptive Soft Binding framework that leverages both image-based and geometric priors to learn per-Gaussian feature offsets within the UV space. This UV representation supports dynamic resampling, ensuring full compatibility with Adaptive Density Control (ADC) and enhanced adaptability to shape and textural variations. (2) a Temporal ADC strategy, which first clusters structurally similar frames to facilitate more targeted computation of the densification criterion. It further introduces a novel fused perceptual error as clone criterion to jointly capture geometric and textural discrepancies, encouraging densification in regions requiring finer details.

However, its effectiveness diminishes in cross-modal scenarios, such as vision-to-language distillation, where inconsistencies in representation across modalities lead to difficult knowledge transfer. To address this challenge, we propose frequency-decoupled cross-modal knowledge distillation, a method designed to decouple and balance knowledge transfer across modalities by leveraging frequency-domain features. We observed that low-frequency features exhibit high consistency across different modalities, whereas high-frequency features demonstrate extremely low cross-modal similarity. Accordingly, we apply distinct losses to these features: enforcing strong alignment in the low-frequency domain and introducing relaxed alignment for high-frequency features.

Although CAD technology has advanced in recent years, the application scope of existing datasets remains relatively limited, typically supporting only single tasks, which has somewhat constrained the development of CAD technology. To address the above limitation, in this paper, we construct a multi-task liver dataset (LiMT) used for liver and tumor segmentation, multi-label lesion classification, and lesion detection based on arterial phase-enhanced computed tomography (CT), potentially providing an exploratory solution that is able to explore the correlation between tasks and does not need to worry about the heterogeneity between task-specific datasets during training. The dataset includes CT volumes from 150 different cases, comprising four types of liver diseases as well as normal cases. Each volume has been carefully annotated and calibrated by experienced clinicians. This public multi-task dataset may become a valuable resource for the medical imaging research community in the future. In addition, this paper not only provides relevant baseline experimental results but also reviews existing datasets and methods related to liver-related tasks.

A key bottleneck lies in the lack of public, large-scale, high-quality SVQA datasets. Although recent work uses LVLMs to synthesize data at scale, we identify systematic errors in their resulting QA pairs, stemming from LVLMs' inherent limitations and information asymmetry between figures and text. To address these challenges, we propose a verification-centric Generate-then-Verify framework that first generates QA pairs with figure-associated textual context, then applies cross-modal consistency checks against figures along with auxiliary filters to eliminate erroneous pairs. We instantiate this framework to curate VeriSciQA, a dataset of 20,351 QA pairs spanning 20 scientific domains and 12 figure types. VeriSciQA poses a challenging benchmark for open-source models, with a substantial accuracy gap between the leading open-source models (64%) and a proprietary model (82%). Moreover, models fine-tuned on VeriSciQA achieve consistent improvements on SVQA benchmarks, with performance gains that scale with data size and surpass models trained on existing datasets. Human evaluation further validates the superior correctness of VeriSciQA.

Recent self-rewarding approaches attempt to overcome this constraint by allowing models to act as their own critics or reward providers. Yet, purely text-based self-evaluation struggles to verify complex visual reasoning steps and often suffers from evaluation hallucinations. To address these challenges, inspired by recent advances in tool-integrated reasoning, we propose Agent0-VL, a self-evolving vision-language agent that achieves continual improvement with tool-integrated reasoning. Agent0-VL incorporates tool usage not only into reasoning but also into self-evaluation and self-repair, enabling the model to introspect, verify, and refine its reasoning through evidence-grounded analysis. It unifies two synergistic roles within a single LVLM: a Solver that performs multi-turn tool-integrated reasoning, and a Verifier that generates structured feedback and fine-grained self-rewards through tool-grounded critique. These roles interact through a Self-Evolving Reasoning Cycle, where tool-based verification and reinforcement learning jointly align the reasoning and evaluation distributions for stable self-improvement. Through this zero-external-reward evolution, Agent0-VL aligns its reasoning and verification behaviors without any human annotation or external reward models, achieving continual self-improvement. Experiments on geometric problem solving and visual scientific analysis show that Agent0-VL achieves an 12.5% improvement over the base model.

For improved robustness, we use 3D skeletal features extracted from sign language videos to capture the convergence of sign properties and their dynamics, which tend to cluster at sign boundaries. Another focus of this work is the incorporation of information from 3D handshape for boundary detection. To detect handshapes normally expected at the beginning and end of signs, we pretrain a handshape classifier for 87 linguistically defined canonical handshape categories using a dataset that we created by integrating and normalizing several existing datasets.

Previous works typically employ geometric, generative, or simulation priors to guide the transfer process, but these external priors introduce auxiliary constraints that lead to trade-offs between generalizability and temporal consistency. To address these limitations, we propose guiding the motion transfer process through an internal prior that exclusively captures the spatial-temporal transformations and is shared between the source video and any transferred target video. Specifically, we first lift both the source video and the target image into a unified 3D representation space. Motion trajectories are then extracted from the source video to construct a spatial-temporal (SpaT) prior that is independent of object geometry and semantics, encoding relative spatial variations over time. This prior is further integrated with the target object to synthesize a controllable velocity field, which is subsequently refined using Position-Based Dynamics to mitigate artifacts and enhance visual coherence. The resulting velocity field can be flexibly employed for efficient video production. Empirical results demonstrate that Motion Marionette generalizes across diverse objects, produces temporally consistent videos that align well with the source motion, and supports controllable video generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Motion Marionette \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u90e8\u7a7a\u95f4-\u65f6\u95f4\u5148\u9a8c\u5b9e\u73b0\u521a\u6027\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5916\u90e8\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u5148\u9a8c\uff08\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u751f\u6210\u6216\u6a21\u62df\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u90e8\u5148\u9a8c\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9996\u5148\u5c06\u6e90\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u5347\u5230\u7edf\u4e00\u76843D\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u6e90\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\u6784\u5efa\u7a7a\u95f4-\u65f6\u95f4\uff08SpaT\uff09\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8c61\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u3002\u968f\u540e\u5c06\u6b64\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u53ef\u63a7\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff08PBD\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMotion Marionette \u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u6e90\u8fd0\u52a8\u5bf9\u9f50\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u63a7\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "Motion Marionette \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u90e8\u5148\u9a8c\uff08SpaT\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u5355\u76ee\u6e90\u89c6\u9891\u5230\u5355\u89c6\u56fe\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u521a\u6027\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5916\u90e8\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

This approach leverages the largest-ever optically printed 3D specimen dataset, comprising a large family of parametrically designed complex minimal surface structures that have undergone terminal chemical characterisation. Conventional vision models are ill-equipped for this task, as they lack an inductive bias for the coupled, non-linear interactions of optical physics (diffraction, absorption) and material physics (diffusion, convection) that govern the final chemical state. To address this, we propose Coupled Physics-Gated Adaptation (C-PGA), a novel multimodal fusion architecture. Unlike standard concatenation, C-PGA explicitly models physical coupling by using sparse geometrical and process parameters (e.g., surface transport, print layer height) as a Query to dynamically gate and adapt the dense visual features via feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM). This mechanism spatially modulates dual 3D visual streams-extracted by parallel 3D-CNNs processing raw projection stacks and their diffusion-diffraction corrected counterparts allowing the model to recalibrate its visual perception based on the physical context.

However, existing TTS methods operate at the full-image level, overlooking the fact that image quality is often spatially heterogeneous. This leads to unnecessary computation on already satisfactory regions and insufficient correction of localized defects. In this paper, we explore a new direction - Localized TTS - that adaptively resamples defective regions while preserving high-quality regions, thereby substantially reducing the search space. This paradigm poses two central challenges: accurately localizing defects and maintaining global consistency. We propose LoTTS, the first fully training-free framework for localized TTS. For defect localization, LoTTS contrasts cross- and self-attention signals under quality-aware prompts (e.g., high-quality vs. low-quality) to identify defective regions, and then refines them into coherent masks. For consistency, LoTTS perturbs only defective regions and denoises them locally, ensuring that corrections remain confined while the rest of the image remains undisturbed. Extensive experiments on SD2.1, SDXL, and FLUX demonstrate that LoTTS achieves state-of-the-art performance: it consistently improves both local quality and global fidelity, while reducing GPU cost by 2-4x compared to Best-of-N sampling.

Project page at https://yufanchen96.github.io/projects/HybriDLA", "summary": "Conventional document layout analysis (DLA) traditionally depends on empirical priors or a fixed set of learnable queries executed in a single forward pass. While sufficient for early-generation documents with a small, predetermined number of regions, this paradigm struggles with contemporary documents, which exhibit diverse element counts and increasingly complex layouts. To address challenges posed by modern documents, we present HybriDLA, a novel generative framework that unifies diffusion and autoregressive decoding within a single layer. The diffusion component iteratively refines bounding-box hypotheses, whereas the autoregressive component injects semantic and contextual awareness, enabling precise region prediction even in highly varied layouts. To further enhance detection quality, we design a multi-scale feature-fusion encoder that captures both fine-grained and high-level visual cues.

However, conventional methods face significant limitations: manual features (e.g., SIFT) lack robustness; deep learning-based detectors (e.g., YOLO) can identify component presence but cannot perform state-specific retrieval or zero-shot search; Visual Large Models (VLMs) offer semantic and zero-shot capabilities but suffer from poor spatial grounding and high computational cost, making them inefficient for direct retrieval. To bridge these gaps, this paper proposes DetVLM, a novel intelligent image search framework that synergistically fuses object detection with VLMs. The framework pioneers a search-enhancement paradigm via a two-stage pipeline: a YOLO detector first conducts efficient, high-recall component-level screening to determine component presence; then, a VLM acts as a recall-enhancement unit, performing secondary verification for components missed by the detector. This architecture directly enables two advanced capabilities: 1) State Search: Guided by task-specific prompts, the VLM refines results by verifying component existence and executing sophisticated state judgments (e.g., \"sun visor lowered\"), allowing retrieval based on component state. 2) Zero-shot Search: The framework leverages the VLM's inherent zero-shot capability to recognize and retrieve images containing unseen components or attributes (e.g., \"driver wearing a mask\") without any task-specific training. Experiments on a vehicle component dataset show DetVLM achieves a state-of-the-art overall retrieval accuracy of 94.82\\%, significantly outperforming detection-only baselines.

To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce CounterVQA, a video-based benchmark featuring three progressive difficulty levels that assess different aspects of counterfactual reasoning. Through comprehensive evaluation of both state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models, we uncover a substantial performance gap: while these models achieve reasonable accuracy on simple counterfactual questions, performance degrades significantly on complex multi-hop causal chains. To address these limitations, we develop a post-training method, CFGPT, that enhances a model's visual counterfactual reasoning ability by distilling its counterfactual reasoning capability from the language modality, yielding consistent improvements across all CounterVQA difficulty levels.

However, enabling an excessive proportion of background search tokens to attend to the target template tokens weakens the tracker's discriminative capability. Several token pruning methods have been proposed to mitigate background interference; however, they often remove tokens near the target, leading to the loss of essential contextual information and degraded tracking performance. Moreover, the presence of distractors within the search tokens further reduces the tracker's ability to accurately identify the target. To address these limitations, we propose CPDATrack, a novel tracking framework designed to suppress interference from background and distractor tokens while enhancing computational efficiency. First, a learnable module is integrated between two designated encoder layers to estimate the probability of each search token being associated with the target. Based on these estimates, less-informative background tokens are pruned from the search region while preserving the contextual cues surrounding the target. To further suppress background interference, a discriminative selective attention mechanism is employed that fully blocks search-to-template attention in the early layers. In the subsequent encoder layers, high-probability target tokens are selectively extracted from a localized region to attend to the template tokens, thereby reducing the influence of background and distractor tokens.

We address this limitation by proposing \\textbf{MambaEye}, a novel, causal sequential encoder that leverages the low complexity and causal-process based pure Mamba2 backbone. Unlike previous Mamba-based vision encoders that often employ bidirectional processing, our strictly unidirectional approach preserves the inherent causality of State Space Models, enabling the model to generate a prediction at any point in its input sequence. A core innovation is our use of relative move embedding, which encodes the spatial shift between consecutive patches, providing a strong inductive bias for translation invariance and making the model inherently adaptable to arbitrary image resolutions and scanning patterns.

However, existing approaches lack emotional feedback from generated images, limiting the control of emotional continuity. Additionally, their simple alignment between emotions and naively generated texts fails to adaptively adjust emotional prompts according to image content, leading to insufficient emotional fidelity. To address these concerns, we propose a novel generation-understanding-feedback reinforcement paradigm (EmoFeedback2) for C-EICG, which exploits the reasoning capability of the fine-tuned large vision-language model (LVLM) to provide reward and textual feedback for generating high-quality images with continuous emotions. Specifically, we introduce an emotion-aware reward feedback strategy, where the LVLM evaluates the emotional values of generated images and computes the reward against target emotions, guiding the reinforcement fine-tuning of the generative model and enhancing the emotional continuity of images. Furthermore, we design a self-promotion textual feedback framework, in which the LVLM iteratively analyzes the emotional content of generated images and adaptively produces refinement suggestions for the next-round prompt, improving the emotional fidelity with fine-grained content. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively generates high-quality images with the desired emotions, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in our custom dataset.

However, real-world models often operate in a sequence of decisions, where an isolated mistake can be easily corrected, but cascading errors can lead to severe risks.\n  This paper reveals a novel threat: a single perturbation can hijack the whole decision chain. We demonstrate the feasibility of manipulating a model's outputs toward multiple, predefined outcomes, such as simultaneously misclassifying \"non-motorized lane\" signs as \"motorized lane\" and \"pedestrian\" as \"plastic bag\".\n  To expose this threat, we introduce Semantic-Aware Universal Perturbations (SAUPs), which induce varied outcomes based on the semantics of the inputs.

While large vision foundation models have shown promise for zero-shot biomedical segmentation, most existing approaches still depend on dense supervision and computationally expensive fine-tuning. Consequently, training-free methods present a compelling research direction, yet remain largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce SPROUT, a fully training- and annotation-free prompting framework for nuclear instance segmentation. SPROUT leverages histology-informed priors to construct slide-specific reference prototypes that mitigate domain gaps. These prototypes progressively guide feature alignment through a partial optimal transport scheme. The resulting foreground and background features are transformed into positive and negative point prompts, enabling the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to produce precise nuclear delineations without any parameter updates. Extensive experiments across multiple histopathology benchmarks demonstrate that SPROUT achieves competitive performance without supervision or retraining, establishing a novel paradigm for scalable, training-free nuclear instance segmentation in pathology.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPROUT \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6838\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b66\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u6848\u5f15\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5229\u7528 SAM \u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6838\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6d1e\u5bdf\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e0b\u6e38\u8f6c\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bc6\u96c6\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "SPROUT \u5229\u7528\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b66\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6784\u5efa\u7279\u5b9a\u5207\u7247\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u90e8\u5206\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u6848\u9010\u6b65\u5f15\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u7684\u524d\u666f\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u7279\u5f81\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6b63\u8d1f\u70b9\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f Segment Anything Model (SAM) \u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u66f4\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6838\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSPROUT \u5728\u65e0\u9700\u76d1\u7763\u6216\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6838\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "SPROUT \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6838\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b66\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6784\u5efa\u7279\u5b9a\u5207\u7247\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u90e8\u5206\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u6848\u9010\u6b65\u5f15\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6838\u5206\u5272\u3002"}}

This paper proposes a multimodal fusion network that leverages seven modality features from both visual and motion branches, aiming to effectively extract and integrate complementary cues across different modalities. Specifically, motion and visual features are extracted from the raw inputs using multiple Transformer-based extraction modules. Depth-guided attention module leverages depth information to guide attention towards salient regions in another modality through comprehensive spatial feature interactions. To account for the varying importance of different modalities and frames, modality attention and temporal attention are designed to selectively emphasize informative modalities and effectively capture temporal dependencies.

However, accurate pedestrian intention prediction in urban environments remains challenging due to the multitude of factors affecting pedestrian behavior. In this paper, we propose a multi-context fusion Transformer (MFT) that leverages diverse numerical contextual attributes across four key dimensions, encompassing pedestrian behavior context, environmental context, pedestrian localization context and vehicle motion context, to enable accurate pedestrian intention prediction. MFT employs a progressive fusion strategy, where mutual intra-context attention enables reciprocal interactions within each context, thereby facilitating feature sequence fusion and yielding a context token as a context-specific representation. This is followed by mutual cross-context attention, which integrates features across contexts with a global CLS token serving as a compact multi-context representation. Finally, guided intra-context attention refines context tokens within each context through directed interactions, while guided cross-context attention strengthens the global CLS token to promote multi-context fusion via guided information propagation, yielding deeper and more efficient integration. Experimental results validate the superiority of MFT over state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy rates of 73%, 93%, and 90% on the JAADbeh, JAADall, and PIE datasets, respectively.

Such reasoning is often infeasible with only a single front view and requires a comprehensive view of the environment, which we achieve through multi-view inputs. We define Safety-Critical Reasoning as a new task that leverages multi-view inputs to address this challenge. Then, we distill Safety-Critical Reasoning into two stages: first resolve the immediate risk, then mitigate the decision-induced downstream risks. To support this, we introduce WaymoQA, a dataset of 35,000 human-annotated question-answer pairs covering complex, high-risk driving scenarios. The dataset includes multiple-choice and open-ended formats across both image and video modalities.

However, when confronted with complex prompts involving multiple objects and hierarchical structures, existing models struggle to accurately follow instructions, leading to issues such as concept omission, confusion, and poor compositionality. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Compositional Generative framework (HiCoGen) built upon a novel Chain of Synthesis (CoS) paradigm. Instead of monolithic generation, HiCoGen first leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose complex prompts into minimal semantic units. It then synthesizes these units iteratively, where the image generated in each step provides crucial visual context for the next, ensuring all textual concepts are faithfully constructed into the final scene. To further optimize this process, we introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Crucially, we identify that the limited exploration of standard diffusion samplers hinders effective RL. We theoretically prove that sample diversity is maximized by concentrating stochasticity in the early generation stages and, based on this insight, propose a novel Decaying Stochasticity Schedule to enhance exploration. Our RL algorithm is then guided by a hierarchical reward mechanism that jointly evaluates the image at the global, subject, and relationship levels.

Among existing approaches, point-based methods directly generate point clouds without relying on other representations such as latent features, meshes, or voxels. These methods offer low training cost and algorithmic simplicity, but often underperform compared to representation-based approaches. In this paper, we propose MFM-Point, a multi-scale Flow Matching framework for point cloud generation that substantially improves the scalability and performance of point-based methods while preserving their simplicity and efficiency. Our multi-scale generation algorithm adopts a coarse-to-fine generation paradigm, enhancing generation quality and scalability without incurring additional training or inference overhead. A key challenge in developing such a multi-scale framework lies in preserving the geometric structure of unordered point clouds while ensuring smooth and consistent distributional transitions across resolutions.

While 3D foundation models like VGGT provide accurate 3D geometry, their performance drops markedly when moving objects dominate. Existing 4D approaches often rely on external priors, heavy post-optimization, or require fine-tuning on 4D datasets. In this paper, we propose VGGT4D, a training-free framework that extends the 3D foundation model VGGT for robust 4D scene reconstruction. Our approach is motivated by the key finding that VGGT's global attention layers already implicitly encode rich, layer-wise dynamic cues. To obtain masks that decouple static and dynamic elements, we mine and amplify global dynamic cues via gram similarity and aggregate them across a temporal window. To further sharpen mask boundaries, we introduce a refinement strategy driven by projection gradient. We then integrate these precise masks into VGGT's early-stage inference, effectively mitigating motion interference in both pose estimation and geometric reconstruction. Across six datasets, our method achieves superior performance in dynamic object segmentation, camera pose estimation, and dense reconstruction.

Many VAD models work without supervision but are still able to provide visual explanations by highlighting the anomalous regions within an image.

To address this limitation, we propose extending Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) to the VAD setting. By learning meaningful concepts, the network can provide human-interpretable descriptions of anomalies, offering a novel and more insightful way to explain them. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we develop a Concept Dataset to support research on CBMs for VAD; (ii) we improve the CBM architecture to generate both concept-based and visual explanations, bridging semantic and localization interpretability; and (iii) we introduce a pipeline for synthesizing artificial anomalies, preserving the VAD paradigm of minimizing dependence on rare anomalous samples.

We begin by exploring how input activations are affected by RLVR through the perspective of logit lens. Our systematic investigations across multiple post-trained LMMs suggest that RLVR shifts low-entropy activations unexpectedly, while high-entropy ones are less affected. We further demonstrate that such phenomena are associated with LMM reasoning by controlled experiments, suggesting a potentially beneficial role of modulating low-entropy activations. To this end, we propose Activation Replay, a novel simple yet effective training-free approach that boosts multimodal reasoning of post-trained LMMs without requiring expensive policy optimization. Our design involves manipulation of visual tokens at test time, replaying low-entropy activations from the input context of base LMMs to regulating the RLVR counterparts. Activation Replay triggers better reasoning across diverse scenarios, including mathematics, o3-like visual agents, and video reasoning. We further show that Activation Replay boosts Pass@K and mitigates narrower reasoning coverage of RLVR. Our design is compared against alternative choices, such as replaying high-entropy activations instead of low-entropy ones, or direct cross-model intervention instead of manipulating input tokens, demonstrating the superiority of our implementation.

As imaging volumes grow, scalable methods that can process entire lung volumes efficiently are essential to tap into the full potential of these large screening datasets.

We present LungEvaty, a fully transformer-based framework for predicting 1-6 year lung cancer risk from a single LDCT scan. The model operates on whole-lung inputs, learning directly from large-scale screening data to capture comprehensive anatomical and pathological cues relevant for malignancy risk.

For example, given a video sequence, such models are able to describe in detail objects, the surroundings and dynamic actions. In this study, we explored the extent to which these models ground their semantic understanding in the actual visual input. Specifically, given sequences of hands interacting with objects, we asked models when and where the interaction begins or ends. For this purpose, we introduce a first of its kind, large-scale dataset with more than 20K annotated interactions on videos from the Something-Something-V2 dataset. 250 AMTurk human annotators labeled core interaction events, particularly when and where objects and agents become attached ('contact') or detached ('release'). We asked two LMMs (Qwen-2.5VL and GPT-4o) to locate these events in short videos, each with a single event. The results show that although the models can reliably name the target objects, identify the action and provide coherent reasoning, they consistently fail to identify the frame where the interaction begins or ends and cannot localize the event within the scene.

While guidance-based methods in theory allow generic models to be used for inverse problems such as inpainting, in practice, their effectiveness is limited, leading to the necessity of specialized inpainting-specific models. In this work, we argue that the missing ingredient for training-free inpainting is the optimization (guidance) of the initial seed noise. We propose to optimize the initial seed noise to approximately match the unmasked parts of the data - with as few as a few tens of optimization steps. We then apply conventional training-free inpainting methods on top of our optimized initial seed noise. Critically, we propose two core ideas to effectively implement this idea: (i) to avoid the costly unrolling required to relate the initial noise and the generated outcome, we perform linear approximation; and (ii) to stabilize the optimization, we optimize the initial seed noise in the spectral domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various inpainting tasks, outperforming the state of the art.

This paper introduces a multimodal approach to VR gaze prediction that combines temporal gaze patterns, head movement data, and visual scene information. By leveraging a gated fusion mechanism with cross-modal attention, the approach learns to adaptively weight gaze history, head movement, and scene content based on contextual relevance. Evaluations using a dataset spanning 22 VR scenes with 5.3M gaze samples demonstrate improvements in predictive accuracy when combining modalities compared to using individual data streams alone. The results indicate that integrating past gaze trajectories with head orientation and scene content enhances prediction accuracy across 1-3 future frames.

This has led to a fragmented landscape: specialized, single-task models handle alpha but lack versatility, while unified multi-task frameworks are confined to the RGB domain. To bridge this critical gap, we propose OmniAlpha, the first unified, multi-task generative framework for sequence-to-sequence RGBA image generation and editing. Its architecture features MSRoPE-BiL, a novel RoPE method with a bi-directionally extendable layer axis for its Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, enabling the concurrent processing of multiple input and target RGBA layers. To power this framework, we introduce AlphaLayers, a new dataset of 1,000 high-quality, multi-layer triplets, built via a novel automated synthesis and filter pipeline. Jointly training OmniAlpha on this dataset across a comprehensive suite of 21 diverse tasks, extensive experiments demonstrate that our unified approach consistently outperforms strong, specialized baselines. Most notably, OmniAlpha achieves a dramatic 84.8% relative reduction in SAD for mask-free matting on AIM-500 and wins over 90% of human preferences in layer-conditioned completion.

This limitation arises because VAE-based latent compression inherently discards subtle texture information, causing identity- and attribute-specific cues to vanish. Moreover, post-editing approaches that amplify local details based on existing methods often produce results inconsistent with the original image in terms of lighting, texture, or shape. To address this, we introduce \\ourMthd{}, a detail-aware refinement framework that performs two consecutive stages of reference-driven correction to enhance pixel-level consistency. We first adapt a single-image diffusion editor by fine-tuning it to jointly ingest the draft image and the reference image, enabling globally coherent refinement while maintaining structural fidelity. We then apply reinforcement learning to further strengthen localized editing capability, explicitly optimizing for detail accuracy and semantic consistency.

To overcome this, we propose a novel two-stage pipeline that divides the problem into a front-end perception task and a back-end 2D-to-3D uplifting task. This separation allows us to train the front-end components with abundant 2D supervision from our newly created TTHQ dataset, while the back-end uplifting network is trained exclusively on physically-correct synthetic data. We specifically re-engineer the uplifting model to be robust to common real-world artifacts, such as missing detections and varying frame rates.

When it comes to representing and assessing creativity, treating it as a single undifferentiated quantity would appear naive and underwhelming. In this work, we learn the \\emph{first type-specific creativity reward model}, coined CREward, which spans three creativity ``axes,\" geometry, material, and texture, to allow us to view creativity through the lens of the image formation pipeline. To build our reward model, we first conduct a human benchmark evaluation to capture human perception of creativity for each type across various creative images. We then analyze the correlation between human judgments and predictions by large vision-language models (LVLMs), confirming that LVLMs exhibit strong alignment with human perception. Building on this observation, we collect LVLM-generated labels to train our CREward model that is applicable to both evaluation and generation of creative images.

The DaVinci Xi system overlays a graphical user interface (UI) that indicates the state of each robotic arm, including the activation of the endoscope arm. Detecting this activation provides valuable metadata such as camera movement information, which can support downstream surgical data science tasks including tool tracking, skill assessment, or camera control automation.\n  Methods: We developed a lightweight pipeline based on a ResNet18 convolutional neural network to automatically identify the position of the camera tile and its activation state within the DaVinci Xi UI. The model was fine-tuned on manually annotated data from the SurgToolLoc dataset and evaluated across three public datasets comprising over 70,000 frames.\n  Results: The model achieved F1-scores between 0.993 and 1.000 for the binary detection of active cameras and correctly localized the camera tile in all cases without false multiple-camera detections.\n  Conclusion: The proposed pipeline enables reliable, real-time extraction of camera activation metadata from surgical videos, facilitating automated preprocessing and analysis for diverse downstream applications.

(ii) The substantial storage costs of training a separate model for each setting in the case of multiple views hinder practical clinical applications. To address these issues, we elaborate an explicitly provable Lipschitz-constrained network, dubbed LipNet, and integrate an explicit prompt module to provide discriminative knowledge of different sparse sampling settings, enabling the treatment of multiple sparse view configurations within a single model. Furthermore, we develop a storage-saving deep unfolding framework for multiple-in-one SVCT reconstruction, termed PromptCT, which embeds LipNet as its prior network to ensure the convergence of its corresponding iterative algorithm. In simulated and real data experiments, PromptCT outperforms benchmark reconstruction algorithms in multiple-in-one SVCT reconstruction, achieving higher-quality reconstructions with lower storage costs. On the theoretical side, we explicitly demonstrate that LipNet satisfies boundary property, further proving its Lipschitz continuity and subsequently analyzing the convergence of the proposed iterative algorithms.

Understood the ability of neural networks to fit nonlinear problems from the perspective of PID. Considered a single-layer neural network as using a second-order difference equation and a nonlinearity to describe a local problem. Multilayer networks gradually transform the raw representation to the desired representation through multiple such combinations. Analysed some reference principles for designing neural networks. Designed a relatively small PID convolutional neural network, with a total of 17 layers and 413 thousand parameters. Implemented a simple but practical feature reuse method by concatenation and pooling. The network was trained and tested using the simulated randomly moving ball datasets, and the experimental results showed that the prediction accuracy was close to the upper limit that the input image resolution can represent.

However, effectively extracting and integrating complementary cues from different types of data remains one of the major challenges. This paper proposes an attention-guided cross-modal interaction Transformer (ACIT) for pedestrian crossing intention prediction. ACIT leverages six visual and motion modalities, which are grouped into three interaction pairs: (1) Global semantic map and global optical flow, (2) Local RGB image and local optical flow, and (3) Ego-vehicle speed and pedestrian's bounding box. Within each visual interaction pair, a dual-path attention mechanism enhances salient regions within the primary modality through intra-modal self-attention and facilitates deep interactions with the auxiliary modality (i.e., optical flow) via optical flow-guided attention. Within the motion interaction pair, cross-modal attention is employed to model the cross-modal dynamics, enabling the effective extraction of complementary motion features. Beyond pairwise interactions, a multi-modal feature fusion module further facilitates cross-modal interactions at each time step. Furthermore, a Transformer-based temporal feature aggregation module is introduced to capture sequential dependencies. Experimental results demonstrate that ACIT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy rates of 70% and 89% on the JAADbeh and JAADall datasets, respectively.

Existing fully-supervised IML methods depend heavily on dense pixel-level mask annotations, which limits scalability to large datasets or real-world deployment.In contrast, the majority of existing weakly-supervised IML approaches are based on image-level labels, which greatly reduce annotation effort but typically lack precise spatial localization. To address this dilemma, we propose BoxPromptIML, a novel weakly-supervised IML framework that effectively balances annotation cost and localization performance. Specifically, we propose a coarse region annotation strategy, which can generate relatively accurate manipulation masks at lower cost. To improve model efficiency and facilitate deployment, we further design an efficient lightweight student model, which learns to perform fine-grained localization through knowledge distillation from a fixed teacher model based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Moreover, inspired by the human subconscious memory mechanism, our feature fusion module employs a dual-guidance strategy that actively contextualizes recalled prototypical patterns with real-time observational cues derived from the input. Instead of passive feature extraction, this strategy enables a dynamic process of knowledge recollection, where long-term memory is adapted to the specific context of the current image, significantly enhancing localization accuracy and robustness.

Trained on extensive high-quality segmentation data, the segment anything model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable universal segmentation capabilities, offering valuable support for OVSS. Although previous methods have made progress in leveraging SAM for OVSS, there are still some challenges: (1) SAM's tendency to over-segment and (2) hard combinations between fixed masks and labels. This paper introduces a novel mask-injected framework, SAM-MI, which effectively integrates SAM with OVSS models to address these challenges. Initially, SAM-MI employs a Text-guided Sparse Point Prompter to sample sparse prompts for SAM instead of previous dense grid-like prompts, thus significantly accelerating the mask generation process. The framework then introduces Shallow Mask Aggregation (SMAgg) to merge partial masks to mitigate the SAM's over-segmentation issue. Finally, Decoupled Mask Injection (DMI) incorporates SAM-generated masks for guidance at low-frequency and high-frequency separately, rather than directly combining them with labels. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the superiority of SAM-MI. Notably, the proposed method achieves a 16.7% relative improvement in mIoU over Grounded-SAM on the MESS benchmark, along with a 1.6$\\times$ speedup.

Current approaches mainly focus on tracking objects in each frame of a video stream, making it almost impossible to run the model under conditions of limited computing resources. To address this issue, we propose StableTrack, a novel approach that stabilizes the quality of tracking on low-frequency detections. Our method introduces a new two-stage matching strategy to improve the cross-frame association between low-frequency detections.

We observe that although MLLMs can accurately extract visual semantics from visual tokens, they fail to fully leverage this advantage during subsequent inference. To address this limitation, we propose Vision-Guided Attention (VGA), a training-free method that first constructs precise visual grounding by exploiting the semantic content of visual tokens, and then uses this grounding to guide the model's focus toward relevant visual regions. In image captioning, VGA further refines this guidance dynamically during generation by suppressing regions that have already been described. In VGA, each token undergoes only a single forward pass, introducing a negligible latency overhead of just 4.36\\%. In addition, VGA is fully compatible with efficient attention implementations such as FlashAttention. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs and multiple hallucination benchmarks demonstrate that VGA achieves state-of-the-art dehallucination performance.

Block Cascading significantly mitigates this trade-off through training-free parallelization. Our key insight: future video blocks do not need fully denoised current blocks to begin generation. By starting block generation with partially denoised context from predecessors, we transform sequential pipelines into parallel cascades where multiple blocks denoise simultaneously. With 5 GPUs exploiting temporal parallelism, we achieve ~2x acceleration across all model scales: 1.3B models accelerate from 16 to 30 FPS, 14B models from 4.5 to 12.5 FPS. Beyond inference speed, Block Cascading eliminates overhead from KV-recaching (of ~200ms) during context switches for interactive generation. Extensive evaluations validated against multiple block-causal pipelines demonstrate no significant loss in generation quality when switching from block-causal to Block Cascading pipelines for inference.

Pruning redundant vision tokens for high VLM inference efficiency has been continuously studied but all existing methods resort to indirect and non-guaranteed ways. We propose OC-VTP, a direct and guaranteed approach to select the most representative vision tokens for high-efficiency yet accuracy-preserving VLM inference. Our OC-VTP requires merely light-weight pre-training of a small object-centric vision token pruner, which can then be inserted into existing VLMs, without fine-tuning of any models on any datasets. It is gauranteed that the most representative vision tokens are kept by minimizing the error in reconstructing the original unpruned tokens from the selected ones.

Finetuning and benchmarking these generative models have often relied on datasets of human-annotated design preferences. Yet, due to the subjective and highly personalized nature of visual design, preference varies widely among individuals. In this paper, we study this problem by introducing DesignPref, a dataset of 12k pairwise comparisons of UI design generation annotated by 20 professional designers with multi-level preference ratings. We found that among trained designers, substantial levels of disagreement exist (Krippendorff's alpha = 0.25 for binary preferences). Natural language rationales provided by these designers indicate that disagreements stem from differing perceptions of various design aspect importance and individual preferences. With DesignPref, we demonstrate that traditional majority-voting methods for training aggregated judge models often do not accurately reflect individual preferences. To address this challenge, we investigate multiple personalization strategies, particularly fine-tuning or incorporating designer-specific annotations into RAG pipelines. Our results show that personalized models consistently outperform aggregated baseline models in predicting individual designers' preferences, even when using 20 times fewer examples. Our work provides the first dataset to study personalized visual design evaluation and support future research into modeling individual design taste.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165DesignPref\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u95f4UI\u8bbe\u8ba1\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2a\u4f53\u504f\u597d\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u4e2a\u4f53\u504f\u597d\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86DesignPref\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b12k\u5bf9UI\u8bbe\u8ba1\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u753120\u4f4d\u4e13\u4e1a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u504f\u597d\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2a\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u504f\u597d\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u752820\u500d\u5c11\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165DesignPref\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e13\u4e1a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u4e4b\u95f4\u5728UI\u8bbe\u8ba1\u504f\u597d\u4e0a\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2a\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u504f\u597d\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

These factors limit image quality and hinder supervised blind super-resolution due to the lack of ground-truth images. This work presents History-Augmented Contrastive Blind Super-Resolution (HACBSR), an unsupervised framework for blind super-resolution that operates without ground-truth images and external kernel priors. HACBSR comprises two components: (1) a contrastive kernel sampling mechanism with kernel similarity control to mitigate distribution bias from Gaussian sampling, and (2) a history-augmented contrastive learning that uses historical models to generate negative samples to enable less greedy optimization and to induce strong convexity without ground-truth. A convergence analysis of the history-augmented contrastive learning is given in the Appendix. To support evaluation in planetary applications, we introduce Ceres-50, a dataset with diverse geological features simulated degradation patterns. Experiments show that HACBSR achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art unsupervised methods across multiple upscaling factors.

However, performance degradation persists due to uneven illumination inherent in endoscopic images, particularly in low-intensity regions. Existing low-light enhancement techniques fail to effectively guide the depth network. Furthermore, solutions from other fields, like autonomous driving, require well-lit images, making them unsuitable and increasing data collection burdens. To this end, we present DeLight-Mono - a novel self-supervised monocular depth estimation framework with illumination decoupling.

To address this, we propose FLaTEC, a frequency-aware compression model that enables the compression of a full scan with high compression ratios. Our approach introduces a frequency-aware mechanism that decouples low-frequency structures and high-frequency textures, while hybridizing latent triplanes as a compact proxy for point cloud. Specifically, we convert voxelized embeddings into triplane representations to reduce sparsity, computational cost, and storage requirements. We then devise a frequency-disentangling technique that extracts compact low-frequency content while collecting high-frequency details across scales. The decoupled low-frequency and high-frequency components are stored in binary format. During decoding, full-spectrum signals are progressively recovered via a modulation block. Additionally, to compensate for the loss of 3D correlation, we introduce an efficient frequency-based attention mechanism that fosters local connectivity and outputs arbitrary resolution points.

Second, we introduce a joint training scheme where the model is fine-tuned with an RL objective while the timestep distillation training continues simultaneously. We demonstrate that the stable, well-defined loss from the ongoing distillation acts as a powerful regularizer, effectively stabilizing the RL training process and preventing policy collapse. Extensive experiments on score-based and flow matching models show that our proposed Flash-DMD not only converges significantly faster but also achieves state-of-the-art generation quality in the few-step sampling regime, outperforming existing methods in visual quality, human preference, and text-image alignment metrics.

Leveraging the generation principle of large language models, they allow for efficiently generating deceptively real-looking images, further increasing the need for reliable detection methods. However, to date there is a lack of work specifically targeting the detection of images generated by AR image generators. In this work, we present PRADA (Probability-Ratio-Based Attribution and Detection of Autoregressive-Generated Images), a simple and interpretable approach that can reliably detect AR-generated images and attribute them to their respective source model. The key idea is to inspect the ratio of a model's conditional and unconditional probability for the autoregressive token sequence representing a given image. Whenever an image is generated by a particular model, its probability ratio shows unique characteristics which are not present for images generated by other models or real images. We exploit these characteristics for threshold-based attribution and detection by calibrating a simple, model-specific score function.

Existing methods typically address this problem by aligning visual content with textual descriptions at the task and step levels to inject procedural semantics into video representations. However, due to their high level of abstraction, 'task' and 'step' descriptions fail to form a robust alignment with the concrete, observable details in visual data. To address this, we introduce 'states', i.e., textual snapshots of object configurations, as a visually-grounded semantic layer that anchors abstract procedures to what a model can actually see. We formalize this insight in a novel Task-Step-State (TSS) framework, where tasks are achieved via steps that drive transitions between observable states. To enforce this structure, we propose a progressive pre-training strategy that unfolds the TSS hierarchy, forcing the model to ground representations in states while associating them with steps and high-level tasks. Extensive experiments on the COIN and CrossTask datasets show that our method outperforms baseline models on multiple downstream tasks, including task recognition, step recognition, and next step prediction. Ablation studies show that introducing state supervision is a key driver of performance gains across all tasks.

The dataset consisted of 3D full-body plug-in gait dynamic coordinates from 20 normal-weight healthy male individuals each performing 204 load-reaching tasks from different load positions while adapting various lifting and handling techniques. The model inputs consisted of the 3D position of the hand-load position, lifting (stoop, full-squat and semi-squat) and handling (one- and two-handed) techniques, body weight and height, and the 3D coordinate data of the body posture from the first 25% of the task duration. These inputs were used by the models to predict body coordinates during the remaining 75% of the task period. Moreover, a novel method was proposed to improve the accuracy of the previous and present posture prediction networks by enforcing constant body segment lengths through the optimization of a new cost function. The results indicated that the new cost function decreased the prediction error of the models by approximately 8% and 21% for the arm and leg models, respectively. We indicated that utilizing the transformer architecture, with a root-mean-square-error of 47.0 mm, exhibited ~58% more accurate long-term performance than the BLSTM-based model.

However, its clinical translation is hindered by inherent challenges: spatially varying noise arising from hardware limitations, and complex imaging protocols introduce heteroscedasticity in CEST data, perturbing the accuracy of quantitative contrast mapping such as amide proton transfer (APT) imaging. Traditional denoising methods are not designed for this complex noise and often alter the underlying information that is critical for biomedical analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new Blind Adaptive Local Denoising (BALD) method. BALD exploits the self-similar nature of CEST data to derive an adaptive variance-stabilizing transform that equalizes the noise distributions across CEST pixels without prior knowledge of noise characteristics. Then, BALD performs two-stage denoising on a linear transformation of data to disentangle molecular signals from noise. A local SVD decomposition is used as a linear transform to prevent spatial and spectral denoising artifacts. We conducted extensive validation experiments on multiple phantoms and \\textit{in vivo} CEST scans.

However, existing approaches often suffer from tight runtime coupling or depend on offline reward signals, resulting in substantial inference overhead or hindering end-to-end optimization. To overcome these limitations, we introduce WPT, a World-to-Policy Transfer training paradigm that enables online distillation under the guidance of an end-to-end world model. Specifically, we develop a trainable reward model that infuses world knowledge into a teacher policy by aligning candidate trajectories with the future dynamics predicted by the world model. Subsequently, we propose policy distillation and world reward distillation to transfer the teacher's reasoning ability into a lightweight student policy, enhancing planning performance while preserving real-time deployability. Extensive experiments on both open-loop and closed-loop benchmarks show that our WPT achieves state-of-the-art performance with a simple policy architecture: it attains a 0.11 collision rate (open-loop) and achieves a 79.23 driving score (closed-loop) surpassing both world-model-based and imitation-learning methods in accuracy and safety.

Open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD) addresses this limitation but remains underexplored in medical imaging due to dataset scarcity and weak text-image alignment. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedROV, the first Real-time Open Vocabulary detection model for medical imaging. To enable open-vocabulary learning, we curate a large-scale dataset, Omnis, with 600K detection samples across nine imaging modalities and introduce a pseudo-labeling strategy to handle missing annotations from multi-source datasets. Additionally, we enhance generalization by incorporating knowledge from a large pre-trained foundation model. By leveraging contrastive learning and cross-modal representations, MedROV effectively detects both known and novel structures. Experimental results demonstrate that MedROV outperforms the previous state-of-the-art foundation model for medical image detection with an average absolute improvement of 40 mAP50, and surpasses closed-set detectors by more than 3 mAP50, while running at 70 FPS, setting a new benchmark in medical detection.

This article explains an integrated approach to the use of deep learning tools and attention mechanisms for automatic detection of cardiomegaly using X-ray images. The initiation of the project is grounded on a strong Data Collection phase and gathering the data of annotated X-ray images of various types. Then, while the Preprocessing module fine-tunes image quality, it is feasible to utilize the best out of the data quality in the proposed system. In our proposed system, the process is a CNN configuration leveraging the inception V3 model as one of the key blocks. Besides, we also employ a multilayer attention mechanism to enhance the strength. The most important feature of the method is the multi-head attention mechanism that can learn features automatically. By exact selective focusing on only some regions of input, the model can thus identify cardiomegaly in a sensitive manner. Attention rating is calculated, duplicated, and applied to enhance representation of main data, and therefore there is a successful diagnosis.

We identify two failure modes: model-specific periodic content repetition and a universal quality degradation. Prior works attempt to solve repetition via positional encodings, overlooking quality degradation and achieving only limited extrapolation. In this paper, we revisit this challenge from a more fundamental view: attention maps, which directly govern how context influences outputs. We identify that both failure modes arise from a unified cause: attention dispersion, where tokens beyond the training window dilute learned attention patterns. This leads to quality degradation and repetition emerges as a special case when this dispersion becomes structured into periodic attention patterns, induced by harmonic properties of positional encodings. Building on this insight, we propose UltraViCo, a training-free, plug-and-play method that suppresses attention for tokens beyond the training window via a constant decay factor. By jointly addressing both failure modes, we outperform a broad set of baselines largely across models and extrapolation ratios, pushing the extrapolation limit from 2x to 4x. Remarkably, it improves Dynamic Degree and Imaging Quality by 233% and 40.5% over the previous best method at 4x extrapolation.

Compared with structural imaging (e.g., X-ray, CT, and MRI), functional PET poses distinct challenges: metabolic patterns vary with tracer physiology, and whole-body 3D contextual information is required rather than local-region interpretation. To advance PETRG, we propose PETRG-3D, an end-to-end 3D dual-branch framework that separately encodes PET and CT volumes and incorporates style-adaptive prompts to mitigate inter-hospital variability in reporting practices. We construct PETRG-Lym, a multi-center lymphoma dataset collected from four hospitals (824 reports w/ 245,509 paired PET/CT slices), and construct AutoPET-RG-Lym, a publicly accessible PETRG benchmark derived from open imaging data but equipped with new expert-written, clinically validated reports (135 cases). To assess clinical utility, we introduce PETRG-Score, a lymphoma-specific evaluation protocol that jointly measures metabolic and structural findings across curated anatomical regions. Experiments show that PETRG-3D substantially outperforms existing methods on both natural language metrics (e.g., +31.49\\% ROUGE-L) and clinical efficacy metrics (e.g., +8.18\\% PET-All), highlighting the benefits of volumetric dual-modality modeling and style-aware prompting.

In this work we propose HCFSSNet, a Hybrid Convolution and Frequency State Space Network for LIC. HCFSSNet uses CNNs to extract local high frequency structures and introduces a Vision Frequency State Space (VFSS) block that models long range low frequency information. The VFSS block combines an Omni directional Neighborhood State Space (VONSS) module, which scans features horizontally, vertically and diagonally, with an Adaptive Frequency Modulation Module (AFMM) that applies content adaptive weighting of discrete cosine transform frequency components for more efficient bit allocation. To further reduce redundancy in the entropy model, we integrate AFMM with a Swin Transformer to form a Frequency Swin Transformer Attention Module (FSTAM) for frequency aware side information modeling. Experiments on the Kodak, Tecnick and CLIC Professional Validation datasets show that HCFSSNet achieves competitive rate distortion performance compared with recent SSM based codecs such as MambaIC, while using significantly fewer parameters.

The recently proposed SKEL model addresses this limitation by re-rigging SMPL with an anatomically accurate skeleton. However, estimating SKEL parameters directly remains challenging due to limited training data, perspective ambiguities, and the inherent complexity of human articulation. We introduce SKEL-CF, a coarse-to-fine framework for SKEL parameter estimation. SKEL-CF employs a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder predicts coarse camera and SKEL parameters, and the decoder progressively refines them in successive layers. To ensure anatomically consistent supervision, we convert the existing SMPL-based dataset 4DHuman into a SKEL-aligned version, 4DHuman-SKEL, providing high-quality training data for SKEL estimation. In addition, to mitigate depth and scale ambiguities, we explicitly incorporate camera modeling into the SKEL-CF pipeline and demonstrate its importance across diverse viewpoints. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed design. On the challenging MOYO dataset, SKEL-CF achieves 85.0 MPJPE / 51.4 PA-MPJPE, significantly outperforming the previous SKEL-based state-of-the-art HSMR (104.5 / 79.6).

This critical oversight ignores the fact that real-world MLLMs inherently require such mechanisms to mitigate potential risks. In this work, we shift our focus to CVIT for safety-aligned MLLMs and observe that during continual adaptation, the model not only suffers from task forgetting but also exhibits degradation in its safety. Achieving a harmonious balance between safety and task performance remains a crucial challenge. To address this, we propose Harmonious Parameter Adaptation (HPA), a post-training framework composed of focusing-based parameter partition, harmoniously balanced parameter selection, and orthogonal parameter adjustment. Specifically, HPA partitions parameters into two types based on their focus on safety or task performance, and selects the focused ones to preserve from a balanced perspective.

Existing anomaly detection benchmarks (e.g., MVTec-AD with 15 categories) cover only a narrow range of categories, limiting the evaluation of cross-context generalization and scalability. We introduce ADNet, a large-scale, multi-domain benchmark comprising 380 categories aggregated from 49 publicly available datasets across Electronics, Industry, Agrifood, Infrastructure, and Medical domains. The benchmark includes a total of 196,294 RGB images, consisting of 116,192 normal samples for training and 80,102 test images, of which 60,311 are anomalous. All images are standardized with MVTec-style pixel-level annotations and structured text descriptions spanning both spatial and visual attributes, enabling multimodal anomaly detection tasks.

In this work, we introduce Exo2EgoSyn, an adaptation of WAN 2.2 that unlocks Exocentric-to-Egocentric(Exo2Ego) cross-view video synthesis. Our framework consists of three key modules. Ego-Exo View Alignment(EgoExo-Align) enforces latent-space alignment between exocentric and egocentric first-frame representations, reorienting the generative space from the given exo view toward the ego view. Multi-view Exocentric Video Conditioning (MultiExoCon) aggregates multi-view exocentric videos into a unified conditioning signal, extending WAN2.2 beyond its vanilla single-image or text conditioning. Furthermore, Pose-Aware Latent Injection (PoseInj) injects relative exo-to-ego camera pose information into the latent state, guiding geometry-aware synthesis across viewpoints. Together, these modules enable high-fidelity ego view video generation from third-person observations without retraining from scratch. Experiments on ExoEgo4D validate that Exo2EgoSyn significantly improves Ego2Exo synthesis, paving the way for scalable cross-view video generation with foundation models.

Subsequently, the constructed image-prompt pairs are utilized to finetune Stable Diffusion, incorporating a lightweight controller to guide the location and shape of camouflaged objects for enhanced camouflage scene fitness. Moreover, we design a Frequency Interaction Refinement Module (FIRM) to capture high-frequency texture features, facilitating the learning of complex camouflage patterns. Extensive experiments, including CLIPScore evaluation and camouflage effectiveness assessment, demonstrate the semantic alignment of our generated text prompts and CT-CIG's ability to produce photorealistic camouflage images.", "AI": {"tldr": "CT-CIG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u63a7\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4f2a\u88c5\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6269\u6563\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u903b\u8f91\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u903c\u771f\u7684\u4f2a\u88c5\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f2a\u88c5\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u5ffd\u7565\u4f2a\u88c5\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u73af\u5883\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u5173\u7cfb\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u7136\u7ed3\u679c\uff0cCT-CIG\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f2a\u88c5\u63ed\u793a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u673a\u5236\uff08CRDM\uff09\u6807\u6ce8\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03Stable Diffusion\u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u6307\u5bfc\u4f2a\u88c5\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9891\u7387\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ec6\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff08FIRM\uff09\u6355\u6349\u9ad8\u9891\u7eb9\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e14CT-CIG\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u7684\u4f2a\u88c5\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "conclusion": "CT-CIG\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6269\u6563\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u903b\u8f91\u5408\u7406\u7684\u4f2a\u88c5\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u4f2a\u88c5\u6548\u679c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing methods struggle with controllability and fail to precisely manipulate the semantics of specific concepts in the image. We attribute this limitation to semantic entanglement in the patch-token representations on which adversarial attacks typically operate: global context aggregated by self-attention in the vision encoder dominates individual patch features, making them unreliable handles for precise local semantic manipulation. Our systematic investigation reveals a key insight: value features (V) computed within the transformer attention block serve as much more precise handles for manipulation. We show that V suppresses global-context channels, allowing it to retain high-entropy, disentangled local semantic information. Building on this discovery, we propose V-Attack, a novel method designed for precise local semantic attacks. V-Attack targets the value features and introduces two core components: (1) a Self-Value Enhancement module to refine V's intrinsic semantic richness, and (2) a Text-Guided Value Manipulation module that leverages text prompts to locate source concept and optimize it toward a target concept. By bypassing the entangled patch features, V-Attack achieves highly effective semantic control. Extensive experiments across diverse LVLMs, including LLaVA, InternVL, DeepseekVL and GPT-4o, show that V-Attack improves the attack success rate by an average of 36% over state-of-the-art methods, exposing critical vulnerabilities in modern visual-language understanding.

These models are typically data-intensive, a challenge that becomes more pronounced when dealing with diverse and complex images. In this work, we propose HistoSpeckle-Net, a deep learning architecture designed to reconstruct structurally rich medical images from MMF speckles. To build a clinically relevant dataset, we develop an optical setup that couples laser light through a spatial light modulator (SLM) into an MMF, capturing output speckle patterns corresponding to input OrganAMNIST images. Unlike previous MMF imaging approaches, which have not considered the underlying statistics of speckles and reconstructed images, we introduce a distribution-aware learning strategy. We employ a histogram-based mutual information loss to enhance model robustness and reduce reliance on large datasets. Our model includes a histogram computation unit that estimates smooth marginal and joint histograms for calculating mutual information loss. It also incorporates a unique Three-Scale Feature Refinement Module, which leads to multiscale Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) loss computation. Together, these two loss functions enhance both the structural fidelity and statistical alignment of the reconstructed images. Our experiments on the complex OrganAMNIST dataset demonstrate that HistoSpeckle-Net achieves higher fidelity than baseline models such as U-Net and Pix2Pix. It gives superior performance even with limited training samples and across varying fiber bending conditions.

However, how these models behave under long prompts remains underexplored. Long prompts encode rich content, spatial, and stylistic information that enhances fidelity but often suppresses diversity, leading to repetitive and less creative outputs. In this work, we systematically study this fidelity-diversity dilemma and reveal that state-of-the-art models exhibit a clear drop in diversity as prompt length increases. To enable consistent evaluation, we introduce LPD-Bench, a benchmark designed for assessing both fidelity and diversity in long-prompt generation. Building on our analysis, we develop a theoretical framework that increases sampling entropy through prompt reformulation and propose a training-free method, PromptMoG, which samples prompt embeddings from a Mixture-of-Gaussians in the embedding space to enhance diversity while preserving semantics.

Real-world environments demand models capable of recognizing diverse, previously unseen objects, which remains a major limitation of closed-set methods. Existing open-vocabulary 3D detectors relax annotation requirements but still depend on training scenes, either as point clouds or images. We take this a step further by introducing Zoo3D, the first training-free 3D object detection framework. Our method constructs 3D bounding boxes via graph clustering of 2D instance masks, then assigns semantic labels using a novel open-vocabulary module with best-view selection and view-consensus mask generation. Zoo3D operates in two modes: the zero-shot Zoo3D$_0$, which requires no training at all, and the self-supervised Zoo3D$_1$, which refines 3D box prediction by training a class-agnostic detector on Zoo3D$_0$-generated pseudo labels. Furthermore, we extend Zoo3D beyond point clouds to work directly with posed and even unposed images. Across ScanNet200 and ARKitScenes benchmarks, both Zoo3D$_0$ and Zoo3D$_1$ achieve state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary 3D object detection. Remarkably, our zero-shot Zoo3D$_0$ outperforms all existing self-supervised methods, hence demonstrating the power and adaptability of training-free, off-the-shelf approaches for real-world 3D understanding.

Most current RL approaches depend on pre-trained preference models that output scalar rewards to approximate human preferences. However, these rewards often fail to capture human perception and are vulnerable to reward hacking, where higher scores do not correspond to better images. To address this, we introduce Adv-GRPO, an RL framework with an adversarial reward that iteratively updates both the reward model and the generator. The reward model is supervised using reference images as positive samples and can largely avoid being hacked. Unlike KL regularization that constrains parameter updates, our learned reward directly guides the generator through its visual outputs, leading to higher-quality images. Moreover, while optimizing existing reward functions can alleviate reward hacking, their inherent biases remain. For instance, PickScore may degrade image quality, whereas OCR-based rewards often reduce aesthetic fidelity. To address this, we take the image itself as a reward, using reference images and vision foundation models (e.g., DINO) to provide rich visual rewards. These dense visual signals, instead of a single scalar, lead to consistent gains across image quality, aesthetics, and task-specific metrics. Finally, we show that combining reference samples with foundation-model rewards enables distribution transfer and flexible style customization.

To address this issue, we propose MBCD, a unified collaborative distillation framework that retains WA's flatness-inducing advantages while overcoming its shortcomings in multi-modal contexts.

Conventional classification approaches typically train models to directly predict class labels from input images, but this might lead to suboptimal performance in such scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Discrete Diffusion Classification Modeling (DiDiCM), a novel framework that leverages a diffusion-based procedure to model the posterior distribution of class labels conditioned on the input image. DiDiCM supports diffusion-based predictions either on class probabilities or on discrete class labels, providing flexibility in computation and memory trade-offs. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study demonstrating the superior performance of DiDiCM over standard classifiers, showing that a few diffusion iterations achieve higher classification accuracy on the ImageNet dataset compared to baselines, with accuracy gains increasing as the task becomes more challenging.

The same holds for retrieving the image embedding (image retrieval task) given a text prompt. However, real-world scene images exhibit rich compositional structure involving multiple objects and actions. The latest methods in the CLIP-based literature improve class-level discrimination by mining harder negative image-text pairs and by refining permanent text prompts, often using LLMs. However, these improvements remain confined to predefined class lists and do not explicitly model relational or compositional structure. PyramidCLIP partially addresses this gap by aligning global and local visual features, yet it still lacks explicit modeling of inter-object relations. Hence, to further leverage this aspect for scene analysis, the proposed ScenarioCLIP model accepts input texts, grounded relations, and input images, along with focused regions highlighting relations. The proposed model is pretrained on curated scenario data, and finetuned for specialized downstream tasks, such as cross-modal retrieval and fine-grained visual understanding tasks. To address the lack of domain-specific datasets, we generate a novel dataset by extending image-text pairs from existing diverse indoor and outdoor scenario datasets that are publicly available. We used a pipeline of existing language models to ground action, object, and relations, filled by manual and automatic curation. We established a comprehensive benchmark for several scenario-based tasks and compared it with many baseline methods.

Existing methods either suffer from limited receptive fields or quadratic complexity due to using CNNs or vision Transformers. In this paper, we present the first work that studies the adaptability of State Space Models (SSMs) in DA PCC and find that directly applying SSMs to DA PCC will encounter several challenges: directly serializing 3D point clouds into 1D sequences often disrupts the spatial topology and local geometric features of the target domain. Besides, the overlook of designs in the learning domain-agnostic representations hinders the adaptation performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, DAPointMamba for DA PCC, that exhibits strong adaptability across domains and has the advantages of global receptive fields and efficient linear complexity. It has three novel modules. In particular, Cross-Domain Patch-Level Scanning introduces patch-level geometric correspondences, enabling effective local alignment. Cross-Domain Spatial SSM Alignment further strengthens spatial consistency by modulating patch features based on cross-domain similarity, effectively mitigating fine-grained structural discrepancies. Cross-Domain Channel SSM Alignment actively addresses global semantic gaps by interleaving and aligning feature channels.

Recent approaches aim to mitigate these issues by (i) employing advanced denoising or label assignment strategies, or (ii) incorporating detection priors from external object detectors via distillation or anchor proposal techniques. Inspired by the success of integrating detection priors and by the key insight that MOTR-like models are secretly strong detection models, we introduce SelfMOTR, a novel tracking transformer that relies on self-generated detection priors. Through extensive analysis and ablation studies, we uncover and demonstrate the hidden detection capabilities of MOTR-like models, and present a practical set of tools for leveraging them effectively. On DanceTrack, SelfMOTR achieves strong performance, competing with recent state-of-the-art end-to-end tracking methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "SelfMOTR\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u68c0\u6d4b\u5148\u9a8c\u63d0\u5347MOTR\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728DanceTrack\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u53ca\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5173\u8054\u5728\u8054\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u4ecd\u662f\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SelfMOTR\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u68c0\u6d4b\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8ddf\u8e2a\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728DanceTrack\u4e0a\uff0cSelfMOTR\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u65b0\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ade\u4e89\u3002", "conclusion": "SelfMOTR\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u8eab\u751f\u6210\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86MOTR\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728DanceTrack\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4e0e\u6700\u65b0\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

They highlight the decisive features the model relies on, providing contrastive interpretations for classifiers. State-of-the-art visual counterfactual explanation methods are designed to explain image classifiers. The generation of CFEs for video classifiers remains largely underexplored. For the counterfactual videos to be useful, they have to be physically plausible, temporally coherent, and exhibit smooth motion trajectories. Existing CFE image-based methods, designed to explain image classifiers, lack the capacity to generate temporally coherent, smooth and physically plausible video CFEs. To address this, we propose Back To The Feature (BTTF), an optimization framework that generates video CFEs. Our method introduces two novel features, 1) an optimization scheme to retrieve the initial latent noise conditioned by the first frame of the input video, 2) a two-stage optimization strategy to enable the search for counterfactual videos in the vicinity of the input video. Both optimization processes are guided solely by the target classifier, ensuring the explanation is faithful. To accelerate convergence, we also introduce a progressive optimization strategy that incrementally increases the number of denoising steps. Extensive experiments on video datasets such as Shape-Moving (motion classification), MEAD (emotion classification), and NTU RGB+D (action classification) show that our BTTF effectively generates valid, visually similar and realistic counterfactual videos that provide concrete insights into the classifier's decision-making mechanism.", "AI": {"tldr": "BTTF\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Back To The Feature (BTTF)\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u7279\u5f81\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165\u89c6\u9891\u7b2c\u4e00\u5e27\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u6f5c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff1b2) \u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u89c6\u9891\u9644\u8fd1\u641c\u7d22\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89c6\u9891\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Shape-Moving\u3001MEAD\u548cNTU RGB+D\u7b49\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBTTF\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u4e14\u903c\u771f\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "conclusion": "BTTF\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u4e14\u903c\u771f\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Most previous methods rely solely on mask supervision, which effectively guides spatial localization but provides limited constraints on the temporal semantic transitions. Consequently, they often produce spatially coherent predictions while still suffering from unresolved semantic inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we propose TaCo, a spatio-temporal semantic consistent network, which enriches the existing mask-supervised framework with a spatio-temporal semantic joint constraint. TaCo conceptualizes change as a semantic transition between bi-temporal states, in which one temporal feature representation can be derived from the other via dedicated transition features. To realize this, we introduce a Text-guided Transition Generator that integrates textual semantics with bi-temporal visual features to construct the cross-temporal transition features. In addition, we propose a spatio-temporal semantic joint constraint consisting of bi-temporal reconstruct constraints and a transition constraint: the former enforces alignment between reconstructed and original features, while the latter enhances discrimination for changes.

In this paper, we analyze these challenges and propose TReFT, a novel method to Tame Rectified Flow models for one-step image Translation. Unlike previous works, TReFT directly uses the velocity predicted by pretrained DiT or UNet as output-a simple yet effective design that tackles the convergence issues under adversarial training with one-step inference. This design is mainly motivated by a novel observation that, near the end of the denoising process, the velocity predicted by pretrained RF models converges to the vector from origin to the final clean image, a property we further justify through theoretical analysis. When applying TReFT to large pretrained RF models such as SD3.5 and FLUX, we introduce memory-efficient latent cycle-consistency and identity losses during training, as well as lightweight architectural simplifications for faster inference.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising path to overcome these limitations, yet its success in autonomous driving has been elusive. We identify a fundamental flaw hindering this progress: a deep seated optimistic bias in the world models used for RL. To address this, we introduce a framework for post-training policy refinement built around an Impartial World Model. Our primary contribution is to teach this model to be honest about danger. We achieve this with a novel data synthesis pipeline, Counterfactual Synthesis, which systematically generates a rich curriculum of plausible collisions and off-road events. This transforms the model from a passive scene completer into a veridical forecaster that remains faithful to the causal link between actions and outcomes. We then integrate this Impartial World Model into our closed-loop RL framework, where it serves as an internal critic. During refinement, the agent queries the critic to ``dream\" of the outcomes for candidate actions. We demonstrate through extensive experiments, including on a new Risk Foreseeing Benchmark, that our model significantly outperforms baselines in predicting failures. Consequently, when used as a critic, it enables a substantial reduction in safety violations in challenging simulations, proving that teaching a model to dream of danger is a critical step towards building truly safe and intelligent autonomous agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5408\u6210\u548c\u516c\u6b63\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76RL\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u957f\u5c3e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5904\u7406\u957f\u5c3e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u56e0\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e50\u89c2\u504f\u89c1\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u6210\u529f\u7684\u6839\u672c\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u516c\u6b63\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u548c\u504f\u79bb\u9053\u8def\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u88ab\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u8865\u5168\u8005\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u5fe0\u5b9e\u9884\u6d4b\u884c\u52a8\u4e0e\u7ed3\u679c\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u9884\u6d4b\u8005\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5931\u8d25\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u516c\u6b63\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u957f\u5c3e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u2018\u9884\u89c1\u5371\u9669\u2019\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u771f\u6b63\u5b89\u5168\u667a\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present a deep learning framework that predicts a 4-point parameterized homography matrix to rectify shelf images captured from arbitrary angles. Our model leverages a ConvNeXt-based backbone for enhanced feature representation and adopts normalized coordinate regression for improved stability. To address data scarcity and promote generalization, we introduce a novel augmentation strategy by modeling and sampling synthetic homographies. Our method achieves a mean corner error of 1.298 pixels on the test set.

How can we develop embodied visual search agents as efficient as humans while bypassing the constraints imposed by real-world hardware? To this end, we propose humanoid visual search where a humanoid agent actively rotates its head to search for objects or paths in an immersive world represented by a 360\u00b0 panoramic image. To study visual search in visually-crowded real-world scenarios, we build H* Bench, a new benchmark that moves beyond household scenes to challenging in-the-wild scenes that necessitate advanced visual-spatial reasoning capabilities, such as transportation hubs, large-scale retail spaces, urban streets, and public institutions. Our experiments first reveal that even top-tier proprietary models falter, achieving only ~30% success in object and path search. We then use post-training techniques to enhance the open-source Qwen2.5-VL, increasing its success rate by over threefold for both object search (14.83% to 47.38%) and path search (6.44% to 24.94%).

Existing methods either require tedious manual efforts, lack generalization to in-the-wild data, or are constrained by the limited expressiveness of 3D Morphable Models. To address these limitations, we propose VGGTFace, an automatic approach that innovatively applies the 3D foundation model, \\emph{i.e.} VGGT, for topologically consistent facial geometry reconstruction from in-the-wild multi-view images captured by everyday users. Our key insight is that, by leveraging VGGT, our method naturally inherits strong generalization ability and expressive power from its large-scale training and point map representation. However, it is unclear how to reconstruct a topologically consistent mesh from VGGT, as the topology information is missing in its prediction. To this end, we augment VGGT with Pixel3DMM for injecting topology information via pixel-aligned UV values. In this manner, we convert the pixel-aligned point map of VGGT to a point cloud with topology. Tailored to this point cloud with known topology, we propose a novel Topology-Aware Bundle Adjustment strategy to fuse them, where we construct a Laplacian energy for the Bundle Adjustment objective. Our method achieves high-quality reconstruction in 10 seconds for 16 views on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090.

Recent speculative inference methods enable lossless parallel sampling in U-Net-based diffusion models via a drafter-verifier scheme, but their acceleration is limited on DiTs due to insufficient draft accuracy during verification. To address this limitation, we analyze the DiTs' feature dynamics and find the features of the final transformer layer (top-block) exhibit strong temporal consistency and rich semantic abstraction. Based on this insight, we propose FREE, a novel framework that employs a lightweight drafter to perform feature-level autoregression with parallel verification, guaranteeing lossless acceleration with theoretical and empirical support. Meanwhile, prediction variance (uncertainty) of DiTs naturally increases in later denoising steps, reducing acceptance rates under speculative sampling. To mitigate this effect, we further introduce an uncertainty-guided relaxation strategy, forming FREE (relax), which dynamically adjusts the acceptance probability in response to uncertainty levels. Experiments on ImageNet-$512^2$ show that FREE achieves up to $1.86 \\times$ acceleration, and FREE (relax) further reaches $2.25 \\times$ speedup while maintaining high perceptual and quantitative fidelity in generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "FREE\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u677e\u5f1b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901fDiTs\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe2.25\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3DiTs\u56e0\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u53bb\u566a\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347drafter-verifier\u65b9\u6848\u5728DiTs\u4e0a\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFREE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7drafter\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u677e\u5f1b\u7b56\u7565\uff08FREE (relax)\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u63a5\u53d7\u6982\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet-$512^2$\u4e0a\uff0cFREE\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad81.86\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0cFREE (relax)\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u81f32.25\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3002", "conclusion": "FREE\u548cFREE (relax)\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u677e\u5f1b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86DiTs\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Given the ID images of multiple individuals, its purpose is to generate a customized image that seamlessly integrates them while preserving their respective identities. Compared to single-ID customization, multi-ID customization is much more difficult and poses two major challenges. First, since the multi-ID customization model is trained to reconstruct an image from the cropped person regions, it often encounters the copy-paste issue during inference, leading to lower quality. Second, the model also suffers from inferior text controllability. The generated result simply combines multiple persons into one image, regardless of whether it is aligned with the input text. In this work, we propose MultiID to tackle this challenging task in a training-free manner. Since the existing single-ID customization models have less copy-paste issue, our key idea is to adapt these models to achieve multi-ID customization. To this end, we present an ID-decoupled cross-attention mechanism, injecting distinct ID embeddings into the corresponding image regions and thus generating multi-ID outputs. To enhance the generation controllability, we introduce three critical strategies, namely the local prompt, depth-guided spatial control, and extended self-attention, making the results more consistent with the text prompts and ID images. We also carefully build a benchmark, called IDBench, for evaluation. The extensive qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of MultiID in solving the aforementioned two challenges. Its performance is comparable or even better than the training-based multi-ID customization methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "MultiID\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u7684\u591aID\u5b9a\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ID\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u590d\u5236\u7c98\u8d34\u548c\u6587\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u591aID\u5b9a\u5236\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u8bdd\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u590d\u5236\u7c98\u8d34\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u6587\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ID\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u7684ID\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e09\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "result": "MultiID\u5728\u5b9a\u6027\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591aID\u5b9a\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "MultiID\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591aID\u5b9a\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u5236\u7c98\u8d34\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u6587\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591aID\u5b9a\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The Consistency Model (CM), as a trajectory-based framework, demonstrates significant potential due to its strong theoretical foundation and high-quality few-step generation. Nevertheless, current continuous-time consistency distillation methods still rely heavily on training data and computational resources, hindering their deployment in resource-constrained scenarios and limiting their scalability to diverse domains. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory-Backward Consistency Model (TBCM), which eliminates the dependence on external training data by extracting latent representations directly from the teacher model's generation trajectory. Unlike conventional methods that require VAE encoding and large-scale datasets, our self-contained distillation paradigm significantly improves both efficiency and simplicity. Moreover, the trajectory-extracted samples naturally bridge the distribution gap between training and inference, thereby enabling more effective knowledge transfer. Empirically, TBCM achieves 6.52 FID and 28.08 CLIP scores on MJHQ-30k under one-step generation, while reducing training time by approximately 40% compared to Sana-Sprint and saving a substantial amount of GPU memory, demonstrating superior efficiency without sacrificing quality. We further reveal the diffusion-generation space discrepancy in continuous-time consistency distillation and analyze how sampling strategies affect distillation performance, offering insights for future distillation research.

We introduce MajutsuCity, a natural language-driven and aesthetically adaptive framework for synthesizing structurally consistent and stylistically diverse 3D urban scenes. MajutsuCity represents a city as a composition of controllable layouts, assets, and materials, and operates through a four-stage pipeline. To extend controllability beyond initial generation, we further integrate MajutsuAgent, an interactive language-grounded editing agent} that supports five object-level operations. To support photorealistic and customizable scene synthesis, we also construct MajutsuDataset, a high-quality multimodal dataset} containing 2D semantic layouts and height maps, diverse 3D building assets, and curated PBR materials and skyboxes, each accompanied by detailed annotations. Meanwhile, we develop a practical set of evaluation metrics, covering key dimensions such as structural consistency, scene complexity, material fidelity, and lighting atmosphere. Extensive experiments demonstrate MajutsuCity reduces layout FID by 83.7% compared with CityDreamer and by 20.1% over CityCraft. Our method ranks first across all AQS and RDR scores, outperforming existing methods by a clear margin.

To enable machines to understand such complex, context-dependent behaviors, it is essential to model multiple people in relation to the surrounding scene context. In this paper, we present a novel research problem to model the correlations between two people engaged in a shared interaction involving an object. We refer to this formulation as Human-Human-Object Interactions (HHOIs). To overcome the lack of dedicated datasets for HHOIs, we present a newly captured HHOIs dataset and a method to synthesize HHOI data by leveraging image generative models. As an intermediary, we obtain individual human-object interaction (HOIs) and human-human interaction (HHIs) from the HHOIs, and with these data, we train an text-to-HOI and text-to-HHI model using score-based diffusion model. Finally, we present a unified generative framework that integrates the two individual model, capable of synthesizing complete HHOIs in a single advanced sampling process.

However, current remote sensing foundation models are ill-suited to such inputs: full-image encoding exhausts token and memory budgets, while resize-based preprocessing loses fine-grained and answer-critical details. In this context, guiding the model look where it matters before prediction becomes crucial. Therefore, we present ZoomSearch, a training-free, plug-and-play pipeline that decouples 'where to look' from 'how to answer' for Ultra-HR Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (RS-VQA). ZoomSearch combines Adaptive Multi-Branch Zoom Search, which performs a hierarchical search over image patches to localize query-relevant regions, with Layout-Aware Patch Reassembly, which reorganizes the selected patches into a compact, layout-faithful canvas. We conduct comprehensive experiments on Ultra-HR RS-VQA benchmarks MME-RealWorld-RS and LRS-VQA, comparing against (i) strong general foundation models, (ii) remote sensing foundation models, (iii) Ultra-HR RS-VQA methods, and (iv) plug-and-play search-based VQA methods. When integrated with LLaVA-ov, ZoomSearch attains state-of-the-art accuracy across diverse tasks, improving the LLaVA-ov baseline by 26.3% on LRS-VQA and 114.8\\% on MME-RealWorld-RS.

Yet in the video generation domain, where spatiotemporal complexity and computational cost are substantially higher, state-of-the-art systems almost exclusively rely on diffusion-based models. In this work, we revisit this design space by presenting STARFlow-V, a normalizing flow-based video generator with substantial benefits such as end-to-end learning, robust causal prediction, and native likelihood estimation. Building upon the recently proposed STARFlow, STARFlow-V operates in the spatiotemporal latent space with a global-local architecture which restricts causal dependencies to a global latent space while preserving rich local within-frame interactions. This eases error accumulation over time, a common pitfall of standard autoregressive diffusion model generation. Additionally, we propose flow-score matching, which equips the model with a light-weight causal denoiser to improve the video generation consistency in an autoregressive fashion. To improve the sampling efficiency, STARFlow-V employs a video-aware Jacobi iteration scheme that recasts inner updates as parallelizable iterations without breaking causality. Thanks to the invertible structure, the same model can natively support text-to-video, image-to-video as well as video-to-video generation tasks. Empirically, STARFlow-V achieves strong visual fidelity and temporal consistency with practical sampling throughput relative to diffusion-based baselines.

We propose temporal-spatial descriptors inspired by Laban Movement Analysis. These features capture local joint dynamics such as velocity, acceleration, and angular movement of the upper body, enabling a structured representation of spatial coordination.

This formulation introduces a physics-based regularization term that enforces smooth contour evolution and structural consistency, allowing the network to better capture fine vascular geometry. The proposed loss is integrated into several segmentation architectures, including U-Net, U-Net++, SegFormer, and MedFormer, and evaluated on two public benchmarks: DIAS and DSCA. Experimental results demonstrate that PIL consistently outperforms conventional loss functions such as Cross-Entropy, Dice, Active Contour, and Surface losses, achieving superior sensitivity, F1 score, and boundary coherence. These findings confirm that the incorporation of physics-based boundary interactions into deep neural networks improves both the precision and robustness of vascular segmentation in dynamic angiographic imaging.

However, recent advanced methods such as BAGEL and LMFusion follow the Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) paradigm, adopting a symmetric design that mirrors one expert to another for convenient initialization and fusion, which remains suboptimal due to inherent modality discrepancies. In this work, we propose HBridge, an asymmetric H-shaped architecture that enables heterogeneous experts to optimally leverage pretrained priors from their respective modality domains. Unlike prior dense fusion strategies that straightforwardly connect all layers between experts via shared attention, HBridge selectively bridges intermediate layers, reducing over 40% attention sharing, which improves efficiency and enhances generation quality. Shallow and deep layers, which capture modality-specific representations, are decoupled, while mid-layer bridging promotes semantic alignment. To further strengthen cross-modal coherence, we introduce semantic reconstruction tokens that explicitly guide the generative expert to reconstruct visual semantic tokens of the target image.

From Analysis to Path Forward", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent years have witnessed significant progress in Unified Multimodal Models, yet a fundamental question remains: Does understanding truly inform generation? To investigate this, we introduce UniSandbox, a decoupled evaluation framework paired with controlled, synthetic datasets to avoid data leakage and enable detailed analysis. Our findings reveal a significant understanding-generation gap, which is mainly reflected in two key dimensions: reasoning generation and knowledge transfer. Specifically, for reasoning generation tasks, we observe that explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in the understanding module effectively bridges the gap, and further demonstrate that a self-training approach can successfully internalize this ability, enabling implicit reasoning during generation. Additionally, for knowledge transfer tasks, we find that CoT assists the generative process by helping retrieve newly learned knowledge, and also discover that query-based architectures inherently exhibit latent CoT-like properties that affect this transfer. UniSandbox provides preliminary insights for designing future unified architectures and training strategies that truly bridge the gap between understanding and generation.

Experiments across single- and multi-condition scenarios show consistent gains in instruction fidelity, caption accuracy, and downstream video quality, with strong generalization to reasoning-intensive and unseen inputs.

However, existing tokenizers are typically trained from scratch and struggle to balance semantic representation and reconstruction fidelity, particularly in high-dimensional latent spaces. In this work, we introduce DINO-Tok, a DINO-based visual tokenizer that unifies hierarchical representations into an information-complete latent space. By integrating shallow features that retain fine-grained details with deep features encoding global semantics, DINO-Tok effectively bridges pretrained representations and visual generation. We further analyze the challenges of vector quantization (VQ) in this high-dimensional space, where key information is often lost and codebook collapse occurs. We thus propose a global PCA reweighting mechanism to stabilize VQ and preserve essential information across dimensions. On ImageNet 256$\\times$256, DINO-Tok achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, reaching 28.54 PSNR for autoencoding and 23.98 PSNR for VQ-based modeling, significantly outperforming prior tokenizers and comparable to billion-level data trained models (such as Hunyuan and Wan).

In this paper, our aim is to solve the inconsistency problem of generated images by applying a reference-guided post-editing approach and present our ImageCritic. We first construct a dataset of reference-degraded-target triplets obtained via VLM-based selection and explicit degradation, which effectively simulates the common inaccuracies or inconsistencies observed in existing generation models.

Recent efforts have leveraged pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, alongside long-tailed learning techniques to exploit rich visual-textual priors for improved performance. However, existing methods often derive semantic inter-class relationships directly from imbalanced datasets, resulting in unreliable correlations for tail classes due to data scarcity. Moreover, CLIP's zero-shot paradigm is optimized for single-label image-text matching, making it suboptimal for multi-label tasks. To address these issues, we propose the correlation adaptation prompt network (CAPNET), a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly models label correlations from CLIP's textual encoder. The framework incorporates a graph convolutional network for label-aware propagation and learnable soft prompts for refined embeddings. It utilizes a distribution-balanced Focal loss with class-aware re-weighting for optimized training under imbalance. Moreover, it improves generalization through test-time ensembling and realigns visual-textual modalities using parameter-efficient fine-tuning to avert overfitting on tail classes without compromising head class performance.

To answer this question, many data curation efforts center on the quality of a dataset. However, most of these existing methods are (i) offline, i.e. they produce a static dataset from a set of predetermined filtering criteria, and (ii) concept-agnostic, i.e. they use model-based filters which induce additional data biases. In this work, we go beyond such offline, concept-agnostic methods and advocate for more flexible, task-adaptive online concept-based curation. Our first contribution is DataConcept, a collection of 128M web-crawled image-text pairs annotated with fine-grained details about their concept composition. Building on DataConcept, we introduce Concept-Aware Batch Sampling (CABS), a simple yet effective batch sampling framework that flexibly constructs batches on-the-fly based on specific target distributions.

To address this, we introduce DPP-GRPO, a novel framework for diverse video generation that combines Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) theories to enforce explicit reward on diverse generations. Our objective turns diversity into an explicit signal by imposing diminishing returns on redundant samples (via DPP) while supplies groupwise feedback over candidate sets (via GRPO). Our framework is plug-and-play and model-agnostic, and encourages diverse generations across visual appearance, camera motions, and scene structure without sacrificing prompt fidelity or perceptual quality.

Project page: https://nvlabs.github.io/LocateAnything3D/", "summary": "To act in the world, a model must name what it sees and know where it is in 3D. Today's vision-language models (VLMs) excel at open-ended 2D description and grounding, yet multi-object 3D detection remains largely missing from the VLM toolbox. We present LocateAnything3D, a VLM-native recipe that casts 3D detection as a next-token prediction problem. The key is a short, explicit Chain-of-Sight (CoS) sequence that mirrors how human reason from images: find an object in 2D, then infer its distance, size, and pose. The decoder first emits 2D detections as a visual chain-of-thought, then predicts 3D boxes under an easy-to-hard curriculum: across objects, a near-to-far order reduces early ambiguity and matches ego-centric utility; within each object, a center-from-camera, dimensions, and rotation factorization ranks information by stability and learnability. This VLM-native interface preserves open-vocabulary and visual-prompting capability without specialized heads. On the challenging Omni3D benchmark, our model achieves state-of-the-art results, with 49.89 AP_3D, surpassing the previous best by +15.51 absolute improvement even when the baseline is given ground-truth 2D boxes.

We introduce $\\infty$-RoPE, a unified inference-time framework that addresses all three limitations through three interconnected components: Block-Relativistic RoPE, KV Flush, and RoPE Cut. Block-Relativistic RoPE reformulates temporal encoding as a moving local reference frame, where each newly generated latent block is rotated relative to the base model's maximum frame horizon while earlier blocks are rotated backward to preserve relative temporal geometry. This relativistic formulation eliminates fixed temporal positions, enabling continuous video generation far beyond the base positional limits. To obtain fine-grained action control without re-encoding, KV Flush renews the KV cache by retaining only two latent frames, the global sink and the last generated latent frame, thereby ensuring immediate prompt responsiveness. Finally, RoPE Cut introduces controlled discontinuities in temporal RoPE coordinates, enabling multi-cut scene transitions within a single continuous rollout. Together, these components establish $\\infty$-RoPE as a training-free foundation for infinite-horizon, controllable, and cinematic video diffusion. Comprehensive experiments show that $\\infty$-RoPE consistently surpasses previous autoregressive models in overall VBench scores.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u221e-RoPE \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u7ec4\u4ef6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u3001\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u7535\u5f71\u5316\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u6709\u9650\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u3001\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7cbe\u7ec6\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u7535\u5f71\u5316\u573a\u666f\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "method": "\u221e-RoPE \u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff1aBlock-Relativistic RoPE\uff08\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u79fb\u52a8\u5c40\u90e8\u53c2\u8003\u7cfb\uff09\u3001KV Flush\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u7559\u5168\u5c40\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u548c\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5e27\u66f4\u65b0 KV \u7f13\u5b58\uff09\u548c RoPE Cut\uff08\u5728\u65f6\u95f4 RoPE \u5750\u6807\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u63a7\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u221e-RoPE \u5728\u6574\u4f53 VBench \u8bc4\u5206\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u221e-RoPE \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 Block-Relativistic RoPE\u3001KV Flush \u548c RoPE Cut \u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u3001\u7cbe\u7ec6\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u7535\u5f71\u5316\u573a\u666f\u8f6c\u6362\u3002"}}

A key challenge, however, lies in designing effective and interpretable rewards. Existing methods often rely on either composite metrics (e.g., CLIP, OCR, and realism scores) with fixed weights or a single scalar reward distilled from human preference models, which can limit interpretability and flexibility. We propose RubricRL, a simple and general framework for rubric-based reward design that offers greater interpretability, composability, and user control. Instead of using a black-box scalar signal, RubricRL dynamically constructs a structured rubric for each prompt--a decomposable checklist of fine-grained visual criteria such as object correctness, attribute accuracy, OCR fidelity, and realism--tailored to the input text. Each criterion is independently evaluated by a multimodal judge (e.g., o4-mini), and a prompt-adaptive weighting mechanism emphasizes the most relevant dimensions. This design not only produces interpretable and modular supervision signals for policy optimization (e.g., GRPO or PPO), but also enables users to directly adjust which aspects to reward or penalize. Experiments with an autoregressive text-to-image model demonstrate that RubricRL improves prompt faithfulness, visual detail, and generalizability, while offering a flexible and extensible foundation for interpretable RL alignment across text-to-image architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "RubricRL\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u56fa\u5b9a\u6743\u91cd\u590d\u5408\u6307\u6807\u6216\u5355\u4e00\u6807\u91cf\u5956\u52b1\uff09\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRubricRL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6743\u91cd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eRubricRL\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u76f4\u63a5\u8c03\u6574\u5956\u52b1\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "RubricRL\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}
