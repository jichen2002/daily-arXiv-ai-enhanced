### [1] [Pygmalion Effect in Vision: Image-to-Clay Translation for Reflective Geometry Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21098)
*Gayoung Lee,Junho Kim,Jin-Hwa Kim,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Pygmalion Effect框架，通过图像到黏土转换抑制镜面反射并保持几何一致性，提升反射对象的3D重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解反射在3D重建中是一个长期挑战，因为外观和几何在视图依赖反射下纠缠不清。

Method: 提出了一种双分支网络，其中基于BRDF的反射分支与黏土引导分支互补，后者稳定几何并细化表面法线。两个分支通过合成的黏土样图像联合训练，这些图像提供了无反射的监督信号。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法在法线精度和网格完整性上显著优于现有反射处理方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过将反射对象转化为类似黏土的形式，显著提高了3D重建中法线精度和网格完整性，揭示了‘通过去光泽来观察’作为反射对象几何学习的强大归纳偏置。

Abstract: Understanding reflection remains a long-standing challenge in 3D reconstruction due to the entanglement of appearance and geometry under view-dependent reflections. In this work, we present the Pygmalion Effect in Vision, a novel framework that metaphorically "sculpts" reflective objects into clay-like forms through image-to-clay translation. Inspired by the myth of Pygmalion, our method learns to suppress specular cues while preserving intrinsic geometric consistency, enabling robust reconstruction from multi-view images containing complex reflections. Specifically, we introduce a dual-branch network in which a BRDF-based reflective branch is complemented by a clay-guided branch that stabilizes geometry and refines surface normals. The two branches are trained jointly using the synthesized clay-like images, which provide a neutral, reflection-free supervision signal that complements the reflective views. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate substantial improvement in normal accuracy and mesh completeness over existing reflection-handling methods. Beyond technical gains, our framework reveals that seeing by unshining, translating radiance into neutrality, can serve as a powerful inductive bias for reflective object geometry learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CtrlVDiff通过混合模态控制策略和MMVideo数据集，统一处理视频理解与生成，支持分层编辑且鲁棒性强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频理解和可控视频生成的双重挑战，几何线索（如深度、边缘）不足以约束外观、材质和光照，需引入基于图形的模态（内在属性和语义）以提供互补约束。

Method: 提出CtrlVDiff模型，采用混合模态控制策略（HMCS）融合深度、法线、分割、边缘和基于图形的内在属性（如反照率、粗糙度、金属性）等特征，并构建MMVideo数据集支持训练。

Result: CtrlVDiff在理解和生成基准测试中表现出卓越的可控性和保真度，支持分层编辑，超越现有基线，并在模态缺失时保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CtrlVDiff通过统一的扩散框架和混合模态控制策略（HMCS），在视频理解和可控视频生成方面表现出色，支持分层编辑（如重新照明、材质调整、对象插入），并在模态缺失时保持鲁棒性。

Abstract: We tackle the dual challenges of video understanding and controllable video generation within a unified diffusion framework. Our key insights are two-fold: geometry-only cues (e.g., depth, edges) are insufficient: they specify layout but under-constrain appearance, materials, and illumination, limiting physically meaningful edits such as relighting or material swaps and often causing temporal drift. Enriching the model with additional graphics-based modalities (intrinsics and semantics) provides complementary constraints that both disambiguate understanding and enable precise, predictable control during generation.
  However, building a single model that uses many heterogeneous cues introduces two core difficulties. Architecturally, the model must accept any subset of modalities, remain robust to missing inputs, and inject control signals without sacrificing temporal consistency. Data-wise, training demands large-scale, temporally aligned supervision that ties real videos to per-pixel multimodal annotations.
  We then propose CtrlVDiff, a unified diffusion model trained with a Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS) that routes and fuses features from depth, normals, segmentation, edges, and graphics-based intrinsics (albedo, roughness, metallic), and re-renders videos from any chosen subset with strong temporal coherence. To enable this, we build MMVideo, a hybrid real-and-synthetic dataset aligned across modalities and captions. Across understanding and generation benchmarks, CtrlVDiff delivers superior controllability and fidelity, enabling layer-wise edits (relighting, material adjustment, object insertion) and surpassing state-of-the-art baselines while remaining robust when some modalities are unavailable.

### [3] [Are Neuro-Inspired Multi-Modal Vision-Language Models Resilient to Membership Inference Privacy Leakage?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20710)
*David Amebley,Sayanton Dibbo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种神经科学启发的拓扑正则化框架，证明神经VLMs在隐私攻击中更具韧性且不影响效用，实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态模型（MMs）的广泛应用引入了新的隐私泄露风险，但目前研究主要集中在单模态AI-ML系统的隐私攻击上。神经启发的MMs是否对隐私攻击具有韧性尚未被探索。

Method: 采用系统性的神经科学启发拓扑正则化（tau）框架，对比分析了基线VLMs和神经VLMs（带拓扑正则化）在图像-文本推理隐私攻击中的韧性。实验使用了BLIP、PaliGemma 2和ViT-GPT2三种VLMs，并在COCO、CC3M和NoCaps三个基准数据集上进行评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，神经VLMs（如BLIP模型在COCO数据集上）的成员推理攻击（MIA）成功率平均ROC-AUC下降了24%，同时保持了相似的模型效用（通过MPNet和ROUGE-2指标衡量）。这一发现在PaliGemma 2和ViT-GPT2模型及CC3M和NoCaps数据集上得到了进一步验证。

Conclusion: 本研究通过引入神经科学启发的拓扑正则化框架，证明了神经启发的多模态视觉语言模型（VLMs）在隐私攻击中具有更强的韧性，同时不显著影响模型效用。

Abstract: In the age of agentic AI, the growing deployment of multi-modal models (MMs) has introduced new attack vectors that can leak sensitive training data in MMs, causing privacy leakage. This paper investigates a black-box privacy attack, i.e., membership inference attack (MIA) on multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs). State-of-the-art research analyzes privacy attacks primarily to unimodal AI-ML systems, while recent studies indicate MMs can also be vulnerable to privacy attacks. While researchers have demonstrated that biologically inspired neural network representations can improve unimodal model resilience against adversarial attacks, it remains unexplored whether neuro-inspired MMs are resilient against privacy attacks. In this work, we introduce a systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework to analyze MM VLMs resilience against image-text-based inference privacy attacks. We examine this phenomenon using three VLMs: BLIP, PaliGemma 2, and ViT-GPT2, across three benchmark datasets: COCO, CC3M, and NoCaps. Our experiments compare the resilience of baseline and neuro VLMs (with topological regularization), where the tau > 0 configuration defines the NEURO variant of VLM. Our results on the BLIP model using the COCO dataset illustrate that MIA attack success in NEURO VLMs drops by 24% mean ROC-AUC, while achieving similar model utility (similarities between generated and reference captions) in terms of MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics. This shows neuro VLMs are comparatively more resilient against privacy attacks, while not significantly compromising model utility. Our extensive evaluation with PaliGemma 2 and ViT-GPT2 models, on two additional datasets: CC3M and NoCaps, further validates the consistency of the findings. This work contributes to the growing understanding of privacy risks in MMs and provides evidence on neuro VLMs privacy threat resilience.

### [4] [Inferix: A Block-Diffusion based Next-Generation Inference Engine for World Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20714)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inferix是专为世界模型设计的下一代推理引擎，通过半自回归解码实现高质量视频生成，支持交互和基准测试，推动世界模型探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 世界模型是代理AI、具身AI和游戏等领域的核心模拟器，能够生成长、物理真实且交互式的高质量视频。扩展这些模型可能解锁视觉感知、理解和推理的新能力，超越当前以LLM为中心的视觉基础模型范式。

Method: 采用半自回归（块扩散）解码范式，结合扩散和自回归方法的优势，通过块内扩散生成视频令牌，同时基于先前块进行条件生成，实现更连贯稳定的视频序列。

Result: Inferix通过优化的半自回归解码过程实现了高质量、可变长度的视频生成，支持交互式视频流和性能分析，并集成了LV-Bench进行高效基准测试。

Conclusion: Inferix被设计为下一代推理引擎，专注于通过优化的半自回归解码过程实现沉浸式世界合成，区别于高并发场景系统（如vLLM或SGLang）和经典视频扩散模型（如xDiTs）。

Abstract: World models serve as core simulators for fields such as agentic AI, embodied AI, and gaming, capable of generating long, physically realistic, and interactive high-quality videos. Moreover, scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, paving the way for a new paradigm that moves beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models. A key breakthrough empowering them is the semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, which merges the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones, resulting in more coherent and stable video sequences. Crucially, it overcomes limitations of standard video diffusion by reintroducing LLM-style KV Cache management, enabling efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation.
  Therefore, Inferix is specifically designed as a next-generation inference engine to enable immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding processes. This dedicated focus on world simulation distinctly sets it apart from systems engineered for high-concurrency scenarios (like vLLM or SGLang) and from classic video diffusion models (such as xDiTs). Inferix further enhances its offering with interactive video streaming and profiling, enabling real-time interaction and realistic simulation to accurately model world dynamics. Additionally, it supports efficient benchmarking through seamless integration of LV-Bench, a new fine-grained evaluation benchmark tailored for minute-long video generation scenarios. We hope the community will work together to advance Inferix and foster world model exploration.

*Kun Guo,Yun Shen,Xijun Wang,Chaoqun You,Yun Rui,Tony Q. S. Quek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出LTED-Ada算法，通过深度强化学习和联邦学习优化视频对象识别，实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决资源受限设备（如交通摄像头）在视频对象识别中面临的帧率、准确性和延迟挑战。

Method: 提出LTED-Ada算法，结合深度强化学习和联邦学习，自适应选择本地跟踪或边缘检测。

Result: 实验表明LTED-Ada在单设备和多设备场景下均表现优越。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种混合方法（LTED-Ada），通过深度强化学习和联邦学习在资源受限设备上优化视频对象识别，实验证明了其优越性。

Abstract: Fast and accurate video object recognition, which relies on frame-by-frame video analytics, remains a challenge for resource-constrained devices such as traffic cameras. Recent advances in mobile edge computing have made it possible to offload computation-intensive object detection to edge servers equipped with high-accuracy neural networks, while lightweight and fast object tracking algorithms run locally on devices. This hybrid approach offers a promising solution but introduces a new challenge: deciding when to perform edge detection versus local tracking. To address this, we formulate two long-term optimization problems for both single-device and multi-device scenarios, taking into account the temporal correlation of consecutive frames and the dynamic conditions of mobile edge networks. Based on the formulation, we propose the LTED-Ada in single-device setting, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that adaptively selects between local tracking and edge detection, according to the frame rate as well as recognition accuracy and delay requirement. In multi-device setting, we further enhance LTED-Ada using federated learning to enable collaborative policy training across devices, thereby improving its generalization to unseen frame rates and performance requirements. Finally, we conduct extensive hardware-in-the-loop experiments using multiple Raspberry Pi 4B devices and a personal computer as the edge server, demonstrating the superiority of LTED-Ada.

*Haibo HU,Lianming Huang,Nan Guan,Chun Jason Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeeAD是一种无需训练的早期退出框架，通过评估轨迹可行性和自适应跳层，显著降低VLA模型的推理延迟，同时保持规划质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型由于深度Transformer堆栈导致推理延迟高，影响自动驾驶的实时性。DeeAD旨在通过早期退出和自适应跳层来减少延迟，同时不牺牲规划质量。

Method: DeeAD采用训练免费的早期退出框架，通过评估中间轨迹的物理可行性来加速规划。它利用轻量级规划先验（如导航或低精度规划）来判断是否终止推理，并引入多跳控制器自适应跳过冗余层。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试中，DeeAD实现了高达28%的Transformer层稀疏性和29%的延迟降低，同时保持了规划质量和安全性。

Conclusion: DeeAD框架通过引入动作引导的早期退出机制和自适应跳层控制器，显著降低了VLA模型的推理延迟，同时保持了规划质量和安全性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models unify perception, reasoning, and trajectory generation for autonomous driving, but suffer from significant inference latency due to deep transformer stacks. We present DeeAD, a training-free, action-guided early-exit framework that accelerates VLA planning by evaluating the physical feasibility of intermediate trajectories. Instead of relying on confidence scores, DeeAD terminates inference when predicted trajectories align with lightweight planning priors (e.g., Navigation or Low-precision Planning) within a tolerable deviation (<2m). To improve efficiency, we introduce a multi-hop controller that adaptively skips redundant layers based on the change rate of scores. DeeAD integrates into existing VLA models, such as ORION, without requiring retraining. Experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate up to 28% transformer-layer sparsity and 29% latency reduction, while preserving planning quality and safety.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMD 是一种新范式，用于压缩大型 SSL 模型为紧凑且高效的代理模型，保留其通用性。Foundry 是其首个实现，在 3D 点云任务中表现优异，接近完整模型性能，同时减少计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型自监督学习模型虽然具有强大的通用特征提取能力，但其巨大的规模和计算成本使其难以部署在边缘设备上。现有的压缩技术（如标准知识蒸馏）会牺牲模型的通用性，因此需要一种新的压缩方法。

Method: 本文提出了 Foundation Model Distillation (FMD) 范式，通过训练学生模型学习一组压缩的 SuperTokens，以重建教师模型的 token 级表征，从而捕获其潜在空间的紧凑基础。Foundry 是 FMD 在 3D 点云任务中的首个实现。

Result: Foundry 在多种下游任务（分类、部分分割和少样本场景）中表现出强大的迁移能力，接近完整基础模型的性能，同时显著减少了 token 数量和 FLOPs，使其更适合在资源受限的硬件上部署。

Conclusion: Foundation Model Distillation (FMD) 提供了一种有效的方法，将大型自监督学习模型压缩为紧凑且高效的代理模型，同时保留了其通用的表征能力。Foundry 作为 FMD 的首个实现，在 3D 点云任务中展示了出色的性能，接近完整基础模型的性能，同时显著减少了计算资源需求。

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale datasets have become powerful general-purpose feature extractors. However, their immense size and computational cost make them prohibitive for deployment on edge devices such as robots and AR/VR headsets. Existing compression techniques like standard knowledge distillation create efficient 'specialist' models but sacrifice the crucial, downstream-agnostic generality that makes foundation models so valuable.  In this paper, we introduce Foundation Model Distillation (FMD), a new paradigm for compressing large SSL models into compact, efficient, and faithful proxies that retain their general-purpose representational power. We present Foundry, the first implementation of FMD for 3D point clouds. Our approach, Foundry, trains a student to learn a compressed set of SuperTokens that reconstruct the teacher's token-level representations, capturing a compact basis of its latent space. A single distilled model maintains strong transferability across diverse downstream tasks-classification, part segmentation, and few-shot scenarios-approaching full foundation-model performance while using significantly fewer tokens and FLOPs, making such models more practical for deployment on resourceconstrained hardware.

TL;DR: DinoLizer是一种基于DINOv2的模型，用于定位生成式修复图像中的篡改区域，性能优于现有方法，且对后处理操作鲁棒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对生成式修复图像中篡改区域的定位需求，利用Vision Transformer的强大表征能力，开发一种高效且鲁棒的检测方法。

Method: 在DINOv2预训练模型的基础上，添加线性分类头，利用ViT的patch嵌入预测篡改区域，采用滑动窗口策略处理大图像，并通过后处理优化二值篡改掩码。

Result: DinoLizer在多种生成模型的数据集上表现优于现有方法，IoU提升12%，且在后处理操作中表现更优。

Conclusion: DinoLizer基于DINOv2模型，在生成式修复图像的篡改区域定位任务中表现优异，显著超越了现有技术，并在后处理操作中保持了鲁棒性。

Abstract: We introduce DinoLizer, a DINOv2-based model for localizing manipulated regions in generative inpainting. Our method builds on a DINOv2 model pretrained to detect synthetic images on the B-Free dataset. We add a linear classification head on top of the Vision Transformer's patch embeddings to predict manipulations at a $14\times 14$ patch resolution. The head is trained to focus on semantically altered regions, treating non-semantic edits as part of the original content. Because the ViT accepts only fixed-size inputs, we use a sliding-window strategy to aggregate predictions over larger images; the resulting heatmaps are post-processed to refine the estimated binary manipulation masks. Empirical results show that DinoLizer surpasses state-of-the-art local manipulation detectors on a range of inpainting datasets derived from different generative models. It remains robust to common post-processing operations such as resizing, noise addition, and JPEG (double) compression. On average, DinoLizer achieves a 12\% higher Intersection-over-Union (IoU) than the next best model, with even greater gains after post-processing. Our experiments with off-the-shelf DINOv2 demonstrate the strong representational power of Vision Transformers for this task. Finally, extensive ablation studies comparing DINOv2 and its successor, DINOv3, in deepfake localization confirm DinoLizer's superiority. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏评估VLMs在工具界面设计中的能力，而理解并提升这一能力对VLMs与设计师在常规软件中的协作至关重要。

Method: 通过引入CANVAS基准测试，包含598个工具设计任务，覆盖30种功能类别，任务分为设计复制和设计修改两类，评估模型在逐步更新设计时的工具调用能力。

Result: 结果显示领先模型能通过策略性工具调用提升设计质量，同时研究识别了常见错误模式，为未来改进提供依据。

Conclusion: 研究提出了CANVAS基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在工具界面设计中的表现，发现领先模型能通过更策略性的工具调用提升设计质量，并识别了常见错误模式，为未来研究提供方向。

Abstract: User interface (UI) design is an iterative process in which designers progressively refine their work with design software such as Figma or Sketch. Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) with tool invocation suggest these models can operate design software to edit a UI design through iteration. Understanding and enhancing this capacity is important, as it highlights VLMs' potential to collaborate with designers within conventional software. However, as no existing benchmark evaluates tool-based design performance, the capacity remains unknown. To address this, we introduce CANVAS, a benchmark for VLMs on tool-based user interface design. Our benchmark contains 598 tool-based design tasks paired with ground-truth references sampled from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 function-based categories (e.g., onboarding, messaging). In each task, a VLM updates the design step-by-step through context-based tool invocations (e.g., create a rectangle as a button background), linked to design software. Specifically, CANVAS incorporates two task types: (i) design replication evaluates the ability to reproduce a whole UI screen; (ii) design modification evaluates the ability to modify a specific part of an existing screen. Results suggest that leading models exhibit more strategic tool invocations, improving design quality. Furthermore, we identify common error patterns models exhibit, guiding future work in enhancing tool-based design capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TIE improves VLMs by conditioning image encoding on text queries, boosting performance and efficiency, with notable gains in specific tasks and better interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the limitation of standard image encoders in VLMs that process images agnostically, without considering downstream tasks or text queries.

Method: Proposes the Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE), which generates image representations conditioned on input text queries, enhancing task-specific processing.

Result: VLMs with TIE outperform conventional models by +1.5 and +1.3 points on average across nine benchmarks, with up to 6-point gains in specific tasks, while using half the image tokens.

Conclusion: TIE-based VLMs demonstrate superior performance and efficiency, with significant improvements in specific tasks and better interpretability through query-relevant feature attention.

Abstract: Image encoders, a fundamental component of vision-language models (VLMs), are typically pretrained independently before being aligned with a language model. This standard paradigm results in encoders that process images agnostically, without regard to the specific downstream task or text query. To address this limitation, we propose the Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE), which generates image representations conditioned on the input text query. VLMs equipped with TIE outperform their conventional counterparts by +1.5 and +1.3 points on average across nine image-to-text benchmarks at the 1B and 3B scales, respectively, with gains reaching up to 6 points on tasks such as DocVQA and InfoVQA. Moreover, TIE-based VLMs attain superior performance while utilizing only half as many image tiles (tokens), resulting in notably improved inference efficiency. TIE also generalizes well with generic queries, indicating that text-conditioned training effectively optimizes the encoder to capture key visual features. Qualitative analysis confirms that TIE consistently attends to query-relevant regions, enhancing both interpretability and query-specific grounding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖密集或全场景观测，限制了在受限或部分视图环境中的有效性。

Method: SMARC 结合了 Partial Convolutional U-Net 和分类头，实现了在极端观测稀疏条件下的空间修复和语义理解。

Result: SMARC 在 PSNR 上达到 17.55 dB，材料分类准确率为 85.10%，优于五种对比模型。

Conclusion: SMARC 在极稀疏观测条件下通过部分卷积在空间推理中的优势，为最小视觉表面理解奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Understanding material surfaces from sparse visual cues is critical for applications in robotics, simulation, and material perception. However, most existing methods rely on dense or full-scene observations, limiting their effectiveness in constrained or partial view environment. To address this challenge, we introduce SMARC, a unified model for Surface MAterial Reconstruction and Classification from minimal visual input. By giving only a single 10% contiguous patch of the image, SMARC recognizes and reconstructs the full RGB surface while simultaneously classifying the material category. Our architecture combines a Partial Convolutional U-Net with a classification head, enabling both spatial inpainting and semantic understanding under extreme observation sparsity. We compared SMARC against five models including convolutional autoencoders [17], Vision Transformer (ViT) [13], Masked Autoencoder (MAE) [5], Swin Transformer [9], and DETR [2] using Touch and Go dataset [16] of real-world surface textures. SMARC achieves state-of-the-art results with a PSNR of 17.55 dB and a material classification accuracy of 85.10%. Our findings highlight the advantages of partial convolution in spatial reasoning under missing data and establish a strong foundation for minimal-vision surface understanding.

TL;DR: LongVT是一个端到端的代理框架，通过交替的多模态工具链思维解决长视频推理中的幻觉问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频中证据稀疏且时间分散导致的幻觉问题，模仿人类先全局浏览再局部细查的理解方式。

Method: 利用大型多模态模型（LMMs）的时间定位能力作为视频裁剪工具，通过交替的多模态工具链思维（Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought）实现全局到局部的推理循环。

Result: LongVT在四个具有挑战性的长视频理解和推理基准测试中表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: LongVT通过全局到局部的推理循环，显著提升了长视频理解与推理任务的性能，并在多个基准测试中优于现有基线。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown great potential for video reasoning with textual Chain-of-Thought. However, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, especially when processing long-form videos where evidence is sparse and temporally dispersed. Inspired by how humans comprehend long videos - by first skimming globally and then examining relevant clips for details - we introduce LongVT, an end-to-end agentic framework that enables "Thinking with Long Videos" via interleaved Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought. Specifically, we exploit LMMs' inherent temporal grounding ability as a native video cropping tool to zoom in on a specific video clip and resample finer-grained video frames. This global-to-local reasoning loop continues until answers are grounded in retrieved visual evidence. Given the scarcity of fine-grained question-answering (QA) data for the long video reasoning task, we curate and will release a data suite named VideoSIAH to facilitate both training and evaluation. Specifically, our training dataset consists of 247.9K samples for tool-integrated cold-start supervised fine-tuning, 1.6K samples for agentic reinforcement learning, and 15.4K samples for agentic reinforcement fine-tuning, respectively. Our evaluation benchmark consists of 1,280 QA pairs that are carefully curated through a semi-automatic data pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation. With a meticulously designed three-stage training strategy and extensive empirical validation, LongVT consistently outperforms existing strong baselines across four challenging long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. Our codes, data, and model checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/LongVT .

*Souradeep Dutta,Keshav Bulia,Neena S Nair*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KRISP轻量级复现模型性能为原版75%，揭示设计缺陷，支持边缘设备离线推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原版KRISP模型虽有效，但工业级训练计算需求高且与大型主干网络紧密耦合，因此需要从不同角度重新审视并开发轻量级版本。

Method: 通过系统消融研究，包括在合成VQA数据上的概念验证和DAQUAR数据集的评估，复现了一个参数显著减少的轻量级KRISP模型。

Result: 轻量级模型在低参数配置和外部知识图谱领域约束下，避免了AI幻觉，并能在智能手机和AR-VR等边缘设备上运行，提升离线视觉推理能力。

Conclusion: KRISP的轻量级复现模型虽然性能约为原版的75%，但揭示了原设计中未充分覆盖的缺陷和隐性问题，为资源受限下的知识增强VQA架构提供了可扩展性和有效性的见解。

Abstract: Facebook AI Research introduced KRISP [4], which integrates structured external knowledge into pipelines for vision-language reasoning. Despite its effectiveness, the original model has been developed for industrial-scale training, is computationally demanding, and is tightly connected to a large backbone. In this work, we reexamine KRISP from a different angle and offer a lightweight reproduction with significantly fewer parameters. Even though our replicated model performs about 75 % of the original, the replication process uncovers a number of design flaws, real-world pitfalls, and implicit problems that were not fully covered in the original paper. We offer insights into the scalability and efficacy of knowledge-enhanced VQA architectures under resource constraints through systematic ablation studies, which include a proof-of-concept on synthetic VQA data and evaluation on the DAQUAR dataset. Our model, configured with a low parameter setup and constrained by the external Knowledge graph domain, prevents AI hallucinations and generates outputs solely within that domain. Minimal parameters allow us to function on edge devices like smartphones and AR-VR, further improving offline visual reasoning.

Abstract: Dynamic sampling mechanisms in deep learning architectures have demonstrated utility across many computer vision models, though the theoretical analysis of these structures has not yet been unified. In this paper we connect the various dynamic sampling methods by developing and analyzing a novel operator which generalizes existing methods, which we term "warping". Warping provides a minimal implementation of dynamic sampling which is amenable to analysis, and can be used to reconstruct existing architectures including deformable convolutions, active convolutional units, and spatial transformer networks. Using our formalism, we provide statistical analysis of the operator by modeling the inputs as both IID variables and homogeneous random fields. Extending this analysis, we discover a unique asymmetry between the forward and backward pass of the model training. We demonstrate that these mechanisms represent an entirely different class of orthogonal operators to the traditional translationally invariant operators defined by convolutions. With a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical investigation, we find the conditions necessary to ensure stable training of dynamic sampling networks. In addition, statistical analysis of discretization effects are studied. Finally, we introduce a novel loss landscape visualization which utilizes gradient update information directly, to better understand learning behavior.

TL;DR: $Δ$-NeRF 是一种增量优化的 NeRF 框架，通过模块化残差设计解决了数据顺序到达时的训练问题，显著提升了效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 NeRF 框架在增量引入新视图时需要完全重新训练，限制了其在卫星地形分析等顺序数据场景中的应用。

Method: $Δ$-NeRF 引入了残差控制器、不确定性感知门控机制和视图选择策略，并结合知识蒸馏压缩模型。

Result: 实验表明，$Δ$-NeRF 在卫星图像上性能接近联合训练，训练时间减少 30-42%，PSNR 提升高达 43.5%。

Conclusion: $Δ$-NeRF 提出了一种模块化残差框架，通过增量式优化解决了 NeRF 在数据顺序到达时的训练问题，显著提升了性能并减少了训练时间和数据需求。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, most existing NeRF frameworks require complete retraining when new views are introduced incrementally, limiting their applicability in domains where data arrives sequentially. This limitation is particularly problematic in satellite-based terrain analysis, where regions are repeatedly observed over time. Incremental refinement of NeRFs remains underexplored, and naive approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting when past data is unavailable. We propose $Δ$-NeRF, a unique modular residual framework for incremental NeRF refinement. $Δ$-NeRF introduces several novel techniques including: (1) a residual controller that injects per-layer corrections into a frozen base NeRF, enabling refinement without access to past data; (2) an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism that prevents overcorrection by adaptively combining base and refined predictions; and (3) a view selection strategy that reduces training data by up to 47\% while maintaining performance. Additionally, we employ knowledge distillation to compress the enhanced model into a compact student network (20\% of original size). Experiments on satellite imagery demonstrate that $Δ$-NeRF achieves performance comparable to joint training while reducing training time by 30-42\%. $Δ$-NeRF consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving an improvement of up to 43.5\% in PSNR over naive fine-tuning and surpassing joint training on some metrics.

Method: StM采用无标注视频数据，将其分割为动态前景和背景层，通过自组合学习动态主体与多样化场景的交互。引入变换感知训练管道，结合多层融合与增强技术，实现感知感知合成，并使用身份保留损失保持前景保真度。

Conclusion: StM框架通过动态前景与背景层的自组合学习，显著提升了生成视频的真实性和控制能力，并在定量和定性评估中优于现有方法。

Abstract: We present Split-then-Merge (StM), a novel framework designed to enhance control in generative video composition and address its data scarcity problem. Unlike conventional methods relying on annotated datasets or handcrafted rules, StM splits a large corpus of unlabeled videos into dynamic foreground and background layers, then self-composes them to learn how dynamic subjects interact with diverse scenes. This process enables the model to learn the complex compositional dynamics required for realistic video generation. StM introduces a novel transformation-aware training pipeline that utilizes a multi-layer fusion and augmentation to achieve affordance-aware composition, alongside an identity-preservation loss that maintains foreground fidelity during blending. Experiments show StM outperforms SoTA methods in both quantitative benchmarks and in humans/VLLM-based qualitative evaluations.

Motivation: 针对当前大型视觉语言模型在视觉感知和推理任务中的不足，开发一个能够精确评估和提升模型性能的合成环境。

Method: Sphinx通过程序化生成包含多种视觉元素的谜题，并配对可验证的真实解决方案，构建了一个大规模数据集。

Conclusion: Sphinx环境通过RLVR方法显著提升了模型在视觉推理任务中的准确性，并展示了在多模态推理领域的潜力。

Abstract: We present Sphinx, a synthetic environment for visual perception and reasoning that targets core cognitive primitives. Sphinx procedurally generates puzzles using motifs, tiles, charts, icons, and geometric primitives, each paired with verifiable ground-truth solutions, enabling both precise evaluation and large-scale dataset construction. The benchmark covers 25 task types spanning symmetry detection, geometric transformations, spatial reasoning, chart interpretation, and sequence prediction. Evaluating recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) shows that even state-of-the-art GPT-5 attains only 51.1% accuracy, well below human performance. Finally, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) substantially improves model accuracy on these tasks and yields gains on external visual reasoning benchmarks, highlighting its promise for advancing multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Diffusion models have established the state-of-the-art in text-to-image generation, but their performance often relies on a diffusion prior network to translate text embeddings into the visual manifold for easier decoding. These priors are computationally expensive and require extensive training on massive datasets. In this work, we challenge the necessity of a trained prior at all by employing Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI), a training-free and data-free alternative, to replace the need for a prior. OVI initializes a latent visual representation from random pseudo-tokens and iteratively optimizes it to maximize the cosine similarity with input textual prompt embedding. We further propose two novel constraints, a Mahalanobis-based and a Nearest-Neighbor loss, to regularize the OVI optimization process toward the distribution of realistic images. Our experiments, conducted on Kandinsky 2.2, show that OVI can serve as an alternative to traditional priors. More importantly, our analysis reveals a critical flaw in current evaluation benchmarks like T2I-CompBench++, where simply using the text embedding as a prior achieves surprisingly high scores, despite lower perceptual quality. Our constrained OVI methods improve visual fidelity over this baseline, with the Nearest-Neighbor approach proving particularly effective, achieving quantitative scores comparable to or higher than the state-of-the-art data-efficient prior, indicating that the idea merits further investigation. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确检测血管树中心线及其拓扑结构对临床诊断和治疗至关重要，漏检小分支可能导致致命错误。

Method: RefTr采用基于Transformer解码器的Producer-Refiner架构，Producer生成初始汇合轨迹，Refiner递归细化这些轨迹以形成中心线图。使用汇合轨迹表示确保有效的树拓扑，并引入非极大值抑制算法合并重复分支。

Result: RefTr在多个公共数据集上实现了优于先前方法的召回率和相当的精确度，同时推理速度更快、参数更少。

Conclusion: RefTr通过其Producer-Refiner架构和递归细化策略，在3D医学影像中实现了血管树中心线的高召回率和精确度，同时减少了参数数量，展示了其在临床任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Tubular trees, such as blood vessels and lung airways, are essential for material transport within the human body. Accurately detecting their centerlines with correct tree topology is critical for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. In these applications, maintaining high recall is crucial, as missing small branches can result in fatal mistakes caused by incomplete assessments or undetected abnormalities. We present RefTr, a 3D image-to-graph model for centerline generation of vascular trees via recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories. RefTr uses a Producer-Refiner architecture based on a Transformer decoder, where the Producer proposes a set of initial confluent trajectories that are recurrently refined by the Refiner to produce final trajectories, which forms the centerline graph. The confluent trajectory representation enables refinement of complete trajectories while explicitly enforcing a valid tree topology. The recurrent refinement scheme improves precision and reuses the same Refiner block across multiple steps, yielding a 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters compared to previous SOTA. We also introduce an efficient non-maximum suppression algorithm for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches and boost precision. Across multiple public centerline datasets, RefTr achieves superior recall and comparable precision to previous SOTA, while offering faster inference and substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating its potential as a new state-of-the-art framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging.

Abstract: Reliable depth estimation under real optical conditions remains a core challenge for camera vision in systems such as autonomous robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent progress in depth estimation and depth-of-field rendering, research remains constrained by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity, real stereo DSLR datasets, limiting real-world generalization and evaluation of models trained on synthetic data as shown extensively in literature. We present the first high-resolution (5472$\times$3648px) stereo DSLR dataset with 18000 images, systematically varying focal length and aperture across complex real scenes and capturing the optical realism and complexity of professional camera systems. For 9 scenes with varying scene complexity, lighting and background, images are captured with two identical camera assemblies at 10 focal lengths (28-70mm) and 5 apertures (f/2.8-f/22), spanning 50 optical configurations in 2000 images per scene. This full-range optics coverage enables controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects for monocular and stereo depth estimation, shallow depth-of-field rendering, deblurring, 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Each focal configuration has a dedicated calibration image set, supporting evaluation of classical and learning based methods for intrinsic and extrinsic calibration. The dataset features challenging visual elements such as multi-scale optical illusions, reflective surfaces, mirrors, transparent glass walls, fine-grained details, and natural / artificial ambient light variations. This work attempts to bridge the realism gap between synthetic training data and real camera optics, and demonstrates challenges with the current state-of-the-art monocular, stereo depth and depth-of-field methods. We release the dataset, calibration files, and evaluation code to support reproducible research on real-world optical generalization.

Abstract: Visual content memorability has intrigued the scientific community for decades, with applications ranging widely, from understanding nuanced aspects of human memory to enhancing content design. A significant challenge in progressing the field lies in the expensive process of collecting memorability annotations from humans. This limits the diversity and scalability of datasets for modeling visual content memorability. Most existing datasets are limited to collecting aggregate memorability scores for visual content, not capturing the nuanced memorability signals present in natural, open-ended recall descriptions. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale unsupervised dataset designed explicitly for modeling visual memorability signals, containing over 82,000 videos, accompanied by descriptive recall data. We leverage tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) retrieval queries from online platforms such as Reddit. We demonstrate that our unsupervised dataset provides rich signals for two memorability-related tasks: recall generation and ToT retrieval. Large vision-language models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions for visual content. We also employ a contrastive training strategy to create the first model capable of performing multimodal ToT retrieval. Our dataset and models present a novel direction, facilitating progress in visual content memorability research.

Abstract: We propose a method which, given a sequence of stereo foggy images, estimates the parameters of a fog model and updates them dynamically. In contrast with previous approaches, which estimate the parameters sequentially and thus are prone to error propagation, our algorithm estimates all the parameters simultaneously by solving a novel optimisation problem. By assuming that fog is only locally homogeneous, our method effectively handles real-world fog, which is often globally inhomogeneous. The proposed algorithm can be easily used as an add-on module in existing visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) or odometry systems in the presence of fog. In order to assess our method, we also created a new dataset, the Stereo Driving In Real Fog (SDIRF), consisting of high-quality, consecutive stereo frames of real, foggy road scenes under a variety of visibility conditions, totalling over 40 minutes and 34k frames. As a first-of-its-kind, SDIRF contains the camera's photometric parameters calibrated in a lab environment, which is a prerequisite for correctly applying the atmospheric scattering model to foggy images. The dataset also includes the counterpart clear data of the same routes recorded in overcast weather, which is useful for companion work in image defogging and depth reconstruction. We conducted extensive experiments using both synthetic foggy data and real foggy sequences from SDIRF to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over prior methods. Our method not only produces the most accurate estimates on synthetic data, but also adapts better to real fog. We make our code and SDIRF publicly available\footnote{https://github.com/SenseRoboticsLab/estimating-fog-parameters} to the community with the aim of advancing the research on visual perception in fog.

Motivation: 跨视角对象对应任务（如ego-exo对象对应）由于视角和外观的显著变化，现有分割模型（如SAM2）难以直接应用，亟需一种统一的跨视角对应框架。

Method: V^2-SAM通过两个互补的提示生成器（V^2-Anchor和V^2-Visual）将SAM2从单视角分割扩展到跨视角对应，并结合多专家设计和后验循环一致性选择器（PCCS）优化性能。

Result: V^2-SAM在Ego-Exo4D、DAVIS-2017和HANDAL-X等基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: V^2-SAM通过创新的跨视角提示生成器和多专家设计，显著提升了跨视角对象对应任务的性能，并在多个基准测试中达到了最先进水平。

Abstract: Cross-view object correspondence, exemplified by the representative task of ego-exo object correspondence, aims to establish consistent associations of the same object across different viewpoints (e.g., ego-centric and exo-centric). This task poses significant challenges due to drastic viewpoint and appearance variations, making existing segmentation models, such as SAM2, non-trivial to apply directly. To address this, we present V^2-SAM, a unified cross-view object correspondence framework that adapts SAM2 from single-view segmentation to cross-view correspondence through two complementary prompt generators. Specifically, the Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor), built upon DINOv3 features, establishes geometry-aware correspondences and, for the first time, unlocks coordinate-based prompting for SAM2 in cross-view scenarios, while the Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) enhances appearance-guided cues via a novel visual prompt matcher that aligns ego-exo representations from both feature and structural perspectives. To effectively exploit the strengths of both prompts, we further adopt a multi-expert design and introduce a Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) that adaptively selects the most reliable expert based on cyclic consistency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of V^2-SAM, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence).

Motivation: 现有方法在推理时容易对目标奖励函数欠优化或过优化（奖励黑客），需要一种更有效的对齐方法。

Method: 提出Null-TTA方法，通过优化分类器自由引导中的无条件嵌入来对齐扩散模型。

Result: Null-TTA在目标测试时对齐中达到最先进水平，同时保持强大的跨奖励泛化能力。

Conclusion: Null-TTA通过优化无条件嵌入而非潜在或噪声变量，实现了在语义空间中的优化，为TTA提供了一种有效且新颖的范式。

Abstract: Test-time alignment (TTA) aims to adapt models to specific rewards during inference. However, existing methods tend to either under-optimise or over-optimise (reward hack) the target reward function. We propose Null-Text Test-Time Alignment (Null-TTA), which aligns diffusion models by optimising the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance, rather than manipulating latent or noise variables. Due to the structured semantic nature of the text embedding space, this ensures alignment occurs on a semantically coherent manifold and prevents reward hacking (exploiting non-semantic noise patterns to improve the reward). Since the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance serves as the anchor for the model's generative distribution, Null-TTA directly steers model's generative distribution towards the target reward rather than just adjusting the samples, even without updating model parameters. Thanks to these desirable properties, we show that Null-TTA achieves state-of-the-art target test-time alignment while maintaining strong cross-reward generalisation. This establishes semantic-space optimisation as an effective and principled novel paradigm for TTA.

Motivation: 传统INR缺乏显式几何结构，局部编辑能力有限，难以应用于动态或交互式场景。

Method: 提出GaINeR框架，通过检索给定图像坐标的K个最近高斯分布、聚合距离加权嵌入，并通过神经网络预测RGB值。

Result: GaINeR能够实现高保真图像重建、超分辨率和压缩，同时支持局部编辑和物理模拟集成。

Conclusion: GaINeR通过结合可训练高斯分布和基于神经网络的INR，实现了连续图像表示、可解释的几何结构和灵活的局部编辑，为物理感知和交互式图像处理提供了基础。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have become an essential tool for modeling continuous 2D images, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction, super-resolution, and compression. Popular architectures such as SIREN, WIRE, and FINER demonstrate the potential of INR for capturing fine-grained image details. However, traditional INRs often lack explicit geometric structure and have limited capabilities for local editing or integration with physical simulation, restricting their applicability in dynamic or interactive settings. To address these limitations, we propose GaINeR: Geometry-Aware Implicit Network Representation, a novel framework for 2D images that combines trainable Gaussian distributions with a neural network-based INR. For a given image coordinate, the model retrieves the K nearest Gaussians, aggregates distance-weighted embeddings, and predicts the RGB value via a neural network. This design enables continuous image representation, interpretable geometric structure, and flexible local editing, providing a foundation for physically aware and interactive image manipulation. The official implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/WJakubowska/GaINeR.

Motivation: 旨在评估深度学习模型在减少小脑桥脑角池对比增强T1加权MRI（T1ce）对比剂剂量方面的效果，以降低患者接受对比剂的风险。

Method: 本研究采用多中心回顾性研究设计，利用前庭神经鞘瘤患者的T1和T1ce图像模拟不同对比剂剂量的低剂量T1ce，训练深度学习模型从低剂量模拟中恢复标准剂量T1ce。评估了DL恢复T1ce的图像质量和分割性能，并由头颈放射科医生对恢复图像的质量和诊断特征进行评分。

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate a deep learning (DL) model for reducing the agent dose of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (T1ce) of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cistern. Materials and methods: In this multi-center retrospective study, T1 and T1ce of vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients were used to simulate low-dose T1ce with varying reductions of contrast agent dose. DL models were trained to restore standard-dose T1ce from the low-dose simulation. The image quality and segmentation performance of the DL-restored T1ce were evaluated. A head and neck radiologist was asked to rate DL-restored images in multiple aspects, including image quality and diagnostic characterization. Results: 203 MRI studies from 72 VS patients (mean age, 58.51 \pm 14.73, 39 men) were evaluated. As the input dose increased, the structural similarity index measure of the restored T1ce increased from 0.639 \pm 0.113 to 0.993 \pm 0.009, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio increased from 21.6 \pm 3.73 dB to 41.4 \pm 4.84 dB. At 10% input dose, using DL-restored T1ce for segmentation improved the Dice from 0.673 to 0.734, the 95% Hausdorff distance from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and the average surface distance from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm. Both DL-restored T1ce from 10% and 30% input doses showed excellent images, with the latter being considered more informative. Conclusion: The DL model improved the image quality of low-dose MRI of the CPA cistern, which makes lesion detection and diagnostic characterization possible with 10% - 30% of the standard dose.

Abstract: We propose a smooth regularization technique that instills a strong temporal inductive bias in video recognition models, particularly benefiting lightweight architectures. Our method encourages smoothness in the intermediate-layer embeddings of consecutive frames by modeling their changes as a Gaussian Random Walk (GRW). This penalizes abrupt representational shifts, thereby promoting low-acceleration solutions that better align with the natural temporal coherence inherent in videos. By leveraging this enforced smoothness, lightweight models can more effectively capture complex temporal dynamics. Applied to such models, our technique yields a 3.8% to 6.4% accuracy improvement on Kinetics-600. Notably, the MoViNets model family trained with our smooth regularization improves the current state of the art by 3.8% to 6.1% within their respective FLOP constraints, while MobileNetV3 and the MoViNets-Stream family achieve gains of 4.9% to 6.4% over prior state-of-the-art models with comparable memory footprints.

Abstract: Neurons are the fundamental building blocks of deep neural networks, and their interconnections allow AI to achieve unprecedented results. Motivated by the goal of understanding how neurons encode information, compositional explanations leverage logical relationships between concepts to express the spatial alignment between neuron activations and human knowledge. However, these explanations rely on human-annotated datasets, restricting their applicability to specific domains and predefined concepts. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a framework for the vision domain that allows users to probe neurons for arbitrary concepts and datasets. Specifically, the framework leverages masks generated by open vocabulary semantic segmentation to compute open vocabulary compositional explanations. The proposed framework consists of three steps: specifying arbitrary concepts, generating semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, and deriving compositional explanations from these masks. The paper compares the proposed framework with previous methods for computing compositional explanations both in terms of quantitative metrics and human interpretability, analyzes the differences in explanations when shifting from human-annotated data to model-annotated data, and showcases the additional capabilities provided by the framework in terms of flexibility of the explanations with respect to the tasks and properties of interest.

Conclusion: UruDendro4数据集通过提供多高度的样本和手动标注的年轮数据，支持了基于横截面图像的年度木材体积建模，并展示了DeepCS-TRD方法在自动年轮检测中的最佳性能。

Abstract: Tree-ring growth represents the annual wood increment for a tree, and quantifying it allows researchers to assess which silvicultural practices are best suited for each species. Manual measurement of this growth is time-consuming and often imprecise, as it is typically performed along 4 to 8 radial directions on a cross-sectional disc. In recent years, automated algorithms and datasets have emerged to enhance accuracy and automate the delineation of annual rings in cross-sectional images.
  To address the scarcity of wood cross-section data, we introduce the UruDendro4 dataset, a collection of 102 image samples of Pinus taeda L., each manually annotated with annual growth rings. Unlike existing public datasets, UruDendro4 includes samples extracted at multiple heights along the stem, allowing for the volumetric modeling of annual growth using manually delineated rings. This dataset (images and annotations) allows the development of volumetric models for annual wood estimation based on cross-sectional imagery.
  Additionally, we provide a performance baseline for automatic ring detection on this dataset using state-of-the-art methods. The highest performance was achieved by the DeepCS-TRD method, with a mean Average Precision of 0.838, a mean Average Recall of 0.782, and an Adapted Rand Error score of 0.084. A series of ablation experiments were conducted to empirically validate the final parameter configuration. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that training a learning model including this dataset improves the model's generalization in the tree-ring detection task.

Conclusion: BUSTR框架通过结合结构化描述符和放射组学特征，无需配对的图像-报告数据即可生成乳腺超声报告，显著提升了自动报告指标和临床效果。

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation (RRG) for breast ultrasound (BUS) is limited by the lack of paired image-report datasets and the risk of hallucinations from large language models. We propose BUSTR, a multitask vision-language framework that generates BUS reports without requiring paired image-report supervision. BUSTR constructs reports from structured descriptors (e.g., BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features, learns descriptor-aware visual representations with a multi-head Swin encoder trained using a multitask loss over dataset-specific descriptor sets, and aligns visual and textual tokens via a dual-level objective that combines token-level cross-entropy with a cosine-similarity alignment loss between input and output representations. We evaluate BUSTR on two public BUS datasets, BrEaST and BUS-BRA, which differ in size and available descriptors. Across both datasets, BUSTR consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics, particularly for key targets such as BI-RADS category and pathology. Our results show that this descriptor-aware vision model, trained with a combined token-level and alignment loss, improves both automatic report metrics and clinical efficacy without requiring paired image-report data.

TL;DR: StickerNet introduces a new image composition task focusing on artistic and playful edits, using a dataset from real-world editing actions to outperform baselines and match human behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users of online platforms motivated by gaining community recognition often aim to create content that is more artistic, playful, or socially engaging, rather than preserving realism.

Method: We present StickerNet, a two-stage framework that first determines the composition type, then predicts placement parameters such as opacity, mask, location, and scale accordingly.

Result: User studies and quantitative evaluations show that StickerNet outperforms common baselines and closely matches human placement behavior.

Conclusion: This work introduces a new direction in visual understanding that emphasizes expressiveness and user intent over realism.

Abstract: As a widely used operation in image editing workflows, image composition has traditionally been studied with a focus on achieving visual realism and semantic plausibility. However, in practical editing scenarios of the modern content creation landscape, many compositions are not intended to preserve realism. Instead, users of online platforms motivated by gaining community recognition often aim to create content that is more artistic, playful, or socially engaging. Taking inspiration from this observation, we define the expressive composition task, a new formulation of image composition that embraces stylistic diversity and looser placement logic, reflecting how users edit images on real-world creative platforms. To address this underexplored problem, we present StickerNet, a two-stage framework that first determines the composition type, then predicts placement parameters such as opacity, mask, location, and scale accordingly. Unlike prior work that constructs datasets by simulating object placements on real images, we directly build our dataset from 1.8 million editing actions collected on an anonymous online visual creation and editing platform, each reflecting user-community validated placement decisions. This grounding in authentic editing behavior ensures strong alignment between task definition and training supervision. User studies and quantitative evaluations show that StickerNet outperforms common baselines and closely matches human placement behavior, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning from real-world editing patterns despite the inherent ambiguity of the task. This work introduces a new direction in visual understanding that emphasizes expressiveness and user intent over realism.

Method: 采用序列化方法，利用摄像头的重叠覆盖区域，迭代应用不同令牌限制的VLMs，并通过对象级相似性检测器智能绕过冗余调用。

Result: 实验结果表明，TrafficLens能将视频到文本转换时间减少至多4倍，且信息准确性不受影响。

Conclusion: TrafficLens算法通过优化多摄像头交通路口的视频到文本转换流程，显著提升了处理效率，同时保持了信息准确性。

Abstract: Traffic cameras are essential in urban areas, playing a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. Multiple cameras at intersections enhance law enforcement capabilities, traffic management, and pedestrian safety. However, efficiently managing and analyzing multi-camera feeds poses challenges due to the vast amount of data. Analyzing such huge video data requires advanced analytical tools. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, excel in text-based tasks, integrating them into traffic video analysis demands converting video data into text using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), which is time-consuming and delays the timely utilization of traffic videos for generating insights and investigating incidents. To address these challenges, we propose TrafficLens, a tailored algorithm for multi-camera traffic intersections. TrafficLens employs a sequential approach, utilizing overlapping coverage areas of cameras. It iteratively applies VLMs with varying token limits, using previous outputs as prompts for subsequent cameras, enabling rapid generation of detailed textual descriptions while reducing processing time. Additionally, TrafficLens intelligently bypasses redundant VLM invocations through an object-level similarity detector. Experimental results with real-world datasets demonstrate that TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to $4\times$ while maintaining information accuracy.

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning across healthcare institutions promises improved diagnostic accuracy by leveraging diverse datasets, yet privacy regulations such as HIPAA prohibit direct patient data sharing. While federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training without raw data exchange, recent studies show that model gradients in conventional FL remain vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, potentially exposing sensitive medical information. This paper presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure multi-institutional histopathology classification. The approach leverages the ViT CLS token as a compact 768-dimensional feature representation for secure aggregation, encrypting these tokens using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to the server. We demonstrate that encrypting CLS tokens achieves a 30-fold communication reduction compared to gradient encryption while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. Through evaluation on a three-client federated setup for lung cancer histopathology classification, we show that gradients are highly susceptible to model inversion attacks (PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741), enabling near-perfect image reconstruction. In contrast, the proposed CLS-protected HE approach prevents such attacks while enabling encrypted inference directly on ciphertexts, requiring only 326 KB of encrypted data transmission per aggregation round. The framework achieves 96.12 percent global classification accuracy in the unencrypted domain and 90.02 percent in the encrypted domain.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于双校正流的无反转风格迁移框架，通过并行预测内容和风格轨迹，并通过动态中点插值融合它们，有效解决了传统方法依赖计算密集型反转过程的问题，提高了效率和视觉保真度。

Abstract: Style transfer, a pivotal task in image processing, synthesizes visually compelling images by seamlessly blending realistic content with artistic styles, enabling applications in photo editing and creative design. While mainstream training-free diffusion-based methods have greatly advanced style transfer in recent years, their reliance on computationally inversion processes compromises efficiency and introduces visual distortions when inversion is inaccurate. To address these limitations, we propose a novel \textit{inversion-free} style transfer framework based on dual rectified flows, which tackles the challenge of finding an unknown stylized distribution from two distinct inputs (content and style images), \textit{only with forward pass}. Our approach predicts content and style trajectories in parallel, then fuses them through a dynamic midpoint interpolation that integrates velocities from both paths while adapting to the evolving stylized image. By jointly modeling the content, style, and stylized distributions, our velocity field design achieves robust fusion and avoids the shortcomings of naive overlays. Attention injection further guides style integration, enhancing visual fidelity, content preservation, and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate generalization across diverse styles and content, providing an effective and efficient pipeline for style transfer.

Conclusion: 提出的Ref-COD框架通过将参考图像蒸馏为类别原型内存，并在推理时通过查询条件混合原型合成参考向量，实现了无需测试时参考图像的高效部署，性能与现有方法相当或更优。

Abstract: Referring Camouflaged Object Detection (Ref-COD) segments specified camouflaged objects in a scene by leveraging a small set of referring images. Though effective, current systems adopt a dual-branch design that requires reference images at test time, which limits deployability and adds latency and data-collection burden. We introduce a Ref-COD framework that distills references into a class-prototype memory during training and synthesizes a reference vector at inference via a query-conditioned mixture of prototypes. Concretely, we maintain an EMA-updated prototype per category and predict mixture weights from the query to produce a guidance vector without any test-time references. To bridge the representation gap between reference statistics and camouflaged query features, we propose a bidirectional attention alignment module that adapts both the query features and the class representation. Thus, our approach yields a simple, efficient path to Ref-COD without mandatory references. We evaluate the proposed method on the large-scale R2C7K benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate competitive or superior performance of the proposed method compared with recent state-of-the-arts. Code is available at https://github.com/yuhuan-wu/RefOnce.

Abstract: Accurately localizing and segmenting obscured objects from faint light patterns beyond the field of view is highly challenging due to multiple scattering and medium-induced perturbations. Most existing methods, based on real-valued modeling or local convolutional operations, are inadequate for capturing the underlying physics of coherent light propagation. Moreover, under low signal-to-noise conditions, these methods often converge to non-physical solutions, severely compromising the stability and reliability of the observation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel physics-driven Wavefront Propagating Compensation Network (WavePCNet) to simulate wavefront propagation and enhance the perception of obscured objects. This WavePCNet integrates the Tri-Phase Wavefront Complex-Propagation Reprojection (TriWCP) to incorporate complex amplitude transfer operators to precisely constrain coherent propagation behavior, along with a momentum memory mechanism to effectively suppress the accumulation of perturbations. Additionally, a High-frequency Cross-layer Compensation Enhancement is introduced to construct frequency-selective pathways with multi-scale receptive fields and dynamically model structural consistency across layers, further boosting the model's robustness and interpretability under complex environmental conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on four physically collected datasets demonstrate that WavePCNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are increasingly deployed for vision-language tasks that produce explicit intermediate rationales. However, reasoning traces can contain unsafe content even when the final answer is non-harmful, creating deployment risks. Existing multimodal safety guards primarily evaluate only the input question and the final answer, neglecting the intermediate reasoning process. This oversight allows undetected harm, such as biased inferences or policy-violating use of visual context, to emerge during reasoning. We introduce GuardTrace-VL, a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors the full Question-Thinking-Answer (QTA) pipeline via joint image-text analysis, enabling detection of unsafe content as it emerges in the reasoning stage. To support training and evaluation, we construct the GuardTrace dataset, which is generated through diverse prompting strategies and refined via a MLRM- and human-based voting and verification pipeline. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage progressive training scheme combined with the data refinement process, enabling the model to learn nuanced and context-dependent safety preferences according to different risk levels. On our proposed test set covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, GuardTrace-VL model achieves an F1 score of 93.1% on unsafe reasoning detection tasks, representing a 13.5% improvement in F1 score compared to the previous strongest multimodal safety defense methods. The codes will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Images can be viewed as layered compositions, foreground objects over background, with potential occlusions. This layered representation enables independent editing of elements, offering greater flexibility for content creation. Despite the progress in large generative models, decomposing a single image into layers remains challenging due to limited methods and data. We observe a strong connection between layer decomposition and in/outpainting tasks, and propose adapting a diffusion-based inpainting model for layer decomposition using lightweight finetuning. To further preserve detail in the latent space, we introduce a novel multi-modal context fusion module with linear attention complexity. Our model is trained purely on a synthetic dataset constructed from open-source assets and achieves superior performance in object removal and occlusion recovery, unlocking new possibilities in downstream editing and creative applications.

Abstract: News image captioning aims to produce journalistically informative descriptions by combining visual content with contextual cues from associated articles. Despite recent advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: (1) incomplete information coverage, (2) weak cross-modal alignment, and (3) suboptimal visual-entity grounding. To address these issues, we introduce MERGE, the first Multimodal Entity-aware Retrieval-augmented GEneration framework for news image captioning. MERGE constructs an entity-centric multimodal knowledge base (EMKB) that integrates textual, visual, and structured knowledge, enabling enriched background retrieval. It improves cross-modal alignment through a multistage hypothesis-caption strategy and enhances visual-entity matching via dynamic retrieval guided by image content. Extensive experiments on GoodNews and NYTimes800k show that MERGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with CIDEr gains of +6.84 and +1.16 in caption quality, and F1-score improvements of +4.14 and +2.64 in named entity recognition. Notably, MERGE also generalizes well to the unseen Visual News dataset, achieving +20.17 in CIDEr and +6.22 in F1-score, demonstrating strong robustness and domain adaptability.

Conclusion: MetaRank通过元学习框架实现了任务感知的MTE度量选择，显著提升了模型迁移性能，并在广泛实验中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate pre-trained source model is a critical, yet computationally expensive, task in transfer learning. Model Transferability Estimation (MTE) methods address this by providing efficient proxy metrics to rank models without full fine-tuning. In practice, the choice of which MTE metric to use is often ad hoc or guided simply by a metric's average historical performance. However, we observe that the effectiveness of MTE metrics is highly task-dependent and no single metric is universally optimal across all target datasets. To address this gap, we introduce MetaRank, a meta-learning framework for automatic, task-aware MTE metric selection. We formulate metric selection as a learning-to-rank problem. Rather than relying on conventional meta-features, MetaRank encodes textual descriptions of both datasets and MTE metrics using a pretrained language model, embedding them into a shared semantic space. A meta-predictor is then trained offline on diverse meta-tasks to learn the intricate relationship between dataset characteristics and metric mechanisms, optimized with a listwise objective that prioritizes correctly ranking the top-performing metrics. During the subsequent online phase, MetaRank efficiently ranks the candidate MTE metrics for a new, unseen target dataset based on its textual description, enabling practitioners to select the most appropriate metric a priori. Extensive experiments across 11 pretrained models and 11 target datasets demonstrate the strong effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Trustworthy multi-view classification (TMVC) addresses the challenge of achieving reliable decision-making in complex scenarios where multi-source information is heterogeneous, inconsistent, or even conflicting. Existing TMVC approaches predominantly rely on globally dense neighbor relationships to model intra-view dependencies, leading to high computational costs and an inability to directly ensure consistency across inter-view relationships. Furthermore, these methods typically aggregate evidence from different views through manually assigned weights, lacking guarantees that the learned multi-view neighbor structures are consistent within the class space, thus undermining the trustworthiness of classification outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel TMVC framework that introduces prototypes to represent the neighbor structures of each view. By simplifying the learning of intra-view neighbor relations and enabling dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view structure, our approach facilitates more efficient and consistent discovery of cross-view consensus. Extensive experiments on multiple public multi-view datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive downstream performance and robustness compared to prevalent TMVC methods.

Result: 实验表明，CameraMaster对参数变化产生单调且接近线性的响应，支持无缝多参数组合，并显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CameraMaster提出了一种统一的相机感知框架，通过显式解耦相机指令并整合指令表示与参数嵌入，显著提升了图像修饰的物理一致性和参数控制精度。

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have greatly advanced image editing and generation. However, achieving physically consistent image retouching with precise parameter control (e.g., exposure, white balance, zoom) remains challenging. Existing methods either rely solely on ambiguous and entangled text prompts, which hinders precise camera control, or train separate heads/weights for parameter adjustment, which compromises scalability, multi-parameter composition, and sensitivity to subtle variations. To address these limitations, we propose CameraMaster, a unified camera-aware framework for image retouching. The key idea is to explicitly decouple the camera directive and then coherently integrate two critical information streams: a directive representation that captures the photographer's intent, and a parameter embedding that encodes precise camera settings. CameraMaster first uses the camera parameter embedding to modulate both the camera directive and the content semantics. The modulated directive is then injected into the content features via cross-attention, yielding a strongly camera-sensitive semantic context. In addition, the directive and camera embeddings are injected as conditioning and gating signals into the time embedding, enabling unified, layer-wise modulation throughout the denoising process and enforcing tight semantic-parameter alignment. To train and evaluate CameraMaster, we construct a large-scale dataset of 78K image-prompt pairs annotated with camera parameters. Extensive experiments show that CameraMaster produces monotonic and near-linear responses to parameter variations, supports seamless multi-parameter composition, and significantly outperforms existing methods.

Result: 评估发现，即使传统图像问答基准表现相近的模型，在描述效用上差距可达32%。

Conclusion: 论文提出了CaptionQA基准测试，用于评估模型生成的图像描述在下游任务中的实用性，揭示了现有模型在描述效用上的显著差距，并开源了扩展新领域的工具。

Abstract: Image captions serve as efficient surrogates for visual content in multimodal systems such as retrieval, recommendation, and multi-step agentic inference pipelines. Yet current evaluation practices miss a fundamental question: Can captions stand-in for images in real downstream tasks? We propose a utility-based benchmark, CaptionQA, to evaluate model-generated captions, where caption quality is measured by how well it supports downstream tasks. CaptionQA is an extensible domain-dependent benchmark covering 4 domains--Natural, Document, E-commerce, and Embodied AI--each with fine-grained taxonomies (25 top-level and 69 subcategories) that identify useful information for domain-specific tasks. CaptionQA builds 33,027 densely annotated multiple-choice questions (50.3 per image on average) that explicitly require visual information to answer, providing a comprehensive probe of caption utility. In our evaluation protocol, an LLM answers these questions using captions alone, directly measuring whether captions preserve image-level utility and are utilizable by a downstream LLM. Evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals substantial gaps between the image and its caption utility. Notably, models nearly identical on traditional image-QA benchmarks lower by up to 32% in caption utility. We release CaptionQA along with an open-source pipeline for extension to new domains. The code is available at https://github.com/bronyayang/CaptionQA.

Result: 在AIST++和FineDance数据集上，FlowerDance在运动质量和生成效率上均达到最优。

Conclusion: FlowerDance在音乐到舞蹈的生成中实现了高质量和高效率，支持运动编辑，并在AIST++和FineDance数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to translate auditory signals into expressive human motion, with broad applications in virtual reality, choreography, and digital entertainment. Despite promising progress, the limited generation efficiency of existing methods leaves insufficient computational headroom for high-fidelity 3D rendering, thereby constraining the expressiveness of 3D characters during real-world applications. Thus, we propose FlowerDance, which not only generates refined motion with physical plausibility and artistic expressiveness, but also achieves significant generation efficiency on inference speed and memory utilization . Specifically, FlowerDance combines MeanFlow with Physical Consistency Constraints, which enables high-quality motion generation with only a few sampling steps. Moreover, FlowerDance leverages a simple but efficient model architecture with BiMamba-based backbone and Channel-Level Cross-Modal Fusion, which generates dance with efficient non-autoregressive manner. Meanwhile, FlowerDance supports motion editing, enabling users to interactively refine dance sequences. Extensive experiments on AIST++ and FineDance show that FlowerDance achieves state-of-the-art results in both motion quality and generation efficiency. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Diagnosing lung cancer typically involves physicians identifying lung nodules in Computed tomography (CT) scans and generating diagnostic reports based on their morphological features and medical expertise. Although advancements have been made in using multimodal large language models for analyzing lung CT scans, challenges remain in accurately describing nodule morphology and incorporating medical expertise. These limitations affect the reliability and effectiveness of these models in clinical settings. Collaborative multi-agent systems offer a promising strategy for achieving a balance between generality and precision in medical applications, yet their potential in pathology has not been thoroughly explored. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LungNoduleAgent, an innovative collaborative multi-agent system specifically designed for analyzing lung CT scans. LungNoduleAgent streamlines the diagnostic process into sequential components, improving precision in describing nodules and grading malignancy through three primary modules. The first module, the Nodule Spotter, coordinates clinical detection models to accurately identify nodules. The second module, the Radiologist, integrates localized image description techniques to produce comprehensive CT reports. Finally, the Doctor Agent System performs malignancy reasoning by using images and CT reports, supported by a pathology knowledge base and a multi-agent system framework. Extensive testing on two private datasets and the public LIDC-IDRI dataset indicates that LungNoduleAgent surpasses mainstream vision-language models, agent systems, and advanced expert models. These results highlight the importance of region-level semantic alignment and multi-agent collaboration in diagnosing nodules. LungNoduleAgent stands out as a promising foundational tool for supporting clinical analyses of lung nodules.

Abstract: Spatially varying image deblurring remains a fundamentally ill-posed problem, especially when degradations arise from complex mixtures of motion and other forms of blur under significant noise. State-of-the-art learning-based approaches generally fall into two paradigms: model-based deep unrolling methods that enforce physical constraints by modeling the degradations, but often produce over-smoothed, artifact-laden textures, and generative models that achieve superior perceptual quality yet hallucinate details due to weak physical constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that uniquely reconciles these paradigms by taming a powerful generative prior with explicit, dense physical constraints. Rather than oversimplifying the degradation field, we model it as a dense continuum of high-dimensional compressed kernels, ensuring that minute variations in motion and other degradation patterns are captured. We leverage this rich descriptor field to condition a ControlNet architecture, strongly guiding the diffusion sampling process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively bridges the gap between physical accuracy and perceptual realism, outperforming state-of-the-art model-based methods as well as generative baselines in challenging, severely blurred scenarios.

Motivation: 当前图像情感合成方法将生成和编辑任务分离，导致效率低下且限制应用场景，如治疗干预或叙事。

Result: 实验结果显示，MUSE 在情感准确性和语义多样性上表现优越，同时保持内容、文本提示和情感表达之间的平衡。

Conclusion: MUSE 框架在情感生成和编辑任务中表现优于现有方法，建立了情感合成的新范式。

Abstract: Images evoke emotions that profoundly influence perception, often prioritized over content. Current Image Emotional Synthesis (IES) approaches artificially separate generation and editing tasks, creating inefficiencies and limiting applications where these tasks naturally intertwine, such as therapeutic interventions or storytelling. In this work, we introduce MUSE, the first unified framework capable of both emotional generation and editing. By adopting a strategy conceptually aligned with Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that widely used in both LLM and diffusion model communities, it avoids the requirement for additional updating diffusion model and specialized emotional synthesis datasets. More specifically, MUSE addresses three key questions in emotional synthesis: (1) HOW to stably guide synthesis by leveraging an off-the-shelf emotion classifier with gradient-based optimization of emotional tokens; (2) WHEN to introduce emotional guidance by identifying the optimal timing using semantic similarity as a supervisory signal; and (3) WHICH emotion to guide synthesis through a multi-emotion loss that reduces interference from inherent and similar emotions. Experimental results show that MUSE performs favorably against all methods for both generation and editing, improving emotional accuracy and semantic diversity while maintaining an optimal balance between desired content, adherence to text prompts, and realistic emotional expression. It establishes a new paradigm for emotion synthesis.

Conclusion: T-NIG模型在短期和长期预测任务中均表现出色，能够有效维持疾病相关特征，即使面对不规则时间分布的数据。

Abstract: Image generation can provide physicians with an imaging diagnosis basis in the prediction of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Recent research has shown that long-term AD predictions by image generation often face difficulties maintaining disease-related characteristics when dealing with irregular time intervals in sequential data. Considering that the time-related aspects of the distribution can reflect changes in disease-related characteristics when images are distributed unevenly, this research proposes a model to estimate the temporal parameter within the Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution (T-NIG) to assist in generating images over the long term. The T-NIG model employs brain images from two different time points to create intermediate brain images, forecast future images, and predict the disease. T-NIG is designed by identifying features using coordinate neighborhoods. It incorporates a time parameter into the normal inverse gamma distribution to understand how features change in brain imaging sequences that have varying time intervals. Additionally, T-NIG utilizes uncertainty estimation to reduce both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in the model, which arise from insufficient temporal data. In particular, the T-NIG model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term prediction tasks within the dataset. Experimental results indicate that T-NIG is proficient in forecasting disease progression while maintaining disease-related characteristics, even when faced with an irregular temporal data distribution.

TL;DR: MIRA, a multimodal reasoning agent, improves image editing by iteratively processing instructions, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based editing models often fail to accurately interpret complex user instructions, leading to semantic drift or unintended edits.

Method: MIRA employs a lightweight, plug-and-play multimodal reasoning agent with an iterative perception-reasoning-action loop, trained using a two-stage SFT + GRPO pipeline on the MIRA-Editing dataset.

Result: MIRA enhances performance when paired with open-source image editing models, achieving results comparable to or better than proprietary systems.

Conclusion: MIRA significantly improves semantic consistency and perceptual quality in instruction-guided image editing, matching or surpassing proprietary systems.

Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing offers an intuitive way for users to edit images with natural language. However, diffusion-based editing models often struggle to accurately interpret complex user instructions, especially those involving compositional relationships, contextual cues, or referring expressions, leading to edits that drift semantically or fail to reflect the intended changes. We tackle this problem by proposing MIRA (Multimodal Iterative Reasoning Agent), a lightweight, plug-and-play multimodal reasoning agent that performs editing through an iterative perception-reasoning-action loop, effectively simulating multi-turn human-model interaction processes. Instead of issuing a single prompt or static plan, MIRA predicts atomic edit instructions step by step, using visual feedback to make its decisions. Our 150K multimodal tool-use dataset, MIRA-Editing, combined with a two-stage SFT + GRPO training pipeline, enables MIRA to perform reasoning and editing over complex editing instructions. When paired with open-source image editing models such as Flux.1-Kontext, Step1X-Edit, and Qwen-Image-Edit, MIRA significantly improves both semantic consistency and perceptual quality, achieving performance comparable to or exceeding proprietary systems such as GPT-Image and Nano-Banana.

Abstract: Iris authentication algorithms have achieved impressive recognition performance, making them highly promising for real-world applications such as border control, citizen identification, and both criminal investigations and commercial systems. However, their robustness is still challenged by variations in rotation, scale, specular reflections, and defocus blur. In addition, most existing approaches rely on straightforward point-to-point comparisons, typically using cosine or L2 distance, without effectively leveraging the spatio-spatial-temporal structure of iris patterns. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and generalized matching pipeline that learns rich spatio-spatial-temporal representations of iris features. Our approach first splits each iris image along one dimension, generating a sequence of sub-images that serve as input to a 3D-CNN, enabling the network to capture both spatial and spatio-spatial-temporal cues. To further enhance the modeling of spatio-spatial-temporal feature dynamics, we train the model in curriculum manner. This design allows the network to embed temporal dependencies directly into the feature space, improving discriminability in the deep metric domain. The framework is trained end-to-end with triplet and ArcFace loss in a curriculum manner, enforcing highly discriminative embeddings despite challenges like rotation, scale, reflections, and blur. This design yields a robust and generalizable solution for iris authentication.Github code: https://github.com/GeetanjaliGTZ/CLRecogEye

Abstract: Radar sensors provide reliable perception across adverse weather, lighting, and long-range conditions. Recent advances in foundation models have transformed visual and language understanding, yet their integration with radar sensing remains largely underexplored. Existing radar approaches are fragmented and task-specific; each downstream task employs distinct architectures and training objectives, preventing transfer across tasks. In this work, we introduce RadarFM: a radar foundation model that learns unified scene-level representations through structured spatial language supervision. We make two key contributions: (1) a structured caption framework that encodes vehicle distributions in native radar coordinates, and (2) a hash-aware contrastive learning objective that quantifies continuous scene similarity rather than binary matching, enabling fine-grained spatial reasoning. Leveraging the CARLA simulator, we generate large-scale, well-annotated radar datasets across diverse driving scenarios. We also propose localization-aware metrics that assess spatial accuracy beyond traditional detection measures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的高效MLLMs通过压缩视觉令牌减少资源消耗，但视觉信息的丢失会降低理解能力。尽管先前研究引入知识蒸馏增强学生模型，但忽视了高效学生与原始教师模型之间因视觉令牌不平衡导致的细粒度视觉理解差异。

Method: EM-KD首先计算教师和学生模型视觉logits之间的曼哈顿距离，并使用匈牙利匹配算法在空间维度上对齐。随后引入两种蒸馏策略：视觉-语言亲和力蒸馏（VLAD）和视觉语义蒸馏（VSD）。VLAD通过计算文本令牌与对齐视觉令牌之间的亲和矩阵，并最小化学生和教师亲和矩阵之间的平滑L1距离。VSD则利用反向KL散度测量对齐视觉logits在词汇空间上的离散概率分布。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，EM-KD训练的模型在准确性和效率上均显著优于先前的高效MLLMs，且相比其他蒸馏方法（配备提出的视觉令牌匹配策略），EM-KD表现更优。

Conclusion: EM-KD通过提出一种新颖的知识蒸馏范式，显著提升了高效多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的准确性和效率，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) compress vision tokens to reduce resource consumption, but the loss of visual information can degrade comprehension capabilities. Although some priors introduce Knowledge Distillation to enhance student models, they overlook the fundamental differences in fine-grained vision comprehension caused by unbalanced vision tokens between the efficient student and vanilla teacher. In this paper, we propose EM-KD, a novel paradigm that enhances the Efficient MLLMs with Knowledge Distillation. To overcome the challenge of unbalanced vision tokens, we first calculate the Manhattan distance between the vision logits of teacher and student, and then align them in the spatial dimension with the Hungarian matching algorithm. After alignment, EM-KD introduces two distillation strategies: 1) Vision-Language Affinity Distillation (VLAD) and 2) Vision Semantic Distillation (VSD). Specifically, VLAD calculates the affinity matrix between text tokens and aligned vision tokens, and minimizes the smooth L1 distance of the student and the teacher affinity matrices. Considering the semantic richness of vision logits in the final layer, VSD employs the reverse KL divergence to measure the discrete probability distributions of the aligned vision logits over the vocabulary space. Comprehensive evaluation on diverse benchmarks demonstrates that EM-KD trained model outperforms prior Efficient MLLMs on both accuracy and efficiency with a large margin, validating its effectiveness. Compared with previous distillation methods, which are equipped with our proposed vision token matching strategy for fair comparison, EM-KD also achieves better performance.

Conclusion: FaithFusion通过像素级期望信息增益（EIG）有效融合3DGS和扩散模型，实现了几何保真度和视觉合理性的平衡，并在Waymo数据集上达到了SOTA性能。

Abstract: In controllable driving-scene reconstruction and 3D scene generation, maintaining geometric fidelity while synthesizing visually plausible appearance under large viewpoint shifts is crucial. However, effective fusion of geometry-based 3DGS and appearance-driven diffusion models faces inherent challenges, as the absence of pixel-wise, 3D-consistent editing criteria often leads to over-restoration and geometric drift. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{FaithFusion}, a 3DGS-diffusion fusion framework driven by pixel-wise Expected Information Gain (EIG). EIG acts as a unified policy for coherent spatio-temporal synthesis: it guides diffusion as a spatial prior to refine high-uncertainty regions, while its pixel-level weighting distills the edits back into 3DGS. The resulting plug-and-play system is free from extra prior conditions and structural modifications.Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our approach attains SOTA performance across NTA-IoU, NTL-IoU, and FID, maintaining an FID of 107.47 even at 6 meters lane shift.

Conclusion: DATGN通过生成与阿尔茨海默病脑萎缩趋势一致的MRI图像，实现了早期疾病预测，并在分类准确率上取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a degenerative brain condition, can benefit from early prediction to slow its progression. As the disease progresses, patients typically undergo brain atrophy. Current prediction methods for Alzheimers disease largely involve analyzing morphological changes in brain images through manual feature extraction. This paper proposes a novel method, the Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN), to automate the learning of morphological changes in brain images about disease progression for early prediction. Given the common occurrence of missing data in the temporal sequences of MRI images, DATGN initially interpolates incomplete sequences. Subsequently, a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module guides the network in generating future MRI images that adhere to the disease's progression, facilitating early prediction of Alzheimer's disease. DATGN was tested for the generation of temporal sequences of future MRI images using the ADNI dataset, and the experimental results are competitive in terms of PSNR and MMSE image quality metrics. Furthermore, when DATGN-generated synthetic data was integrated into the SVM vs. CNN vs. 3DCNN-based classification methods, significant improvements were achieved from 6. 21\% to 16\% in AD vs. NC classification accuracy and from 7. 34\% to 21. 25\% in AD vs. MCI vs. NC classification accuracy. The qualitative visualization results indicate that DATGN produces MRI images consistent with the brain atrophy trend in Alzheimer's disease, enabling early disease prediction.

Abstract: Large-scale vision generative models, including diffusion and flow models, have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, transferring these pre-trained models to downstream tasks often results in significant parameter redundancy. In this paper, we propose EntPruner, an entropy-guided automatic progressive pruning framework for diffusion and flow models. First, we introduce entropy-guided pruning, a block-level importance assessment strategy specifically designed for generative models. Unlike discriminative models, generative models require preserving the diversity and condition-fidelity of the output distribution. As the importance of each module can vary significantly across downstream tasks, EntPruner prioritizes pruning of less important blocks using data-dependent Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) as a guiding metric. CED quantifies how much the distribution diverges from the learned conditional data distribution after removing a block. Second, we propose a zero-shot adaptive pruning framework to automatically determine when and how much to prune during training. This dynamic strategy avoids the pitfalls of one-shot pruning, mitigating mode collapse, and preserving model performance. Extensive experiments on DiT and SiT models demonstrate the effectiveness of EntPruner, achieving up to 2.22$\times$ inference speedup while maintaining competitive generation quality on ImageNet and three downstream datasets.

Abstract: It is well-known that if a network aims to learn how to deblur, it should understand the blur process. Blurring is naturally caused by the convolution of the sharp image with the blur kernel. Thus, allowing the network to learn the blur process in the kernel-level can significantly improve the image deblurring performance. But, current deep networks are still at the pixel-level learning stage, either performing end-to-end pixel-level restoration or stage-wise pseudo kernel-level restoration, failing to enable the deblur model to understand the essence of the blur. To this end, we propose Fourier Kernel Estimator (FKE), which considers the activation operation in Fourier space and converts the convolution problem in the spatial domain to a multiplication problem in Fourier space. Our FKE, jointly optimized with the deblur model, enables the network to learn the kernel-level blur process with low complexity and without any additional supervision. Furthermore, we change the convolution object of the kernel from ``image" to network extracted ``feature", whose rich semantic and structural information is more suitable to blur process learning. With the convolution of the feature and the estimated kernel, our model can learn the essence of blur in kernel-level. To further improve the efficiency of feature extraction, we design a decoupled multi-scale architecture with multiple hierarchical sub-unets with a reversible strategy, which allows better multi-scale encoding and decoding in low training memory. Extensive experiments indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art motion deblurring results and show potential for handling other kernel-related problems. Analysis also shows our kernel estimator is able to learn physically meaningful kernels. The code will be available at https://github.com/DeepMed-Lab-ECNU/Single-Image-Deblur.

Abstract: Human video generation has advanced rapidly with the development of diffusion models, but the high computational cost and substantial memory consumption associated with training these models on high-resolution, multi-frame data pose significant challenges. In this paper, we propose Entropy-Guided Prioritized Progressive Learning (Ent-Prog), an efficient training framework tailored for diffusion models on human video generation. First, we introduce Conditional Entropy Inflation (CEI) to assess the importance of different model components on the target conditional generation task, enabling prioritized training of the most critical components. Second, we introduce an adaptive progressive schedule that adaptively increases computational complexity during training by measuring the convergence efficiency. Ent-Prog reduces both training time and GPU memory consumption while maintaining model performance. Extensive experiments across three datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of Ent-Prog, achieving up to 2.2$\times$ training speedup and 2.4$\times$ GPU memory reduction without compromising generative performance.

Motivation: 现有方法在跨模态对齐中存在两个主要问题：条件查询缺乏帧间依赖性和变化建模，以及文本约束的延迟整合可能导致视频特征聚焦于非目标对象。

Method: 提出ProxyFormer架构，使用代理查询整合视觉和文本语义，并通过多阶段视频特征编码器动态更新和传播代理查询。采用时空维度解耦的跨模态交互和联合语义一致性（JSC）训练策略。

Result: 在四个广泛使用的RVOS基准测试中，ProxyFormer表现出优于现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: ProxyFormer通过引入代理查询和联合语义一致性训练策略，显著提升了RVOS任务的性能，并在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) is an emerging cross-modality task that aims to generate pixel-level maps of the target objects referred by given textual expressions. The main concept involves learning an accurate alignment of visual elements and language expressions within a semantic space. Recent approaches address cross-modality alignment through conditional queries, tracking the target object using a query-response based mechanism built upon transformer structure. However, they exhibit two limitations: (1) these conditional queries lack inter-frame dependency and variation modeling, making accurate target tracking challenging amid significant frame-to-frame variations; and (2) they integrate textual constraints belatedly, which may cause the video features potentially focus on the non-referred objects. Therefore, we propose a novel RVOS architecture called ProxyFormer, which introduces a set of proxy queries to integrate visual and text semantics and facilitate the flow of semantics between them. By progressively updating and propagating proxy queries across multiple stages of video feature encoder, ProxyFormer ensures that the video features are focused on the object of interest. This dynamic evolution also enables the establishment of inter-frame dependencies, enhancing the accuracy and coherence of object tracking. To mitigate high computational costs, we decouple cross-modality interactions into temporal and spatial dimensions. Additionally, we design a Joint Semantic Consistency (JSC) training strategy to align semantic consensus between the proxy queries and the combined video-text pairs. Comprehensive experiments on four widely used RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our ProxyFormer to the state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有安全评估方法无法捕捉视频生成的复杂时序动态，亟需针对T2V模型的自动化红队测试框架。

Method: TEAR采用两阶段优化方法：初始生成器训练和时序感知在线偏好学习，结合循环优化的对抗提示生成策略。

Result: TEAR在开源和商业T2V系统中实现了超过80%的攻击成功率，较之前最佳结果57%有显著提升。

Conclusion: TEAR框架显著提升了文本到视频模型的安全性评估，攻击成功率从57%提升至80%以上，验证了其在捕捉动态时序风险方面的有效性。

Abstract: Text-to-Video (T2V) models are capable of synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent dynamic video content, but the diverse generation also inherently introduces critical safety challenges. Existing safety evaluation methods,which focus on static image and text generation, are insufficient to capture the complex temporal dynamics in video generation. To address this, we propose a TEmporal-aware Automated Red-teaming framework, named TEAR, an automated framework designed to uncover safety risks specifically linked to the dynamic temporal sequencing of T2V models. TEAR employs a temporal-aware test generator optimized via a two-stage approach: initial generator training and temporal-aware online preference learning, to craft textually innocuous prompts that exploit temporal dynamics to elicit policy-violating video output. And a refine model is adopted to improve the prompt stealthiness and adversarial effectiveness cyclically. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of TEAR across open-source and commercial T2V systems with over 80% attack success rate, a significant boost from prior best result of 57%.

Motivation: 研究全局原生分辨率视觉编码与切片方法的行为差异，发现全局编码虽提升能力但增加计算开销，因此提出更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出了渐进式视觉压缩（PVC）方法，包括两个关键模块：精细化的补丁嵌入和窗口化令牌压缩，这些模块可以无缝集成到标准视觉Transformer（ViT）中。

Result: ViT-UHD在性能上与MoonViT竞争，同时将TTFT降低了2.4倍；LLaVA-UHD v3与Qwen2-VL性能相当，TTFT进一步降低1.9倍。

Conclusion: LLaVA-UHD v3和ViT-UHD展示了在保持性能的同时显著降低计算开销的能力，为高效多模态大语言模型的研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Visual encoding followed by token condensing has become the standard architectural paradigm in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Many recent MLLMs increasingly favor global native- resolution visual encoding over slice-based methods. To investigate this trend, we systematically compare their behavior on vision-language understanding and attention patterns, revealing that global encoding enhances overall capability but at the expense of greater computational overhead. To address this issue, we present LLaVA-UHD v3, an MLLM centered upon our proposed Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) method, which can be seamlessly integrated into standard Vision Transformer (ViT) to enable efficient native-resolution encoding. The PVC approach consists of two key modules: (i) refined patch embedding, which supports flexible patch-size scaling for fine-grained visual model- ing, (ii) windowed token compression, hierarchically deployed across ViT layers to progressively aggregate local token representations. Jointly modulated by these two modules, a widely pretrained ViT can be reconfigured into an efficient architecture while largely preserving generality. Evaluated across extensive benchmarks, the transformed ViT, termed ViT-UHD, demonstrates competitive performance with MoonViT while reducing TTFT (time-to-first-token) by 2.4x, when developed within an identical MLLM architecture. Building upon ViT-UHD, LLaVA-UHD v3 also achieves competitive performance to Qwen2-VL, while further reducing TTFT by 1.9x. We will release all code and checkpoints to support future research on efficient MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有测试时间扩展策略在视觉自回归模型中应用效果不佳，因缺乏全局画布蓝图且计算资源浪费于错误生成轨迹。

Method: GridAR采用网格分区渐进生成方案，生成多个局部候选并早期修剪不可行选项，结合布局指定提示重构策略以指导后续解码。

Result: 在N=4时，GridAR性能超越Best-of-N（N=8）14.4%，成本降低25.6%；在图像编辑任务中，语义保持提升13.9%。

Conclusion: GridAR框架通过网格分区渐进生成和布局指定提示重构策略，显著提升了视觉自回归模型在有限测试时间扩展下的生成质量，同时在图像编辑任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent visual autoregressive (AR) models have shown promising capabilities in text-to-image generation, operating in a manner similar to large language models. While test-time computation scaling has brought remarkable success in enabling reasoning-enhanced outputs for challenging natural language tasks, its adaptation to visual AR models remains unexplored and poses unique challenges. Naively applying test-time scaling strategies such as Best-of-N can be suboptimal: they consume full-length computation on erroneous generation trajectories, while the raster-scan decoding scheme lacks a blueprint of the entire canvas, limiting scaling benefits as only a few prompt-aligned candidates are generated. To address these, we introduce GridAR, a test-time scaling framework designed to elicit the best possible results from visual AR models. GridAR employs a grid-partitioned progressive generation scheme in which multiple partial candidates for the same position are generated within a canvas, infeasible ones are pruned early, and viable ones are fixed as anchors to guide subsequent decoding. Coupled with this, we present a layout-specified prompt reformulation strategy that inspects partial views to infer a feasible layout for satisfying the prompt. The reformulated prompt then guides subsequent image generation to mitigate the blueprint deficiency. Together, GridAR achieves higher-quality results under limited test-time scaling: with N=4, it even outperforms Best-of-N (N=8) by 14.4% on T2I-CompBench++ while reducing cost by 25.6%. It also generalizes to autoregressive image editing, showing comparable edit quality and a 13.9% gain in semantic preservation on PIE-Bench over larger-N baselines.

Conclusion: UPA-RFAS 是一种有效的通用对抗补丁框架，能够在不同模型、任务和视角下实现跨模型攻击，为未来防御研究提供了基准。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, yet universal and transferable attacks remain underexplored, as most existing patches overfit to a single model and fail in black-box settings. To address this gap, we present a systematic study of universal, transferable adversarial patches against VLA-driven robots under unknown architectures, finetuned variants, and sim-to-real shifts. We introduce UPA-RFAS (Universal Patch Attack via Robust Feature, Attention, and Semantics), a unified framework that learns a single physical patch in a shared feature space while promoting cross-model transfer. UPA-RFAS combines (i) a feature-space objective with an $\ell_1$ deviation prior and repulsive InfoNCE loss to induce transferable representation shifts, (ii) a robustness-augmented two-phase min-max procedure where an inner loop learns invisible sample-wise perturbations and an outer loop optimizes the universal patch against this hardened neighborhood, and (iii) two VLA-specific losses: Patch Attention Dominance to hijack text$\to$vision attention and Patch Semantic Misalignment to induce image-text mismatch without labels. Experiments across diverse VLA models, manipulation suites, and physical executions show that UPA-RFAS consistently transfers across models, tasks, and viewpoints, exposing a practical patch-based attack surface and establishing a strong baseline for future defenses.

Conclusion: AnchorOPT作为一种即插即用的模块，能够无缝集成到现有框架中，并在多样化数据集上实现一致的性能提升。

Abstract: Existing prompt learning methods, which are built upon CLIP models, leverage textual tokens as anchors to guide the learnable soft tokens. This guidance improves CLIP generalizations. However, these anchors-static in both value and position-lack cross-task and stage-adaptive flexibility. To address this limitation, we propose AnchorOPT, a dynamic anchor-based prompt learning framework. Specifically, AnchorOPT introduces dynamism in two key dimensions: (i) anchor values eschew handcrafted explicit textual tokens (e.g., "shape", "color"), instead learning dynamically from task-specific data; and (ii) the positional relationship between anchor and soft tokens is no longer fixed but adaptively optimized via a learnable position matrix conditioned on the training stage and task context. Training occurs in two stages: we first learn the anchor tokens, then freeze and transfer them to the second stage for optimization of soft tokens and the position matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that using only a simple learnable anchor and position matrix achieves performance comparable to or exceeding some methods incorporating additional learnable modules or regularization techniques. As a plug-and-play module, AnchorOPT integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks, yielding consistent performance gains across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: BotaCLIP 通过轻量级多模态对比框架成功将领域特定知识注入预训练的基础模型，显著提升了生态任务中的表现，展示了在数据稀缺环境下高效学习的潜力。

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated a remarkable ability to learn rich, transferable representations across diverse modalities such as images, text, and audio. In modern machine learning pipelines, these representations often replace raw data as the primary input for downstream tasks. In this paper, we address the challenge of adapting a pre-trained foundation model to inject domain-specific knowledge, without retraining from scratch or incurring significant computational costs. To this end, we introduce BotaCLIP, a lightweight multimodal contrastive framework that adapts a pre-trained Earth Observation foundation model (DOFA) by aligning high-resolution aerial imagery with botanical relevés. Unlike generic embeddings, BotaCLIP internalizes ecological structure through contrastive learning with a regularization strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Once trained, the resulting embeddings serve as transferable representations for downstream predictors. Motivated by real-world applications in biodiversity modeling, we evaluated BotaCLIP representations in three ecological tasks: plant presence prediction, butterfly occurrence modeling, and soil trophic group abundance estimation. The results showed consistent improvements over those derived from DOFA and supervised baselines. More broadly, this work illustrates how domain-aware adaptation of foundation models can inject expert knowledge into data-scarce settings, enabling frugal representation learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D vision-language models (VLMs) highlight a strong potential for 3D scene understanding and reasoning. However, effectively tokenizing 3D scenes into holistic scene tokens, and leveraging these tokens across diverse 3D understanding tasks, remain highly challenging. We present NDTokenizer3D, a generalist 3D VLM that performs a wide range of 3D scene understanding tasks while naturally supporting human interactions, thereby bridging language-level reasoning with 3D spatial understanding. The core of our approach is a novel three-stage scene tokenization pipeline built upon a Multi-Scale Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) representation, paired with a Multi-Scale NDT Decoder (MSDec). Specifically, NDTokenizer3D first constructs a multi-scale NDT representation from raw high-resolution point clouds, preserving both global context and fine-grained geometric details. Next, the MSDec progressively fuses cross-scale NDT features, producing holistic scene tokens consumable by LLM endpoints. Beyond tokenization, MSDec is repurposed as a general interface for human-interactive prompting (points, boxes, masks) and segmentation-mask decoding, unifying diverse 3D scene understanding tasks within a single architecture. With this compact and unified design, NDTokenizer3D offers a fine-grained, general-purpose 3D VLM, achieving remarkable improvements in 3D Referring Segmentation, 3D Visual Question Answering, and 3D Dense Captioning.

Abstract: Learning joint representations across multiple modalities remains a central challenge in multimodal machine learning. Prevailing approaches predominantly operate in pairwise settings, aligning two modalities at a time. While some recent methods aim to capture higher-order interactions among multiple modalities, they often overlook or insufficiently preserve pairwise relationships, limiting their effectiveness on single-modality tasks. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Fusion (ConFu), a framework that jointly embeds both individual modalities and their fused combinations into a unified representation space, where modalities and their fused counterparts are aligned. ConFu extends traditional pairwise contrastive objectives with an additional fused-modality contrastive term, encouraging the joint embedding of modality pairs with a third modality. This formulation enables ConFu to capture higher-order dependencies, such as XOR-like relationships, that cannot be recovered through pairwise alignment alone, while still maintaining strong pairwise correspondence. We evaluate ConFu on synthetic and real-world multimodal benchmarks, assessing its ability to exploit cross-modal complementarity, capture higher-order dependencies, and scale with increasing multimodal complexity. Across these settings, ConFu demonstrates competitive performance on retrieval and classification tasks, while supporting unified one-to-one and two-to-one retrieval within a single contrastive framework.

Abstract: Recent deep clustering models have produced impressive clustering performance. However, a common issue with existing methods is the disparity between global and local feature structures. While local structures typically show strong consistency and compactness within class samples, global features often present intertwined boundaries and poorly separated clusters. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCBoost, a parameter-free plug-in designed to enhance the global feature structures of current deep clustering models. By harnessing reliable local structural cues, our method aims to elevate clustering performance effectively. Specifically, we first identify high-confidence samples through adaptive $k$-nearest neighbors-based consistency filtering, aiming to select a sufficient number of samples with high label reliability to serve as trustworthy anchors for self-supervision. Subsequently, these samples are utilized to compute a discriminative loss, which promotes both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, to guide network optimization. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets showcase that our DCBoost significantly improves the clustering performance of diverse existing deep clustering models. Notably, our method improves the performance of current state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., ProPos) by more than 3% and amplifies the silhouette coefficient by over $7\times$.

*Munish Rathee,Boris Bačić,Maryam Doborjeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIFT-SNN框架整合SIFT和SNN，实现92.3%的准确率和9.5ms延迟，适合实时边缘部署，但泛化能力待验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种低延迟、低功耗的神经形态信号处理框架，用于实时检测交通基础设施中的结构异常。

Method: 结合Scale-Invariant Feature Transform（SIFT）进行空间特征编码，以及基于LIF的脉冲神经网络（SNN）进行分类。

Result: 分类准确率为92.3%（±0.8%），单帧推理时间为9.5毫秒，稀疏脉冲活动率为8.1%。

Conclusion: SIFT-SNN框架通过整合SIFT和SNN技术，实现了高精度、低延迟的结构异常检测，适合实时边缘部署，但在未见的现场条件下泛化能力仍需验证。

Abstract: This paper presents the SIFT-SNN framework, a low-latency neuromorphic signal-processing pipeline for real-time detection of structural anomalies in transport infrastructure. The proposed approach integrates Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for spatial feature encoding with a latency-driven spike conversion layer and a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for classification. The Auckland Harbour Bridge dataset is recorded under various weather and lighting conditions, comprising 6,000 labelled frames that include both real and synthetically augmented unsafe cases. The presented system achieves a classification accuracy of 92.3% (+- 0.8%) with a per-frame inference time of 9.5 ms. Achieved sub-10 millisecond latency, combined with sparse spike activity (8.1%), enables real-time, low-power edge deployment. Unlike conventional CNN-based approaches, the hybrid SIFT-SNN pipeline explicitly preserves spatial feature grounding, enhances interpretability, supports transparent decision-making, and operates efficiently on embedded hardware. Although synthetic augmentation improved robustness, generalisation to unseen field conditions remains to be validated. The SIFT-SNN framework is validated through a working prototype deployed on a consumer-grade system and framed as a generalisable case study in structural safety monitoring for movable concrete barriers, which, as a traffic flow-control infrastructure, is deployed in over 20 cities worldwide.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have highlighted their potential for medical and surgical applications. However, existing surgical datasets predominantly adopt a Visual Question Answering (VQA) format with heterogeneous taxonomies and lack support for pixel-level segmentation, limiting consistent evaluation and applicability. We present SurgMLLMBench, a unified multimodal benchmark explicitly designed for developing and evaluating interactive multimodal LLMs for surgical scene understanding, including the newly collected Micro-surgical Artificial Vascular anastomosIS (MAVIS) dataset. It integrates pixel-level instrument segmentation masks and structured VQA annotations across laparoscopic, robot-assisted, and micro-surgical domains under a unified taxonomy, enabling comprehensive evaluation beyond traditional VQA tasks and richer visual-conversational interactions. Extensive baseline experiments show that a single model trained on SurgMLLMBench achieves consistent performance across domains and generalizes effectively to unseen datasets. SurgMLLMBench will be publicly released as a robust resource to advance multimodal surgical AI research, supporting reproducible evaluation and development of interactive surgical reasoning models.

Result: 在广泛使用的动作识别基准测试中，ART框架表现优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: ART框架通过结合查询-响应机制和多级轨迹对比约束，显著提升了细粒度动作识别的性能，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Fine-grained action recognition (FGAR) aims to identify subtle and distinctive differences among fine-grained action categories. However, current recognition methods often capture coarse-grained motion patterns but struggle to identify subtle details in local regions evolving over time. In this work, we introduce the Action-Region Tracking (ART) framework, a novel solution leveraging a query-response mechanism to discover and track the dynamics of distinctive local details, enabling effective distinction of similar actions. Specifically, we propose a region-specific semantic activation module that employs discriminative and text-constrained semantics as queries to capture the most action-related region responses in each video frame, facilitating interaction among spatial and temporal dimensions with corresponding video features. The captured region responses are organized into action tracklets, which characterize region-based action dynamics by linking related responses across video frames in a coherent sequence. The text-constrained queries encode nuanced semantic representations derived from textual descriptions of action labels extracted by language branches within Visual Language Models (VLMs). To optimize the action tracklets, we design a multi-level tracklet contrastive constraint among region responses at spatial and temporal levels, enabling effective discrimination within each frame and correlation between adjacent frames. Additionally, a task-specific fine-tuning mechanism refines textual semantics such that semantic representations encoded by VLMs are preserved while optimized for task preferences. Comprehensive experiments on widely used action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the superiority to previous state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 现有方法在抽象视觉推理上缺乏灵活性，受限于外部工具，无法实现类人的视觉思考。

Method: 提出了Monet训练框架，通过三个阶段蒸馏监督微调（SFT）管道解决潜在视觉推理中的计算成本和监督不足问题，并开发了VLPO强化学习方法。

Conclusion: Monet-7B模型在真实世界感知和推理任务上表现优异，并在抽象视觉推理任务上展现出强大的分布外泛化能力。

Abstract: "Thinking with images" has emerged as an effective paradigm for advancing visual reasoning, extending beyond text-only chains of thought by injecting visual evidence into intermediate reasoning steps. However, existing methods fall short of human-like abstract visual thinking, as their flexibility is fundamentally limited by external tools. In this work, we introduce Monet, a training framework that enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to reason directly within the latent visual space by generating continuous embeddings that function as intermediate visual thoughts. We identify two core challenges in training MLLMs for latent visual reasoning: high computational cost in latent-vision alignment and insufficient supervision over latent embeddings, and address them with a three-stage distillation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline. We further reveal a limitation of applying GRPO to latent reasoning: it primarily enhances text-based reasoning rather than latent reasoning. To overcome this, we propose VLPO (Visual-latent Policy Optimization), a reinforcement learning method that explicitly incorporates latent embeddings into policy gradient updates. To support SFT, we construct Monet-SFT-125K, a high-quality text-image interleaved CoT dataset containing 125K real-world, chart, OCR, and geometry CoTs. Our model, Monet-7B, shows consistent gains across real-world perception and reasoning benchmarks and exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization on challenging abstract visual reasoning tasks. We also empirically analyze the role of each training component and discuss our early unsuccessful attempts, providing insights for future developments in visual latent reasoning. Our model, data, and code are available at https://github.com/NOVAglow646/Monet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较三种生成建模范式（DDPM、CFM 和 MeanFlow）的性能差异，特别是 MeanFlow 的直接一步生成能力，并探索 CFM 在图像修复中的应用。

Method: 使用统一的 TinyUNet 架构（<1.5M 参数）在 CIFAR-10 上实现了 DDPM、CFM 和 MeanFlow 三种生成建模范式，并扩展了 CFM 到图像修复任务，采用四种掩码类型进行掩码引导采样。

Result: CFM 在 50 步采样中达到 FID 24.15，显著优于 DDPM（FID 402.98）；MeanFlow 在单步采样中达到 FID 29.15；图像修复模型的 PSNR 从 4.95 提升到 8.57 dB，SSIM 从 0.289 提升到 0.418。

Conclusion: MeanFlow 在单步采样中实现了 FID 29.15，推理时间减少了 50 倍，而 CFM 在图像修复任务中表现出显著的性能提升，证明了修复感知训练的有效性。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparative study of three generative modeling paradigms: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), and MeanFlow. While DDPM and CFM require iterative sampling, MeanFlow enables direct one-step generation by modeling the average velocity over time intervals. We implement all three methods using a unified TinyUNet architecture (<1.5M parameters) on CIFAR-10, demonstrating that CFM achieves an FID of 24.15 with 50 steps, significantly outperforming DDPM (FID 402.98). MeanFlow achieves FID 29.15 with single-step sampling -- a 50X reduction in inference time. We further extend CFM to image inpainting, implementing mask-guided sampling with four mask types (center, random bbox, irregular, half). Our fine-tuned inpainting model achieves substantial improvements: PSNR increases from 4.95 to 8.57 dB on center masks (+73%), and SSIM improves from 0.289 to 0.418 (+45%), demonstrating the effectiveness of inpainting-aware training.

Conclusion: 视觉干扰物（distractors）在视觉语言模型（VLMs）中的影响与文本干扰物不同，表现为准确率下降但推理长度不增加。通过追踪属性计数和简单提示策略，可以缓解干扰物带来的偏差。

Abstract: How does irrelevant information (i.e., distractors) affect test-time scaling in vision-language models (VLMs)? Prior studies on language models have reported an inverse scaling effect, where textual distractors lead to longer but less effective reasoning. To investigate whether similar phenomena occur in multimodal settings, we introduce Idis (Images with distractors), a visual question-answering dataset that systematically varies distractors along semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions. Our analyses reveal that visual distractors differ fundamentally from textual ones: although inverse scaling persists, adding visual distractors reduces accuracy without increasing reasoning length. We further show that tracking attribute counts within reasoning traces provides key insights into how distractors, reasoning length, and accuracy interact. Finally, we demonstrate that these trends extend to established visual bias benchmarks such as Waterbirds, and we propose a simple prompting strategy to mitigate bias-driven predictions in reasoning models.

Conclusion: T3-Tracer框架通过联合分析音频的帧、片段和整体级别，显著提升了部分音频伪造检测的性能，实验证明其在三个具有挑战性的数据集上达到了最先进的水平。

Abstract: Recently, partial audio forgery has emerged as a new form of audio manipulation. Attackers selectively modify partial but semantically critical frames while preserving the overall perceptual authenticity, making such forgeries particularly difficult to detect. Existing methods focus on independently detecting whether a single frame is forged, lacking the hierarchical structure to capture both transient and sustained anomalies across different temporal levels. To address these limitations, We identify three key levels relevant to partial audio forgery detection and present T3-Tracer, the first framework that jointly analyzes audio at the frame, segment, and audio levels to comprehensively detect forgery traces. T3-Tracer consists of two complementary core modules: the Frame-Audio Feature Aggregation Module (FA-FAM) and the Segment-level Multi-Scale Discrepancy-Aware Module (SMDAM). FA-FAM is designed to detect the authenticity of each audio frame. It combines both frame-level and audio-level temporal information to detect intra-frame forgery cues and global semantic inconsistencies. To further refine and correct frame detection, we introduce SMDAM to detect forgery boundaries at the segment level. It adopts a dual-branch architecture that jointly models frame features and inter-frame differences across multi-scale temporal windows, effectively identifying abrupt anomalies that appeared on the forged boundaries. Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: FIELDS通过结合2D图像一致性线索和直接的3D表情参数监督，以及辅助的情感识别分支，成功实现了高保真的3D面部重建，保留了细微的情感线索，显著提升了野外面部表情识别的性能。

Abstract: Facial expressions convey the bulk of emotional information in human communication, yet existing 3D face reconstruction methods often miss subtle affective details due to reliance on 2D supervision and lack of 3D ground truth. We propose FIELDS (Face reconstruction with accurate Inference of Expression using Learning with Direct Supervision) to address these limitations by extending self-supervised 2D image consistency cues with direct 3D expression parameter supervision and an auxiliary emotion recognition branch. Our encoder is guided by authentic expression parameters from spontaneous 4D facial scans, while an intensity-aware emotion loss encourages the 3D expression parameters to capture genuine emotion content without exaggeration. This dual-supervision strategy bridges the 2D/3D domain gap and mitigates expression-intensity bias, yielding high-fidelity 3D reconstructions that preserve subtle emotional cues. From a single image, FIELDS produces emotion-rich face models with highly realistic expressions, significantly improving in-the-wild facial expression recognition performance without sacrificing naturalness.

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法通过结合SAM基础模型和知识图谱，显著提升了遥感变化字幕生成的性能，实现了在多基准数据集上的最先进表现。

Abstract: Remote sensing change captioning is an emerging and popular research task that aims to describe, in natural language, the content of interest that has changed between two remote sensing images captured at different times. Existing methods typically employ CNNs/Transformers to extract visual representations from the given images or incorporate auxiliary tasks to enhance the final results, with weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of the SAM (Segment Anything Model) foundation model to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge into the captioning framework. Specifically, we employ a CNN/Transformer model to extract global-level vision features, leverage the SAM foundation model to delineate semantic- and motion-level change regions, and utilize a specially constructed knowledge graph to provide information about objects of interest. These heterogeneous sources of information are then fused via cross-attention, and a Transformer decoder is used to generate the final natural language description of the observed changes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple widely used benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: 本文通过将LPS扩展到复数神经网络，并在Gumbel Softmax前引入从ℂ到ℝ的投影层，为计算机视觉任务提供了理论保证的平移等变性和不变性。实验验证了该扩展在分类、重建和语义分割任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks have shown remarkable performance in recent years on various computer vision problems. However, the traditional convolutional neural network architecture lacks a critical property: shift equivariance and invariance, broken by downsampling and upsampling operations. Although data augmentation techniques can help the model learn the latter property empirically, a consistent and systematic way to achieve this goal is by designing downsampling and upsampling layers that theoretically guarantee these properties by construction. Adaptive Polyphase Sampling (APS) introduced the cornerstone for shift invariance, later extended to shift equivariance with Learnable Polyphase up/downsampling (LPS) applied to real-valued neural networks. In this paper, we extend the work on LPS to complex-valued neural networks both from a theoretical perspective and with a novel building block of a projection layer from $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ before the Gumbel Softmax. We finally evaluate this extension on several computer vision problems, specifically for either the invariance property in classification tasks or the equivariance property in both reconstruction and semantic segmentation problems, using polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar images.

Abstract: We present a novel unsupervised framework to unlock vast unlabeled human demonstration data from continuous industrial video streams for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model pre-training. Our method first trains a lightweight motion tokenizer to encode motion dynamics, then employs an unsupervised action segmenter leveraging a novel "Latent Action Energy" metric to discover and segment semantically coherent action primitives. The pipeline outputs both segmented video clips and their corresponding latent action sequences, providing structured data directly suitable for VLA pre-training. Evaluations on public benchmarks and a proprietary electric motor assembly dataset demonstrate effective segmentation of key tasks performed by humans at workstations. Further clustering and quantitative assessment via a Vision-Language Model confirm the semantic coherence of the discovered action primitives. To our knowledge, this is the first fully automated end-to-end system for extracting and organizing VLA pre-training data from unstructured industrial videos, offering a scalable solution for embodied AI integration in manufacturing.

Abstract: The threat of Audio-Video (AV) forgery is rapidly evolving beyond human-centric deepfakes to include more diverse manipulations across complex natural scenes. However, existing benchmarks are still confined to DeepFake-based forgeries and single-granularity annotations, thus failing to capture the diversity and complexity of real-world forgery scenarios. To address this, we introduce AVFakeBench, the first comprehensive audio-video forgery detection benchmark that spans rich forgery semantics across both human subject and general subject. AVFakeBench comprises 12K carefully curated audio-video questions, covering seven forgery types and four levels of annotations. To ensure high-quality and diverse forgeries, we propose a multi-stage hybrid forgery framework that integrates proprietary models for task planning with expert generative models for precise manipulation. The benchmark establishes a multi-task evaluation framework covering binary judgment, forgery types classification, forgery detail selection, and explanatory reasoning. We evaluate 11 Audio-Video Large Language Models (AV-LMMs) and 2 prevalent detection methods on AVFakeBench, demonstrating the potential of AV-LMMs as emerging forgery detectors while revealing their notable weaknesses in fine-grained perception and reasoning.

Abstract: Event cameras produce asynchronous event streams that are spatially sparse yet temporally dense. Mainstream event representation learning algorithms typically use event frames, voxels, or tensors as input. Although these approaches have achieved notable progress, they struggle to address the undersampling problem caused by spatial sparsity. In this paper, we propose a novel hypergraph-guided spatio-temporal event stream completion mechanism, which connects event tokens across different times and spatial locations via hypergraphs and leverages contextual information message passing to complete these sparse events. The proposed method can flexibly incorporate RGB tokens as nodes in the hypergraph within this completion framework, enabling multi-modal hypergraph-based information completion. Subsequently, we aggregate hypergraph node information across different time steps through self-attention, enabling effective learning and fusion of multi-modal features. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-label event classification tasks fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

Abstract: Generative world models for autonomous driving (AD) have become a trending topic. Unlike the widely studied image modality, in this work we explore generative world models for LiDAR data. Existing generation methods for LiDAR data only support single frame generation, while existing prediction approaches require multiple frames of historical input and can only deterministically predict multiple frames at once, lacking interactivity. Both paradigms fail to support long-horizon interactive generation. To this end, we introduce LaGen, which to the best of our knowledge is the first framework capable of frame-by-frame autoregressive generation of long-horizon LiDAR scenes. LaGen is able to take a single-frame LiDAR input as a starting point and effectively utilize bounding box information as conditions to generate high-fidelity 4D scene point clouds. In addition, we introduce a scene decoupling estimation module to enhance the model's interactive generation capability for object-level content, as well as a noise modulation module to mitigate error accumulation during long-horizon generation. We construct a protocol based on nuScenes for evaluating long-horizon LiDAR scene generation. Experimental results comprehensively demonstrate LaGen outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR generation and prediction models, especially on the later frames.

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated exceptional performance across various computer vision tasks, yet their quadratic computational complexity concerning token length remains a significant challenge. To address this, token reduction methods have been widely explored. However, existing approaches often overlook the frequency characteristics of self-attention, such as rank collapsing and over-smoothing phenomenon. In this paper, we propose a frequency-aware token reduction strategy that improves computational efficiency while preserving performance by mitigating rank collapsing. Our method partitions tokens into high-frequency tokens and low-frequency tokens. high-frequency tokens are selectively preserved, while low-frequency tokens are aggregated into a compact direct current token to retain essential low-frequency components. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves accuracy while reducing computational overhead and mitigating rank collapsing and over smoothing. Furthermore, we analyze the previous methods, shedding light on their implicit frequency characteristics and limitations.

*Juncheng Chen,Chao Xu,Yanjun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MatchGS通过几何优化和2D-3D对齐，利用3DGS生成高精度训练数据，显著提升零样本图像匹配性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于学习的图像匹配严重依赖大规模、多样且几何准确的训练数据。3DGS虽能实现逼真的新视角合成，但其几何不准确性和深度渲染偏差阻碍了稳健的对应标记。

Method: MatchGS框架包括：(1) 几何精确的数据生成流程，优化3DGS几何以产生高精度对应标签；(2) 2D-3D表示对齐策略，将3DGS的显式3D知识注入2D匹配器，指导其学习视角不变的3D表示。

Result: 生成的对应标签将极线误差降低至现有数据集的1/40，支持极端视角变化下的监督，并通过高斯属性提供自监督信号。零样本性能在公开基准上提升高达17.7%。

Conclusion: 3DGS经过适当的几何优化后，可以作为可扩展、高保真且结构丰富的数据源，为新一代稳健的零样本图像匹配器铺平道路。

Abstract: Learning-based image matching critically depends on large-scale, diverse, and geometrically accurate training data. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables photorealistic novel-view synthesis and thus is attractive for data generation. However, its geometric inaccuracies and biased depth rendering currently prevent robust correspondence labeling. To address this, we introduce MatchGS, the first framework designed to systematically correct and leverage 3DGS for robust, zero-shot image matching. Our approach is twofold: (1) a geometrically-faithful data generation pipeline that refines 3DGS geometry to produce highly precise correspondence labels, enabling the synthesis of a vast and diverse range of viewpoints without compromising rendering fidelity; and (2) a 2D-3D representation alignment strategy that infuses 3DGS' explicit 3D knowledge into the 2D matcher, guiding 2D semi-dense matchers to learn viewpoint-invariant 3D representations. Our generated ground-truth correspondences reduce the epipolar error by up to 40 times compared to existing datasets, enable supervision under extreme viewpoint changes, and provide self-supervisory signals through Gaussian attributes. Consequently, state-of-the-art matchers trained solely on our data achieve significant zero-shot performance gains on public benchmarks, with improvements of up to 17.7%. Our work demonstrates that with proper geometric refinement, 3DGS can serve as a scalable, high-fidelity, and structurally-rich data source, paving the way for a new generation of robust zero-shot image matchers.

TL;DR: M&B 是一种新型的类增量学习训练方法，通过权重合并和有界更新技术减少灾难性遗忘，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决类增量学习（CIL）中的灾难性遗忘问题，提出了一种直接在参数空间中操作模型权重的训练方法。

Method: M&B 算法包含两种权重合并：任务间权重合并（平均所有先前阶段的模型权重）和任务内权重合并（结合当前阶段的模型参数）。此外，采用有界更新技术优化目标模型，确保最小化累积更新并保留先前任务的知识。

Result: 在标准CIL基准测试中，M&B 方法表现优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Merge-and-Bound (M&B) 方法通过直接在参数空间中进行权重操作，有效减少了灾难性遗忘，并在标准CIL基准测试中表现出优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: We present a novel training approach, named Merge-and-Bound (M&B) for Class Incremental Learning (CIL), which directly manipulates model weights in the parameter space for optimization. Our algorithm involves two types of weight merging: inter-task weight merging and intra-task weight merging. Inter-task weight merging unifies previous models by averaging the weights of models from all previous stages. On the other hand, intra-task weight merging facilitates the learning of current task by combining the model parameters within current stage. For reliable weight merging, we also propose a bounded update technique that aims to optimize the target model with minimal cumulative updates and preserve knowledge from previous tasks; this strategy reveals that it is possible to effectively obtain new models near old ones, reducing catastrophic forgetting. M&B is seamlessly integrated into existing CIL methods without modifying architecture components or revising learning objectives. We extensively evaluate our algorithm on standard CIL benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: RSCoVLM作为统一的遥感多任务学习基线，表现出卓越的性能，甚至媲美专业模型，并开源所有资源以促进通用遥感模型的进一步发展。

Abstract: With Transformers achieving outstanding performance on individual remote sensing (RS) tasks, we are now approaching the realization of a unified model that excels across multiple tasks through multi-task learning (MTL). Compared to single-task approaches, MTL methods offer improved generalization, enhanced scalability, and greater practical applicability. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have achieved promising results in RS image understanding, grounding, and ultra-high-resolution (UHR) image reasoning, respectively. Moreover, the unified text-based interface demonstrates significant potential for MTL. Hence, in this work, we present RSCoVLM, a simple yet flexible VLM baseline for RS MTL. Firstly, we create the data curation engine, including data acquisition, offline processing and integrating, as well as online loading and weighting. This data engine effectively addresses complex RS data enviroment and generates flexible vision-language conversations. Furthermore, we propose a unified dynamic-resolution strategy to address the diverse image scales inherent in RS imagery. For UHR images, we introduce the Zoom-in Chain mechanism together with its corresponding dataset, LRS-VQA-Zoom. The strategies are flexible and effectively mitigate the computational burdens. Additionally, we significantly enhance the model's object detection capability and propose a novel evaluation protocol that ensures fair comparison between VLMs and conventional detection models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSCoVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, outperforming existing RS VLMs and even rivaling specialized expert models. All the training and evaluating tools, model weights, and datasets have been fully open-sourced to support reproducibility. We expect that this baseline will promote further progress toward general-purpose RS models.

Method: 提出了一种名为PathMamba的混合架构，结合了Mamba的顺序建模和Transformer的全局推理，Mamba块用于追踪道路网络的连续性，Transformer块用于全局特征优化。

Result: 在DeepGlobe Road Extraction和Massachusetts Roads数据集上，PathMamba实现了新的最先进性能，显著提升了拓扑连续性（以APLS指标衡量），同时保持了计算竞争力。

Conclusion: PathMamba通过结合Mamba的顺序建模能力和Transformer的全局推理能力，在道路分割任务中实现了高准确性和拓扑连续性，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Achieving both high accuracy and topological continuity in road segmentation from satellite imagery is a critical goal for applications ranging from urban planning to disaster response. State-of-the-art methods often rely on Vision Transformers, which excel at capturing global context, yet their quadratic complexity is a significant barrier to efficient deployment, particularly for on-board processing in resource-constrained platforms. In contrast, emerging State Space Models like Mamba offer linear-time efficiency and are inherently suited to modeling long, continuous structures. We posit that these architectures have complementary strengths. To this end, we introduce PathMamba, a novel hybrid architecture that integrates Mamba's sequential modeling with the Transformer's global reasoning. Our design strategically uses Mamba blocks to trace the continuous nature of road networks, preserving topological structure, while integrating Transformer blocks to refine features with global context. This approach yields topologically superior segmentation maps without the prohibitive scaling costs of pure attention-based models. Our experiments on the DeepGlobe Road Extraction and Massachusetts Roads datasets demonstrate that PathMamba sets a new state-of-the-art. Notably, it significantly improves topological continuity, as measured by the APLS metric, setting a new benchmark while remaining computationally competitive.

Method: 提出了一种新颖且高效的师生框架MRPD，通过将学生点云模型的特征与来自三种不同教师（视觉模型处理深度投影、高性能3D模型和文本编码器）的鲁棒嵌入对齐，学习轻量级提示。蒸馏过程由置信门控机制动态平衡所有输入模态的贡献。

Conclusion: MRPD框架通过高效利用多模态知识，为构建鲁棒的3D视觉系统提供了新的实用范式，显著提升了对抗攻击下的模型鲁棒性，同时在干净数据上也表现更优。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to learning-based 3D point cloud models, critically undermining their reliability in security-sensitive applications. Existing defense methods often suffer from (1) high computational overhead and (2) poor generalization ability across diverse attack types. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel yet efficient teacher-student framework, namely Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation (MRPD) for distilling robust 3D point cloud model. It learns lightweight prompts by aligning student point cloud model's features with robust embeddings from three distinct teachers: a vision model processing depth projections, a high-performance 3D model, and a text encoder. To ensure a reliable knowledge transfer, this distillation is guided by a confidence-gated mechanism which dynamically balances the contribution of all input modalities. Notably, since the distillation is all during the training stage, there is no additional computational cost at inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRPD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against a wide range of white-box and black-box attacks, while even achieving better performance on clean data. Our work presents a new, practical paradigm for building robust 3D vision systems by efficiently harnessing multimodal knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D纹理生成系统因注意力模糊导致跨视图不一致，CaliTex旨在通过几何校准的注意力机制解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了两个模块：Part-Aligned Attention确保语义匹配部分的空间对齐，Condition-Routed Attention通过几何条件路径路由外观信息以保持空间保真度，并结合两阶段扩散变换器。

Result: CaliTex生成了无缝且视图一致的纹理，在开源和商业基线中表现优异。

Conclusion: CaliTex通过几何校准的注意力机制有效解决了3D纹理生成中的跨视图不一致问题，显著提升了纹理的一致性和质量。

Abstract: Despite major advances brought by diffusion-based models, current 3D texture generation systems remain hindered by cross-view inconsistency -- textures that appear convincing from one viewpoint often fail to align across others. We find that this issue arises from attention ambiguity, where unstructured full attention is applied indiscriminately across tokens and modalities, causing geometric confusion and unstable appearance-structure coupling. To address this, we introduce CaliTex, a framework of geometry-calibrated attention that explicitly aligns attention with 3D structure. It introduces two modules: Part-Aligned Attention that enforces spatial alignment across semantically matched parts, and Condition-Routed Attention which routes appearance information through geometry-conditioned pathways to maintain spatial fidelity. Coupled with a two-stage diffusion transformer, CaliTex makes geometric coherence an inherent behavior of the network rather than a byproduct of optimization. Empirically, CaliTex produces seamless and view-consistent textures and outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines.

TL;DR: HTTM是一种无需训练的3D令牌合并方法，通过多头部粒度合并显著加速VGGT，性能损失极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VGGT的全局注意力机制在处理长序列输入时存在显著的延迟瓶颈，现有合并技术会损害模型的表现能力。

Method: 提出了一种基于多头部粒度的令牌合并方法（HTTM），通过保留特征令牌的唯一性，并利用空间局部性和时间对应性实现高合并比。

Result: HTTM在GPU推理中实现了高达7倍的加速，且性能下降可忽略不计。

Conclusion: HTTM是一种无需训练的高效3D令牌合并方法，能够在保持模型性能的同时显著加速VGGT，最高可达7倍加速。

Abstract: The Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) marks a significant leap forward in 3D scene reconstruction, as it is the first model that directly infers all key 3D attributes (camera poses, depths, and dense geometry) jointly in one pass. However, this joint inference mechanism requires global attention layers that perform all-to-all attention computation on tokens from all views. For reconstruction of large scenes with long-sequence inputs, this causes a significant latency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose head-wise temporal merging (HTTM), a training-free 3D token merging method for accelerating VGGT. Existing merging techniques merge tokens uniformly across different attention heads, resulting in identical tokens in the layers' output, which hinders the model's representational ability. HTTM tackles this problem by merging tokens in multi-head granularity, which preserves the uniqueness of feature tokens after head concatenation. Additionally, this enables HTTM to leverage the spatial locality and temporal correspondence observed at the head level to achieve higher merging ratios with lower merging costs compared to existing methods. Thus, HTTM achieves up to 7x acceleration with negligible performance drops in a GPU-based inference.

Result: Qwen3-VL在多个多模态基准测试中表现优异，支持高达256K tokens的交错上下文，并在密集和MoE架构中均实现了卓越性能。

Conclusion: Qwen3-VL被设计为一个多功能的基础引擎，适用于图像推理、智能决策和多模态代码智能的现实工作流程。

Abstract: We introduce Qwen3-VL, the most capable vision-language model in the Qwen series to date, achieving superior performance across a broad range of multimodal benchmarks. It natively supports interleaved contexts of up to 256K tokens, seamlessly integrating text, images, and video. The model family includes both dense (2B/4B/8B/32B) and mixture-of-experts (30B-A3B/235B-A22B) variants to accommodate diverse latency-quality trade-offs. Qwen3-VL delivers three core pillars: (i) markedly stronger pure-text understanding, surpassing comparable text-only backbones in several cases; (ii) robust long-context comprehension with a native 256K-token window for both text and interleaved multimodal inputs, enabling faithful retention, retrieval, and cross-referencing across long documents and videos; and (iii) advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, demonstrating leading performance on comprehensive evaluations such as MMMU and visual-math benchmarks (e.g., MathVista and MathVision). Architecturally, we introduce three key upgrades: (i) an enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for stronger spatial-temporal modeling across images and video; (ii) DeepStack integration, which effectively leverages multi-level ViT features to tighten vision-language alignment; and (iii) text-based time alignment for video, evolving from T-RoPE to explicit textual timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. Under comparable token budgets and latency constraints, Qwen3-VL achieves superior performance in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We envision Qwen3-VL serving as a foundational engine for image-grounded reasoning, agentic decision-making, and multimodal code intelligence in real-world workflows.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI models in everyday devices has highlighted a critical challenge: prediction errors that degrade user experience. While existing solutions focus on error detection, they rarely provide efficient correction mechanisms, especially for resource-constrained devices. We present a novel system enabling users to correct AI misclassifications through few-shot learning, requiring minimal computational resources and storage. Our approach combines server-side foundation model training with on-device prototype-based classification, enabling efficient error correction through prototype updates rather than model retraining. The system consists of two key components: (1) a server-side pipeline that leverages knowledge distillation to transfer robust feature representations from foundation models to device-compatible architectures, and (2) a device-side mechanism that enables ultra-efficient error correction through prototype adaptation. We demonstrate our system's effectiveness on both image classification and object detection tasks, achieving over 50% error correction in one-shot scenarios on Food-101 and Flowers-102 datasets while maintaining minimal forgetting (less than 0.02%) and negligible computational overhead. Our implementation, validated through an Android demonstration app, proves the system's practicality in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法需要昂贵的端到端训练且常生成明显扰动补丁，ADVLA旨在高效破坏下游动作预测并在低幅度约束下生成几乎不可察觉的扰动。

Method: 提出ADVLA框架，直接在视觉编码器投影到文本特征空间的特征上应用对抗扰动，结合注意力引导使扰动集中且稀疏，并引入三种策略增强敏感性、强制稀疏性和集中扰动。

Result: 在$L_{\infty}=4/255$约束下，ADVLA结合Top-K掩码修改不到10%的补丁，攻击成功率近100%，扰动集中在关键区域且几乎不可察觉，单次迭代仅需约0.06秒。

Conclusion: ADVLA有效削弱了VLA模型在低幅度和局部稀疏条件下的下游动作预测，避免了传统补丁攻击的高训练成本和明显扰动，展示了攻击VLA特征空间的独特有效性和实用价值。

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied intelligence have developed rapidly. However, existing adversarial attack methods require costly end-to-end training and often generate noticeable perturbation patches. To address these limitations, we propose ADVLA, a framework that directly applies adversarial perturbations on features projected from the visual encoder into the textual feature space. ADVLA efficiently disrupts downstream action predictions under low-amplitude constraints, and attention guidance allows the perturbations to be both focused and sparse. We introduce three strategies that enhance sensitivity, enforce sparsity, and concentrate perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that under an $L_{\infty}=4/255$ constraint, ADVLA combined with Top-K masking modifies less than 10% of the patches while achieving an attack success rate of nearly 100%. The perturbations are concentrated on critical regions, remain almost imperceptible in the overall image, and a single-step iteration takes only about 0.06 seconds, significantly outperforming conventional patch-based attacks. In summary, ADVLA effectively weakens downstream action predictions of VLA models under low-amplitude and locally sparse conditions, avoiding the high training costs and conspicuous perturbations of traditional patch attacks, and demonstrates unique effectiveness and practical value for attacking VLA feature spaces.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still lack robustness in spatial intelligence, demonstrating poor performance on spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. We attribute this gap to the absence of a visual geometry learning process capable of reconstructing 3D space from 2D images. We present G$^2$VLM, a geometry grounded vision-language model that bridges two fundamental aspects of spatial intelligence: spatial 3D reconstruction and spatial understanding. G$^2$VLM natively leverages learned 3D visual geometry features to directly predict 3D attributes and enhance spatial reasoning tasks via in-context learning and interleaved reasoning. Our unified design is highly scalable for spatial understanding: it trains on abundant multi-view image and video data, while simultaneously leveraging the benefits of 3D visual priors that are typically only derived from hard-to-collect annotations. Experimental results demonstrate G$^2$VLM is proficient in both tasks, achieving comparable results to state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and achieving better or competitive results across spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. By unifying a semantically strong VLM with low-level 3D vision tasks, we hope G$^2$VLM can serve as a strong baseline for the community and unlock more future applications, such as 3D scene editing.

Conclusion: 通过多尺度特征融合的近似策略，该方法在合成和真实数据集上实现了最先进的性能，同时减少了网络参数和运行时间。

Abstract: Estimating the normal of a point requires constructing a local patch to provide center-surrounding context, but determining the appropriate neighborhood size is difficult when dealing with different data or geometries. Existing methods commonly employ various parameter-heavy strategies to extract a full feature description from the input patch. However, they still have difficulties in accurately and efficiently predicting normals for various point clouds. In this work, we present a new idea of feature extraction for robust normal estimation of point clouds. We use the fusion of multi-scale features from different neighborhood sizes to address the issue of selecting reasonable patch sizes for various data or geometries. We seek to model a patch feature fitting (PFF) based on multi-scale features to approximate the optimal geometric description for normal estimation and implement the approximation process via multi-scale feature aggregation and cross-scale feature compensation. The feature aggregation module progressively aggregates the patch features of different scales to the center of the patch and shrinks the patch size by removing points far from the center. It not only enables the network to precisely capture the structure characteristic in a wide range, but also describes highly detailed geometries. The feature compensation module ensures the reusability of features from earlier layers of large scales and reveals associated information in different patch sizes. Our approximation strategy based on aggregating the features of multiple scales enables the model to achieve scale adaptation of varying local patches and deliver the optimal feature description. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets with fewer network parameters and running time.

Abstract: Endoscopic (endo) video exhibits strong view-dependent effects such as specularities, wet reflections, and occlusions. Pure photometric supervision misaligns with geometry and triggers early geometric drift, where erroneous shapes are reinforced during densification and become hard to correct. We ask how to anchor geometry early for 4D Gaussian splatting (4DGS) while maintaining temporal consistency and efficiency in dynamic endoscopic scenes. Thus, we present Endo-G$^{2}$T, a geometry-guided and temporally aware training scheme for time-embedded 4DGS. First, geo-guided prior distillation converts confidence-gated monocular depth into supervision with scale-invariant depth and depth-gradient losses, using a warm-up-to-cap schedule to inject priors softly and avoid early overfitting. Second, a time-embedded Gaussian field represents dynamics in XYZT with a rotor-like rotation parameterization, yielding temporally coherent geometry with lightweight regularization that favors smooth motion and crisp opacity boundaries. Third, keyframe-constrained streaming improves efficiency and long-horizon stability through keyframe-focused optimization under a max-points budget, while non-keyframes advance with lightweight updates. Across EndoNeRF and StereoMIS-P1 datasets, Endo-G$^{2}$T achieves state-of-the-art results among monocular reconstruction baselines.

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在时空视频定位（STVG）任务中因训练目标不对齐和细粒度区域-词对齐弱而表现不佳的问题。

Method: 提出了边界框思维链机制和多维度强化奖励函数，包括格式、一致性、时间、空间和思考奖励，通过强化微调提供几何感知监督。

Conclusion: STVG-o1通过引入边界框思维链和多维度强化奖励函数，显著提升了MLLMs在时空视频定位任务中的性能，成为该领域的新标杆。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) requires localizing a target object in untrimmed videos both temporally and spatially from natural language descriptions. Despite their strong language understanding, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) underperform on STVG due to misaligned training objectives and weak fine-grained region-word alignment in standard visual encoders. To address this, we propose STVG-o1, the first framework that enables off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve state-of-the-art STVG performance without any architectural modifications. Our method introduces a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism that explicitly reasons about spatio-temporal locations in an intermediate step before producing the final prediction. We further design a multi-dimensional reinforcement reward function consisting of format, consistency, temporal, spatial, and think rewards, which provides geometry-aware supervision through reinforcement fine-tuning. Evaluated on HCSTVG-v1/v2 and VidSTG, STVG-o1 sets new state-of-the-art results on HCSTVG, outperforming the best task-specific method by 7.3\% m\_tIoU on HCSTVG-v1, matching specialized models on VidSTG, and surpassing all existing MLLM-based approaches by large margins. It also demonstrates strong open-vocabulary generalization across datasets, establishing MLLMs as viable and powerful backbones for precise spatio-temporal grounding. Our code and models will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR模型在图像生成中虽表现优异，但多样性不足的问题被忽视。本文旨在不重新训练或微调的情况下，提升测试时的多样性。

Method: 在测试时分两阶段处理：1) 向文本嵌入注入噪声以增强多样性；2) 提出scale-travel（一种受扩散模型中时间旅行策略启发的潜在精炼技术），通过多尺度自编码器提取粗尺度标记以在中间阶段恢复生成。

Conclusion: DiverseVAR通过结合文本嵌入噪声注入和scale-travel精炼技术，显著提升了多样性同时最小化图像质量损失，实现了多样性与质量的新帕累托前沿。

Abstract: We introduce DiverseVAR, a framework that enhances the diversity of text-conditioned visual autoregressive models (VAR) at test time without requiring retraining, fine-tuning, or substantial computational overhead. While VAR models have recently emerged as strong competitors to diffusion and flow models for image generation, they suffer from a critical limitation in diversity, often producing nearly identical images even for simple prompts. This issue has largely gone unnoticed amid the predominant focus on image quality. We address this limitation at test time in two stages. First, inspired by diversity enhancement techniques in diffusion models, we propose injecting noise into the text embedding. This introduces a trade-off between diversity and image quality: as diversity increases, the image quality sharply declines. To preserve quality, we propose scale-travel: a novel latent refinement technique inspired by time-travel strategies in diffusion models. Specifically, we use a multi-scale autoencoder to extract coarse-scale tokens that enable us to resume generation at intermediate stages. Extensive experiments show that combining text-embedding noise injection with our scale-travel refinement significantly enhances diversity while minimizing image-quality degradation, achieving a new Pareto frontier in the diversity-quality trade-off.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖几何特征，在几何信息不足或模糊时表现不佳，且缺乏物理约束防止重叠组装。

Method: E-M3RF采用旋转等变编码器处理3D点位置，结合Transformer编码颜色特征，形成多模态表示，并通过SE(3)流匹配预测重组变换。

Conclusion: E-M3RF通过结合几何和颜色特征的多模态表示，显著提升了3D重组任务的性能，尤其在几何信息不足或模糊的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: 3D reassembly is a fundamental geometric problem, and in recent years it has increasingly been challenged by deep learning methods rather than classical optimization. While learning approaches have shown promising results, most still rely primarily on geometric features to assemble a whole from its parts. As a result, methods struggle when geometry alone is insufficient or ambiguous, for example, for small, eroded, or symmetric fragments. Additionally, solutions do not impose physical constraints that explicitly prevent overlapping assemblies. To address these limitations, we introduce E-M3RF, an equivariant multimodal 3D reassembly framework that takes as input the point clouds, containing both point positions and colors of fractured fragments, and predicts the transformations required to reassemble them using SE(3) flow matching. Each fragment is represented by both geometric and color features: i) 3D point positions are encoded as rotationconsistent geometric features using a rotation-equivariant encoder, ii) the colors at each 3D point are encoded with a transformer. The two feature sets are then combined to form a multimodal representation. We experimented on four datasets: two synthetic datasets, Breaking Bad and Fantastic Breaks, and two real-world cultural heritage datasets, RePAIR and Presious, demonstrating that E-M3RF on the RePAIR dataset reduces rotation error by 23.1% and translation error by 13.2%, while Chamfer Distance decreases by 18.4% compared to competing methods.

Conclusion: MobileI2V首次实现了在移动设备上快速生成720p图像到视频，且质量与现有模型相当，每帧生成速度低于100毫秒。

Abstract: Recently, video generation has witnessed rapid advancements, drawing increasing attention to image-to-video (I2V) synthesis on mobile devices. However, the substantial computational complexity and slow generation speed of diffusion models pose significant challenges for real-time, high-resolution video generation on resource-constrained mobile devices. In this work, we propose MobileI2V, a 270M lightweight diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation on mobile devices. The core lies in: (1) We analyzed the performance of linear attention modules and softmax attention modules on mobile devices, and proposed a linear hybrid architecture denoiser that balances generation efficiency and quality. (2) We design a time-step distillation strategy that compresses the I2V sampling steps from more than 20 to only two without significant quality loss, resulting in a 10-fold increase in generation speed. (3) We apply mobile-specific attention optimizations that yield a 2-fold speed-up for attention operations during on-device inference. MobileI2V enables, for the first time, fast 720p image-to-video generation on mobile devices, with quality comparable to existing models. Under one-step conditions, the generation speed of each frame of 720p video is less than 100 ms. Our code is available at: https://github.com/hustvl/MobileI2V.

Motivation: 传统的自注意力蒸馏方法独立对齐教师和学生特征图，无法充分捕捉像素间关系，因此提出CanKD以更全面地学习特征表示。

Method: 提出基于交叉注意力的非局部知识蒸馏框架（CanKD），通过交叉注意力机制增强知识转移过程，使学生特征图的每个像素能动态考虑教师特征图的所有像素。

Result: 在目标检测和图像分割任务上的实验表明，CanKD优于现有的特征和混合蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: CanKD作为一种新的注意力引导蒸馏范式，在计算机视觉任务中展现出潜力，其代码已开源。

Abstract: We propose Cross-Attention-based Non-local Knowledge Distillation (CanKD), a novel feature-based knowledge distillation framework that leverages cross-attention mechanisms to enhance the knowledge transfer process. Unlike traditional self-attention-based distillation methods that align teacher and student feature maps independently, CanKD enables each pixel in the student feature map to dynamically consider all pixels in the teacher feature map. This non-local knowledge transfer more thoroughly captures pixel-wise relationships, improving feature representation learning. Our method introduces only an additional loss function to achieve superior performance compared with existing attention-guided distillation methods. Extensive experiments on object detection and image segmentation tasks demonstrate that CanKD outperforms state-of-the-art feature and hybrid distillation methods. These experimental results highlight CanKD's potential as a new paradigm for attention-guided distillation in computer vision tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/tori-hotaru/CanKD

Abstract: The effectiveness of deepfake detection methods often depends less on their core design and more on implementation details such as data preprocessing, augmentation strategies, and optimization techniques. These factors make it difficult to fairly compare detectors and to understand which factors truly contribute to their performance. To address this, we systematically investigate how different design choices influence the accuracy and generalization capabilities of deepfake detection models, focusing on aspects related to training, inference, and incremental updates. By isolating the impact of individual factors, we aim to establish robust, architecture-agnostic best practices for the design and development of future deepfake detection systems. Our experiments identify a set of design choices that consistently improve deepfake detection and enable state-of-the-art performance on the AI-GenBench benchmark.

Abstract: Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing is a crucial method for diagnosing autoimmune disorders, including lupus, Sjögren's syndrome, and scleroderma. Despite its importance, manual ANA detection is slow, labor-intensive, and demands years of training. ANA detection is complicated by over 100 coexisting antibody types, resulting in vast fluorescent pattern combinations. Although machine learning and deep learning have enabled automation, ANA detection in real-world clinical settings presents unique challenges as it involves multi-instance, multi-label (MIML) learning. In this paper, a novel framework for ANA detection is proposed that handles the complexities of MIML tasks using unaltered microscope images without manual preprocessing. Inspired by human labeling logic, it identifies consistent ANA sub-regions and assigns aggregated labels accordingly. These steps are implemented using three task-specific components: an instance sampler, a probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher, and self-paced weight learning rate coefficients. The instance sampler suppresses low-confidence instances by modeling pattern confidence, while the dispatcher adaptively assigns labels based on instance distinguishability. Self-paced learning adjusts training according to empirical label observations. Our framework overcomes limitations of traditional MIML methods and supports end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on one ANA dataset and three public medical MIML benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework. On the ANA dataset, our model achieves up to +7.0% F1-Macro and +12.6% mAP gains over the best prior method, setting new state-of-the-art results. It also ranks top-2 across all key metrics on public datasets, reducing Hamming loss and one-error by up to 18.2% and 26.9%, respectively.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新型的Ensemble-of-Specialists框架，为构建可扩展且高效的遥感基础模型（RSFMs）设定了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have shown great promise in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, and similar efforts are now emerging in the Earth Observation community. These models aim to generalize across tasks with limited supervision, reducing the need for training separate models for each task. However, current strategies, which largely focus on scaling model size and dataset volume, require prohibitive computational and data resources, limiting accessibility to only a few large institutions. Moreover, this paradigm of ever-larger models stands in stark contrast with the principles of sustainable and environmentally responsible AI, as it leads to immense carbon footprints and resource inefficiency. In this work, we present a novel and efficient alternative: an Ensemble-of-Specialists framework for building Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). Our method decomposes the training process into lightweight, task-specific ConvNeXtV2 specialists that can be frozen and reused. This modular approach offers strong advantages in efficiency, interpretability, and extensibility. Moreover, it naturally supports federated training, pruning, and continuous specialist integration, making it particularly well-suited for collaborative and resource-constrained settings. Our framework sets a new direction for building scalable and efficient RSFMs.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating disorder marked by a decline in cognitive function. Timely identification of the disease is essential for the development of personalized treatment strategies that aim to mitigate its progression. The application of generated images for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease poses challenges, particularly in accurately representing the disease's characteristics when input sequences are captured at irregular time intervals. This study presents an innovative methodology for sequential image generation, guided by quantitative metrics, to maintain the essential features indicative of disease progression. Furthermore, an age-scaling factor is integrated into the process to produce age-specific MRI images, facilitating the prediction of advanced stages of the disease. The results obtained from the ablation study suggest that the inclusion of quantitative metrics significantly improves the accuracy of MRI image synthesis. Furthermore, the application of age-scaled pixel loss contributed to the enhanced iterative generation of MRI images. In terms of long-term disease prognosis, the Structural Similarity Index reached a peak value of 0.882, indicating a substantial degree of similarity in the synthesized images.

Abstract: Reward feedback learning (ReFL) has proven effective for aligning image generation with human preferences. However, its extension to video generation faces significant challenges. Existing video reward models rely on vision-language models designed for pixel-space inputs, confining ReFL optimization to near-complete denoising steps after computationally expensive VAE decoding. This pixel-space approach incurs substantial memory overhead and increased training time, and its late-stage optimization lacks early-stage supervision, refining only visual quality rather than fundamental motion dynamics and structural coherence. In this work, we show that pre-trained video generation models are naturally suited for reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process noisy latent representations at arbitrary timesteps and inherently preserve temporal information through their sequential modeling capabilities. Accordingly, we propose Process Reward Feedback Learning~(PRFL), a framework that conducts preference optimization entirely in latent space, enabling efficient gradient backpropagation throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRFL significantly improves alignment with human preferences, while achieving substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time compared to RGB ReFL.

Abstract: Illumination inconsistency is a fundamental challenge in multi-view 3D reconstruction. Variations in sunlight direction, cloud cover, and shadows break the constant-lighting assumption underlying both classical multi-view stereo (MVS) and structure from motion (SfM) pipelines and recent neural rendering methods, leading to geometry drift, color inconsistency, and shadow imprinting. This issue is especially critical in UAV-based reconstruction, where long flight durations and outdoor environments make lighting changes unavoidable. However, existing datasets either restrict capture to short time windows, thus lacking meaningful illumination diversity, or span months and seasons, where geometric and semantic changes confound the isolated study of lighting robustness. We introduce UAVLight, a controlled-yet-real benchmark for illumination-robust 3D reconstruction. Each scene is captured along repeatable, geo-referenced flight paths at multiple fixed times of day, producing natural lighting variation under consistent geometry, calibration, and viewpoints. With standardized evaluation protocols across lighting conditions, UAVLight provides a reliable foundation for developing and benchmarking reconstruction methods that are consistent, faithful, and relightable in real outdoor environments.

Abstract: Automated landmark detection offers an efficient approach for medical professionals to understand patient anatomic structure and positioning using intra-operative imaging. While current detection methods for pelvic fluoroscopy demonstrate promising accuracy, most assume a fixed Antero-Posterior view of the pelvis. However, orientation often deviates from this standard view, either due to repositioning of the imaging unit or of the target structure itself. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that incorporates 2D/3D landmark registration into the training of a U-Net landmark prediction model. We analyze the performance difference by comparing landmark detection accuracy between the baseline U-Net, U-Net trained with Pose Estimation Loss, and U-Net fine-tuned with Pose Estimation Loss under realistic intra-operative conditions where patient pose is variable.

Abstract: The synthesis of synchronized audio-visual content is a key challenge in generative AI, with open-source models facing challenges in robust audio-video alignment. Our analysis reveals that this issue is rooted in three fundamental challenges of the joint diffusion process: (1) Correspondence Drift, where concurrently evolving noisy latents impede stable learning of alignment; (2) inefficient global attention mechanisms that fail to capture fine-grained temporal cues; and (3) the intra-modal bias of conventional Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which enhances conditionality but not cross-modal synchronization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Harmony, a novel framework that mechanistically enforces audio-visual synchronization. We first propose a Cross-Task Synergy training paradigm to mitigate drift by leveraging strong supervisory signals from audio-driven video and video-driven audio generation tasks. Then, we design a Global-Local Decoupled Interaction Module for efficient and precise temporal-style alignment. Finally, we present a novel Synchronization-Enhanced CFG (SyncCFG) that explicitly isolates and amplifies the alignment signal during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Harmony establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in both generation fidelity and, critically, in achieving fine-grained audio-visual synchronization.

Abstract: Oral cancer is highly common across the globe and is mostly diagnosed during the later stages due to the close visual similarity to benign, precancerous, and malignant lesions in the oral cavity. Implementing computer aided diagnosis systems early on has the potential to greatly improve clinical outcomes. This research intends to use deep learning to build a multiclass classifier for sixteen different oral lesions. To overcome the challenges of limited and imbalanced datasets, the proposed technique combines stratified data splitting and advanced data augmentation and oversampling to perform the classification. The experimental results, which achieved 83.33 percent accuracy, 89.12 percent precision, and 77.31 percent recall, demonstrate the superiority of the suggested model over state of the art methods now in use. The suggested model effectively conveys the effectiveness of oversampling and augmentation strategies in situations where the minority class classification performance is noteworthy. As a first step toward trustworthy computer aided diagnostic systems for the early detection of oral cancer in clinical settings, the suggested framework shows promise.

TL;DR: MoGAN通过运动中心化后训练框架提升视频扩散模型的运动质量，实验显示显著改进且不影响视觉保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准去噪MSE目标缺乏对时间一致性的直接监督，导致生成的视频运动质量不佳。

Method: 基于3步蒸馏视频扩散模型，训练DiT基光学流判别器区分真实与生成运动，并结合分布匹配正则化器。

Result: 在VBench和VideoJAM-Bench上，MoGAN分别提升了运动评分7.3%和7.4%，人类研究也显示其运动质量更受偏好。

Conclusion: MoGAN通过结合光学流判别器和分布匹配正则化器，显著提升了视频生成的运动质量，同时保持了视觉保真度和效率。

Abstract: Video diffusion models achieve strong frame-level fidelity but still struggle with motion coherence, dynamics and realism, often producing jitter, ghosting, or implausible dynamics. A key limitation is that the standard denoising MSE objective provides no direct supervision on temporal consistency, allowing models to achieve low loss while still generating poor motion. We propose MoGAN, a motion-centric post-training framework that improves motion realism without reward models or human preference data. Built atop a 3-step distilled video diffusion model, we train a DiT-based optical-flow discriminator to differentiate real from generated motion, combined with a distribution-matching regularizer to preserve visual fidelity. With experiments on Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B, MoGAN substantially improves motion quality across benchmarks. On VBench, MoGAN boosts motion score by +7.3% over the 50-step teacher and +13.3% over the 3-step DMD model. On VideoJAM-Bench, MoGAN improves motion score by +7.4% over the teacher and +8.8% over DMD, while maintaining comparable or even better aesthetic and image-quality scores. A human study further confirms that MoGAN is preferred for motion quality (52% vs. 38% for the teacher; 56% vs. 29% for DMD). Overall, MoGAN delivers significantly more realistic motion without sacrificing visual fidelity or efficiency, offering a practical path toward fast, high-quality video generation.

Motivation: 解决SAM在遥感图像上因领域偏移和密集标注稀缺导致的性能不佳问题。

Method: 提出了一种自提示、点监督框架，采用Refine-Requery-Reinforce循环，通过稀疏点标注逐步优化SAM的分割质量。

Result: 在WHU、HRSID和NWPU VHR-10三个基准数据集上表现优于预训练SAM及近期点监督分割方法。

Conclusion: 自我提示和语义对齐为遥感应用中基础分割模型的可扩展点级适应提供了高效路径。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have demonstrated remarkable generalization on natural images, but perform suboptimally on remote sensing imagery (RSI) due to severe domain shift and the scarcity of dense annotations. To address this, we propose a self-prompting, point-supervised framework that adapts SAM to RSIs using only sparse point annotations. Our method employs a Refine-Requery-Reinforce loop, where coarse pseudo-masks are generated from initial points (Refine), improved with self-constructed box prompts (Requery), and embeddings are aligned across iterations to reduce confirmation bias (Reinforce). Without relying on full-mask supervision, our approach progressively enhances SAM's segmentation quality and domain robustness through self-guided prompt adaptation . We evaluate our proposed method on three RSI benchmark datasets, including WHU, HRSID, and NWPU VHR-10, showing that our method consistently surpasses pretrained SAM and recent point-supervised segmentation methods. Our results demonstrate that self-prompting and semantic alignment provide an efficient path towards scalable, point-level adaptation of foundation segmentation models for remote sensing applications.

Motivation: 解决GCN在骨架动作识别中依赖大量标注数据的问题，提出标签高效的方法以应对实际场景中标注数据稀缺的挑战。

Method: 1. 开发了一种基于对抗策略的获取函数，用于选择信息丰富的样本进行标注；2. 引入了双向稳定的GCN架构，优化了数据空间映射。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种标签高效的GCN模型，通过新颖的获取函数和双向稳定GCN架构，显著提升了骨架动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Despite the notable success of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in skeleton-based action recognition, their performance often depends on large volumes of labeled data, which are frequently scarce in practical settings. To address this limitation, we propose a novel label-efficient GCN model. Our work makes two primary contributions. First, we develop a novel acquisition function that employs an adversarial strategy to identify a compact set of informative exemplars for labeling. This selection process balances representativeness, diversity, and uncertainty. Second, we introduce bidirectional and stable GCN architectures. These enhanced networks facilitate a more effective mapping between the ambient and latent data spaces, enabling a better understanding of the learned exemplar distribution. Extensive evaluations on two challenging skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks reveal significant improvements achieved by our label-efficient GCNs compared to prior work.

TL;DR: CaFlow结合因果反事实正则化和双向时间条件流，解决了长期动作质量评估中的因果鲁棒性和时间建模问题，实现了最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期动作质量评估（如花样滑冰或艺术体操）需要建模长时间动态并保持对上下文混杂因素的鲁棒性，现有方法依赖昂贵标注或单向时间建模，易受虚假相关性和不稳定长期表示的影响。

Method: CaFlow框架整合了因果反事实正则化（CCR）模块和双向时间条件流（BiT-Flow）模块。CCR以自监督方式解耦因果和混杂特征，并通过反事实干预增强因果鲁棒性；BiT-Flow通过循环一致性约束建模前向和后向动态，生成更平滑、一致的表示。

Result: 在多个长期AQA基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CaFlow达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CaFlow通过结合因果反事实正则化和双向时间条件流，在长期动作质量评估任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) predicts fine-grained execution scores from action videos and is widely applied in sports, rehabilitation, and skill evaluation. Long-term AQA, as in figure skating or rhythmic gymnastics, is especially challenging since it requires modeling extended temporal dynamics while remaining robust to contextual confounders. Existing approaches either depend on costly annotations or rely on unidirectional temporal modeling, making them vulnerable to spurious correlations and unstable long-term representations. To this end, we propose CaFlow, a unified framework that integrates counterfactual de-confounding with bidirectional time-conditioned flow. The Causal Counterfactual Regularization (CCR) module disentangles causal and confounding features in a self-supervised manner and enforces causal robustness through counterfactual interventions, while the BiT-Flow module models forward and backward dynamics with a cycle-consistency constraint to produce smoother and more coherent representations. Extensive experiments on multiple long-term AQA benchmarks demonstrate that CaFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at https://github.com/Harrison21/CaFlow

Motivation: 探索大型多模态模型（LMMs）在遵循多样化、细粒度评估标准方面的能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过严格的数据筛选流程构建 Multi-Crit 基准，涵盖开放式生成和可验证推理任务，并引入三种新指标评估模型的多元标准遵循能力。

Result: 分析 25 个 LMMs 发现：1) 专有模型在开放式评估中难以保持一致性；2) 开源模型在灵活性上更落后；3) 基于整体判断信号的微调无法推广到多元标准判断。

Conclusion: Multi-Crit 为构建可靠且可操控的多模态 AI 评估系统奠定了基础，揭示了当前多模态评判模型在遵循多样化标准方面的局限性。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) are increasingly adopted as judges in multimodal evaluation systems due to their strong instruction following and consistency with human preferences. However, their ability to follow diverse, fine-grained evaluation criteria remains underexplored. We develop Multi-Crit, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal judges on their capacity to follow pluralistic criteria and produce reliable criterion-level judgments. Covering both open-ended generation and verifiable reasoning tasks, Multi-Crit is built through a rigorous data curation pipeline that gathers challenging response pairs with multi-criterion human annotations. It further introduces three novel metrics for systematically assessing pluralistic adherence, criterion-switching flexibility, and the ability to recognize criterion-level preference conflicts. Comprehensive analysis of 25 LMMs reveals that 1) proprietary models still struggle to maintain consistent adherence to pluralistic criteria--especially in open-ended evaluation; 2) open-source models lag further behind in flexibly following diverse criteria; and 3) critic fine-tuning with holistic judgment signals enhances visual grounding but fails to generalize to pluralistic criterion-level judgment. Additional analyses on reasoning fine-tuning, test-time scaling, and boundary consistency between open-source and proprietary models further probe the limits of current multimodal judges. As a pioneering study, Multi-Crit lays the foundation for building reliable and steerable multimodal AI evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑胶质瘤具有高死亡率，早期和准确诊断对治疗干预至关重要。传统方法在分割和分类准确性上存在不足，因此需要开发更高效的深度学习模型。

Method: 开发了一个混合深度学习模型，结合了基于U-Net的分割网络和混合DenseNet-VGG分类网络，并引入了多头注意力和空间-通道注意力机制。通过预处理步骤（如归一化、重采样和数据增强）处理高维3D MRI数据。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的混合深度学习框架在脑胶质瘤的早期和准确诊断中显示出巨大潜力，能够显著提升分割和分类的准确性，有助于临床治疗规划。

Abstract: Gliomas are brain tumor types that have a high mortality rate which means early and accurate diagnosis is important for therapeutic intervention for the tumors. To address this difficulty, the proposed research will develop a hybrid deep learning model which integrates U-Net based segmentation and a hybrid DenseNet-VGG classification network with multihead attention and spatial-channel attention capabilities. The segmentation model will precisely demarcate the tumors in a 3D volume of MRI data guided by spatial and contextual information. The classification network which combines a branch of both DenseNet and VGG, will incorporate the demarcated tumor on which features with attention mechanisms would be focused on clinically relevant features. High-dimensional 3D MRI data could successfully be utilized in the model through preprocessing steps which are normalization, resampling, and data augmentation. Through a variety of measures the framework is evaluated: measures of performance in segmentation are Dice coefficient and Mean Intersection over Union (IoU) and measures of performance in classification are accuracy precision, recall, and F1-score. The hybrid framework that has been proposed has demonstrated through physical testing that it has the capability of obtaining a Dice coefficient of 98% in tumor segmentation, and 99% on classification accuracy, outperforming traditional CNN models and attention-free methods. Utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms enhances notions of priority in aspects of the tumor that are clinically significant, and enhances interpretability and accuracy. The results suggest a great potential of the framework in facilitating the timely and reliable diagnosis and grading of glioma by clinicians is promising, allowing for better planning of patient treatment.

Motivation: 探索仅通过相机轨迹（而非像素）是否能感知视频内容，这一看似不可能的问题。

Method: 提出了一种对比学习框架CamFormer，将相机姿态轨迹投影到与自然语言对齐的联合嵌入空间。

Result: 发现相机轨迹是揭示视频内容的强信号，CamFormer嵌入在多种下游任务中表现优异，且对不同相机姿态估计方法具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 相机轨迹作为一种轻量级、鲁棒且多功能的模态，能够有效感知视频内容。

Abstract: Can one perceive a video's content without seeing its pixels, just from the camera trajectory-the path it carves through space? This paper is the first to systematically investigate this seemingly implausible question. Towards this end, we propose a contrastive learning framework to train CamFormer, a dedicated encoder that projects camera pose trajectories into a joint embedding space, aligning them with natural language. We find that, contrary to its apparent simplicity, the camera trajectory is a remarkably informative signal to uncover video content. In other words, "how you move" can indeed reveal "what you are doing" (egocentric) or "observing" (exocentric). We demonstrate the versatility of our learned CamFormer embeddings on a diverse suite of downstream tasks, ranging from cross-modal alignment to classification and temporal analysis. Importantly, our representations are robust across diverse camera pose estimation methods, including both high-fidelity multi-sensored and standard RGB-only estimators. Our findings establish camera trajectory as a lightweight, robust, and versatile modality for perceiving video content.

Motivation: 现代扩散模型在多模态控制（如文本提示、空间布局、姿态约束等）下的高保真生成能力不足。

Method: 提出了 Canvas-to-Image 框架，将多种控制信号编码为单一复合画布图像，并通过多任务画布训练策略联合优化扩散模型。

Result: 在多人组合、姿态控制生成、布局约束生成等任务中，Canvas-to-Image 显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Canvas-to-Image 通过统一的画布界面和多任务训练策略，显著提升了扩散模型在多模态控制下的生成质量，尤其在身份保持和控制遵从方面表现优异。

Abstract: While modern diffusion models excel at generating high-quality and diverse images, they still struggle with high-fidelity compositional and multimodal control, particularly when users simultaneously specify text prompts, subject references, spatial arrangements, pose constraints, and layout annotations. We introduce Canvas-to-Image, a unified framework that consolidates these heterogeneous controls into a single canvas interface, enabling users to generate images that faithfully reflect their intent. Our key idea is to encode diverse control signals into a single composite canvas image that the model can directly interpret for integrated visual-spatial reasoning. We further curate a suite of multi-task datasets and propose a Multi-Task Canvas Training strategy that optimizes the diffusion model to jointly understand and integrate heterogeneous controls into text-to-image generation within a unified learning paradigm. This joint training enables Canvas-to-Image to reason across multiple control modalities rather than relying on task-specific heuristics, and it generalizes well to multi-control scenarios during inference. Extensive experiments show that Canvas-to-Image significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation and control adherence across challenging benchmarks, including multi-person composition, pose-controlled composition, layout-constrained generation, and multi-control generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统缓存策略（如 LRU 和 CLIMB）无法高效适应变化的访问模式，需要更轻量且自适应的解决方案。

Method: 提出了 AdaptiveClimb 和 DynamicAdaptiveClimb 两种新型缓存替换策略，动态调整缓存对象的提升距离和缓存大小，仅需一个可调参数且无需逐项统计。

Result: 在 1067 条真实世界轨迹的评估中，DynamicAdaptiveClimb 命中率提升高达 29%，比 FIFO 基线显著减少缺失惩罚，并优于其他先进算法 10%-15%。

Conclusion: DynamicAdaptiveClimb 在动态缓存环境中表现出色，显著提升了命中率并减少了缺失惩罚，适合现代高效缓存管理。

Abstract: Efficient cache management is critical for optimizing the system performance, and numerous caching mechanisms have been proposed, each exploring various insertion and eviction strategies. In this paper, we present AdaptiveClimb and its extension, DynamicAdaptiveClimb, two novel cache replacement policies that leverage lightweight, cache adaptation to outperform traditional approaches. Unlike classic Least Recently Used (LRU) and Incremental Rank Progress (CLIMB) policies, AdaptiveClimb dynamically adjusts the promotion distance (jump) of the cached objects based on recent hit and miss patterns, requiring only a single tunable parameter and no per-item statistics. This enables rapid adaptation to changing access distributions while maintaining low overhead. Building on this foundation, DynamicAdaptiveClimb further enhances adaptability by automatically tuning the cache size in response to workload demands. Our comprehensive evaluation across a diverse set of real-world traces, including 1067 traces from 6 different datasets, demonstrates that DynamicAdaptiveClimb consistently achieves substantial speedups and higher hit ratios compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, our approach achieves up to a 29% improvement in hit ratio and a substantial reduction in miss penalties compared to the FIFO baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the next-best contenders, AdaptiveClimb and SIEVE [43], by approximately 10% to 15%, especially in environments characterized by fluctuating working set sizes. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in delivering efficient performance, making it well-suited for modern, dynamic caching environments.

Method: 提出了DUALGAUGE框架，包括一个代理程序执行器和一个基于LLM的评估器，用于在沙盒环境中运行程序并评估其正确性和漏洞行为。

Result: DUALGAUGE在评估十个领先LLM时发现了它们在生成正确和安全代码方面的关键差距。

Conclusion: DUALGAUGE是一个自动化基准测试框架，旨在同时评估LLM生成代码的安全性和正确性，填补了现有评估方法的不足。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and autonomous coding agents are increasingly used to generate software across a wide range of domains. Yet a core requirement remains unmet: ensuring that generated code is secure without compromising its functional correctness. Existing benchmarks and evaluations for secure code generation fall short-many measure only vulnerability reduction, disregard correctness preservation, or evaluate security and functionality on separate datasets, violating the fundamental need for simultaneous joint evaluation. We present DUALGAUGE, the first fully automated benchmarking framework designed to rigorously evaluate the security and correctness of LLM-generated code in unison. Given the lack of datasets enabling joint evaluation of secure code generation, we also present DUALGAUGE-BENCH, a curated benchmark suite of diverse coding tasks, each paired with manually validated test suites for both security and functionality, designed for full coverage of specification requirements. At the core of DUALGAUGE is an agentic program executor, which runs a program against given tests in sandboxed environments, and an LLM-based evaluator, which assesses both correctness and vulnerability behavior against expected outcomes. We rigorously evaluated and ensured the quality of DUALGAUGE-BENCH and the accuracy of DUALGAUGE, and applied DUALGAUGE to benchmarking ten leading LLMs on DUALGAUGE-BENCH across thousands of test scenarios. Our results reveal critical gaps in correct and secure code generation by these LLMs, for which our open-source system and datasets help accelerate progress via reproducible, scalable, and rigorous evaluation.

Motivation: 数据驱动方法（DDMs）在产品开发中的应用日益增多，但其整合仍显碎片化，主要源于不确定性，尤其是缺乏关于在何时使用何种DDMs的明确指导。因此，本文旨在通过文献综述，明确DDMs在工程设计中的使用情况，包括方法类型、应用阶段及具体用途。

Abstract: The increasing availability of data and advancements in computational intelligence have accelerated the adoption of data-driven methods (DDMs) in product development. However, their integration into product development remains fragmented. This fragmentation stems from uncertainty, particularly the lack of clarity on what types of DDMs to use and when to employ them across the product development lifecycle. To address this, a necessary first step is to investigate the usage of DDM in engineering design by identifying which methods are being used, at which development stages, and for what application. This paper presents a PRISMA systematic literature review. The V-model as a product development framework was adopted and simplified into four stages: system design, system implementation, system integration, and validation. A structured search across Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore (2014--2024) retrieved 1{,}689 records. After screening, 114 publications underwent full-text analysis. Findings show that machine learning (ML) and statistical methods dominate current practice, whereas deep learning (DL), though still less common, exhibits a clear upward trend in adoption. Additionally, supervised learning, clustering, regression analysis, and surrogate modeling are prevalent in design, implementation, and integration system stages but contributions to validation remain limited. Key challenges in existing applications include limited model interpretability, poor cross-stage traceability, and insufficient validation under real-world conditions. Additionally, it highlights key limitations and opportunities such as the need for interpretable hybrid models. This review is a first step toward design-stage guidelines; a follow-up synthesis should map computer science algorithms to engineering design problems and activities.

Abstract: The purpose of this article is to describe an adaptive decision-making support model aimed at improving the efficiency of engineering infrastructure reconstruction program management in the context of developing the architecture and work breakdown structure of programs. As part of the study, the existing adaptive program management tools are analyzed, the use of infrastructure systems modelling tools is justified for program architecture and WBS creation. Existing models and modelling methods are viewed, and machine learning and artificial neural networks are selected for the model. The main components of the model are defined, which include a set of decision-maker preferences, decision-making tasks, sets of input data, and applied software components of the model. To support decision-making, the adaptive model applies the method of system modeling and predicting the value of the objective function at a given system configuration. Prediction is done using machine learning methods based on a dataset consisting of historical data related to existing engineering systems. The work describes the components of the redistribution of varied model parameters, which modify the model dataset based on the selected object type, which allows adapting the decision-making process to the existing program implementation goals. The functional composition done in Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio is described. The neural network parameters and evaluation results are given. The application of the developed adaptive model is possible in the management of programs for the reconstruction of such engineering systems as systems of heat, gas, electricity supply, water supply, and drainage, etc.

Method: 通过编程生成设计不良的代码片段，并在不同指导级别（从简单的验证到引导和开放式生成）下测试DeepSeek-R1模型家族（14B、32B、70B），同时通过注入干扰元素来改变上下文噪声。

Result: 在理想条件下，模型对这两个概念有扎实的基础理解，但实际知识脆弱且高度不对称。耦合性推理在嘈杂、开放式场景中表现脆弱（F1分数下降超过50%），而内聚性分析在引导任务中对内部噪声表现出显著鲁棒性（性能下降较小）。然而，当完全移除引导时，这种鲁棒性也会失效。

Conclusion: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在识别设计缺陷方面能提供可靠帮助，但在嘈杂、现实场景中自主推理的能力有限，突显了对更可扩展和鲁棒的程序理解能力的迫切需求。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly adopted in the software engineering domain, yet the robustness of their grasp on core software design concepts remains unclear. We conduct an empirical study to systematically evaluate their understanding of cohesion (intra-module) and coupling (inter-module). We programmatically generate poorly designed code fragments and test the DeepSeek-R1 model family ($14$B, $32$B, $70$B) under varying levels of guidance, from simple \textit{Verification} to \textit{Guided} and \textit{Open-ended Generation}, while varying contextual noise by injecting distractor elements. While models exhibit a solid baseline understanding of both concepts in ideal conditions, their practical knowledge is fragile and highly asymmetrical. Reasoning about coupling proves brittle; performance collapses in noisy, open-ended scenarios, with F1 scores dropping by over $50\%$. In contrast, the models' analysis of cohesion is remarkably robust to internal noise in guided tasks, showing little performance degradation. However, this resilience also fails when all guidance is removed. Reasoning-trace analysis confirms these failure modes, revealing \textit{cognitive shortcutting} for coupling versus a more exhaustive (yet still failing) analysis for cohesion. To summarize, while LLMs can provide reliable assistance for recognizing design flaws, their ability to reason autonomously in noisy, realistic contexts is limited, highlighting the critical need for more scalable and robust program understanding capabilities.

Motivation: 阐明确定性、单维度生产力启发式的局限性，并探索更全面的开发者效能评估方法。

Method: 通过广泛的仓库挖掘操作化SPACE框架，采用包括广义线性混合模型（GLMM）和基于RoBERTa的情感分类在内的严格统计方法，合成了一个全面的、多方面的生产力指标。

Result: 分析结果显示，负面情感状态与提交频率之间存在统计学上显著的正相关关系，暗示了由挫败感驱动的迭代修复循环。此外，研究表明，分析贡献者互动的拓扑结构在映射协作动态方面比传统的基于数量的指标具有更高的保真度。

Abstract: This empirical investigation elucidates the limitations of deterministic, unidimensional productivity heuristics by operationalizing the SPACE framework through extensive repository mining. Utilizing a dataset derived from open-source repositories, the study employs rigorous statistical methodologies including Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) and RoBERTa-based sentiment classification to synthesize a holistic, multi-faceted productivity metric. Analytical results reveal a statistically significant positive correlation between negative affective states and commit frequency, implying a cycle of iterative remediation driven by frustration. Furthermore, the investigation has demonstrated that analyzing the topology of contributor interactions yields superior fidelity in mapping collaborative dynamics compared to traditional volume-based metrics. Ultimately, this research posits a Composite Productivity Score (CPS) to address the heterogeneity of developer efficacy.

TL;DR: 研究通过模型编辑技术更新LLMs中的废弃API知识，提出AdaLoRA-L方法，显著提升特异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs因训练数据时效性问题生成的废弃API问题，避免昂贵的重新训练成本。

Method: 本研究应用了10种最先进的模型编辑技术，并引入了EDAPIBench基准测试，包含70多个废弃API和3000多个编辑实例。最终提出了AdaLoRA-L方法，通过定义‘通用API层’和‘特定API层’来优化编辑效果。

Result: AdaLoRA在生成正确的最新API方面表现最佳，但在特异性上不足。AdaLoRA-L显著改善了特异性。

Conclusion: AdaLoRA-L显著提高了特异性，同时在其他评估指标上保持了可比性能。

Abstract: Pre-trained or fine-tuned on large code corpora, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in code completion tasks. However, their embedded knowledge is constrained by the timeliness of training data, which often includes code using deprecated APIs. Consequently, LLMs frequently generate deprecated APIs that will no longer be supported in future versions of third-party libraries. While retraining LLMs on updated codebases could refresh their API knowledge, this approach is computationally expensive. Recently, lightweight model editing methods have emerged to efficiently correct specific knowledge in LLMs. However, it remains unclear whether these methods can effectively update deprecated API knowledge and enable edited models to generate up-to-date APIs. To address this gap, we conduct the first systematic study applying 10 state-of-the-art model editing techniques to update deprecated API knowledge in three LLMs: Qwen2.5-Coder, StarCoder2, and DeepSeek-Coder. We introduce EDAPIBench, a dedicated benchmark featuring over 70 deprecated APIs from 8 popular Python libraries, with more than 3,000 editing instances. Our results show that the parameter-efficient fine-tuning method AdaLoRA achieves the best performance in enabling edited models to generate correct, up-to-date APIs, but falls short in Specificity (i.e., the editing influences untargeted knowledge). To resolve this, we propose AdaLoRA-L, which defines "Common API Layers" (layers within the LLMs with high importance across all APIs, storing general knowledge and excluded from editing) and restricts edits exclusively to "Specific API Layers" (layers with high importance only for the target API, storing the API-specific knowledge). Experimental results demonstrate that AdaLoRA-L significantly improves Specificity while maintaining comparable performance across other evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索移动应用行为中未被充分研究的地理差异现象，特别是GeoTwins和base.apk文件的区域差异，及其对安全性、隐私和公平性的影响。

Method: 通过构建分布式应用收集管道，跨多个地区收集并分析了数千个应用，并发布了一个包含81,963个GeoTwins的数据集。

Result: 研究发现，GeoTwins在权限请求、第三方库和隐私披露方面存在差异，且base.apk文件也存在区域差异，这些差异可能导致安全评估的不一致和地理偏见。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了移动应用中存在的地理差异现象，包括GeoTwins和base.apk文件的区域差异，这些差异对安全性、隐私和功能评估产生了影响，并提出了对透明度、同意和伦理问题的关注。

Abstract: While mobile app evolution has been widely studied, geographical variation in app behavior remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a large-scale study of location-based Android app differentiation, uncovering two important and underexamined phenomena with security and fairness implications. First, we introduce GeoTwins: apps that are functionally similar and share branding but are released under different package names across countries. Despite their similarity, GeoTwins often diverge in requested permissions, third-party libraries, and privacy disclosures. Second, we examine the Android App Bundle ecosystem and reveal unexpected regional differences in supposedly consistent base.apk files. Contrary to common assumptions, even base.apk files vary by region, exposing hidden customizations that may affect app behavior or security.
  These discrepancies have concrete consequences. Geographically distinct variants can lead the same app to be labeled benign in one malware study but suspicious in another, depending on the region of download. Such hidden variation undermines reproducibility and introduces geographic bias into assessments of security, privacy, and functionality. It also raises ethical concerns about transparency and consent: visually identical Google Play listings may mask subtle but important differences.
  To study these issues, we built a distributed app collection pipeline spanning multiple regions and analyzed thousands of apps. We also release a dataset of 81,963 GeoTwins to support future work. Our findings reveal systemic regional disparities in mobile software, with implications for researchers, developers, platform architects, and policymakers.

Motivation: 尽管AI辅助工具在技术特性上有所进步，但开发者如何心理建模这些工具以及不匹配如何影响信任、控制和采用尚不清楚。

Method: 通过六个共同设计研讨会，与58名开发者合作，引出他们对AI辅助错误检测和可读性功能的心理模型。

Result: 开发者将错误检测工具视为“错误侦探”，仅在关键问题时警告用户，保证透明度、可操作的反馈和信心提示；而可读性评估工具则被视为“质量教练”，提供情境化、个性化和渐进式指导。信任取决于解释的清晰度、时机和用户控制。

Conclusion: 论文总结了一套以人为中心的AI设计原则，旨在在IDE中平衡干扰与支持、简洁与深度、自动化与人类能动性。

Abstract: AI-assisted tools support developers in performing cognitively demanding tasks such as bug detection and code readability assessment. Despite the advancements in the technical characteristics of these tools, little is known about how developers mentally model them and how mismatches affect trust, control, and adoption. We conducted six co-design workshops with 58 developers to elicit their mental models about AI-assisted bug detection and readability features. It emerged that developers conceive bug detection tools as \textit{bug detectives}, which warn users only in case of critical issues, guaranteeing transparency, actionable feedback, and confidence cues. Readability assessment tools, on the other hand, are envisioned as \textit{quality coaches}, which provide contextual, personalized, and progressive guidance. Trust, in both tasks, depends on the clarity of explanations, timing, and user control. A set of design principles for Human-Centered AI in IDEs has been distilled, aiming to balance disruption with support, conciseness with depth, and automation with human agency.

Method: 通过五阶段评估流程（文件理解、代码编辑、命令生成、验证和最终执行）评估Copilot在数据集适应任务中的表现。

Result: 现有系统能识别关键文件并生成部分适应，但很少能生成功能正确的实现。提示级干预（如提供执行错误消息和参考代码）显著提高了结构相似性（从7.25%提升至67.14%）。

Conclusion: 当前的多代理LLM系统在数据集适应任务中展现了潜力但也存在局限，未来研究需要构建更可靠、自纠正的代理。

Abstract: Automating the adaptation of software engineering (SE) research artifacts across datasets is essential for scalability and reproducibility, yet it remains largely unstudied. Recent advances in large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems, such as GitHub Copilot's agent mode, promise to automate complex development workflows through coordinated reasoning, code generation, and tool interaction. This paper presents the first empirical study on how state-of-the-art multi-agent systems perform in dataset adaptation tasks. We evaluate Copilot, backed by GPT-4.1 and Claude Sonnet 4, on adapting SE research artifacts from benchmark repositories including ROCODE and LogHub2.0. Through a five-stage evaluation pipeline (file comprehension, code editing, command generation, validation, and final execution), we measure success rates, analyze failure patterns, and assess prompt-based interventions designed to enhance agent performance. Results show that current systems can identify key files and generate partial adaptations but rarely produce functionally correct implementations. Prompt-level interventions, especially providing execution error messages and reference code, substantially improve structural similarity to ground truth (from 7.25% to 67.14%), highlighting the importance of contextual and feedback-driven guidance. Our findings reveal both the promise and limitations of today's multi-agent LLM systems for dataset adaptation, and suggest concrete directions for building more reliable, self-correcting agents in future SE research.

Motivation: 探讨如何利用LLMs的数据驱动知识和编程模式来弥补传统自动化方法在语义信息和生成现实输入与断言方面的不足。

Method: 通过系统文献综述分析了115篇2021年5月至2025年8月发表的论文，提出了基于单元测试生成生命周期的统一分类法。

Result: 分析发现提示工程因其灵活性成为主导策略（占89%的文献），迭代验证和修复循环成为确保鲁棒性的标准机制，但故障检测能力和标准化评估基准仍是挑战。

Conclusion: 本文总结了LLMs在单元测试生成领域的应用现状，并提出了未来研究的路线图，强调向自主测试代理和结合LLMs与传统软件工程工具的混合系统发展。

Abstract: Unit testing is an essential yet laborious technique for verifying software and mitigating regression risks. Although classic automated methods effectively explore program structures, they often lack the semantic information required to produce realistic inputs and assertions. Large Language Models (LLMs) address this limitation by utilizing by leveraging their data-driven knowledge of code semantics and programming patterns. To analyze the state of the art in this domain, we conducted a systematic literature review of 115 publications published between May 2021 and August 2025. We propose a unified taxonomy based on the unit test generation lifecycle that treats LLMs as stochastic generators requiring systematic engineering constraints. This framework analyzes the literature regarding core generative strategies and a set of enhancement techniques ranging from pre-generation context enrichment to post-generation quality assurance. Our analysis reveals that prompt engineering has emerged as the dominant utilization strategy and accounts for 89% of the studies due to its flexibility. We find that iterative validation and repair loops have become the standard mechanism to ensure robust usability and lead to significant improvements in compilation and execution pass rates. However, critical challenges remain regarding the weak fault detection capabilities of generated tests and the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. We conclude with a roadmap for future research that emphasizes the progression towards autonomous testing agents and hybrid systems combining LLMs with traditional software engineering tools. This survey provides researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive perspective on converting the potential of LLMs into industrial-grade testing solutions.

*Pasapong Wongprasert,Kasidis Arunruangsirilert,Jiro Katto*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文研究了泰国b28/n28频段上4x4 MIMO的实际性能，发现支持4x4 MIMO的设备表现优于仅支持2Rx的设备，验证了低频段4x4 MIMO的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 市场上大多数商用5G设备在低频段（<1 GHz）缺乏4x4 MIMO支持，而泰国True-H和dtac网络已部署4T4R，因此研究低频段4x4 MIMO的实际性能具有现实意义。

Method: 使用索尼Xperia 1 III和IV智能手机，通过固件修改配置2 Rx端口，与其他制造商的设备进行对比测试，评估不同信号条件下的可靠性及最优条件下的最大吞吐量。

Result: 实验结果表明，支持4x4 MIMO的设备在b28/n28频段上表现更优，尤其是在信号条件和吞吐量方面。

Conclusion: 本文通过实验验证了在泰国b28/n28（APT）频段上4x4 MIMO的实际性能，发现支持4x4 MIMO的设备（如索尼Xperia 1 III和IV）在信号条件和吞吐量方面表现优于仅支持2Rx天线的设备。

Abstract: All 3GPP-compliant commercial 5G New Radio (NR)-capable UEs on the market are equipped with 4x4 MIMO support for Mid-Band frequencies (>1.7 GHz) and above, enabling up to rank 4 MIMO transmission. This doubles the theoretical throughput compared to rank 2 MIMO and also improves reception performance. However, 4x4 MIMO support on low-band frequencies (<1 GHz) is absent in every commercial UEs, with the exception of the Xperia 1 flagship smartphones manufactured by Sony Mobile and the Xiaomi 14 Pro as of January 2024. The reason most manufacturers omit 4x4 MIMO support for low-band frequencies is likely due to design challenges or relatively small performance gains in real-world usage due to the lack of 4T4R deployment on low-band by mobile network operators around the world.
  In Thailand, 4T4R deployment on the b28/n28 (APT) band is common on True-H and dtac networks, enabling 4x4 MIMO transmission on supported UEs. In this paper, the real-world 4x4 MIMO performance on the b28/n28 (APT) band will be investigated by evaluating the reliability test under different signal conditions and the maximum throughput test by evaluating the performance under optimal conditions, using the Sony Xperia 1 III and the Sony Xperia 1 IV smartphone. Devices from other manufacturers are also used in the experiment to investigate the performance with 2Rx antennas for comparison. Through firmware modifications, the Sony Xperia 1 III and IV can be configured to use only 2 Rx ports on low-band, enabling the collection of comparative 2 Rx performance data as a reference.

TL;DR: 5G SA在泰国已覆盖76%人口，其在UHD视频流传输中表现优异，远超5G NSA和LTE网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究5G SA在实时UHD视频流传输中的性能表现，并与5G NSA和LTE网络进行对比。

Method: 通过MPEG-DASH在不同移动网络技术下进行实时UHD视频直播流传输，评估丢包率、MAC吞吐量和延迟等性能指标。

Result: 5G SA在所有测试情境下成功交付超过95%的UHD视频片段，而5G NSA表现不一，LTE网络则有超过20%的片段未能按时交付。

Conclusion: 5G SA对于低延迟的UHD视频流至关重要，而5G NSA由于依赖传统控制信号可能不足以胜任此任务。

Abstract: 5G Standalone (SA) is the goal of the 5G evolution, which aims to provide higher throughput and lower latency than the existing LTE network. One of the main applications of 5G is the real-time distribution of Ultra High-Definition (UHD) content with a resolution of 4K or 8K. In Q2/2021, Advanced Info Service (AIS), the biggest operator in Thailand, launched 5G SA, providing both 5G SA/NSA service nationwide in addition to the existing LTE network. While many parts of the world are still in process of rolling out the first phase of 5G in Non-Standalone (NSA) mode, 5G SA in Thailand already covers more than 76% of the population.
  In this paper, UHD video will be a real-time live streaming via MPEG-DASH over different mobile network technologies with minimal buffer size to provide the lowest latency. Then, performance such as the number of dropped segments, MAC throughput, and latency are evaluated in various situations such as stationary, moving in the urban area, moving at high speed, and also an ideal condition with maximum SINR. It has been found that 5G SA can deliver more than 95% of the UHD video segment successfully within the required time window in all situations, while 5G NSA produced mixed results depending on the condition of the LTE network. The result also reveals that the LTE network failed to deliver more than 20% of the video segment within the deadline, which shows that 5G SA is absolutely necessary for low-latency UHD video streaming and 5G NSA may not be good enough for such task as it relies on the legacy control signal.

Conclusion: 该演示展示了结合本地部署的轻量级大语言模型（LLaMA-3 8b Q-4b）与检索增强生成（RAG）技术，为5G网络管理提供了一种安全、高效且灵活的自动化解决方案，为未来隐私保护和多用户场景下的5G网络发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: This demonstration showcases the integration of a lightweight, locally deployed Large Language Model (LLaMA-3 8b Q-4b) empowered by retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to automate 5G network management, with a strong emphasis on privacy. By running the LLM on local or edge devices ,we eliminate the need for external APIs, ensuring that sensitive data remains secure and is not transmitted over the internet. Although lightweight models may not match the performance of more complex models like GPT-4, we enhance their efficiency and accuracy through RAG. RAG retrieves relevant information from a comprehensive database, enabling the LLM to generate more precise and effective network configurations based on natural language user input. This approach not only improves the accuracy of the generated configurations but also simplifies the process of creating and configuring private networks, making it accessible to users without extensive networking or programming experience. The objective of this demonstration is to highlight the potential of combining local LLMs and RAG to deliver secure, efficient, and adaptable 5G network solutions, paving the way for a future where 5G networks are both privacy-conscious and versatile across diverse user profiles.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的基于数字孪生（DT）的安全访问策略显著提升了SAGIN-enabled IoT网络的安全性，并有效平衡了系统负载，减少了排队延迟，从而全面提升了网络性能。

Abstract: In space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN)-enabled IoT networks, secure access has become a significant challenge due to the increasing risks of eavesdropping attacks. To address these threats to data confidentiality, this paper proposes a Digital Twin (DT)-driven secure access strategy. The strategy leverages a virtual replica of the physical SAGIN environment within the DT framework to continuously assess dynamic eavesdropping risks by quantifying secrecy capacity. Operating within this DT framework, an evolutionary game model dynamically balances the DT-updated secrecy capacity against queuing delay, steering IoT devices toward more secure and efficient access decisions. Furthermore, a novel distributed algorithm, integral to the DT operation, is developed to obtain the equilibrium access strategy for each device in a scalable manner. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DT-based approach substantially improves the security of SAGIN-enabled IoT networks. Additionally, it effectively balances system load, prevents overload occurrences, and decreases queuing delay compared to benchmark schemes, thereby comprehensively improving overall network performance.

Method: LatencyScope 通过建模RAN每一层的延迟源，识别系统级瓶颈，并捕捉其复杂依赖性和随机性。此外，它还包括一个配置优化器，用于搜索数百亿种配置以找到满足延迟可靠性目标的设置。

Result: 在两种开源的5G RAN测试平台（srsRAN和OAI）上验证了LatencyScope，结果显示其能紧密匹配实际延迟分布，并显著优于先前的分析模型和广泛使用的模拟器。

Conclusion: LatencyScope 提供了一个有效的数学框架，用于精确计算5G RAN中的单向延迟，并通过优化配置帮助网络运营商高效识别最佳系统设置。

Abstract: This paper presents LatencyScope, a mathematical framework for accurately computing one-way latency (for uplink and downlink) in the 5G RAN across diverse system configurations. LatencyScope models latency sources at every layer of the Radio Access Network (RAN), pinpointing system-level bottlenecks--such as radio interfaces, scheduling policies, and hardware/software constraints--while capturing their intricate dependencies and their stochastic nature. LatencyScope also includes a configuration optimizer that uses its mathematical models to search through hundreds of billions of configurations and find settings that meet latency-reliability targets under user constraints. We validate LatencyScope on two open-sourced 5G RAN testbeds (srsRAN and OAI), demonstrating that it can closely match empirical latency distributions and significantly outperform prior analytical models and widely used simulators (MATLAB 5G Toolbox, 5G-LENA). It can also find system configurations that meet Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) targets and enable network operators to efficiently identify the best setup for their systems.

Abstract: The convergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G technologies is transforming modern communication systems by enabling massive connectivity, low latency, and high-speed data transmission. In this evolving landscape, Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is emerging as a promising alternative to traditional Internet Protocol (IP)-based architectures. CCN offers advantages such as in-network caching, scalability, and efficient content dissemination, all of which are particularly well-suited to the constraints of the IoT. However, deploying content-centric approaches in 5G-based IoT environments introduces significant security challenges. Key concerns include content authentication, data integrity, privacy protection, and resilience against attacks such as spoofing and cache poisoning. Such issues are exacerbated by the distributed, mobile, and heterogeneous nature of IoT and 5G systems. In this survey, we review and classify existing security solutions for content-centric architectures in IoT-5G scenarios. We highlight current trends, identify limitations in existing approaches, and outline future research directions with a focus on lightweight and adaptive security mechanisms.

### [136] [Minimizing Hyperbolic Embedding Distortion with LLM-Guided Hierarchy Restructuring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20679)
*Melika Ayoughi,Pascal Mettes,Paul Groth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can effectively restructure hierarchies for better hyperbolic embeddings, offering explainable improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can automatically restructure hierarchies to meet the criteria (high branching factor and single inheritance) for optimal hyperbolic embeddings.

Method: A prompt-based approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform existing hierarchies, guided by known desiderata for hyperbolic embeddings.

Result: Experiments on 16 diverse hierarchies show improved embedding quality across several standard metrics.

Conclusion: LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently yield higher-quality hyperbolic embeddings, and provide explainable reorganizations with justifications to knowledge engineers.

Abstract: Hyperbolic geometry is an effective geometry for embedding hierarchical data structures. Hyperbolic learning has therefore become increasingly prominent in machine learning applications where data is hierarchically organized or governed by hierarchical semantics, ranging from recommendation systems to computer vision. The quality of hyperbolic embeddings is tightly coupled to the structure of the input hierarchy, which is often derived from knowledge graphs or ontologies. Recent work has uncovered that for an optimal hyperbolic embedding, a high branching factor and single inheritance are key, while embedding algorithms are robust to imbalance and hierarchy size. To assist knowledge engineers in reorganizing hierarchical knowledge, this paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to automatically restructure hierarchies to meet these criteria. We propose a prompt-based approach to transform existing hierarchies using LLMs, guided by known desiderata for hyperbolic embeddings. Experiments on 16 diverse hierarchies show that LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently yield higher-quality hyperbolic embeddings across several standard embedding quality metrics. Moreover, we show how LLM-guided hierarchy restructuring enables explainable reorganizations, providing justifications to knowledge engineers.

Conclusion: AssurAI数据集被公开发布，以促进为韩国社区开发更安全、更可靠的生成式AI系统。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative AI necessitates robust safety evaluations. However, current safety datasets are predominantly English-centric, failing to capture specific risks in non-English, socio-cultural contexts such as Korean, and are often limited to the text modality. To address this gap, we introduce AssurAI, a new quality-controlled Korean multimodal dataset for evaluating the safety of generative AI. First, we define a taxonomy of 35 distinct AI risk factors, adapted from established frameworks by a multidisciplinary expert group to cover both universal harms and relevance to the Korean socio-cultural context. Second, leveraging this taxonomy, we construct and release AssurAI, a large-scale Korean multimodal dataset comprising 11,480 instances across text, image, video, and audio. Third, we apply the rigorous quality control process used to ensure data integrity, featuring a two-phase construction (i.e., expert-led seeding and crowdsourced scaling), triple independent annotation, and an iterative expert red-teaming loop. Our pilot study validates AssurAI's effectiveness in assessing the safety of recent LLMs. We release AssurAI to the public to facilitate the development of safer and more reliable generative AI systems for the Korean community.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖手动预定义操作符，限制了泛化性和可扩展性，因此需要一种完全自动化的框架来解决这一问题。

Method: $A^2Flow$ 采用三阶段操作符提取过程：基于案例的初始操作符生成、操作符聚类与初步抽象、深度提取抽象执行操作符，并结合节点级工作流搜索和操作符记忆机制。

Result: 实验表明，$A^2Flow$ 在通用和具身基准测试中平均性能提升2.4%和19.3%，资源使用减少37%。

Conclusion: $A^2Flow$ 通过完全自动化的框架和自适应的抽象操作符，显著提升了代理工作流生成的性能和资源效率，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in automating the design of agentic workflows. However, existing methods still rely heavily on manually predefined operators, limiting generalization and scalability. To address this issue, we propose $A^2Flow$, a fully automated framework for agentic workflow generation based on self-adaptive abstraction operators. $A^2Flow$ employs a three-stage operator extraction process: 1) Case-based Initial Operator Generation: leveraging expert demonstrations and LLM reasoning to generate case-specific operators; 2) Operator Clustering and Preliminary Abstraction: grouping similar operators across tasks to form preliminary abstractions; and 3) Deep Extraction for Abstract Execution Operators: applying long chain-of-thought prompting and multi-path reasoning to derive compact and generalizable execution operators. These operators serve as reusable building blocks for workflow construction without manual predefinition. Furthermore, we enhance node-level workflow search with an operator memory mechanism, which retains historical outputs to enrich context and improve decision-making. Experiments on general and embodied benchmarks show that $A^2Flow$ achieves a 2.4\% and 19.3\% average performance improvement and reduces resource usage by 37\% over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Scientific reasoning through Large Language Models in heliophysics involves more than just recalling facts: it requires incorporating physical assumptions, maintaining consistent units, and providing clear scientific formats through coordinated approaches. To address these challenges, we present Reasoning With a Star, a newly contributed heliophysics dataset applicable to reasoning; we also provide an initial benchmarking approach. Our data are constructed from National Aeronautics and Space Administration & University Corporation for Atmospheric Research Living With a Star summer school problem sets and compiled into a readily consumable question-and-answer structure with question contexts, reasoning steps, expected answer type, ground-truth targets, format hints, and metadata. A programmatic grader checks the predictions using unit-aware numerical tolerance, symbolic equivalence, and schema validation. We benchmark a single-shot baseline and four multi-agent patterns, finding that decomposing workflows through systems engineering principles outperforms direct prompting on problems requiring deductive reasoning rather than pure inductive recall.

Abstract: Emerging from NASA's spacecraft simulations in the 1960s, digital twin technology has advanced through industrial adoption to spark a healthcare transformation. A digital twin is a dynamic, data-driven virtual counterpart of a physical system, continuously updated through real-time data streams and capable of bidirectional interaction. In medicine, digital twin integrates imaging, biosensors, and computational models to generate patient-specific simulations that support diagnosis, treatment planning, and drug development. Representative applications include cardiac digital twin for predicting arrhythmia treatment outcomes, oncology digital twin for tracking tumor progression and optimizing radiotherapy, and pharmacological digital twin for accelerating drug discovery. Despite rapid progress, major challenges, including interoperability, data privacy, and model fidelity, continue to limit widespread clinical integration. Emerging solutions such as explainable AI, federated learning, and harmonized regulatory frameworks offer promising pathways forward. Looking ahead, advances in multi-organ digital twin, genomics integration, and ethical governance will be essential to ensure that digital twin shifts healthcare from reactive treatment to predictive, preventive, and truly personalized medicine.

Motivation: 尽管最近的工作将CoT扩展到多模态设置，在科学问答基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，但这些方法在多样化领域中的泛化能力仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 我们实现了Zhang等人提出的两阶段框架，将理由生成与答案推断分离，并通过门控融合机制与基于T5的语言模型集成视觉特征。通过系统消融研究，分析了视觉特征、理由质量和架构选择的贡献。

Result: 我们的发现表明，虽然视觉集成显著减少了理由生成中的幻觉，但CoT推理的有效性在不同问题类型之间存在显著差异，特别是常识推理提出了特殊挑战。

Conclusion: 本研究为实施多模态推理系统的研究人员提供了实用见解，并确定了跨领域泛化未来改进的关键领域。

Abstract: While recent work has extended CoT to multimodal settings, achieving state-of-the-art results on science question answering benchmarks like ScienceQA, the generalizability of these approaches across diverse domains remains underexplored. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Multimodal-CoT) reasoning, evaluating its effectiveness on the A-OKVQA, OKVQA and ChartQA datasets, which requires broad commonsense and world knowledge beyond scientific reasoning. We implement the two-stage framework proposed by Zhang et al. [3], which separates rationale generation from answer inference and integrates vision features through a gated fusion mechanism with T5-based language models. Through systematic ablation studies, we analyze the contributions of vision features, rationale quality, and architectural choices. Our findings reveal that while vision integration significantly reduces hallucination in rationale generation, the effectiveness of CoT reasoning varies substantially across question types, with commonsense reasoning presenting particular challenges. This work provides practical insights for researchers implementing multimodal reasoning systems and identifies key areas for future improvement in cross-domain generalization.

Motivation: 现有的多接入点协调协议依赖静态规则，无法适应动态网络条件（如干扰水平和拓扑变化），因此需要一种能实时适应和协作的智能解决方案。

Method: 每个接入点被建模为自主的大型语言模型代理，通过自然语言对话和认知工作流（包括记忆、反思和工具使用）来协作推理网络状态并协商自适应协调策略。

Result: 综合仿真结果表明，该框架能成功适应多样化和动态的网络环境，显著优于现有空间复用基线方法。

Conclusion: Agentic AI Wi-Fi框架通过实时协作和自适应策略，显著提升了密集重叠基本服务集中的吞吐量，验证了其作为未来无线网络智能解决方案的潜力。

Abstract: Multi-access point coordination (MAPC) is a key technology for enhancing throughput in next-generation Wi-Fi within dense overlapping basic service sets. However, existing MAPC protocols rely on static, protocol-defined rules, which limits their ability to adapt to dynamic network conditions such as varying interference levels and topologies. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Agentic AI Wi-Fi framework where each access point, modeled as an autonomous large language model agent, collaboratively reasons about the network state and negotiates adaptive coordination strategies in real time. This dynamic collaboration is achieved through a cognitive workflow that enables the agents to engage in natural language dialogue, leveraging integrated memory, reflection, and tool use to ground their decisions in past experience and environmental feedback. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that our agentic framework successfully learns to adapt to diverse and dynamic network environments, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art spatial reuse baseline and validating its potential as a robust and intelligent solution for future wireless networks.

Motivation: 当前评估方法局限于固定环境，无法反映代理在实际部署中遇到的应用设计和内容变体对任务完成能力的影响。

Method: 开发了 OpenApps，包含六个可配置外观和内容的应用程序，支持在单个 CPU 上运行，生成数千个应用版本，并进行了超过 10,000 次独立评估。

Result: 研究发现，代理在固定应用中的可靠性相对稳定，但在应用变体中波动剧烈（例如 Kimi-VL-3B 的任务成功率从 63% 降至 4%），且代理行为（如循环或幻觉操作）因环境配置而异。

Conclusion: OpenApps 是一个轻量级开源生态系统，用于评估多模态代理在不同应用变体中的可靠性，揭示了代理在固定环境和变体环境中的表现差异显著，强调了跨应用变体测量可靠性的重要性。

Abstract: Reliability is key to realizing the promise of autonomous UI-Agents, multimodal agents that directly interact with apps in the same manner as humans, as users must be able to trust an agent to complete a given task. Current evaluations rely on fixed environments, often clones of existing apps, which are limited in that they can only shed light on whether or how often an agent can complete a task within a specific environment. When deployed however, agents are likely to encounter variations in app design and content that can affect an agent's ability to complete a task. To address this blind spot of measuring agent reliability across app variations, we develop OpenApps, a light-weight open-source ecosystem with six apps (messenger, calendar, maps, etc.) that are configurable in appearance and content. OpenApps requires just a single CPU to run, enabling easy generation and deployment of thousands of versions of each app. Specifically, we run more than 10,000 independent evaluations to study reliability across seven leading multimodal agents. We find that while standard reliability within a fixed app is relatively stable, reliability can vary drastically when measured across app variations. Task success rates for many agents can fluctuate by more than $50\%$ across app variations. For example, Kimi-VL-3B's average success across all tasks fluctuates from $63\%$ to just $4\%$ across app versions. We also find agent behaviors such as looping or hallucinating actions can differ drastically depending on the environment configuration. These initial findings highlight the importance of measuring reliability along this new dimension of app variations. OpenApps is available at https://facebookresearch.github.io/OpenApps/

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）经常产生不正确或过时的内容，如何在不进行昂贵重新训练的情况下高效准确地更新其知识是一个主要挑战。

Method: RILKE通过在模型的表示空间中进行干预，利用表示空间的表达能力，学习具有抗改写和编辑局部化的模块，以最小化跨编辑干扰。在推理时，查询自适应路由器选择适当的模块来指导模型生成。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen模型的知识编辑基准测试中，RILKE能够扩展到大规模数据集，表现出高编辑成功率、强大的改写泛化能力，并以适度的内存开销保持通用实用性。

Conclusion: RILKE是一种有效且可扩展的解决方案，适用于大型语言模型中的终身知识控制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce incorrect or outdated content. Updating their knowledge efficiently and accurately without costly retraining is a major challenge. This problem is especially hard for complex, unstructured knowledge in a lifelong setting, where many edits must coexist without interference. We introduce RILKE (Representation Intervention for Lifelong KnowledgE Control), a robust and scalable method that treats knowledge control as interventions within the model's representation space. Leveraging representation-space expressiveness, we identify two properties enabling RILKE to deliver fine-grained control over complex, unstructured knowledge while maintaining general utility with frozen base weights. During training, RILKE learns paraphrase-robust and edit-localized modules that limit each update to a low-dimensional subspace to minimize cross-edit interference. In inference, a query-adaptive router selects the appropriate module to guide the model's generation. In evaluation on knowledge editing benchmarks with LLaMA and Qwen models, RILKE is scalable to large-scale datasets, demonstrating high edit success, strong paraphrase generalization, and preserving general utility with modest memory overhead. These results show RILKE is an effective and scalable solution for lifelong knowledge control in LLMs.

Abstract: While neurons are the basic units of deep neural networks, it is still unclear what they learn and if their knowledge is aligned with that of humans. Compositional explanations aim to answer this question by describing the spatial alignment between neuron activations and concepts through logical rules. These logical descriptions are typically computed via a search over all possible concept combinations. Since computing the spatial alignment over the entire state space is computationally infeasible, the literature commonly adopts beam search to restrict the space. However, beam search cannot provide any theoretical guarantees of optimality, and it remains unclear how close current explanations are to the true optimum. In this theoretical paper, we address this gap by introducing the first framework for computing guaranteed optimal compositional explanations. Specifically, we propose: (i) a decomposition that identifies the factors influencing the spatial alignment, (ii) a heuristic to estimate the alignment at any stage of the search, and (iii) the first algorithm that can compute optimal compositional explanations within a feasible time. Using this framework, we analyze the differences between optimal and non-optimal explanations in the most popular settings for compositional explanations, the computer vision domain and Convolutional Neural Networks. In these settings, we demonstrate that 10-40 percent of explanations obtained with beam search are suboptimal when overlapping concepts are involved. Finally, we evaluate a beam-search variant guided by our proposed decomposition and heuristic, showing that it matches or improves runtime over prior methods while offering greater flexibility in hyperparameters and computational resources.

Conclusion: ENACT benchmark揭示了前沿视觉语言模型（VLMs）与人类在具身认知能力上的差距，尤其是在长交互时间下的表现差异，并发现模型存在人类中心偏见。

Abstract: Embodied cognition argues that intelligence arises from sensorimotor interaction rather than passive observation. It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了结合符号约束的生成模型（Ivy）在教育领域的可扩展性，显著提升了AI生成解释的教学价值。

Abstract: In procedural skill learning, instructional explanations must convey not just steps, but the causal, goal-directed, and compositional logic behind them. Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent yet shallow responses that miss this structure. We present Ivy, an AI coaching system that delivers structured, multi-step explanations by combining symbolic Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) models with a generative interpretation layer-an LLM that constructs explanations while being constrained by TMK structure. TMK encodes causal transitions, goal hierarchies, and problem decompositions, and guides the LLM within explicit structural bounds. We evaluate Ivy against responses against GPT and retrieval-augmented GPT baselines using expert and independent annotations across three inferential dimensions. Results show that symbolic constraints consistently improve the structural quality of explanations for "how" and "why" questions. This study demonstrates a scalable AI for education approach that strengthens the pedagogical value of AI-generated explanations in intelligent coaching systems.

Motivation: 现有RLVR方法存在粗粒度奖励、奖励噪声和低效探索等问题，导致训练不稳定和熵崩溃。

Method: ICPO通过比较同一输入提示下多个响应的生成概率，计算偏好优势分数，并将其与可验证奖励结合，以指导探索过程。

Result: ICPO不仅缓解了粗粒度奖励和奖励噪声问题，还有效抑制了过度自信错误，提升了低估高质量响应的相对优势，防止模型过拟合特定策略。

Conclusion: ICPO方法通过结合偏好优势分数和可验证奖励，显著提升了LLM的推理能力，并在多个基准测试中表现优于GRPO。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies, thereby facilitating more thorough exploration. Comprehensive experiments across four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that ICPO steadily boosts reasoning compared to GRPO.

Conclusion: L4M框架成功地将自然语言的解释灵活性与符号验证的严谨性相结合，提供了透明且可解释的法律裁决，超越了现有LLM和Legal AI基准的表现。

Abstract: The rationality of law manifests in two forms: substantive rationality, which concerns the fairness or moral desirability of outcomes, and formal rationality, which requires legal decisions to follow explicitly stated, general, and logically coherent rules. Existing LLM-based systems excel at surface-level text analysis but lack the guarantees required for principled jurisprudence. We introduce L4M, a novel framework that combines adversarial LLM agents with SMT-solver-backed proofs to unite the interpretive flexibility of natural language with the rigor of symbolic verification. The pipeline consists of three phases: (1) Statute Formalization, where domain-specific prompts convert legal provisions into logical formulae; (2) Dual Fact and Statute Extraction, in which prosecutor- and defense-aligned LLMs independently map case narratives to fact tuples and statutes, ensuring role isolation; and (3) Solver-Centric Adjudication, where an autoformalizer compiles both parties' arguments into logic constraints, and unsat cores trigger iterative self-critique until a satisfiable formula is achieved, which is then verbalized by a Judge-LLM into a transparent verdict and optimized sentence. Experimental results on public benchmarks show that our system surpasses advanced LLMs including GPT-o4-mini, DeepSeek-V3, and Claude 4 as well as state-of-the-art Legal AI baselines, while providing rigorous and explainable symbolic justifications.

TL;DR: OVOD-Agent通过主动视觉推理和Bandit探索优化开放词汇目标检测，显著提升稀有类别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理时仍受限于固定类别名称，未能充分利用多模态训练的潜力，文本空间探索不足。

Method: 提出OVOD-Agent框架，结合Visual-CoT和w-MDP建模视觉上下文转换，并利用Bandit模块生成探索信号，优化Reward Model。

Result: 在COCO和LVIS数据集上的实验表明，OVOD-Agent在不同骨干网络上均能带来一致性能提升。

Conclusion: OVOD-Agent通过主动视觉推理和自我进化检测，显著提升了开放词汇目标检测的性能，尤其在稀有类别上表现突出。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) aims to enable detectors to generalize across categories by leveraging semantic information. Although existing methods are pretrained on large vision-language datasets, their inference is still limited to fixed category names, creating a gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference. Previous work has shown that improving textual representation can significantly enhance OVOD performance, indicating that the textual space is still underexplored. To this end, we propose OVOD-Agent, which transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm, OVOD-Agent extends the textual optimization process into an interpretable Visual-CoT with explicit actions. OVOD's lightweight nature makes LLM-based management unsuitable; instead, we model visual context transitions as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP) over eight state spaces, which naturally represents the agent's state, memory, and interaction dynamics. A Bandit module generates exploration signals under limited supervision, helping the agent focus on uncertain regions and adapt its detection policy. We further integrate Markov transition matrices with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model (RM) optimization, forming a closed loop from Bandit exploration to RM learning. Experiments on COCO and LVIS show that OVOD-Agent provides consistent improvements across OVOD backbones, particularly on rare categories, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展因果定义的适用范围，使其能够处理更复杂的逻辑表达式，并深入理解因果模型的特性。

Method: 从Halpern和Pearl的因果定义中提取关键特征，使其适用于任何定义反事实的模型。

Result: 成功抽象化因果定义，使其适用于包含回溯、逻辑运算（如析取、否定）、信念及嵌套反事实的模型，并扩展至解释的定义。

Conclusion: 通过抽象化Halpern和Pearl的因果定义，我们不仅能够将其应用于更广泛的模型，还能深入理解因果模型中的定义特性。

Abstract: Perhaps the most prominent current definition of (actual) causality is due to Halpern and Pearl.  It is defined using causal models (also known as structural equations models).  We abstract the definition, extracting its key features, so that it can be applied to any other model where counterfactuals are defined. By abstracting the definition, we gain a number of benefits. Not only can we apply the definition in a wider range of models, including ones that allow, for example, backtracking, but we can apply the definition to determine if A is a cause of B  even if A and B are formulas involving disjunctions, negations, beliefs, and nested counterfactuals (none of which can be handled by the Halpern-Pearl definition). Moreover, we can extend the ideas to getting an abstract definition of explanation that can be applied beyond causal models. Finally, we gain a deeper understanding of features of the definition  even in causal models.

TL;DR: Prune4Web通过程序化剪枝DOM结构，显著提升网页自动化效率与精确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有LLM-based网页代理在处理复杂网页时因DOM结构过大导致的信息丢失或效率低下的问题。

Method: 引入DOM Tree Pruning Programming，利用LLM生成可执行的Python评分脚本，动态过滤DOM元素，并结合专门的数据标注管道和两轮对话训练策略。

Result: 在低级别接地任务中，准确率从46.8%提升至88.28%，候选元素减少25至50倍。

Conclusion: Prune4Web通过将DOM处理从资源密集型的LLM读取转移到高效的程序化剪枝，显著提升了网页自动化任务的精确性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Web automation employs intelligent agents to execute high-level tasks by mimicking human interactions with web interfaces. Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on our low-level grounding task, Prune4Web dramatically improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, underscoring its efficacy in real-world web automation.

Conclusion: ChatDRex通过其多代理系统和自然语言接口，使非计算机科学背景的医师和研究人员能够轻松访问复杂的生物信息学分析，从而加速药物再利用的发现，推动个性化医疗和转化研究。

Abstract: Repurposing approved drugs offers a time-efficient and cost-effective alternative to traditional drug development. However, in silico prediction of repurposing candidates is challenging and requires the effective collaboration of specialists in various fields, including pharmacology, medicine, biology, and bioinformatics. Fragmented, specialized algorithms and tools often address only narrow aspects of the overall problem, and heterogeneous, unstructured data landscapes require specialized users to be involved. Hence, these data services do not integrate smoothly across workflows. With ChatDRex, we present a conversation-based, multi-agent system that facilitates the execution of complex bioinformatic analyses aiming for network-based drug repurposing prediction. It builds on the integrated systems medicine knowledge graph NeDRex. ChatDRex provides natural language access to its extensive biomedical KG and integrates bioinformatics agents for network analysis and drug repurposing, complemented by agents for functional coherence evaluation for in silico validation, as well as agents for literature mining and for discussing the obtained results in a scientific context. Its flexible multi-agent design assigns specific tasks to specialized agents, including query routing, data retrieval, algorithm execution, and result visualization. A dedicated reasoning module keeps the user in the loop and allows for hallucination detection. By enabling physicians and researchers without computer science expertise to control complex analyses in natural language, ChatDRex democratizes access to bioinformatics as an important resource for drug repurposing. It enables clinical experts to generate hypotheses and explore drug repurposing opportunities, ultimately accelerating the discovery of novel therapies and advancing personalized medicine and translational research.

Abstract: Extreme weather events pose escalating risks to global society, underscoring the urgent need to unravel their underlying physical mechanisms. Yet the prevailing expert-driven, labor-intensive diagnostic paradigm has created a critical analytical bottleneck, stalling scientific progress. While AI for Earth Science has achieved notable advances in prediction, the equally essential challenge of automated diagnostic reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present the Extreme Weather Expert (EWE), the first intelligent agent framework dedicated to this task. EWE emulates expert workflows through knowledge-guided planning, closed-loop reasoning, and a domain-tailored meteorological toolkit. It autonomously produces and interprets multimodal visualizations from raw meteorological data, enabling comprehensive diagnostic analyses. To catalyze progress, we introduce the first benchmark for this emerging field, comprising a curated dataset of 103 high-impact events and a novel step-wise evaluation metric. EWE marks a step toward automated scientific discovery and offers the potential to democratize expertise and intellectual resources, particularly for developing nations vulnerable to extreme weather.

Method: 提出了MADRA框架，利用多智能体辩论和关键评估器进行风险评分，结合层次认知协作规划框架整合安全、记忆、规划和自进化机制。

Result: 在AI2-THOR和VirtualHome上的实验显示，MADRA能拒绝90%以上的不安全任务且安全任务拒绝率低，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MADRA框架通过多智能体辩论和层次认知协作规划，显著提升了具身AI代理的安全性和任务执行效率，为构建可信赖的代理提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of embodied AI agents during task planning is critical for real-world deployment, especially in household environments where dangerous instructions pose significant risks. Existing methods often suffer from either high computational costs due to preference alignment training or over-rejection when using single-agent safety prompts. To address these limitations, we propose MADRA, a training-free Multi-Agent Debate Risk Assessment framework that leverages collective reasoning to enhance safety awareness without sacrificing task performance. MADRA employs multiple LLM-based agents to debate the safety of a given instruction, guided by a critical evaluator that scores responses based on logical soundness, risk identification, evidence quality, and clarity. Through iterative deliberation and consensus voting, MADRA significantly reduces false rejections while maintaining high sensitivity to dangerous tasks. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical cognitive collaborative planning framework that integrates safety, memory, planning, and self-evolution mechanisms to improve task success rates through continuous learning. We also contribute SafeAware-VH, a benchmark dataset for safety-aware task planning in VirtualHome, containing 800 annotated instructions. Extensive experiments on AI2-THOR and VirtualHome demonstrate that our approach achieves over 90% rejection of unsafe tasks while ensuring that safe-task rejection is low, outperforming existing methods in both safety and execution efficiency. Our work provides a scalable, model-agnostic solution for building trustworthy embodied agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准过于简化空间认知，无法捕捉其层级结构和相互依赖性，需系统性框架评估MLLMs的空间推理能力。

Method: 提出层级空间认知框架，将空间智能分解为五个渐进复杂层次，并构建包含15个任务的SpatialBench基准，引入能力导向的统一评估指标。

Result: 实验显示MLLMs在感知层面表现强，但在符号推理、因果推断和规划上受限；人类测试表明MLLMs过度关注表面细节而缺乏连贯空间意图。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个系统化的层级空间认知框架，并构建了SpatialBench基准，揭示了MLLMs在空间认知上的局限性，为未来空间智能系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Spatial cognition is fundamental to real-world multimodal intelligence, allowing models to effectively interact with the physical environment. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides, existing benchmarks often oversimplify spatial cognition, reducing it to a single-dimensional metric, which fails to capture the hierarchical structure and interdependence of spatial abilities. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical spatial cognition framework that decomposes spatial intelligence into five progressively complex levels from basic observation to high-level planning. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct SpatialBench, a large-scale, fine-grained benchmark covering 15 tasks aligned with these cognitive levels. To provide a unified evaluation across heterogeneous tasks, we further introduce a high-level capability-oriented metric that reliably assesses a model's overall spatial reasoning ability. Extensive experiments over massive MLLMs reveal distinct performance stratification across cognitive levels: models exhibit strong perceptual grounding yet remain limited in symbolic reasoning, causal inference, and planning. Additional human tests demonstrate that humans perform selective, goal-directed abstraction, while MLLMs tend to over-attend to surface details without coherent spatial intent. Our work establishes the first systematic framework for measuring hierarchical spatial cognition in MLLMs, laying the foundation for future spatially intelligent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证性能的关键限制在于错误检测能力，因此希望通过悲观验证提升数学问题的验证效果。

Method: 设计了悲观验证的多个变体，通过为同一证明构建多个并行验证流程，若任一流程报告错误则判定证明错误。

Result: 该方法显著提升了多个数学验证基准的表现，且未消耗大量计算资源，其标记效率甚至超过了扩展的长链思维测试时间缩放。

Conclusion: 悲观验证的研究有助于提升语言模型在广泛任务中的数学能力。

Abstract: The key limitation of the verification performance lies in the ability of error detection. With this intuition we designed several variants of pessimistic verification, which are simple workflows that could significantly improve the verification of open-ended math questions. In pessimistic verification we construct multiple parallel verifications for the same proof, and the proof is deemed incorrect if any one of them reports an error. This simple technique significantly improves the performance across many math verification benchmarks without incurring substantial computational resources. Its token efficiency even surpassed extended long-CoT in test-time scaling. Our case studies further indicate that the majority of false negatives in stronger models are actually caused by annotation errors in the original dataset, so our method's performance is in fact underestimated. Self-verification for mathematical problems can effectively improve the reliability and performance of language model outputs, and it also plays a critical role in enabling long-horizon mathematical tasks. We believe that research on pessimistic verification will help enhance the mathematical capabilities of language models across a wide range of tasks.

Motivation: 探讨语言模型在专家语境中无法可靠披露其AI身份时，用户对其能力边界的信任问题。

Method: 采用共同花园设计，对16个开放权重模型（4B--671B参数）进行了19,200次试验审计。

Result: 模型在不同领域表现出显著的不一致性（如金融顾问角色初始披露率为30.8%，而神经外科医生仅为3.5%），且模型身份比参数数量更能预测行为（ΔR² = 0.359 vs 0.018）。推理优化在某些模型中会主动抑制自我透明度（推理变体的披露率比基础模型低48.4%）。

Conclusion: 研究发现，透明度更多反映训练因素而非模型规模，组织不能假设安全属性会自动迁移到部署环境，需通过有意识的行为设计和实证验证来确保。

Abstract: If a language model cannot reliably disclose its AI identity in expert contexts, users cannot trust its competence boundaries. This study examines self-transparency in models assigned professional personas within high-stakes domains where false expertise risks user harm. Using a common-garden design, sixteen open-weight models (4B--671B parameters) were audited across 19,200 trials. Models exhibited sharp domain-specific inconsistency: a Financial Advisor persona elicited 30.8% disclosure initially, while a Neurosurgeon persona elicited only 3.5%. This creates preconditions for a "Reverse Gell-Mann Amnesia" effect, where transparency in some domains leads users to overgeneralize trust to contexts where disclosure fails. Disclosure ranged from 2.8% to 73.6%, with a 14B model reaching 61.4% while a 70B produced just 4.1%. Model identity predicted behavior better than parameter count ($ΔR_{adj}^{2} = 0.359$ vs 0.018). Reasoning optimization actively suppressed self-transparency in some models, with reasoning variants showing up to 48.4% lower disclosure than base counterparts. Bayesian validation with Rogan--Gladen correction confirmed robustness to measurement error ($κ= 0.908$). These findings demonstrate transparency reflects training factors rather than scale. Organizations cannot assume safety properties transfer to deployment contexts, requiring deliberate behavior design and empirical verification.

Abstract: In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and complex global challenges, responsible foresight has emerged as an essential framework for policymakers aiming to navigate future uncertainties and shape the future. Responsible foresight entails the ethical anticipation of emerging opportunities and risks, with a focus on fostering proactive, sustainable, and accountable future design. This paper coins the term "responsible computational foresight", examining the role of human-centric artificial intelligence and computational modeling in advancing responsible foresight, establishing a set of foundational principles for this new field and presenting a suite of AI-driven foresight tools currently shaping it. AI, particularly in conjunction with simulations and scenario analysis, enhances policymakers' ability to address uncertainty, evaluate risks, and devise strategies geared toward sustainable, resilient futures. However, responsible foresight extends beyond mere technical forecasting; it demands a nuanced understanding of the interdependencies within social, environmental, economic and political systems, alongside a commitment to ethical, long-term decision-making that supports human intelligence. We argue that AI will play a role as a supportive tool in responsible, human-centered foresight, complementing rather than substituting policymaker judgment to enable the proactive shaping of resilient and ethically sound futures. This paper advocates for the thoughtful integration of AI into foresight practices to empower policymakers and communities as they confront the grand challenges of the 21st century.

Method: 研究通过8-puzzle任务直接测试四种模型在不同提示条件（零样本、思维链、算法思维）和分层纠正反馈下的表现，并使用外部移动验证器进一步分析。

Result: 反馈对某些模型-提示组合有提升效果，但成功运行通常耗时且间接。即使有外部验证器提供有效移动，模型仍无法解决任何谜题，主要缺陷为脆弱的状态表示和弱的启发式规划。

Conclusion: 当前大型语言模型在规划和状态推理方面存在显著限制，需要外部工具或机制来维护显式状态和执行结构化搜索。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results on many benchmarks, yet their capacity for planning and stateful reasoning remains unclear. We study these abilities directly, without code execution or other tools, using the 8-puzzle: a classic task that requires state tracking and goal-directed planning while allowing precise, step-by-step evaluation. Four models are tested under common prompting conditions (Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Algorithm-of-Thought) and with tiered corrective feedback. Feedback improves success rates for some model-prompt combinations, but many successful runs are long, computationally expensive, and indirect. We then examine the models with an external move validator that provides only valid moves. Despite this level of assistance, none of the models solve any puzzles in this setting. Qualitative analysis reveals two dominant deficits across all models: (1) brittle internal state representations, leading to frequent invalid moves, and (2) weak heuristic planning, with models entering loops or selecting actions that do not reduce the distance to the goal state. These findings indicate that, in the absence of external tools such as code interpreters, current LLMs have substantial limitations in planning and that further progress may require mechanisms for maintaining explicit state and performing structured search.

Abstract: AI/ML models have rapidly gained prominence as innovations for solving previously unsolved problems and their unintended consequences from amplifying human biases. Advocates for responsible AI/ML have sought ways to draw on the richer causal models of system dynamics to better inform the development of responsible AI/ML. However, a major barrier to advancing this work is the difficulty of bringing together methods rooted in different underlying assumptions (i.e., Dana Meadow's "the unavoidable a priori"). This paper brings system dynamics and structural equation modeling together into a common mathematical framework that can be used to generate systems from distributions, develop methods, and compare results to inform the underlying epistemology of system dynamics for data science and AI/ML applications.

Motivation: 现有基于轨迹的记忆方法存在简短性偏差，且仅记录单模态行为轨迹，无法保留视觉注意与逻辑推理的协同作用，与人类认知的多模态整合特性不符。

Method: ViLoMem采用双流记忆框架，分别编码视觉干扰模式和逻辑推理错误，遵循“增长与精炼”原则逐步积累和更新多模态语义知识。

Result: 在六个多模态基准测试中，ViLoMem显著提高了pass@1准确率，并大幅减少了重复的视觉和逻辑错误。

Conclusion: ViLoMem框架通过双流记忆机制有效提升了MLLMs在多模态任务中的表现，减少了重复错误，并验证了错误感知多模态记忆在终身学习中的价值。

Abstract: MLLMs exhibit strong reasoning on isolated queries, yet they operate de novo -- solving each problem independently and often repeating the same mistakes. Existing memory-augmented agents mainly store past trajectories for reuse. However, trajectory-based memory suffers from brevity bias, gradually losing essential domain knowledge. More critically, even in truly multimodal problem-solving settings, it records only a single-modality trace of past behavior, failing to preserve how visual attention and logical reasoning jointly contributed to the solution. This is fundamentally misaligned with human cognition: semantic memory is both multimodal and integrated, preserving visual and abstract knowledge through coordinated but distinct representational streams. We thus introduce ViLoMem, a dual-stream memory framework that constructs compact, schema-based memory. It separately encodes visual distraction patterns and logical reasoning errors, enabling MLLMs to learn from their successful and failed experiences. Following a grow-and-refine principle, the system incrementally accumulates and updates multimodal semantic knowledge -- preserving stable, generalizable strategies while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Across six multimodal benchmarks, ViLoMem consistently improves pass@1 accuracy and substantially reduces repeated visual and logical errors. Ablations confirm the necessity of dual-stream memory with explicit distraction--hallucination separation, demonstrating the value of error-aware multimodal memory for lifelong and cross-domain agentic learning.

Abstract: Efficient and scalable 3D surface reconstruction from range data remains a core challenge in computer graphics and vision, particularly in real-time and resource-constrained scenarios. Traditional volumetric methods based on fixed-resolution voxel grids or hierarchical structures like octrees often suffer from memory inefficiency, computational overhead, and a lack of GPU support. We propose a novel variance-adaptive, multi-resolution voxel grid that dynamically adjusts voxel size based on the local variance of signed distance field (SDF) observations. Unlike prior multi-resolution approaches that rely on recursive octree structures, our method leverages a flat spatial hash table to store all voxel blocks, supporting constant-time access and full GPU parallelism. This design enables high memory efficiency and real-time scalability. We further demonstrate how our representation supports GPU-accelerated rendering through a parallel quad-tree structure for Gaussian Splatting, enabling effective control over splat density. Our open-source CUDA/C++ implementation achieves up to 13x speedup and 4x lower memory usage compared to fixed-resolution baselines, while maintaining on par results in terms of reconstruction accuracy, offering a practical and extensible solution for high-performance 3D reconstruction.

### [166] [Exploiting Low Scanwidth to Resolve Soft Polytomies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20771)
*Sebastian Bruchhold,Mathias Weller*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对低扫描宽度系统发育网络的高效软树包容算法，解决了传统树包容问题中的假阴性问题。

Result: 算法在扫描宽度较低的情况下表现出更高的效率，解决了软树包容问题。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种解决软树包容问题的算法，该算法在实践中的系统发育网络上具有较低的扫描宽度时更为高效。

Abstract: Phylogenetic networks allow modeling reticulate evolution, capturing events such as hybridization and horizontal gene transfer. A fundamental computational problem in this context is the Tree Containment problem, which asks whether a given phylogenetic network is compatible with a given phylogenetic tree. However, the classical statement of the problem is not robust to poorly supported branches in biological data, possibly leading to false negatives. In an effort to address this, a relaxed version that accounts for uncertainty, called Soft Tree Containment, has been introduced by Bentert, Malík, and Weller [SWAT'18]. We present an algorithm that solves Soft Tree Containment in $2^{O(Δ_T \cdot k \cdot \log(k))} \cdot n^{O(1)}$ time, where $k = \operatorname{sw}(Γ) + Δ_N$, with $Δ_T$ and $Δ_N$ denoting the maximum out-degrees in the tree and the network, respectively, and $\operatorname{sw}(Γ)$ denoting the ``scanwidth'' [Berry, Scornavacca, and Weller, SOFSEM'20] of a given tree extension of the network, while $n$ is the input size. Our approach leverages the fact that phylogenetic networks encountered in practice often exhibit low scanwidth, making the problem more tractable.

Conclusion: 我们首次提出了一个O(n² + m)时间复杂度的算法，用于计算最大权重的(k, ℓ)-稀疏子图，解决了之前算法分析中的错误，并验证了这一时间复杂度的可行性。

Abstract: The family of $(k, \ell)$-sparse graphs, introduced by Lorea, plays a central role in combinatorial optimization and has a wide range of applications, particularly in rigidity theory. A key algorithmic challenge is to compute a maximum-weight $(k, \ell)$-sparse subgraph of a given edge-weighted graph. Although prior approaches have long provided an $O(nm)$-time solution, a previously proposed $O(n^2 + m)$ method was based on an incorrect analysis, leaving open whether this bound is achievable.
  We answer this question affirmatively by presenting the first $O(n^2 + m)$-time algorithm for computing a maximum-weight $(k, \ell)$-sparse subgraph, which combines an efficient data structure with a refined analysis. This quadratic-time algorithm enables faster solutions to key problems in rigidity theory, including computing minimum-weight redundantly rigid and globally rigid subgraphs. Further applications include enumerating non-crossing minimally rigid frameworks and recognizing kinematic joints. Our implementation of the proposed algorithm is publicly available online.

TL;DR: 该论文首次实现了在亚线性时间内计算PSD Hankel矩阵的低秩近似，匹配了理论误差界限并具有鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PSD Hankel矩阵在低秩近似中的重要性及其在理论和应用中的广泛需求，促使研究者开发更高效的算法。

Method: 通过结构保持的存在性证明和基于采样的方法，利用Vandermonde矩阵的通用岭杠杆得分界限，实现了亚线性时间的算法。

Result: 论文展示了在亚线性时间内计算低秩Hankel矩阵的能力，并证明了其误差界限和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种在亚线性时间内计算PSD Hankel矩阵低秩近似的新算法，该算法不仅匹配了Beckermann和Townsend的误差界限，还具有鲁棒性，能够处理非Hankel噪声矩阵。

Abstract: Hankel matrices are an important class of highly-structured matrices, arising across computational mathematics, engineering, and theoretical computer science. It is well-known that positive semidefinite (PSD) Hankel matrices are always approximately low-rank. In particular, a celebrated result of Beckermann and Townsend shows that, for any PSD Hankel matrix $H \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ and any $ε> 0$, letting $H_k$ be the best rank-$k$ approximation of $H$, $\|H-H_k\|_F \leq ε\|H\|_F$ for $k = O(\log n \log(1/ε))$. As such, PSD Hankel matrices are natural targets for low-rank approximation algorithms. We give the first such algorithm that runs in \emph{sublinear time}. In particular, we show how to compute, in $\polylog(n, 1/ε)$ time, a factored representation of a rank-$O(\log n \log(1/ε))$ Hankel matrix $\widehat{H}$ matching the error guarantee of Beckermann and Townsend up to constant factors. We further show that our algorithm is \emph{robust} -- given input $H+E$ where $E \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is an arbitrary non-Hankel noise matrix, we obtain error $\|H - \widehat{H}\|_F \leq O(\|E\|_F) + ε\|H\|_F$. Towards this algorithmic result, our first contribution is a \emph{structure-preserving} existence result - we show that there exists a rank-$k$ \emph{Hankel} approximation to $H$ matching the error bound of Beckermann and Townsend. Our result can be interpreted as a finite-dimensional analog of the widely applicable AAK theorem, which shows that the optimal low-rank approximation of an infinite Hankel operator is itself Hankel. Armed with our existence result, and leveraging the well-known Vandermonde structure of Hankel matrices, we achieve our sublinear time algorithm using a sampling-based approach that relies on universal ridge leverage score bounds for Vandermonde matrices.

Motivation: 随着云存储平台在学术和商业领域的普及，可靠性成为关键需求，尤其是对寻求替代公共云服务的组织而言，评估这些系统的可靠性至关重要。

Method: 使用随机Petri网（SPNs）建模方法，评估了四种架构配置（基线、主机级冗余、虚拟机冗余及两者结合）对Nextcloud文件服务器可用性的影响。

Result: 结果表明，主机和虚拟机级别的冗余显著提高了可用性并减少了预期停机时间。

Conclusion: 通过主机和虚拟机级别的冗余策略，私有云环境中的文件服务器可用性显著提升，为基础设施设计决策提供了评估方法。

Abstract: Cloud-based storage platforms are becoming more common in both academic and business settings due to their flexible access to data and support for collaborative functionalities. As reliability becomes a vital requirement, particularly for organizations looking for alternatives to public cloud services, assessing the dependability of these systems is crucial. This paper presents a methodology for analyzing the availability of a file server (Nextcloud) hosted in a private cloud environment using Apache CloudStack. The analysis is based on a modeling approach through Stochastic Petri Nets (SPNs) that allows the evaluation of different redundancy strategies to enhance the availability of such systems. Four architectural configurations were modeled, including the baseline, host-level redundancy, virtual machine (VM) redundancy, and a combination of both. The results show that redundancy at both the host and VM levels significantly improves availability and reduces expected downtime. The proposed approach provides a method to evaluate the availability of a private cloud and support infrastructure design decisions.

Motivation: 现有的稀疏卷积引擎未能充分利用体素坐标的关键特性，导致预处理和后处理开销高，影响了性能。

Method: Spira提出了一种高性能的一次性搜索算法、有效的打包本地处理方案、灵活的双数据流执行机制以及网络级并行化策略。

Conclusion: Spira是一种针对GPU设计的首个基于体素特性的稀疏卷积引擎，通过利用体素坐标的整数性、空间范围有限性和几何连续性，显著提升了稀疏卷积的性能。

Abstract: Sparse Convolution (SpC) powers 3D point cloud networks widely used in autonomous driving and AR/VR. SpC builds a kernel map that stores mappings between input voxel coordinates, output coordinates, and weight offsets, then uses this map to compute feature vectors for output coordinates. Our work identifies three key properties of voxel coordinates: they are integer-valued, bounded within a limited spatial range, and geometrically continuous-neighboring voxels on the same object surface are highly likely to exist at small spatial offsets from each other. Prior SpC engines do not fully exploit these properties and suffer from high pre-processing and post-processing overheads during kernel map construction. To address this, we design Spira, the first voxel-property-aware SpC engine for GPUs. Spira proposes: (i) a high-performance one-shot search algorithm that builds the kernel map with no preprocessing and high memory locality, (ii) an effective packed-native processing scheme that accesses packed voxel coordinates at low cost, (iii) a flexible dual-dataflow execution mechanism that efficiently computes output feature vectors by adapting to layer characteristics, and (iv) a network-wide parallelization strategy that builds kernel maps for all SpC layers concurrently at network start. Our evaluation shows that Spira significantly outperforms prior SpC engines by 1.71x on average and up to 2.31x for end-to-end inference, and by 2.13x on average and up to 3.32x for layer-wise execution across diverse layer configurations.

TL;DR: Aragog通过动态配置调整，显著提升工作流服务的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在请求执行前固定配置，无法适应工作流执行中的系统负载快速变化，导致配置迅速过时。

Method: Aragog将配置选择问题分解为一次性路由步骤和每个阶段的廉价调度器，并引入新策略加速这两个部分。

Result: Aragog在多样化工作流和模型家族中，将最大服务吞吐量提高了50.0--217.0%，并将峰值请求率下的中位延迟降低了32.5--78.9%。

Conclusion: Aragog通过动态调整配置，显著提高了工作流服务的吞吐量和降低了延迟，同时保持了高准确性。

Abstract: Agentic workflows have emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving complex, multi-stage tasks, but serving them at scale is computationally expensive given the many LLM inferences that each request must pass through. Configuration selection, or the cost-aware assignment of workflow agents to specific LLMs, can reduce these costs, but existing approaches bind configuration decisions before request execution, making them ill-suited for the heterogeneous and lengthy execution of workflows. Specifically, system loads can fluctuate rapidly and substantially during a request's lifetime, causing fixed configurations to quickly become suboptimal. We present Aragog, a system that progressively adapts a request's configuration throughout its execution to match runtime dynamics. To make this practical despite the massive space of workflow configurations, Aragog decouples the problem into two core elements -- a one-time routing step that identifies all accuracy-preserving configurations, and a cheap per-stage scheduler that selects among them using up-to-date system observations -- and introduces novel strategies to accelerate each. Across diverse workflows and model families, Aragog increases maximum serving throughput by 50.0--217.0\% and reduces median latency by 32.5--78.9\% at peak request rates, while maintaining accuracy comparable to the most expensive configurations.

TL;DR: DOPD动态调整LLM推理中的预填充与解码实例比例，显著提升性能并降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决LLM工作负载的异构性导致的预填充与解码实例间的生产者-消费者不平衡问题。

Method: 提出了DOPD（动态最优预填充/解码）系统，通过实时负载监控动态调整预填充与解码实例的比例，并结合适当的请求调度策略。

Result: 相比vLLM和DistServe，DOPD将系统吞吐量提升至1.5倍，P90 TTFT降低67.5%，P90 TPOT降低22.8%。

Conclusion: DOPD通过动态调整实例分配和请求调度策略，显著提高了系统吞吐量，降低了延迟，并在高并发下实现了超过99%的SLO达标率。

Abstract: To meet strict Service-Level Objectives (SLOs),contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) decouple the prefill and decoding stages and place them on separate GPUs to mitigate the distinct bottlenecks inherent to each phase. However, the heterogeneity of LLM workloads causes producerconsumer imbalance between the two instance types in such disaggregated architecture. To address this problem, we propose DOPD (Dynamic Optimal Prefill/Decoding), a dynamic LLM inference system that adjusts instance allocations to achieve an optimal prefill-to-decoding (P/D) ratio based on real-time load monitoring. Combined with an appropriate request-scheduling policy, DOPD effectively resolves imbalances between prefill and decoding instances and mitigates resource allocation mismatches due to mixed-length requests under high concurrency. Experimental evaluations show that, compared with vLLM and DistServe (representative aggregation-based and disaggregationbased approaches), DOPD improves overall system goodput by up to 1.5X, decreases P90 time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 67.5%, and decreases P90 time-per-output-token (TPOT) by up to 22.8%. Furthermore, our dynamic P/D adjustment technique performs proactive reconfiguration based on historical load, achieving over 99% SLOs attainment while using less additional resources.

Conclusion: 该论文通过集成DMA引擎和ARM SMMU的页错误处理机制，提出了一种硬件-软件结合的解决方案，有效解决了传统RDMA技术中的页错误问题，并展示了其在性能和内存利用率上的优势。

Abstract: Nowadays, avoiding system calls during cluster communication (e.g., in Data Centers and High Performance Computing) in modern high-speed interconnection networks has become a necessity, due to the high overhead of multiple data copies between kernel and user space. User-level zero-copy Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) technologies address this problem by improving performance and reducing system energy consumption. However, traditional RDMA engines cannot tolerate page faults and therefore use various techniques to avoid them.
  State-of-the-art RDMA approaches typically rely on pinning address spaces or multiple pages per application. This method introduces long-term disadvantages due to increased programming complexity (pinning and unpinning buffers), limits on how much memory can be pinned, and inefficient memory utilization. In addition, pinning does not fully prevent page faults because modern operating systems apply internal optimization mechanisms, such as Transparent Huge Pages (THP), which are enabled by default in Linux.
  This thesis implements a page-fault handling mechanism integrated with the DMA engine of the ExaNeSt project. Faults are detected by the ARM System Memory Management Unit (SMMU) and resolved through a hardware-software solution that can request retransmission when needed. This mechanism required modifications to the Linux SMMU driver, the development of a new software library, changes to the DMA engine hardware, and adjustments to the DMA scheduling logic. Experiments were conducted on the Quad-FPGA Daughter Board (QFDB) of ExaNeSt, which uses Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs.
  Finally, we evaluate our mechanism and compare it against alternatives such as pinning and pre-faulting, and discuss the advantages of our approach.

In this paper, we propose our solution that serves LLMs by integrating vLLM, Slurm and Kubernetes on the supercomputer \textit{RAMSES}. The initial benchmark indicates that the proposed architecture scales efficiently for 100, 500 and 1000 concurrent requests, incurring only an overhead of approximately 500 ms in terms of end-to-end latency.

Conclusion: MemFine通过其内存感知的细粒度调度框架，有效解决了大规模MoE模型训练中的内存瓶颈问题，显著降低了激活内存并提高了吞吐量，使得在内存受限的GPU上稳定训练成为可能。

Abstract: The training of large-scale Mixture of Experts (MoE) models faces a critical memory bottleneck due to severe load imbalance caused by dynamic token routing. This imbalance leads to memory overflow on GPUs with limited capacity, constraining model scalability. Existing load balancing methods, which cap expert capacity, compromise model accuracy and fail on memory-constrained hardware. To address this, we propose MemFine, a memory-aware fine-grained scheduling framework for MoE training. MemFine decomposes the token distribution and expert computation into manageable chunks and employs a chunked recomputation strategy, dynamically optimized through a theoretical memory model to balance memory efficiency and throughput. Experiments demonstrate that MemFine reduces activation memory by 48.03% and improves throughput by 4.42% compared to full recomputation-based baselines, enabling stable large-scale MoE training on memory-limited GPUs.

Motivation: 解决MLFMA中P2P算子因内存局部性差在GPU上的性能瓶颈问题。

Method: 引入数据冗余以改善空间局部性，并通过基于局部性度量的分析模型验证结果。

Result: 内核速度提升高达7倍，但数据重构开销限制了端到端应用速度提升至1.04倍。

Conclusion: 数据冗余可以提升GPU上P2P算子的性能，但需确保局部性收益超过数据移动开销。

Abstract: The near-field (P2P) operator in the Multilevel Fast Multipole Algorithm (MLFMA) is a performance bottleneck on GPUs due to poor memory locality. This work introduces data redundancy to improve spatial locality by reducing memory access dispersion. For validation of results, we propose an analytical model based on a Locality metric that combines data volume and access dispersion to predict speedup trends without hardware-specific profiling. The approach is validated on two MLFMA-based applications: an electromagnetic solver (DBIM-MLFMA) with regular structure, and a stellar dynamics code (PhotoNs-2.0) with irregular particle distribution. Results show up to 7X kernel speedup due to improved cache behavior. However, increased data volume raises overheads in data restructuring, limiting end-to-end application speedup to 1.04X. While the model cannot precisely predict absolute speedups, it reliably captures performance trends across different problem sizes and densities. The technique is injectable into existing implementations with minimal code changes. This work demonstrates that data redundancy can enhance GPU performance for P2P operator, provided locality gains outweigh data movement costs.

Method: 提出了 Scaling Plane 二维模型和 DIAGONALSCALE 算法，通过联合水平与垂直调整来优化数据库配置。

Result: 实验表明，对角线扩展相比单一扩展方式，能显著降低延迟、查询成本和重新平衡次数。

Conclusion: 现代云数据库的扩展模型需要多维视角，而不仅仅是水平或垂直扩展。Scaling Plane 和 DIAGONALSCALE 算法为云数据库系统提供了下一代自动扩展的基础。

Abstract: Modern cloud databases present scaling as a binary decision: scale-out by adding nodes or scale-up by increasing per-node resources. This one-dimensional view is limiting because database performance, cost, and coordination overhead emerge from the joint interaction of horizontal elasticity and per-node CPU, memory, network bandwidth, and storage IOPS. As a result, systems often overreact to load spikes, underreact to memory pressure, or oscillate between suboptimal states. We introduce the Scaling Plane, a two-dimensional model in which each distributed database configuration is represented as a point (H, V), with H denoting node count and V a vector of resources. Over this plane, we define smooth approximations of latency, throughput, coordination overhead, and monetary cost, providing a unified view of performance trade-offs. We show analytically and empirically that optimal scaling trajectories frequently lie along diagonal paths: sequences of joint horizontal and vertical adjustments that simultaneously exploit cluster parallelism and per-node improvements. To compute such actions, we propose DIAGONALSCALE, a discrete local-search algorithm that evaluates horizontal, vertical, and diagonal moves in the Scaling Plane and selects the configuration minimizing a multi-objective function subject to SLA constraints. Using synthetic surfaces, microbenchmarks, and experiments on distributed SQL and KV systems, we demonstrate that diagonal scaling reduces p95 latency by up to 40 percent, lowers cost-per-query by up to 37 percent, and reduces rebalancing by 2 to 5 times compared to horizontal-only and vertical-only autoscaling. Our results highlight the need for multi-dimensional scaling models and provide a foundation for next-generation autoscaling in cloud database systems.

Abstract: AI/ML model cards can contain a benchmarked evaluation of an AI/ML model against intended use but a one time assessment during model training does not get at how and where a model is actually used over its lifetime. Through Patra Model Cards embedded in the ICICLE AI Institute software ecosystem we study model cards as dynamic objects. The study reported here assesses the benefits and tradeoffs of adopting the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as an interface to the Patra Model Card server. Quantitative assessment shows the overhead of MCP as compared to a REST interface. The core question however is of active sessions enabled by MCP; this is a qualitative question of fit and use in the context of dynamic model cards that we address as well.

Conclusion: OVAL-Grasp在零样本开放词汇任务导向抓取中表现出色，尤其在处理遮挡和视觉特征依赖场景时，展现了其模块化设计的优势。

Abstract: To manipulate objects in novel, unstructured environments, robots need task-oriented grasps that target object parts based on the given task. Geometry-based methods often struggle with visually defined parts, occlusions, and unseen objects. We introduce OVAL-Grasp, a zero-shot open-vocabulary approach to task-oriented, affordance based grasping that uses large-language models and vision-language models to allow a robot to grasp objects at the correct part according to a given task. Given an RGB image and a task, OVAL-Grasp identifies parts to grasp or avoid with an LLM, segments them with a VLM, and generates a 2D heatmap of actionable regions on the object. During our evaluations, we found that our method outperformed two task oriented grasping baselines on experiments with 20 household objects with 3 unique tasks for each. OVAL-Grasp successfully identifies and segments the correct object part 95% of the time and grasps the correct actionable area 78.3% of the time in real-world experiments with the Fetch mobile manipulator. Additionally, OVAL-Grasp finds correct object parts under partial occlusions, demonstrating a part selection success rate of 80% in cluttered scenes. We also demonstrate OVAL-Grasp's efficacy in scenarios that rely on visual features for part selection, and show the benefit of a modular design through our ablation experiments.

Abstract: Teleoperation systems are essential for efficiently collecting diverse and high-quality robot demonstration data, especially for complex, contact-rich tasks. However, current teleoperation platforms typically lack integrated force feedback, cross-embodiment generalization, and portable, user-friendly designs, limiting their practical deployment. To address these limitations, we introduce ACE-F, a cross embodiment foldable teleoperation system with integrated force feedback. Our approach leverages inverse kinematics (IK) combined with a carefully designed human-robot interface (HRI), enabling users to capture precise and high-quality demonstrations effortlessly. We further propose a generalized soft-controller pipeline integrating PD control and inverse dynamics to ensure robot safety and precise motion control across diverse robotic embodiments. Critically, to achieve cross-embodiment generalization of force feedback without additional sensors, we innovatively interpret end-effector positional deviations as virtual force signals, which enhance data collection and enable applications in imitation learning. Extensive teleoperation experiments confirm that ACE-F significantly simplifies the control of various robot embodiments, making dexterous manipulation tasks as intuitive as operating a computer mouse.

Conclusion: 论文提出了两种快速且内存高效的特征选择算法，旨在实时评估视觉特征的效用，从而在计算效率和定位精度之间取得有利的权衡。

Abstract: Robot localization is a fundamental component of autonomous navigation in unknown environments. Among various sensing modalities, visual input from cameras plays a central role, enabling robots to estimate their position by tracking point features across image frames. However, image frames often contain a large number of features, many of which are redundant or uninformative for localization. Processing all features can introduce significant computational latency and inefficiency. This motivates the need for intelligent feature selection, identifying a subset of features that are most informative for localization over a prediction horizon. In this work, we propose two fast and memory-efficient feature selection algorithms that enable robots to actively evaluate the utility of visual features in real time. Unlike existing approaches with high computational and memory demands, the proposed methods are explicitly designed to reduce both time and memory complexity while achieving a favorable trade-off between computational efficiency and localization accuracy.

Abstract: Diffusion- and flow-based policies deliver state-of-the-art performance on long-horizon robotic manipulation and imitation learning tasks. However, these controllers employ a fixed inference budget at every control step, regardless of task complexity, leading to computational inefficiency for simple subtasks while potentially underperforming on challenging ones. To address these issues, we introduce Difficulty-Aware Stochastic Interpolant Policy (DA-SIP), a framework that enables robotic controllers to adaptively adjust their integration horizon in real time based on task difficulty. Our approach employs a difficulty classifier that analyzes observations to dynamically select the step budget, the optimal solver variant, and ODE/SDE integration at each control cycle. DA-SIP builds upon the stochastic interpolant formulation to provide a unified framework that unlocks diverse training and inference configurations for diffusion- and flow-based policies. Through comprehensive benchmarks across diverse manipulation tasks, DA-SIP achieves 2.6-4.4x reduction in total computation time while maintaining task success rates comparable to fixed maximum-computation baselines. By implementing adaptive computation within this framework, DA-SIP transforms generative robot controllers into efficient, task-aware systems that intelligently allocate inference resources where they provide the greatest benefit.

Conclusion: AerialMind和HETrack的引入填补了无人机场景中RMOT研究的空白，验证了数据集的挑战性和方法的有效性。

Abstract: Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) aims to achieve precise object detection and tracking through natural language instructions, representing a fundamental capability for intelligent robotic systems. However, current RMOT research remains mostly confined to ground-level scenarios, which constrains their ability to capture broad-scale scene contexts and perform comprehensive tracking and path planning. In contrast, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) leverage their expansive aerial perspectives and superior maneuverability to enable wide-area surveillance. Moreover, UAVs have emerged as critical platforms for Embodied Intelligence, which has given rise to an unprecedented demand for intelligent aerial systems capable of natural language interaction. To this end, we introduce AerialMind, the first large-scale RMOT benchmark in UAV scenarios, which aims to bridge this research gap. To facilitate its construction, we develop an innovative semi-automated collaborative agent-based labeling assistant (COALA) framework that significantly reduces labor costs while maintaining annotation quality. Furthermore, we propose HawkEyeTrack (HETrack), a novel method that collaboratively enhances vision-language representation learning and improves the perception of UAV scenarios. Comprehensive experiments validated the challenging nature of our dataset and the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于轻量级RL的VIO方法，通过智能控制VO管道运行和自适应状态融合，实现了高效、低内存占用且高精度的运动估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VIO方法在滤波和优化之间存在效率与精度的权衡，优化方法虽准确但计算负担重。论文旨在减少视觉-惯性束调整（VIBA）的调用频率和强度。

Method: 通过轻量级强化学习（RL）代理，设计了双管齐下的策略：选择代理（Select Agent）基于IMU数据智能控制VO管道的运行，融合代理（Fusion Agent）则结合监督网络和RL策略自适应融合状态。

Result: 在EuRoC MAV和TUM-VI数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性、效率和内存使用上优于现有GPU-based VO/VIO系统，运行速度提升1.77倍且GPU内存占用更低。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的方法在视觉-惯性里程计（VIO）中实现了更高的效率和更低的计算负载，同时保持了与传统优化方法相当的轨迹精度。

Abstract: Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) is a critical component for robust ego-motion estimation, enabling foundational capabilities such as autonomous navigation in robotics and real-time 6-DoF tracking for augmented reality. Existing methods face a well-known trade-off: filter-based approaches are efficient but prone to drift, while optimization-based methods, though accurate, rely on computationally prohibitive Visual-Inertial Bundle Adjustment (VIBA) that is difficult to run on resource-constrained platforms. Rather than removing VIBA altogether, we aim to reduce how often and how heavily it must be invoked. To this end, we cast two key design choices in modern VIO, when to run the visual frontend and how strongly to trust its output, as sequential decision problems, and solve them with lightweight reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Our framework introduces a lightweight, dual-pronged RL policy that serves as our core contribution: (1) a Select Agent intelligently gates the entire VO pipeline based only on high-frequency IMU data; and (2) a composite Fusion Agent that first estimates a robust velocity state via a supervised network, before an RL policy adaptively fuses the full (p, v, q) state. Experiments on the EuRoC MAV and TUM-VI datasets show that, in our unified evaluation, the proposed method achieves a more favorable accuracy-efficiency-memory trade-off than prior GPU-based VO/VIO systems: it attains the best average ATE while running up to 1.77 times faster and using less GPU memory. Compared to classical optimization-based VIO systems, our approach maintains competitive trajectory accuracy while substantially reducing computational load.

Abstract: Embodied navigation that adheres to social norms remains an open research challenge. Our \textbf{SocialNav} is a foundational model for socially-aware navigation with a hierarchical "brain-action" architecture, capable of understanding high-level social norms and generating low-level, socially compliant trajectories. To enable such dual capabilities, we construct the SocNav Dataset, a large-scale collection of 7 million samples, comprising (1) a Cognitive Activation Dataset providing social reasoning signals such as chain-of-thought explanations and social traversability prediction, and (2) an Expert Trajectories Pyramid aggregating diverse navigation demonstrations from internet videos, simulated environments, and real-world robots. A multi-stage training pipeline is proposed to gradually inject and refine navigation intelligence: we first inject general navigation skills and social norms understanding into the model via imitation learning, and then refine such skills through a deliberately designed Socially-Aware Flow Exploration GRPO (SAFE-GRPO), the first flow-based reinforcement learning framework for embodied navigation that explicitly rewards socially compliant behaviors. SocialNav achieves +38% success rate and +46% social compliance rate compared to the state-of-the-art method, demonstrating strong gains in both navigation performance and social compliance.

Abstract: Non-contact manipulation has emerged as a transformative approach across various industrial fields. However, current flexible 2D and 3D non-contact manipulation techniques are often limited to microscopic scales, typically controlling objects in the milligram range. In this paper, we present a magnetic levitation system, termed Maglev-Pentabot, designed to address this limitation. The Maglev-Pentabot leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to develop complex control strategies for manipulating objects in the gram range. Specifically, we propose an electromagnet arrangement optimized through numerical analysis to maximize controllable space. Additionally, an action remapping method is introduced to address sample sparsity issues caused by the strong nonlinearity in magnetic field intensity, hence allowing the DRL controller to converge. Experimental results demonstrate flexible manipulation capabilities, and notably, our system can generalize to transport tasks it has not been explicitly trained for. Furthermore, our approach can be scaled to manipulate heavier objects using larger electromagnets, offering a reference framework for industrial-scale robotic applications.

We also provide an extensive and diverse 3D asset library with a total of 1100+ supermarket goods and parameterized facilities assets. Building on this generative foundation, we propose a novel benchmark for assessing supermarket agents, featuring two daily tasks in a supermarket: (1) Checkout Unloading: long-horizon tabletop tasks for cashier agents, and (2) In-Aisle Item Collection: complex mobile manipulation tasks for salesperson agents. We validate our platform and benchmark through extensive experiments, including the deployment of a modular agent system and successful sim-to-real transfer. MarketGen provides a comprehensive framework to accelerate research in embodied AI for complex commercial applications.

Abstract: Humanoid robots, with their human-like morphology, hold great potential for industrial applications. However, existing loco-manipulation methods primarily focus on dexterous manipulation, falling short of the combined requirements for dexterity and proactive force interaction in high-load industrial scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework with a decoupled three-stage training pipeline, consisting of an upper-body policy, a lower-body policy, and a delta-command policy. To accelerate upper-body training, a heuristic reward function is designed. By implicitly embedding forward kinematics priors, it enables the policy to converge faster and achieve superior performance. For the lower body, a force-based curriculum learning strategy is developed, enabling the robot to actively exert and regulate interaction forces with the environment.

Conclusion: 提出的双预积分方法在相对状态估计中表现出比现有技术更高的精度和鲁棒性，特别是在非线性旋转和大平台间距离的情况下。

Abstract: Relative State Estimation perform mutually localization between two mobile agents undergoing six-degree-of-freedom motion. Based on the principle of circular motion, the estimation accuracy is sensitive to nonlinear rotations of the reference platform, particularly under large inter-platform distances. This phenomenon is even obvious for linearized kinematics, because cumulative linearization errors significantly degrade precision. In virtual reality (VR) applications, this manifests as substantial positional errors in 6-DoF controller tracking during rapid rotations of the head-mounted display. The linearization errors introduce drift in the estimate and render the estimator inconsistent. In the field of odometry, IMU preintegration is proposed as a kinematic observation to enable efficient relinearization, thus mitigate linearized error. Building on this theory, we propose dual preintegration, a novel observation integrating IMU preintegration from both platforms. This method serves as kinematic constraints for consecutive relative state and supports efficient relinearization. We also perform observability analysis of the state and analytically formulate the accordingly null space. Algorithm evaluation encompasses both simulations and real-world experiments. Multiple nonlinear rotations on the reference platform are simulated to compare the precision of the proposed method with that of other state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms. The field test compares the proposed method and SOTA algorithms in the application of VR controller tracking from the perspectives of bias observability, nonlinear rotation, and background texture. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is more precise and robust than the SOTA algorithms.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to align and place a fabric piece on top of another using a dual-arm manipulator and a grayscale camera, so that their surface textures are accurately matched. We propose a novel control scheme that combines Transformer-driven visual servoing with dualarm impedance control. This approach enables the system to simultaneously control the pose of the fabric piece and place it onto the underlying one while applying tension to keep the fabric piece flat. Our transformer-based network incorporates pretrained backbones and a newly introduced Difference Extraction Attention Module (DEAM), which significantly enhances pose difference prediction accuracy. Trained entirely on synthetic images generated using rendering software, the network enables zero-shot deployment in real-world scenarios without requiring prior training on specific fabric textures. Real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed system accurately aligns fabric pieces with different textures.

Abstract: In recent years, dual-arm manipulation has become an area of strong interest in robotics, with end-to-end learning emerging as the predominant strategy for solving bimanual tasks. A critical limitation of such learning-based approaches, however, is their difficulty in generalizing to novel scenarios, especially within cluttered environments. This paper presents an alternative paradigm: a sampling-based optimization framework that utilizes a GPU-accelerated physics simulator as its world model. We demonstrate that this approach can solve complex bimanual manipulation tasks in the presence of static obstacles. Our contribution is a customized Model Predictive Path Integral Control (MPPI) algorithm, \textbf{guided by carefully designed task-specific cost functions,} that uses GPU-accelerated MuJoCo for efficiently evaluating robot-object interaction. We apply this method to solve significantly more challenging versions of tasks from the PerAct$^{2}$ benchmark, such as requiring the point-to-point transfer of a ball through an obstacle course. Furthermore, we establish that our method achieves real-time performance on commodity GPUs and facilitates successful sim-to-real transfer by leveraging unique features within MuJoCo. The paper concludes with a statistical analysis of the sample complexity and robustness, quantifying the performance of our approach.

The proposed neural architecture consists of two cascaded networks: a convolutional encoder that compresses the input image into a low-dimensional latent vector, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron that approximates the corresponding spatial SDF. This latter network parametrizes an explicit position constraint used for collision avoidance, which is embedded in a velocity-tracking NMPC that outputs thrust and attitude commands to the robot. First, a theoretical analysis of the contributed NMPC is conducted, verifying recursive feasibility and stability properties under fixed observations. Subsequently, we evaluate the open-loop performance of the learning-based components as well as the closed-loop performance of the controller in simulations and experiments. The simulation study includes an ablation study, comparisons with two state-of-the-art local navigation methods, and an assessment of the resilience to drifting odometry. The real-world experiments are conducted in forest environments, demonstrating that the neural NMPC effectively performs collision avoidance in cluttered settings against an adversarial reference velocity input and drifting position estimates.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a unified framework for robotic manipulation by integrating visual perception, language understanding, and control generation. Yet existing VLA models still struggle to generalize across diverse tasks, scenes, and camera viewpoints, and often produce coarse or unstable actions. We introduce E0, a continuized discrete diffusion framework that formulates action generation as iterative denoising over quantized action tokens. Compared with continuous diffusion policies, E0 offers two key advantages: (1) discrete action tokens align naturally with the symbolic structure of pretrained VLM/VLA backbones, enabling stronger semantic conditioning; and 2. discrete diffusion matches the true quantized nature of real-world robot control-whose hardware constraints (e.g., encoder resolution, control frequency, actuation latency) inherently discretize continuous signals-and therefore benefits from a Bayes-optimal denoiser that models the correct discrete action distribution, leading to stronger generalization. Compared with discrete autoregressive and mask-based discrete diffusion models, E0 supports a significantly larger and finer-grained action vocabulary and avoids the distributional mismatch introduced by masking-based corruptions-yielding more accurate fine-grained action control. We further introduce a spherical viewpoint perturbation augmentation method to improve robustness to camera shifts without additional data. Experiments on LIBERO, VLABench, and ManiSkill show that E0 achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 diverse environments, outperforming strong baselines by 10.7% on average. Real-world evaluation on a Franka arm confirms that E0 delivers precise, robust, and transferable manipulation, establishing discrete diffusion as a promising direction for generalizable VLA policy learning.

Abstract: Vision Language Action models have significantly advanced general purpose robotic manipulation by harnessing large scale pretrained vision and language representations. Among existing approaches, a majority of current VLA systems employ parallel two finger grippers as their default end effectors. However, such grippers face inherent limitations in handling certain real world tasks such as wiping glass surfaces or opening drawers without handles due to insufficient contact area or lack of adhesion. To overcome these challenges, we present a low cost, integrated hardware design that combines a mechanical two finger gripper with a vacuum suction unit, enabling dual mode manipulation within a single end effector. Our system supports flexible switching or synergistic use of both modalities, expanding the range of feasible tasks. We validate the efficiency and practicality of our design within two state of the art VLA frameworks: DexVLA and Pi0. Experimental results demonstrate that with the proposed hybrid end effector, robots can successfully perform multiple complex tasks that are infeasible for conventional two finger grippers alone. All hardware designs and controlling systems will be released.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving models have demonstrated strong performance in open-loop evaluations but often suffer from cascading errors and poor generalization in closed-loop settings. To address this gap, we propose Model-based Policy Adaptation (MPA), a general framework that enhances the robustness and safety of pretrained E2E driving agents during deployment. MPA first generates diverse counterfactual trajectories using a geometry-consistent simulation engine, exposing the agent to scenarios beyond the original dataset. Based on this generated data, MPA trains a diffusion-based policy adapter to refine the base policy's predictions and a multi-step Q value model to evaluate long-term outcomes. At inference time, the adapter proposes multiple trajectory candidates, and the Q value model selects the one with the highest expected utility. Experiments on the nuScenes benchmark using a photorealistic closed-loop simulator demonstrate that MPA significantly improves performance across in-domain, out-of-domain, and safety-critical scenarios. We further investigate how the scale of counterfactual data and inference-time guidance strategies affect overall effectiveness.

Abstract: Quantifying the uncertainty of an object's pose estimate is essential for robust control and planning. Although pose estimation is a well-studied robotics problem, attaching statistically rigorous uncertainty is not well understood without strict distributional assumptions. We develop distribution-free pose uncertainty bounds about a given pose estimate in the monocular setting. Our pose uncertainty only requires high probability noise bounds on pixel detections of 2D semantic keypoints on a known object. This noise model induces an implicit, non-convex set of pose uncertainty constraints. Our key contribution is SLUE (S-Lemma Uncertainty Estimation), a convex program to reduce this set to a single ellipsoidal uncertainty bound that is guaranteed to contain the true object pose with high probability. SLUE solves a relaxation of the minimum volume bounding ellipsoid problem inspired by the celebrated S-lemma. It requires no initial guess of the bound's shape or size and is guaranteed to contain the true object pose with high probability. For tighter uncertainty bounds at the same confidence, we extend SLUE to a sum-of-squares relaxation hierarchy which is guaranteed to converge to the minimum volume ellipsoidal uncertainty bound for a given set of keypoint constraints. We show this pose uncertainty bound can easily be projected to independent translation and axis-angle orientation bounds. We evaluate SLUE on two pose estimation datasets and a real-world drone tracking scenario. Compared to prior work, SLUE generates substantially smaller translation bounds and competitive orientation bounds. We release code at https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/PoseUncertaintySets.

Abstract: Learning new robot tasks on new platforms and in new scenes from only a handful of demonstrations remains challenging. While videos of other embodiments - humans and different robots - are abundant, differences in embodiment, camera, and environment hinder their direct use. We address the small-data problem by introducing a unifying, symbolic representation - a compact 3D "trace-space" of scene-level trajectories - that enables learning from cross-embodiment, cross-environment, and cross-task videos. We present TraceGen, a world model that predicts future motion in trace-space rather than pixel space, abstracting away appearance while retaining the geometric structure needed for manipulation. To train TraceGen at scale, we develop TraceForge, a data pipeline that transforms heterogeneous human and robot videos into consistent 3D traces, yielding a corpus of 123K videos and 1.8M observation-trace-language triplets. Pretraining on this corpus produces a transferable 3D motion prior that adapts efficiently: with just five target robot videos, TraceGen attains 80% success across four tasks while offering 50-600x faster inference than state-of-the-art video-based world models. In the more challenging case where only five uncalibrated human demonstration videos captured on a handheld phone are available, it still reaches 67.5% success on a real robot, highlighting TraceGen's ability to adapt across embodiments without relying on object detectors or heavy pixel-space generation.
