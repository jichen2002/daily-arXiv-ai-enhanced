In this paper, we present AdaptiveClimb and its extension, DynamicAdaptiveClimb, two novel cache replacement policies that leverage lightweight, cache adaptation to outperform traditional approaches. Unlike classic Least Recently Used (LRU) and Incremental Rank Progress (CLIMB) policies, AdaptiveClimb dynamically adjusts the promotion distance (jump) of the cached objects based on recent hit and miss patterns, requiring only a single tunable parameter and no per-item statistics. This enables rapid adaptation to changing access distributions while maintaining low overhead. Building on this foundation, DynamicAdaptiveClimb further enhances adaptability by automatically tuning the cache size in response to workload demands. Our comprehensive evaluation across a diverse set of real-world traces, including 1067 traces from 6 different datasets, demonstrates that DynamicAdaptiveClimb consistently achieves substantial speedups and higher hit ratios compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, our approach achieves up to a 29% improvement in hit ratio and a substantial reduction in miss penalties compared to the FIFO baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the next-best contenders, AdaptiveClimb and SIEVE [43], by approximately 10% to 15%, especially in environments characterized by fluctuating working set sizes. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in delivering efficient performance, making it well-suited for modern, dynamic caching environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f13\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u53d8\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u73af\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7f13\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982 LRU \u548c CLIMB\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e14\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 AdaptiveClimb \u548c DynamicAdaptiveClimb \u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7f13\u5b58\u66ff\u6362\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7f13\u5b58\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u7f13\u5b58\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u8c03\u53c2\u6570\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u9010\u9879\u7edf\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728 1067 \u6761\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cDynamicAdaptiveClimb \u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe 29%\uff0c\u6bd4 FIFO \u57fa\u7ebf\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u7f3a\u5931\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5148\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd5 10%-15%\u3002", "conclusion": "DynamicAdaptiveClimb \u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7f13\u5b58\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7f3a\u5931\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u73b0\u4ee3\u9ad8\u6548\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u3002"}}

A fundamental computational problem in this context is the Tree Containment problem, which asks whether a given phylogenetic network is compatible with a given phylogenetic tree. However, the classical statement of the problem is not robust to poorly supported branches in biological data, possibly leading to false negatives. In an effort to address this, a relaxed version that accounts for uncertainty, called Soft Tree Containment, has been introduced by Bentert, Mal\u00edk, and Weller [SWAT'18]. We present an algorithm that solves Soft Tree Containment in $2^{O(\u0394_T \\cdot k \\cdot \\log(k))} \\cdot n^{O(1)}$ time, where $k = \\operatorname{sw}(\u0393) + \u0394_N$, with $\u0394_T$ and $\u0394_N$ denoting the maximum out-degrees in the tree and the network, respectively, and $\\operatorname{sw}(\u0393)$ denoting the ``scanwidth'' [Berry, Scornavacca, and Weller, SOFSEM'20] of a given tree extension of the network, while $n$ is the input size.

Project site: https://rvp-group.github.io/mrhash/", "summary": "Efficient and scalable 3D surface reconstruction from range data remains a core challenge in computer graphics and vision, particularly in real-time and resource-constrained scenarios. Traditional volumetric methods based on fixed-resolution voxel grids or hierarchical structures like octrees often suffer from memory inefficiency, computational overhead, and a lack of GPU support. We propose a novel variance-adaptive, multi-resolution voxel grid that dynamically adjusts voxel size based on the local variance of signed distance field (SDF) observations. Unlike prior multi-resolution approaches that rely on recursive octree structures, our method leverages a flat spatial hash table to store all voxel blocks, supporting constant-time access and full GPU parallelism. This design enables high memory efficiency and real-time scalability. We further demonstrate how our representation supports GPU-accelerated rendering through a parallel quad-tree structure for Gaussian Splatting, enabling effective control over splat density. Our open-source CUDA/C++ implementation achieves up to 13x speedup and 4x lower memory usage compared to fixed-resolution baselines, while maintaining on par results in terms of reconstruction accuracy, offering a practical and extensible solution for high-performance 3D reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4f53\u7d20\u7f51\u683c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u54c8\u5e0c\u8868\u548cGPU\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u65483D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4f53\u7d20\u7f51\u683c\u6216\u516b\u53c9\u6811\u7684\u4f53\u79ef\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4fGPU\u652f\u6301\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f53\u7d20\u5927\u5c0f\u8c03\u6574\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e73\u5766\u7a7a\u95f4\u54c8\u5e0c\u8868\u5b58\u50a8\u4f53\u7d20\u5757\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6052\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u8bbf\u95ee\u548c\u5168GPU\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u6e90CUDA/C++\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u6bd4\u56fa\u5b9a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u57fa\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8613\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u548c4\u500d\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4f53\u7d20\u7f51\u683c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u3002"}}

As reliability becomes a vital requirement, particularly for organizations looking for alternatives to public cloud services, assessing the dependability of these systems is crucial. This paper presents a methodology for analyzing the availability of a file server (Nextcloud) hosted in a private cloud environment using Apache CloudStack. The analysis is based on a modeling approach through Stochastic Petri Nets (SPNs) that allows the evaluation of different redundancy strategies to enhance the availability of such systems.

Presented at the 2025 International Symposium on Experimental Robotics (ISER)", "summary": "To manipulate objects in novel, unstructured environments, robots need task-oriented grasps that target object parts based on the given task. Geometry-based methods often struggle with visually defined parts, occlusions, and unseen objects. We introduce OVAL-Grasp, a zero-shot open-vocabulary approach to task-oriented, affordance based grasping that uses large-language models and vision-language models to allow a robot to grasp objects at the correct part according to a given task. Given an RGB image and a task, OVAL-Grasp identifies parts to grasp or avoid with an LLM, segments them with a VLM, and generates a 2D heatmap of actionable regions on the object. During our evaluations, we found that our method outperformed two task oriented grasping baselines on experiments with 20 household objects with 3 unique tasks for each. OVAL-Grasp successfully identifies and segments the correct object part 95% of the time and grasps the correct actionable area 78.3% of the time in real-world experiments with the Fetch mobile manipulator. Additionally, OVAL-Grasp finds correct object parts under partial occlusions, demonstrating a part selection success rate of 80% in cluttered scenes. We also demonstrate OVAL-Grasp's efficacy in scenarios that rely on visual features for part selection, and show the benefit of a modular design through our ablation experiments.

In this work, we present the Pygmalion Effect in Vision, a novel framework that metaphorically \"sculpts\" reflective objects into clay-like forms through image-to-clay translation. Inspired by the myth of Pygmalion, our method learns to suppress specular cues while preserving intrinsic geometric consistency, enabling robust reconstruction from multi-view images containing complex reflections. Specifically, we introduce a dual-branch network in which a BRDF-based reflective branch is complemented by a clay-guided branch that stabilizes geometry and refines surface normals. The two branches are trained jointly using the synthesized clay-like images, which provide a neutral, reflection-free supervision signal that complements the reflective views. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate substantial improvement in normal accuracy and mesh completeness over existing reflection-handling methods.

One of the main applications of 5G is the real-time distribution of Ultra High-Definition (UHD) content with a resolution of 4K or 8K. In Q2/2021, Advanced Info Service (AIS), the biggest operator in Thailand, launched 5G SA, providing both 5G SA/NSA service nationwide in addition to the existing LTE network. While many parts of the world are still in process of rolling out the first phase of 5G in Non-Standalone (NSA) mode, 5G SA in Thailand already covers more than 76% of the population.\n  In this paper, UHD video will be a real-time live streaming via MPEG-DASH over different mobile network technologies with minimal buffer size to provide the lowest latency. Then, performance such as the number of dropped segments, MAC throughput, and latency are evaluated in various situations such as stationary, moving in the urban area, moving at high speed, and also an ideal condition with maximum SINR. It has been found that 5G SA can deliver more than 95% of the UHD video segment successfully within the required time window in all situations, while 5G NSA produced mixed results depending on the condition of the LTE network. The result also reveals that the LTE network failed to deliver more than 20% of the video segment within the deadline, which shows that 5G SA is absolutely necessary for low-latency UHD video streaming and 5G NSA may not be good enough for such task as it relies on the legacy control signal.", "AI": {"tldr": "5G SA\u5728\u6cf0\u56fd\u5df2\u8986\u76d676%\u4eba\u53e3\uff0c\u5176\u5728UHD\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u4f20\u8f93\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8fdc\u8d855G NSA\u548cLTE\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a765G SA\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6UHD\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u4f20\u8f93\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e5G NSA\u548cLTE\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7MPEG-DASH\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u79fb\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u6280\u672f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6UHD\u89c6\u9891\u76f4\u64ad\u6d41\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e22\u5305\u7387\u3001MAC\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7b49\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "5G SA\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u6210\u529f\u4ea4\u4ed8\u8d85\u8fc795%\u7684UHD\u89c6\u9891\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u800c5G NSA\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\uff0cLTE\u7f51\u7edc\u5219\u6709\u8d85\u8fc720%\u7684\u7247\u6bb5\u672a\u80fd\u6309\u65f6\u4ea4\u4ed8\u3002", "conclusion": "5G SA\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684UHD\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u800c5G NSA\u7531\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f20\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u80dc\u4efb\u6b64\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

SpC builds a kernel map that stores mappings between input voxel coordinates, output coordinates, and weight offsets, then uses this map to compute feature vectors for output coordinates. Our work identifies three key properties of voxel coordinates: they are integer-valued, bounded within a limited spatial range, and geometrically continuous-neighboring voxels on the same object surface are highly likely to exist at small spatial offsets from each other. Prior SpC engines do not fully exploit these properties and suffer from high pre-processing and post-processing overheads during kernel map construction. To address this, we design Spira, the first voxel-property-aware SpC engine for GPUs. Spira proposes: (i) a high-performance one-shot search algorithm that builds the kernel map with no preprocessing and high memory locality, (ii) an effective packed-native processing scheme that accesses packed voxel coordinates at low cost, (iii) a flexible dual-dataflow execution mechanism that efficiently computes output feature vectors by adapting to layer characteristics, and (iv) a network-wide parallelization strategy that builds kernel maps for all SpC layers concurrently at network start. Our evaluation shows that Spira significantly outperforms prior SpC engines by 1.71x on average and up to 2.31x for end-to-end inference, and by 2.13x on average and up to 3.32x for layer-wise execution across diverse layer configurations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Spira\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578bGPU\u7a00\u758f\u5377\u79ef\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u4f53\u7d20\u5750\u6807\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u70b9\u4e91\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5377\u79ef\u5f15\u64ce\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4f53\u7d20\u5750\u6807\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u540e\u5904\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u9ad8\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "Spira\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6253\u5305\u672c\u5730\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6848\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u53cc\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u6267\u884c\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f51\u7edc\u7ea7\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "Spira\u5728\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u9010\u5c42\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u5206\u522b\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u4e861.71\u500d\u548c2.13\u500d\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u8fbe2.31\u500d\u548c3.32\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "Spira\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9GPU\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f53\u7d20\u7279\u6027\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5377\u79ef\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u4f53\u7d20\u5750\u6807\u7684\u6574\u6570\u6027\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u6709\u9650\u6027\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u5377\u79ef\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, their integration into product development remains fragmented. This fragmentation stems from uncertainty, particularly the lack of clarity on what types of DDMs to use and when to employ them across the product development lifecycle. To address this, a necessary first step is to investigate the usage of DDM in engineering design by identifying which methods are being used, at which development stages, and for what application. This paper presents a PRISMA systematic literature review. The V-model as a product development framework was adopted and simplified into four stages: system design, system implementation, system integration, and validation. A structured search across Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore (2014--2024) retrieved 1{,}689 records. After screening, 114 publications underwent full-text analysis. Findings show that machine learning (ML) and statistical methods dominate current practice, whereas deep learning (DL), though still less common, exhibits a clear upward trend in adoption. Additionally, supervised learning, clustering, regression analysis, and surrogate modeling are prevalent in design, implementation, and integration system stages but contributions to validation remain limited. Key challenges in existing applications include limited model interpretability, poor cross-stage traceability, and insufficient validation under real-world conditions. Additionally, it highlights key limitations and opportunities such as the need for interpretable hybrid models.

It is well-known that positive semidefinite (PSD) Hankel matrices are always approximately low-rank. In particular, a celebrated result of Beckermann and Townsend shows that, for any PSD Hankel matrix $H \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ and any $\u03b5> 0$, letting $H_k$ be the best rank-$k$ approximation of $H$, $\\|H-H_k\\|_F \\leq \u03b5\\|H\\|_F$ for $k = O(\\log n \\log(1/\u03b5))$. As such, PSD Hankel matrices are natural targets for low-rank approximation algorithms. We give the first such algorithm that runs in \\emph{sublinear time}. In particular, we show how to compute, in $\\polylog(n, 1/\u03b5)$ time, a factored representation of a rank-$O(\\log n \\log(1/\u03b5))$ Hankel matrix $\\widehat{H}$ matching the error guarantee of Beckermann and Townsend up to constant factors. We further show that our algorithm is \\emph{robust} -- given input $H+E$ where $E \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is an arbitrary non-Hankel noise matrix, we obtain error $\\|H - \\widehat{H}\\|_F \\leq O(\\|E\\|_F) + \u03b5\\|H\\|_F$. Towards this algorithmic result, our first contribution is a \\emph{structure-preserving} existence result - we show that there exists a rank-$k$ \\emph{Hankel} approximation to $H$ matching the error bound of Beckermann and Townsend. Our result can be interpreted as a finite-dimensional analog of the widely applicable AAK theorem, which shows that the optimal low-rank approximation of an infinite Hankel operator is itself Hankel. Armed with our existence result, and leveraging the well-known Vandermonde structure of Hankel matrices, we achieve our sublinear time algorithm using a sampling-based approach that relies on universal ridge leverage score bounds for Vandermonde matrices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u4e9a\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u8ba1\u7b97PSD Hankel\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u5339\u914d\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u9650\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "PSD Hankel\u77e9\u9635\u5728\u4f4e\u79e9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528Vandermonde\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5cad\u6760\u6746\u5f97\u5206\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e9a\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4e9a\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f4e\u79e9Hankel\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u9650\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u4e9a\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u8ba1\u7b97PSD Hankel\u77e9\u9635\u4f4e\u79e9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5339\u914d\u4e86Beckermann\u548cTownsend\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u8fd8\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u975eHankel\u566a\u58f0\u77e9\u9635\u3002"}}

Project page: https://tele-ai.github.io/CtrlVDiff/", "summary": "We tackle the dual challenges of video understanding and controllable video generation within a unified diffusion framework. Our key insights are two-fold: geometry-only cues (e.g., depth, edges) are insufficient: they specify layout but under-constrain appearance, materials, and illumination, limiting physically meaningful edits such as relighting or material swaps and often causing temporal drift. Enriching the model with additional graphics-based modalities (intrinsics and semantics) provides complementary constraints that both disambiguate understanding and enable precise, predictable control during generation.\n  However, building a single model that uses many heterogeneous cues introduces two core difficulties. Architecturally, the model must accept any subset of modalities, remain robust to missing inputs, and inject control signals without sacrificing temporal consistency. Data-wise, training demands large-scale, temporally aligned supervision that ties real videos to per-pixel multimodal annotations.\n  We then propose CtrlVDiff, a unified diffusion model trained with a Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS) that routes and fuses features from depth, normals, segmentation, edges, and graphics-based intrinsics (albedo, roughness, metallic), and re-renders videos from any chosen subset with strong temporal coherence. To enable this, we build MMVideo, a hybrid real-and-synthetic dataset aligned across modalities and captions. Across understanding and generation benchmarks, CtrlVDiff delivers superior controllability and fidelity, enabling layer-wise edits (relighting, material adjustment, object insertion) and surpassing state-of-the-art baselines while remaining robust when some modalities are unavailable.", "AI": {"tldr": "CtrlVDiff\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u548cMMVideo\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5206\u5c42\u7f16\u8f91\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\uff08\u5982\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\uff09\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u7ea6\u675f\u5916\u89c2\u3001\u6750\u8d28\u548c\u5149\u7167\uff0c\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u5f62\u7684\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u5185\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\uff09\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e92\u8865\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCtrlVDiff\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff08HMCS\uff09\u878d\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u6cd5\u7ebf\u3001\u5206\u5272\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u5f62\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u53cd\u7167\u7387\u3001\u7c97\u7cd9\u5ea6\u3001\u91d1\u5c5e\u6027\uff09\u7b49\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efaMMVideo\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u652f\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "CtrlVDiff\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5206\u5c42\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CtrlVDiff\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff08HMCS\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5206\u5c42\u7f16\u8f91\uff08\u5982\u91cd\u65b0\u7167\u660e\u3001\u6750\u8d28\u8c03\u6574\u3001\u5bf9\u8c61\u63d2\u5165\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Configuration selection, or the cost-aware assignment of workflow agents to specific LLMs, can reduce these costs, but existing approaches bind configuration decisions before request execution, making them ill-suited for the heterogeneous and lengthy execution of workflows. Specifically, system loads can fluctuate rapidly and substantially during a request's lifetime, causing fixed configurations to quickly become suboptimal. We present Aragog, a system that progressively adapts a request's configuration throughout its execution to match runtime dynamics. To make this practical despite the massive space of workflow configurations, Aragog decouples the problem into two core elements -- a one-time routing step that identifies all accuracy-preserving configurations, and a cheap per-stage scheduler that selects among them using up-to-date system observations -- and introduces novel strategies to accelerate each. Across diverse workflows and model families, Aragog increases maximum serving throughput by 50.0--217.0\\% and reduces median latency by 32.5--78.9\\% at peak request rates, while maintaining accuracy comparable to the most expensive configurations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Aragog\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u914d\u7f6e\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bf7\u6c42\u6267\u884c\u524d\u56fa\u5b9a\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u914d\u7f6e\u8fc5\u901f\u8fc7\u65f6\u3002", "method": "Aragog\u5c06\u914d\u7f6e\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u8def\u7531\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5ec9\u4ef7\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u52a0\u901f\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "result": "Aragog\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06\u6700\u5927\u670d\u52a1\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8650.0--217.0%\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5cf0\u503c\u8bf7\u6c42\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u4e2d\u4f4d\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8632.5--78.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "Aragog\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

However, current teleoperation platforms typically lack integrated force feedback, cross-embodiment generalization, and portable, user-friendly designs, limiting their practical deployment. To address these limitations, we introduce ACE-F, a cross embodiment foldable teleoperation system with integrated force feedback. Our approach leverages inverse kinematics (IK) combined with a carefully designed human-robot interface (HRI), enabling users to capture precise and high-quality demonstrations effortlessly. We further propose a generalized soft-controller pipeline integrating PD control and inverse dynamics to ensure robot safety and precise motion control across diverse robotic embodiments. Critically, to achieve cross-embodiment generalization of force feedback without additional sensors, we innovatively interpret end-effector positional deviations as virtual force signals, which enhance data collection and enable applications in imitation learning. Extensive teleoperation experiments confirm that ACE-F significantly simplifies the control of various robot embodiments, making dexterous manipulation tasks as intuitive as operating a computer mouse.

To address these threats to data confidentiality, this paper proposes a Digital Twin (DT)-driven secure access strategy. The strategy leverages a virtual replica of the physical SAGIN environment within the DT framework to continuously assess dynamic eavesdropping risks by quantifying secrecy capacity. Operating within this DT framework, an evolutionary game model dynamically balances the DT-updated secrecy capacity against queuing delay, steering IoT devices toward more secure and efficient access decisions. Furthermore, a novel distributed algorithm, integral to the DT operation, is developed to obtain the equilibrium access strategy for each device in a scalable manner. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DT-based approach substantially improves the security of SAGIN-enabled IoT networks. Additionally, it effectively balances system load, prevents overload occurrences, and decreases queuing delay compared to benchmark schemes, thereby comprehensively improving overall network performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bbf\u95ee\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u865a\u62df\u73af\u5883\u8bc4\u4f30\u7a83\u542c\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u8bbf\u95ee\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86SAGIN-enabled IoT\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728SAGIN-enabled IoT\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u7a83\u542c\u653b\u51fb\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u8bbf\u95ee\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bbf\u95ee\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5229\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6846\u67b6\u6784\u5efa\u7269\u7406SAGIN\u73af\u5883\u7684\u865a\u62df\u526f\u672c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u4fdd\u5bc6\u5bb9\u91cf\u6301\u7eed\u8bc4\u4f30\u52a8\u6001\u7a83\u542c\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8fdb\u5316\u535a\u5f08\u6a21\u578b\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u4fdd\u5bc6\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0e\u6392\u961f\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfcIoT\u8bbe\u5907\u505a\u51fa\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bbe\u5907\u83b7\u53d6\u5747\u8861\u8bbf\u95ee\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eDT\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u4e86\u8fc7\u8f7d\u53d1\u751f\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6392\u961f\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\uff08DT\uff09\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bbf\u95ee\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86SAGIN-enabled IoT\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6392\u961f\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5168\u9762\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, the heterogeneity of LLM workloads causes producerconsumer imbalance between the two instance types in such disaggregated architecture. To address this problem, we propose DOPD (Dynamic Optimal Prefill/Decoding), a dynamic LLM inference system that adjusts instance allocations to achieve an optimal prefill-to-decoding (P/D) ratio based on real-time load monitoring. Combined with an appropriate request-scheduling policy, DOPD effectively resolves imbalances between prefill and decoding instances and mitigates resource allocation mismatches due to mixed-length requests under high concurrency. Experimental evaluations show that, compared with vLLM and DistServe (representative aggregation-based and disaggregationbased approaches), DOPD improves overall system goodput by up to 1.5X, decreases P90 time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 67.5%, and decreases P90 time-per-output-token (TPOT) by up to 22.8%.

Existing models and modelling methods are viewed, and machine learning and artificial neural networks are selected for the model. The main components of the model are defined, which include a set of decision-maker preferences, decision-making tasks, sets of input data, and applied software components of the model. To support decision-making, the adaptive model applies the method of system modeling and predicting the value of the objective function at a given system configuration. Prediction is done using machine learning methods based on a dataset consisting of historical data related to existing engineering systems. The work describes the components of the redistribution of varied model parameters, which modify the model dataset based on the selected object type, which allows adapting the decision-making process to the existing program implementation goals.

Among various sensing modalities, visual input from cameras plays a central role, enabling robots to estimate their position by tracking point features across image frames. However, image frames often contain a large number of features, many of which are redundant or uninformative for localization. Processing all features can introduce significant computational latency and inefficiency. This motivates the need for intelligent feature selection, identifying a subset of features that are most informative for localization over a prediction horizon. In this work, we propose two fast and memory-efficient feature selection algorithms that enable robots to actively evaluate the utility of visual features in real time.

This paper investigates a black-box privacy attack, i.e., membership inference attack (MIA) on multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs). State-of-the-art research analyzes privacy attacks primarily to unimodal AI-ML systems, while recent studies indicate MMs can also be vulnerable to privacy attacks. While researchers have demonstrated that biologically inspired neural network representations can improve unimodal model resilience against adversarial attacks, it remains unexplored whether neuro-inspired MMs are resilient against privacy attacks. In this work, we introduce a systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework to analyze MM VLMs resilience against image-text-based inference privacy attacks. We examine this phenomenon using three VLMs: BLIP, PaliGemma 2, and ViT-GPT2, across three benchmark datasets: COCO, CC3M, and NoCaps. Our experiments compare the resilience of baseline and neuro VLMs (with topological regularization), where the tau > 0 configuration defines the NEURO variant of VLM. Our results on the BLIP model using the COCO dataset illustrate that MIA attack success in NEURO VLMs drops by 24% mean ROC-AUC, while achieving similar model utility (similarities between generated and reference captions) in terms of MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics. This shows neuro VLMs are comparatively more resilient against privacy attacks, while not significantly compromising model utility. Our extensive evaluation with PaliGemma 2 and ViT-GPT2 models, on two additional datasets: CC3M and NoCaps, further validates the consistency of the findings.

Hyperbolic learning has therefore become increasingly prominent in machine learning applications where data is hierarchically organized or governed by hierarchical semantics, ranging from recommendation systems to computer vision. The quality of hyperbolic embeddings is tightly coupled to the structure of the input hierarchy, which is often derived from knowledge graphs or ontologies. Recent work has uncovered that for an optimal hyperbolic embedding, a high branching factor and single inheritance are key, while embedding algorithms are robust to imbalance and hierarchy size. To assist knowledge engineers in reorganizing hierarchical knowledge, this paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to automatically restructure hierarchies to meet these criteria. We propose a prompt-based approach to transform existing hierarchies using LLMs, guided by known desiderata for hyperbolic embeddings. Experiments on 16 diverse hierarchies show that LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently yield higher-quality hyperbolic embeddings across several standard embedding quality metrics. Moreover, we show how LLM-guided hierarchy restructuring enables explainable reorganizations, providing justifications to knowledge engineers.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs can effectively restructure hierarchies for better hyperbolic embeddings, offering explainable improvements.", "motivation": "To investigate whether LLMs can automatically restructure hierarchies to meet the criteria (high branching factor and single inheritance) for optimal hyperbolic embeddings.", "method": "A prompt-based approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform existing hierarchies, guided by known desiderata for hyperbolic embeddings.", "result": "Experiments on 16 diverse hierarchies show improved embedding quality across several standard metrics.", "conclusion": "LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently yield higher-quality hyperbolic embeddings, and provide explainable reorganizations with justifications to knowledge engineers."}}

LatencyScope also includes a configuration optimizer that uses its mathematical models to search through hundreds of billions of configurations and find settings that meet latency-reliability targets under user constraints. We validate LatencyScope on two open-sourced 5G RAN testbeds (srsRAN and OAI), demonstrating that it can closely match empirical latency distributions and significantly outperform prior analytical models and widely used simulators (MATLAB 5G Toolbox, 5G-LENA).

The abstract and text were lightly revised in 2025 to comply with arXiv formatting guidelines", "summary": "Nowadays, avoiding system calls during cluster communication (e.g., in Data Centers and High Performance Computing) in modern high-speed interconnection networks has become a necessity, due to the high overhead of multiple data copies between kernel and user space. User-level zero-copy Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) technologies address this problem by improving performance and reducing system energy consumption. However, traditional RDMA engines cannot tolerate page faults and therefore use various techniques to avoid them.\n  State-of-the-art RDMA approaches typically rely on pinning address spaces or multiple pages per application. This method introduces long-term disadvantages due to increased programming complexity (pinning and unpinning buffers), limits on how much memory can be pinned, and inefficient memory utilization. In addition, pinning does not fully prevent page faults because modern operating systems apply internal optimization mechanisms, such as Transparent Huge Pages (THP), which are enabled by default in Linux.\n  This thesis implements a page-fault handling mechanism integrated with the DMA engine of the ExaNeSt project. Faults are detected by the ARM System Memory Management Unit (SMMU) and resolved through a hardware-software solution that can request retransmission when needed. This mechanism required modifications to the Linux SMMU driver, the development of a new software library, changes to the DMA engine hardware, and adjustments to the DMA scheduling logic. Experiments were conducted on the Quad-FPGA Daughter Board (QFDB) of ExaNeSt, which uses Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs.\n  Finally, we evaluate our mechanism and compare it against alternatives such as pinning and pre-faulting, and discuss the advantages of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u96c6\u6210DMA\u5f15\u64ce\u548cARM SMMU\u7684\u9875\u9519\u8bef\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfRDMA\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u9875\u9519\u8bef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u9ad8\u901f\u4e92\u8fde\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u7528\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u6838\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6570\u636e\u62f7\u8d1d\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u5fc5\u8981\u3002\u4f20\u7edfRDMA\u6280\u672f\u65e0\u6cd5\u5bb9\u5fcd\u9875\u9519\u8bef\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u7f16\u7a0b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0eExaNeSt\u9879\u76eeDMA\u5f15\u64ce\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u9875\u9519\u8bef\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4fee\u6539Linux SMMU\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5e93\u3001\u8c03\u6574DMA\u5f15\u64ce\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u903b\u8f91\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728ExaNeSt\u7684QFDB\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u9884\u9519\u8bef\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210DMA\u5f15\u64ce\u548cARM SMMU\u7684\u9875\u9519\u8bef\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u786c\u4ef6-\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfRDMA\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u9875\u9519\u8bef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

We conduct an empirical study to systematically evaluate their understanding of cohesion (intra-module) and coupling (inter-module). We programmatically generate poorly designed code fragments and test the DeepSeek-R1 model family ($14$B, $32$B, $70$B) under varying levels of guidance, from simple \\textit{Verification} to \\textit{Guided} and \\textit{Open-ended Generation}, while varying contextual noise by injecting distractor elements. While models exhibit a solid baseline understanding of both concepts in ideal conditions, their practical knowledge is fragile and highly asymmetrical. Reasoning about coupling proves brittle; performance collapses in noisy, open-ended scenarios, with F1 scores dropping by over $50\\%$. In contrast, the models' analysis of cohesion is remarkably robust to internal noise in guided tasks, showing little performance degradation. However, this resilience also fails when all guidance is removed. Reasoning-trace analysis confirms these failure modes, revealing \\textit{cognitive shortcutting} for coupling versus a more exhaustive (yet still failing) analysis for cohesion.

However, these controllers employ a fixed inference budget at every control step, regardless of task complexity, leading to computational inefficiency for simple subtasks while potentially underperforming on challenging ones. To address these issues, we introduce Difficulty-Aware Stochastic Interpolant Policy (DA-SIP), a framework that enables robotic controllers to adaptively adjust their integration horizon in real time based on task difficulty. Our approach employs a difficulty classifier that analyzes observations to dynamically select the step budget, the optimal solver variant, and ODE/SDE integration at each control cycle. DA-SIP builds upon the stochastic interpolant formulation to provide a unified framework that unlocks diverse training and inference configurations for diffusion- and flow-based policies. Through comprehensive benchmarks across diverse manipulation tasks, DA-SIP achieves 2.6-4.4x reduction in total computation time while maintaining task success rates comparable to fixed maximum-computation baselines.

Moreover, scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, paving the way for a new paradigm that moves beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models. A key breakthrough empowering them is the semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, which merges the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones, resulting in more coherent and stable video sequences. Crucially, it overcomes limitations of standard video diffusion by reintroducing LLM-style KV Cache management, enabling efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation.\n  Therefore, Inferix is specifically designed as a next-generation inference engine to enable immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding processes. This dedicated focus on world simulation distinctly sets it apart from systems engineered for high-concurrency scenarios (like vLLM or SGLang) and from classic video diffusion models (such as xDiTs). Inferix further enhances its offering with interactive video streaming and profiling, enabling real-time interaction and realistic simulation to accurately model world dynamics. Additionally, it supports efficient benchmarking through seamless integration of LV-Bench, a new fine-grained evaluation benchmark tailored for minute-long video generation scenarios. We hope the community will work together to advance Inferix and foster world model exploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "Inferix\u662f\u4e13\u4e3a\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u4ee3\u7406AI\u3001\u5177\u8eabAI\u548c\u6e38\u620f\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u957f\u3001\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u4e14\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u3002\u6269\u5c55\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u89e3\u9501\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f53\u524d\u4ee5LLM\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u534a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\uff08\u5757\u6269\u6563\uff09\u89e3\u7801\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5757\u5185\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u57fa\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "Inferix\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u534a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u53d8\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u4e86LV-Bench\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Inferix\u88ab\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u534a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u4e16\u754c\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u533a\u522b\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5e76\u53d1\u573a\u666f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982vLLM\u6216SGLang\uff09\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982xDiTs\uff09\u3002"}}

First, we define a taxonomy of 35 distinct AI risk factors, adapted from established frameworks by a multidisciplinary expert group to cover both universal harms and relevance to the Korean socio-cultural context. Second, leveraging this taxonomy, we construct and release AssurAI, a large-scale Korean multimodal dataset comprising 11,480 instances across text, image, video, and audio. Third, we apply the rigorous quality control process used to ensure data integrity, featuring a two-phase construction (i.e., expert-led seeding and crowdsourced scaling), triple independent annotation, and an iterative expert red-teaming loop.

In this paper, we propose our solution that serves LLMs by integrating vLLM, Slurm and Kubernetes on the supercomputer \\textit{RAMSES}. The initial benchmark indicates that the proposed architecture scales efficiently for 100, 500 and 1000 concurrent requests, incurring only an overhead of approximately 500 ms in terms of end-to-end latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3AI\u63a8\u7406\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u957f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6574\u5408vLLM\u3001Slurm\u548cKubernetes\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u8d85\u7ea7\u8ba1\u7b97\u673aRAMSES\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df\u5bf9AI\u63a8\u7406\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709HPC\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u64cd\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u540c\u6b65\u3001\u9762\u5411\u7528\u6237\u7684\u52a8\u6001AI\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408vLLM\u3001Slurm\u548cKubernetes\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u8d85\u7ea7\u8ba1\u7b97\u673aRAMSES\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884cAI\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u5728100\u3001500\u548c1000\u4e2a\u5e76\u53d1\u8bf7\u6c42\u4e0b\u5747\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u7ea6500\u6beb\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408vLLM\u3001Slurm\u548cKubernetes\u5728\u8d85\u7ea7\u8ba1\u7b97\u673aRAMSES\u4e0a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u670d\u52a1LLMs\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002"}}

Recent advances in mobile edge computing have made it possible to offload computation-intensive object detection to edge servers equipped with high-accuracy neural networks, while lightweight and fast object tracking algorithms run locally on devices. This hybrid approach offers a promising solution but introduces a new challenge: deciding when to perform edge detection versus local tracking. To address this, we formulate two long-term optimization problems for both single-device and multi-device scenarios, taking into account the temporal correlation of consecutive frames and the dynamic conditions of mobile edge networks. Based on the formulation, we propose the LTED-Ada in single-device setting, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that adaptively selects between local tracking and edge detection, according to the frame rate as well as recognition accuracy and delay requirement. In multi-device setting, we further enhance LTED-Ada using federated learning to enable collaborative policy training across devices, thereby improving its generalization to unseen frame rates and performance requirements.

However, existing methods still rely heavily on manually predefined operators, limiting generalization and scalability. To address this issue, we propose $A^2Flow$, a fully automated framework for agentic workflow generation based on self-adaptive abstraction operators. $A^2Flow$ employs a three-stage operator extraction process: 1) Case-based Initial Operator Generation: leveraging expert demonstrations and LLM reasoning to generate case-specific operators; 2) Operator Clustering and Preliminary Abstraction: grouping similar operators across tasks to form preliminary abstractions; and 3) Deep Extraction for Abstract Execution Operators: applying long chain-of-thought prompting and multi-path reasoning to derive compact and generalizable execution operators. These operators serve as reusable building blocks for workflow construction without manual predefinition.

Liu"], "title": "Lightweight Model Editing for LLMs to Correct Deprecated API Recommendations", "comment": null, "summary": "Pre-trained or fine-tuned on large code corpora, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in code completion tasks. However, their embedded knowledge is constrained by the timeliness of training data, which often includes code using deprecated APIs. Consequently, LLMs frequently generate deprecated APIs that will no longer be supported in future versions of third-party libraries. While retraining LLMs on updated codebases could refresh their API knowledge, this approach is computationally expensive. Recently, lightweight model editing methods have emerged to efficiently correct specific knowledge in LLMs. However, it remains unclear whether these methods can effectively update deprecated API knowledge and enable edited models to generate up-to-date APIs. To address this gap, we conduct the first systematic study applying 10 state-of-the-art model editing techniques to update deprecated API knowledge in three LLMs: Qwen2.5-Coder, StarCoder2, and DeepSeek-Coder. We introduce EDAPIBench, a dedicated benchmark featuring over 70 deprecated APIs from 8 popular Python libraries, with more than 3,000 editing instances. Our results show that the parameter-efficient fine-tuning method AdaLoRA achieves the best performance in enabling edited models to generate correct, up-to-date APIs, but falls short in Specificity (i.e., the editing influences untargeted knowledge). To resolve this, we propose AdaLoRA-L, which defines \"Common API Layers\" (layers within the LLMs with high importance across all APIs, storing general knowledge and excluded from editing) and restricts edits exclusively to \"Specific API Layers\" (layers with high importance only for the target API, storing the API-specific knowledge). Experimental results demonstrate that AdaLoRA-L significantly improves Specificity while maintaining comparable performance across other evaluation metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u6280\u672f\u66f4\u65b0LLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u5e9f\u5f03API\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAdaLoRA-L\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLMs\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u6548\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5e9f\u5f03API\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8610\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86EDAPIBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b70\u591a\u4e2a\u5e9f\u5f03API\u548c3000\u591a\u4e2a\u7f16\u8f91\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AdaLoRA-L\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u2018\u901a\u7528API\u5c42\u2019\u548c\u2018\u7279\u5b9aAPI\u5c42\u2019\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u7f16\u8f91\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "AdaLoRA\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u6700\u65b0API\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002AdaLoRA-L\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AdaLoRA-L\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing methods face a well-known trade-off: filter-based approaches are efficient but prone to drift, while optimization-based methods, though accurate, rely on computationally prohibitive Visual-Inertial Bundle Adjustment (VIBA) that is difficult to run on resource-constrained platforms. Rather than removing VIBA altogether, we aim to reduce how often and how heavily it must be invoked. To this end, we cast two key design choices in modern VIO, when to run the visual frontend and how strongly to trust its output, as sequential decision problems, and solve them with lightweight reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Our framework introduces a lightweight, dual-pronged RL policy that serves as our core contribution: (1) a Select Agent intelligently gates the entire VO pipeline based only on high-frequency IMU data; and (2) a composite Fusion Agent that first estimates a robust velocity state via a supervised network, before an RL policy adaptively fuses the full (p, v, q) state. Experiments on the EuRoC MAV and TUM-VI datasets show that, in our unified evaluation, the proposed method achieves a more favorable accuracy-efficiency-memory trade-off than prior GPU-based VO/VIO systems: it attains the best average ATE while running up to 1.77 times faster and using less GPU memory.

We present DeeAD, a training-free, action-guided early-exit framework that accelerates VLA planning by evaluating the physical feasibility of intermediate trajectories. Instead of relying on confidence scores, DeeAD terminates inference when predicted trajectories align with lightweight planning priors (e.g., Navigation or Low-precision Planning) within a tolerable deviation (<2m).

This work introduces data redundancy to improve spatial locality by reducing memory access dispersion. For validation of results, we propose an analytical model based on a Locality metric that combines data volume and access dispersion to predict speedup trends without hardware-specific profiling. The approach is validated on two MLFMA-based applications: an electromagnetic solver (DBIM-MLFMA) with regular structure, and a stellar dynamics code (PhotoNs-2.0) with irregular particle distribution. Results show up to 7X kernel speedup due to improved cache behavior. However, increased data volume raises overheads in data restructuring, limiting end-to-end application speedup to 1.04X. While the model cannot precisely predict absolute speedups, it reliably captures performance trends across different problem sizes and densities. The technique is injectable into existing implementations with minimal code changes. This work demonstrates that data redundancy can enhance GPU performance for P2P operator, provided locality gains outweigh data movement costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u5197\u4f59\u6539\u5584GPU\u4e0aP2P\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\uff0c\u5185\u6838\u901f\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u6574\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u901f\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3MLFMA\u4e2dP2P\u7b97\u5b50\u56e0\u5185\u5b58\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u5dee\u5728GPU\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6570\u636e\u5197\u4f59\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5185\u6838\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe7\u500d\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u6784\u5f00\u9500\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5e94\u7528\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u81f31.04\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u5197\u4f59\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347GPU\u4e0aP2P\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u786e\u4fdd\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u6536\u76ca\u8d85\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u79fb\u52a8\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

This paper presents a large-scale study of location-based Android app differentiation, uncovering two important and underexamined phenomena with security and fairness implications. First, we introduce GeoTwins: apps that are functionally similar and share branding but are released under different package names across countries. Despite their similarity, GeoTwins often diverge in requested permissions, third-party libraries, and privacy disclosures. Second, we examine the Android App Bundle ecosystem and reveal unexpected regional differences in supposedly consistent base.apk files. Contrary to common assumptions, even base.apk files vary by region, exposing hidden customizations that may affect app behavior or security.\n  These discrepancies have concrete consequences. Geographically distinct variants can lead the same app to be labeled benign in one malware study but suspicious in another, depending on the region of download. Such hidden variation undermines reproducibility and introduces geographic bias into assessments of security, privacy, and functionality. It also raises ethical concerns about transparency and consent: visually identical Google Play listings may mask subtle but important differences.\n  To study these issues, we built a distributed app collection pipeline spanning multiple regions and analyzed thousands of apps.

Our \\textbf{SocialNav} is a foundational model for socially-aware navigation with a hierarchical \"brain-action\" architecture, capable of understanding high-level social norms and generating low-level, socially compliant trajectories. To enable such dual capabilities, we construct the SocNav Dataset, a large-scale collection of 7 million samples, comprising (1) a Cognitive Activation Dataset providing social reasoning signals such as chain-of-thought explanations and social traversability prediction, and (2) an Expert Trajectories Pyramid aggregating diverse navigation demonstrations from internet videos, simulated environments, and real-world robots. A multi-stage training pipeline is proposed to gradually inject and refine navigation intelligence: we first inject general navigation skills and social norms understanding into the model via imitation learning, and then refine such skills through a deliberately designed Socially-Aware Flow Exploration GRPO (SAFE-GRPO), the first flow-based reinforcement learning framework for embodied navigation that explicitly rewards socially compliant behaviors. SocialNav achieves +38% success rate and +46% social compliance rate compared to the state-of-the-art method, demonstrating strong gains in both navigation performance and social compliance.

In this paper, we introduce Foundation Model Distillation (FMD), a new paradigm for compressing large SSL models into compact, efficient, and faithful proxies that retain their general-purpose representational power. We present Foundry, the first implementation of FMD for 3D point clouds. Our approach, Foundry, trains a student to learn a compressed set of SuperTokens that reconstruct the teacher's token-level representations, capturing a compact basis of its latent space.

This one-dimensional view is limiting because database performance, cost, and coordination overhead emerge from the joint interaction of horizontal elasticity and per-node CPU, memory, network bandwidth, and storage IOPS. As a result, systems often overreact to load spikes, underreact to memory pressure, or oscillate between suboptimal states. We introduce the Scaling Plane, a two-dimensional model in which each distributed database configuration is represented as a point (H, V), with H denoting node count and V a vector of resources. Over this plane, we define smooth approximations of latency, throughput, coordination overhead, and monetary cost, providing a unified view of performance trade-offs. We show analytically and empirically that optimal scaling trajectories frequently lie along diagonal paths: sequences of joint horizontal and vertical adjustments that simultaneously exploit cluster parallelism and per-node improvements. To compute such actions, we propose DIAGONALSCALE, a discrete local-search algorithm that evaluates horizontal, vertical, and diagonal moves in the Scaling Plane and selects the configuration minimizing a multi-objective function subject to SLA constraints. Using synthetic surfaces, microbenchmarks, and experiments on distributed SQL and KV systems, we demonstrate that diagonal scaling reduces p95 latency by up to 40 percent, lowers cost-per-query by up to 37 percent, and reduces rebalancing by 2 to 5 times compared to horizontal-only and vertical-only autoscaling. Our results highlight the need for multi-dimensional scaling models and provide a foundation for next-generation autoscaling in cloud database systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u578b Scaling Plane \u548c DIAGONALSCALE \u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0e\u5782\u76f4\u8c03\u6574\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6210\u672c\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 Scaling Plane \u4e8c\u7ef4\u6a21\u578b\u548c DIAGONALSCALE \u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0e\u5782\u76f4\u8c03\u6574\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ebf\u6269\u5c55\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u4e00\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u67e5\u8be2\u6210\u672c\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u5e73\u8861\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u591a\u7ef4\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u6c34\u5e73\u6216\u5782\u76f4\u6269\u5c55\u3002Scaling Plane \u548c DIAGONALSCALE \u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Despite the advancements in the technical characteristics of these tools, little is known about how developers mentally model them and how mismatches affect trust, control, and adoption. We conducted six co-design workshops with 58 developers to elicit their mental models about AI-assisted bug detection and readability features. It emerged that developers conceive bug detection tools as \\textit{bug detectives}, which warn users only in case of critical issues, guaranteeing transparency, actionable feedback, and confidence cues.

However, current flexible 2D and 3D non-contact manipulation techniques are often limited to microscopic scales, typically controlling objects in the milligram range. In this paper, we present a magnetic levitation system, termed Maglev-Pentabot, designed to address this limitation. The Maglev-Pentabot leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to develop complex control strategies for manipulating objects in the gram range. Specifically, we propose an electromagnet arrangement optimized through numerical analysis to maximize controllable space. Additionally, an action remapping method is introduced to address sample sparsity issues caused by the strong nonlinearity in magnetic field intensity, hence allowing the DRL controller to converge. Experimental results demonstrate flexible manipulation capabilities, and notably, our system can generalize to transport tasks it has not been explicitly trained for. Furthermore, our approach can be scaled to manipulate heavier objects using larger electromagnets, offering a reference framework for industrial-scale robotic applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Maglev-Pentabot\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7535\u78c1\u94c1\u6392\u5217\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u514b\u7ea7\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u64cd\u63a7\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u64cd\u63a7\u6280\u672f\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5fae\u89c2\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff08\u6beb\u514b\u7ea7\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u514b\u7ea7\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u64cd\u63a7\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DRL\uff09\u5f00\u53d1\u590d\u6742\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u5206\u6790\u4f18\u5316\u7535\u78c1\u94c1\u6392\u5217\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u53ef\u63a7\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u4f5c\u91cd\u6620\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u78c1\u573a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5f3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u758f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u5907\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u64cd\u63a7\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u660e\u786e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8fd0\u8f93\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd8\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u5927\u7535\u78c1\u94c1\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u66f4\u91cd\u7269\u4f53\u64cd\u63a7\u3002", "conclusion": "Maglev-Pentabot\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7535\u78c1\u94c1\u6392\u5217\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u514b\u7ea7\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u64cd\u63a7\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Our method builds on a DINOv2 model pretrained to detect synthetic images on the B-Free dataset. We add a linear classification head on top of the Vision Transformer's patch embeddings to predict manipulations at a $14\\times 14$ patch resolution. The head is trained to focus on semantically altered regions, treating non-semantic edits as part of the original content. Because the ViT accepts only fixed-size inputs, we use a sliding-window strategy to aggregate predictions over larger images; the resulting heatmaps are post-processed to refine the estimated binary manipulation masks. Empirical results show that DinoLizer surpasses state-of-the-art local manipulation detectors on a range of inpainting datasets derived from different generative models. It remains robust to common post-processing operations such as resizing, noise addition, and JPEG (double) compression. On average, DinoLizer achieves a 12\\% higher Intersection-over-Union (IoU) than the next best model, with even greater gains after post-processing. Our experiments with off-the-shelf DINOv2 demonstrate the strong representational power of Vision Transformers for this task. Finally, extensive ablation studies comparing DINOv2 and its successor, DINOv3, in deepfake localization confirm DinoLizer's superiority.

Recent advances in large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems, such as GitHub Copilot's agent mode, promise to automate complex development workflows through coordinated reasoning, code generation, and tool interaction. This paper presents the first empirical study on how state-of-the-art multi-agent systems perform in dataset adaptation tasks. We evaluate Copilot, backed by GPT-4.1 and Claude Sonnet 4, on adapting SE research artifacts from benchmark repositories including ROCODE and LogHub2.0. Through a five-stage evaluation pipeline (file comprehension, code editing, command generation, validation, and final execution), we measure success rates, analyze failure patterns, and assess prompt-based interventions designed to enhance agent performance. Results show that current systems can identify key files and generate partial adaptations but rarely produce functionally correct implementations. Prompt-level interventions, especially providing execution error messages and reference code, substantially improve structural similarity to ground truth (from 7.25% to 67.14%), highlighting the importance of contextual and feedback-driven guidance. Our findings reveal both the promise and limitations of today's multi-agent LLM systems for dataset adaptation, and suggest concrete directions for building more reliable, self-correcting agents in future SE research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u4ee3\u7406LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u90e8\u5206\u9002\u5e94\u4f46\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u5e72\u9884\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u4ef6\u7684\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u4ecd\u8f83\u5c11\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e94\u9636\u6bb5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08\u6587\u4ef6\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u7f16\u8f91\u3001\u547d\u4ee4\u751f\u6210\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u6267\u884c\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30Copilot\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u6587\u4ef6\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u5f88\u5c11\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u63d0\u793a\u7ea7\u5e72\u9884\uff08\u5982\u63d0\u4f9b\u6267\u884c\u9519\u8bef\u6d88\u606f\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u4ee3\u7801\uff09\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff08\u4ece7.25%\u63d0\u5347\u81f367.14%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u591a\u4ee3\u7406LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u6f5c\u529b\u4f46\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u8981\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u81ea\u7ea0\u6b63\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u3002"}}

Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) with tool invocation suggest these models can operate design software to edit a UI design through iteration. Understanding and enhancing this capacity is important, as it highlights VLMs' potential to collaborate with designers within conventional software. However, as no existing benchmark evaluates tool-based design performance, the capacity remains unknown. To address this, we introduce CANVAS, a benchmark for VLMs on tool-based user interface design. Our benchmark contains 598 tool-based design tasks paired with ground-truth references sampled from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 function-based categories (e.g., onboarding, messaging). In each task, a VLM updates the design step-by-step through context-based tool invocations (e.g., create a rectangle as a button background), linked to design software. Specifically, CANVAS incorporates two task types: (i) design replication evaluates the ability to reproduce a whole UI screen; (ii) design modification evaluates the ability to modify a specific part of an existing screen. Results suggest that leading models exhibit more strategic tool invocations, improving design quality.

This work presents a comprehensive analysis of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Multimodal-CoT) reasoning, evaluating its effectiveness on the A-OKVQA, OKVQA and ChartQA datasets, which requires broad commonsense and world knowledge beyond scientific reasoning. We implement the two-stage framework proposed by Zhang et al.

Through systematic ablation studies, we analyze the contributions of vision features, rationale quality, and architectural choices. Our findings reveal that while vision integration significantly reduces hallucination in rationale generation, the effectiveness of CoT reasoning varies substantially across question types, with commonsense reasoning presenting particular challenges.

Although classic automated methods effectively explore program structures, they often lack the semantic information required to produce realistic inputs and assertions. Large Language Models (LLMs) address this limitation by utilizing by leveraging their data-driven knowledge of code semantics and programming patterns. To analyze the state of the art in this domain, we conducted a systematic literature review of 115 publications published between May 2021 and August 2025. We propose a unified taxonomy based on the unit test generation lifecycle that treats LLMs as stochastic generators requiring systematic engineering constraints. This framework analyzes the literature regarding core generative strategies and a set of enhancement techniques ranging from pre-generation context enrichment to post-generation quality assurance. Our analysis reveals that prompt engineering has emerged as the dominant utilization strategy and accounts for 89% of the studies due to its flexibility. We find that iterative validation and repair loops have become the standard mechanism to ensure robust usability and lead to significant improvements in compilation and execution pass rates. However, critical challenges remain regarding the weak fault detection capabilities of generated tests and the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. We conclude with a roadmap for future research that emphasizes the progression towards autonomous testing agents and hybrid systems combining LLMs with traditional software engineering tools.

This dynamic collaboration is achieved through a cognitive workflow that enables the agents to engage in natural language dialogue, leveraging integrated memory, reflection, and tool use to ground their decisions in past experience and environmental feedback. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that our agentic framework successfully learns to adapt to diverse and dynamic network environments, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art spatial reuse baseline and validating its potential as a robust and intelligent solution for future wireless networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u7684Agentic AI Wi-Fi\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u5bc6\u96c6\u7f51\u7edc\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\u534f\u8c03\u534f\u8bae\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u5e72\u6270\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u53d8\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5b9e\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\u88ab\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\uff09\u6765\u534f\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u7f51\u7edc\u72b6\u6001\u5e76\u534f\u5546\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u534f\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u5408\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6837\u5316\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u7528\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Agentic AI Wi-Fi\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bc6\u96c6\u91cd\u53e0\u57fa\u672c\u670d\u52a1\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u667a\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Based on the principle of circular motion, the estimation accuracy is sensitive to nonlinear rotations of the reference platform, particularly under large inter-platform distances. This phenomenon is even obvious for linearized kinematics, because cumulative linearization errors significantly degrade precision. In virtual reality (VR) applications, this manifests as substantial positional errors in 6-DoF controller tracking during rapid rotations of the head-mounted display. The linearization errors introduce drift in the estimate and render the estimator inconsistent. In the field of odometry, IMU preintegration is proposed as a kinematic observation to enable efficient relinearization, thus mitigate linearized error. Building on this theory, we propose dual preintegration, a novel observation integrating IMU preintegration from both platforms. This method serves as kinematic constraints for consecutive relative state and supports efficient relinearization. We also perform observability analysis of the state and analytically formulate the accordingly null space. Algorithm evaluation encompasses both simulations and real-world experiments. Multiple nonlinear rotations on the reference platform are simulated to compare the precision of the proposed method with that of other state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms. The field test compares the proposed method and SOTA algorithms in the application of VR controller tracking from the perspectives of bias observability, nonlinear rotation, and background texture. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is more precise and robust than the SOTA algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u9884\u79ef\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e24\u4e2a\u5e73\u53f0\u7684IMU\u9884\u79ef\u5206\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u516d\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\u76f8\u5bf9\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u516d\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5bf9\u53c2\u8003\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65cb\u8f6c\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5927\u5e73\u53f0\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0b\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eIMU\u9884\u79ef\u5206\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u53cc\u9884\u79ef\u5206\u89c2\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u76f8\u5bf9\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u91cd\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53cc\u9884\u79ef\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u504f\u5dee\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u7eb9\u7406\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53cc\u9884\u79ef\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76f8\u5bf9\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u5927\u5e73\u53f0\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002"}}

Current evaluations rely on fixed environments, often clones of existing apps, which are limited in that they can only shed light on whether or how often an agent can complete a task within a specific environment. When deployed however, agents are likely to encounter variations in app design and content that can affect an agent's ability to complete a task. To address this blind spot of measuring agent reliability across app variations, we develop OpenApps, a light-weight open-source ecosystem with six apps (messenger, calendar, maps, etc.) that are configurable in appearance and content. OpenApps requires just a single CPU to run, enabling easy generation and deployment of thousands of versions of each app. Specifically, we run more than 10,000 independent evaluations to study reliability across seven leading multimodal agents. We find that while standard reliability within a fixed app is relatively stable, reliability can vary drastically when measured across app variations. Task success rates for many agents can fluctuate by more than $50\\%$ across app variations. For example, Kimi-VL-3B's average success across all tasks fluctuates from $63\\%$ to just $4\\%$ across app versions. We also find agent behaviors such as looping or hallucinating actions can differ drastically depending on the environment configuration. These initial findings highlight the importance of measuring reliability along this new dimension of app variations.

We propose a novel control scheme that combines Transformer-driven visual servoing with dualarm impedance control.

However, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, especially when processing long-form videos where evidence is sparse and temporally dispersed. Inspired by how humans comprehend long videos - by first skimming globally and then examining relevant clips for details - we introduce LongVT, an end-to-end agentic framework that enables \"Thinking with Long Videos\" via interleaved Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought. Specifically, we exploit LMMs' inherent temporal grounding ability as a native video cropping tool to zoom in on a specific video clip and resample finer-grained video frames. This global-to-local reasoning loop continues until answers are grounded in retrieved visual evidence. Given the scarcity of fine-grained question-answering (QA) data for the long video reasoning task, we curate and will release a data suite named VideoSIAH to facilitate both training and evaluation. Specifically, our training dataset consists of 247.9K samples for tool-integrated cold-start supervised fine-tuning, 1.6K samples for agentic reinforcement learning, and 15.4K samples for agentic reinforcement fine-tuning, respectively. Our evaluation benchmark consists of 1,280 QA pairs that are carefully curated through a semi-automatic data pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation. With a meticulously designed three-stage training strategy and extensive empirical validation, LongVT consistently outperforms existing strong baselines across four challenging long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks.

This problem is especially hard for complex, unstructured knowledge in a lifelong setting, where many edits must coexist without interference.

Leveraging representation-space expressiveness, we identify two properties enabling RILKE to deliver fine-grained control over complex, unstructured knowledge while maintaining general utility with frozen base weights. During training, RILKE learns paraphrase-robust and edit-localized modules that limit each update to a low-dimensional subspace to minimize cross-edit interference. In inference, a query-adaptive router selects the appropriate module to guide the model's generation. In evaluation on knowledge editing benchmarks with LLaMA and Qwen models, RILKE is scalable to large-scale datasets, demonstrating high edit success, strong paraphrase generalization, and preserving general utility with modest memory overhead.

This paper presents an alternative paradigm: a sampling-based optimization framework that utilizes a GPU-accelerated physics simulator as its world model. We demonstrate that this approach can solve complex bimanual manipulation tasks in the presence of static obstacles. Our contribution is a customized Model Predictive Path Integral Control (MPPI) algorithm, \\textbf{guided by carefully designed task-specific cost functions,} that uses GPU-accelerated MuJoCo for efficiently evaluating robot-object interaction. We apply this method to solve significantly more challenging versions of tasks from the PerAct$^{2}$ benchmark, such as requiring the point-to-point transfer of a ball through an obstacle course. Furthermore, we establish that our method achieves real-time performance on commodity GPUs and facilitates successful sim-to-real transfer by leveraging unique features within MuJoCo.

Despite its effectiveness, the original model has been developed for industrial-scale training, is computationally demanding, and is tightly connected to a large backbone. In this work, we reexamine KRISP from a different angle and offer a lightweight reproduction with significantly fewer parameters. Even though our replicated model performs about 75 % of the original, the replication process uncovers a number of design flaws, real-world pitfalls, and implicit problems that were not fully covered in the original paper. We offer insights into the scalability and efficacy of knowledge-enhanced VQA architectures under resource constraints through systematic ablation studies, which include a proof-of-concept on synthetic VQA data and evaluation on the DAQUAR dataset. Our model, configured with a low parameter setup and constrained by the external Knowledge graph domain, prevents AI hallucinations and generates outputs solely within that domain.

Gilpin"], "title": "Guaranteed Optimal Compositional Explanations for Neurons", "comment": "41 pages, 10 figures", "summary": "While neurons are the basic units of deep neural networks, it is still unclear what they learn and if their knowledge is aligned with that of humans. Compositional explanations aim to answer this question by describing the spatial alignment between neuron activations and concepts through logical rules. These logical descriptions are typically computed via a search over all possible concept combinations. Since computing the spatial alignment over the entire state space is computationally infeasible, the literature commonly adopts beam search to restrict the space. However, beam search cannot provide any theoretical guarantees of optimality, and it remains unclear how close current explanations are to the true optimum. In this theoretical paper, we address this gap by introducing the first framework for computing guaranteed optimal compositional explanations. Specifically, we propose: (i) a decomposition that identifies the factors influencing the spatial alignment, (ii) a heuristic to estimate the alignment at any stage of the search, and (iii) the first algorithm that can compute optimal compositional explanations within a feasible time. Using this framework, we analyze the differences between optimal and non-optimal explanations in the most popular settings for compositional explanations, the computer vision domain and Convolutional Neural Networks. In these settings, we demonstrate that 10-40 percent of explanations obtained with beam search are suboptimal when overlapping concepts are involved. Finally, we evaluate a beam-search variant guided by our proposed decomposition and heuristic, showing that it matches or improves runtime over prior methods while offering greater flexibility in hyperparameters and computational resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u675f\u641c\u7d2210-40%\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u662f\u6b21\u4f18\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u662f\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b66\u4e60\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ecd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u675f\u641c\u7d22\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u5f71\u54cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u3001\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4f30\u8ba1\u641c\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9996\u4e2a\u80fd\u5728\u53ef\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u548c\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a10-40%\u7684\u675f\u641c\u7d22\u89e3\u91ca\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u91cd\u53e0\u6982\u5ff5\u65f6\u662f\u6b21\u4f18\u7684\u3002\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u675f\u641c\u7d22\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u8ba1\u7b97\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6700\u4f18\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u675f\u641c\u7d22\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u91cd\u53e0\u6982\u5ff5\u65f6\uff0c10-40%\u7684\u675f\u641c\u7d22\u89e3\u91ca\u662f\u6b21\u4f18\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper we connect the various dynamic sampling methods by developing and analyzing a novel operator which generalizes existing methods, which we term \"warping\". Warping provides a minimal implementation of dynamic sampling which is amenable to analysis, and can be used to reconstruct existing architectures including deformable convolutions, active convolutional units, and spatial transformer networks. Using our formalism, we provide statistical analysis of the operator by modeling the inputs as both IID variables and homogeneous random fields. Extending this analysis, we discover a unique asymmetry between the forward and backward pass of the model training. We demonstrate that these mechanisms represent an entirely different class of orthogonal operators to the traditional translationally invariant operators defined by convolutions. With a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical investigation, we find the conditions necessary to ensure stable training of dynamic sampling networks. In addition, statistical analysis of discretization effects are studied.

It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

We leverage deep neural networks to encode a single range image, capturing all the available information about the environment, into a Signed Distance Function (SDF). The proposed neural architecture consists of two cascaded networks: a convolutional encoder that compresses the input image into a low-dimensional latent vector, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron that approximates the corresponding spatial SDF. This latter network parametrizes an explicit position constraint used for collision avoidance, which is embedded in a velocity-tracking NMPC that outputs thrust and attitude commands to the robot. First, a theoretical analysis of the contributed NMPC is conducted, verifying recursive feasibility and stability properties under fixed observations. Subsequently, we evaluate the open-loop performance of the learning-based components as well as the closed-loop performance of the controller in simulations and experiments. The simulation study includes an ablation study, comparisons with two state-of-the-art local navigation methods, and an assessment of the resilience to drifting odometry.

However, most existing NeRF frameworks require complete retraining when new views are introduced incrementally, limiting their applicability in domains where data arrives sequentially. This limitation is particularly problematic in satellite-based terrain analysis, where regions are repeatedly observed over time. Incremental refinement of NeRFs remains underexplored, and naive approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting when past data is unavailable. We propose $\u0394$-NeRF, a unique modular residual framework for incremental NeRF refinement. $\u0394$-NeRF introduces several novel techniques including: (1) a residual controller that injects per-layer corrections into a frozen base NeRF, enabling refinement without access to past data; (2) an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism that prevents overcorrection by adaptively combining base and refined predictions; and (3) a view selection strategy that reduces training data by up to 47\\% while maintaining performance. Additionally, we employ knowledge distillation to compress the enhanced model into a compact student network (20\\% of original size). Experiments on satellite imagery demonstrate that $\u0394$-NeRF achieves performance comparable to joint training while reducing training time by 30-42\\%. $\u0394$-NeRF consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving an improvement of up to 43.5\\% in PSNR over naive fine-tuning and surpassing joint training on some metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "$\u0394$-NeRF \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u589e\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u7684 NeRF \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6b8b\u5dee\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u987a\u5e8f\u5230\u8fbe\u65f6\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709 NeRF \u6846\u67b6\u5728\u589e\u91cf\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u89c6\u56fe\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u536b\u661f\u5730\u5f62\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u987a\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "$\u0394$-NeRF \u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6b8b\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c$\u0394$-NeRF \u5728\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11 30-42%\uff0cPSNR \u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe 43.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "$\u0394$-NeRF \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6b8b\u5dee\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u91cf\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86 NeRF \u5728\u6570\u636e\u987a\u5e8f\u5230\u8fbe\u65f6\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

We present Ivy, an AI coaching system that delivers structured, multi-step explanations by combining symbolic Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) models with a generative interpretation layer-an LLM that constructs explanations while being constrained by TMK structure. TMK encodes causal transitions, goal hierarchies, and problem decompositions, and guides the LLM within explicit structural bounds.

However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies, thereby facilitating more thorough exploration.

Yet existing VLA models still struggle to generalize across diverse tasks, scenes, and camera viewpoints, and often produce coarse or unstable actions. We introduce E0, a continuized discrete diffusion framework that formulates action generation as iterative denoising over quantized action tokens. Compared with continuous diffusion policies, E0 offers two key advantages: (1) discrete action tokens align naturally with the symbolic structure of pretrained VLM/VLA backbones, enabling stronger semantic conditioning; and 2. discrete diffusion matches the true quantized nature of real-world robot control-whose hardware constraints (e.g., encoder resolution, control frequency, actuation latency) inherently discretize continuous signals-and therefore benefits from a Bayes-optimal denoiser that models the correct discrete action distribution, leading to stronger generalization. Compared with discrete autoregressive and mask-based discrete diffusion models, E0 supports a significantly larger and finer-grained action vocabulary and avoids the distributional mismatch introduced by masking-based corruptions-yielding more accurate fine-grained action control. We further introduce a spherical viewpoint perturbation augmentation method to improve robustness to camera shifts without additional data.

We introduce L4M, a novel framework that combines adversarial LLM agents with SMT-solver-backed proofs to unite the interpretive flexibility of natural language with the rigor of symbolic verification.

To overcome these challenges, we present a low cost, integrated hardware design that combines a mechanical two finger gripper with a vacuum suction unit, enabling dual mode manipulation within a single end effector. Our system supports flexible switching or synergistic use of both modalities, expanding the range of feasible tasks. We validate the efficiency and practicality of our design within two state of the art VLA frameworks: DexVLA and Pi0.

Bagdanov"], "title": "Training-Free Diffusion Priors for Text-to-Image Generation via Optimization-based Visual Inversion", "comment": "11 pages, 7 figures, technical report (preprint)", "summary": "Diffusion models have established the state-of-the-art in text-to-image generation, but their performance often relies on a diffusion prior network to translate text embeddings into the visual manifold for easier decoding. These priors are computationally expensive and require extensive training on massive datasets. In this work, we challenge the necessity of a trained prior at all by employing Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI), a training-free and data-free alternative, to replace the need for a prior. OVI initializes a latent visual representation from random pseudo-tokens and iteratively optimizes it to maximize the cosine similarity with input textual prompt embedding. We further propose two novel constraints, a Mahalanobis-based and a Nearest-Neighbor loss, to regularize the OVI optimization process toward the distribution of realistic images. Our experiments, conducted on Kandinsky 2.2, show that OVI can serve as an alternative to traditional priors. More importantly, our analysis reveals a critical flaw in current evaluation benchmarks like T2I-CompBench++, where simply using the text embedding as a prior achieves surprisingly high scores, despite lower perceptual quality. Our constrained OVI methods improve visual fidelity over this baseline, with the Nearest-Neighbor approach proving particularly effective, achieving quantitative scores comparable to or higher than the state-of-the-art data-efficient prior, indicating that the idea merits further investigation.

Although existing methods are pretrained on large vision-language datasets, their inference is still limited to fixed category names, creating a gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference. Previous work has shown that improving textual representation can significantly enhance OVOD performance, indicating that the textual space is still underexplored. To this end, we propose OVOD-Agent, which transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm, OVOD-Agent extends the textual optimization process into an interpretable Visual-CoT with explicit actions. OVOD's lightweight nature makes LLM-based management unsuitable; instead, we model visual context transitions as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP) over eight state spaces, which naturally represents the agent's state, memory, and interaction dynamics. A Bandit module generates exploration signals under limited supervision, helping the agent focus on uncertain regions and adapt its detection policy. We further integrate Markov transition matrices with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model (RM) optimization, forming a closed loop from Bandit exploration to RM learning.

To address this gap, we propose Model-based Policy Adaptation (MPA), a general framework that enhances the robustness and safety of pretrained E2E driving agents during deployment. MPA first generates diverse counterfactual trajectories using a geometry-consistent simulation engine, exposing the agent to scenarios beyond the original dataset. Based on this generated data, MPA trains a diffusion-based policy adapter to refine the base policy's predictions and a multi-step Q value model to evaluate long-term outcomes. At inference time, the adapter proposes multiple trajectory candidates, and the Q value model selects the one with the highest expected utility. Experiments on the nuScenes benchmark using a photorealistic closed-loop simulator demonstrate that MPA significantly improves performance across in-domain, out-of-domain, and safety-critical scenarios.

Accurately detecting their centerlines with correct tree topology is critical for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. In these applications, maintaining high recall is crucial, as missing small branches can result in fatal mistakes caused by incomplete assessments or undetected abnormalities. We present RefTr, a 3D image-to-graph model for centerline generation of vascular trees via recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories. RefTr uses a Producer-Refiner architecture based on a Transformer decoder, where the Producer proposes a set of initial confluent trajectories that are recurrently refined by the Refiner to produce final trajectories, which forms the centerline graph. The confluent trajectory representation enables refinement of complete trajectories while explicitly enforcing a valid tree topology. The recurrent refinement scheme improves precision and reuses the same Refiner block across multiple steps, yielding a 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters compared to previous SOTA. We also introduce an efficient non-maximum suppression algorithm for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches and boost precision.

It is defined using causal models (also known as structural equations models).  We abstract the definition, extracting its key features, so that it can be applied to any other model where counterfactuals are defined. By abstracting the definition, we gain a number of benefits.

Although pose estimation is a well-studied robotics problem, attaching statistically rigorous uncertainty is not well understood without strict distributional assumptions. We develop distribution-free pose uncertainty bounds about a given pose estimate in the monocular setting. Our pose uncertainty only requires high probability noise bounds on pixel detections of 2D semantic keypoints on a known object. This noise model induces an implicit, non-convex set of pose uncertainty constraints. Our key contribution is SLUE (S-Lemma Uncertainty Estimation), a convex program to reduce this set to a single ellipsoidal uncertainty bound that is guaranteed to contain the true object pose with high probability. SLUE solves a relaxation of the minimum volume bounding ellipsoid problem inspired by the celebrated S-lemma. It requires no initial guess of the bound's shape or size and is guaranteed to contain the true object pose with high probability. For tighter uncertainty bounds at the same confidence, we extend SLUE to a sum-of-squares relaxation hierarchy which is guaranteed to converge to the minimum volume ellipsoidal uncertainty bound for a given set of keypoint constraints. We show this pose uncertainty bound can easily be projected to independent translation and axis-angle orientation bounds. We evaluate SLUE on two pose estimation datasets and a real-world drone tracking scenario. Compared to prior work, SLUE generates substantially smaller translation bounds and competitive orientation bounds.

For 9 scenes with varying scene complexity, lighting and background, images are captured with two identical camera assemblies at 10 focal lengths (28-70mm) and 5 apertures (f/2.8-f/22), spanning 50 optical configurations in 2000 images per scene. This full-range optics coverage enables controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects for monocular and stereo depth estimation, shallow depth-of-field rendering, deblurring, 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Each focal configuration has a dedicated calibration image set, supporting evaluation of classical and learning based methods for intrinsic and extrinsic calibration. The dataset features challenging visual elements such as multi-scale optical illusions, reflective surfaces, mirrors, transparent glass walls, fine-grained details, and natural / artificial ambient light variations.

Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

While videos of other embodiments - humans and different robots - are abundant, differences in embodiment, camera, and environment hinder their direct use. We address the small-data problem by introducing a unifying, symbolic representation - a compact 3D \"trace-space\" of scene-level trajectories - that enables learning from cross-embodiment, cross-environment, and cross-task videos. We present TraceGen, a world model that predicts future motion in trace-space rather than pixel space, abstracting away appearance while retaining the geometric structure needed for manipulation. To train TraceGen at scale, we develop TraceForge, a data pipeline that transforms heterogeneous human and robot videos into consistent 3D traces, yielding a corpus of 123K videos and 1.8M observation-trace-language triplets. Pretraining on this corpus produces a transferable 3D motion prior that adapts efficiently: with just five target robot videos, TraceGen attains 80% success across four tasks while offering 50-600x faster inference than state-of-the-art video-based world models. In the more challenging case where only five uncalibrated human demonstration videos captured on a handheld phone are available, it still reaches 67.5% success on a real robot, highlighting TraceGen's ability to adapt across embodiments without relying on object detectors or heavy pixel-space generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "TraceGen\u901a\u8fc73D\u8f68\u8ff9\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u8de8\u5b9e\u4f53\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8de8\u5b9e\u4f53\u89c6\u9891\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TraceGen\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b3D\u8f68\u8ff9\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u672a\u6765\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86TraceForge\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5c06\u5f02\u6784\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c6\u9891\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u76843D\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u9700\u4e94\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c6\u9891\uff0cTraceGen\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523080%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5feb50-600\u500d\uff1b\u5728\u4ec5\u4e94\u4e2a\u672a\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u89c6\u9891\u4e0b\uff0c\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e3a67.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "TraceGen\u901a\u8fc7\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u76843D\u8f68\u8ff9\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u5b9e\u4f53\u3001\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u548c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

A significant challenge in progressing the field lies in the expensive process of collecting memorability annotations from humans. This limits the diversity and scalability of datasets for modeling visual content memorability. Most existing datasets are limited to collecting aggregate memorability scores for visual content, not capturing the nuanced memorability signals present in natural, open-ended recall descriptions. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale unsupervised dataset designed explicitly for modeling visual memorability signals, containing over 82,000 videos, accompanied by descriptive recall data. We leverage tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) retrieval queries from online platforms such as Reddit. We demonstrate that our unsupervised dataset provides rich signals for two memorability-related tasks: recall generation and ToT retrieval. Large vision-language models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions for visual content. We also employ a contrastive training strategy to create the first model capable of performing multimodal ToT retrieval.

Wallace", "Sen Wang"], "title": "Estimating Fog Parameters from a Sequence of Stereo Images", "comment": null, "summary": "We propose a method which, given a sequence of stereo foggy images, estimates the parameters of a fog model and updates them dynamically. In contrast with previous approaches, which estimate the parameters sequentially and thus are prone to error propagation, our algorithm estimates all the parameters simultaneously by solving a novel optimisation problem. By assuming that fog is only locally homogeneous, our method effectively handles real-world fog, which is often globally inhomogeneous. The proposed algorithm can be easily used as an add-on module in existing visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) or odometry systems in the presence of fog. In order to assess our method, we also created a new dataset, the Stereo Driving In Real Fog (SDIRF), consisting of high-quality, consecutive stereo frames of real, foggy road scenes under a variety of visibility conditions, totalling over 40 minutes and 34k frames. As a first-of-its-kind, SDIRF contains the camera's photometric parameters calibrated in a lab environment, which is a prerequisite for correctly applying the atmospheric scattering model to foggy images. The dataset also includes the counterpart clear data of the same routes recorded in overcast weather, which is useful for companion work in image defogging and depth reconstruction. We conducted extensive experiments using both synthetic foggy data and real foggy sequences from SDIRF to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over prior methods. Our method not only produces the most accurate estimates on synthetic data, but also adapts better to real fog.

However, in silico prediction of repurposing candidates is challenging and requires the effective collaboration of specialists in various fields, including pharmacology, medicine, biology, and bioinformatics. Fragmented, specialized algorithms and tools often address only narrow aspects of the overall problem, and heterogeneous, unstructured data landscapes require specialized users to be involved. Hence, these data services do not integrate smoothly across workflows. With ChatDRex, we present a conversation-based, multi-agent system that facilitates the execution of complex bioinformatic analyses aiming for network-based drug repurposing prediction. It builds on the integrated systems medicine knowledge graph NeDRex. ChatDRex provides natural language access to its extensive biomedical KG and integrates bioinformatics agents for network analysis and drug repurposing, complemented by agents for functional coherence evaluation for in silico validation, as well as agents for literature mining and for discussing the obtained results in a scientific context. Its flexible multi-agent design assigns specific tasks to specialized agents, including query routing, data retrieval, algorithm execution, and result visualization.

To address this, we present V^2-SAM, a unified cross-view object correspondence framework that adapts SAM2 from single-view segmentation to cross-view correspondence through two complementary prompt generators. Specifically, the Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor), built upon DINOv3 features, establishes geometry-aware correspondences and, for the first time, unlocks coordinate-based prompting for SAM2 in cross-view scenarios, while the Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) enhances appearance-guided cues via a novel visual prompt matcher that aligns ego-exo representations from both feature and structural perspectives. To effectively exploit the strengths of both prompts, we further adopt a multi-expert design and introduce a Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) that adaptively selects the most reliable expert based on cyclic consistency.

However, existing methods tend to either under-optimise or over-optimise (reward hack) the target reward function. We propose Null-Text Test-Time Alignment (Null-TTA), which aligns diffusion models by optimising the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance, rather than manipulating latent or noise variables. Due to the structured semantic nature of the text embedding space, this ensures alignment occurs on a semantically coherent manifold and prevents reward hacking (exploiting non-semantic noise patterns to improve the reward). Since the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance serves as the anchor for the model's generative distribution, Null-TTA directly steers model's generative distribution towards the target reward rather than just adjusting the samples, even without updating model parameters. Thanks to these desirable properties, we show that Null-TTA achieves state-of-the-art target test-time alignment while maintaining strong cross-reward generalisation.

Existing methods often suffer from either high computational costs due to preference alignment training or over-rejection when using single-agent safety prompts. To address these limitations, we propose MADRA, a training-free Multi-Agent Debate Risk Assessment framework that leverages collective reasoning to enhance safety awareness without sacrificing task performance. MADRA employs multiple LLM-based agents to debate the safety of a given instruction, guided by a critical evaluator that scores responses based on logical soundness, risk identification, evidence quality, and clarity. Through iterative deliberation and consensus voting, MADRA significantly reduces false rejections while maintaining high sensitivity to dangerous tasks. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical cognitive collaborative planning framework that integrates safety, memory, planning, and self-evolution mechanisms to improve task success rates through continuous learning.

Popular architectures such as SIREN, WIRE, and FINER demonstrate the potential of INR for capturing fine-grained image details. However, traditional INRs often lack explicit geometric structure and have limited capabilities for local editing or integration with physical simulation, restricting their applicability in dynamic or interactive settings. To address these limitations, we propose GaINeR: Geometry-Aware Implicit Network Representation, a novel framework for 2D images that combines trainable Gaussian distributions with a neural network-based INR. For a given image coordinate, the model retrieves the K nearest Gaussians, aggregates distance-weighted embeddings, and predicts the RGB value via a neural network. This design enables continuous image representation, interpretable geometric structure, and flexible local editing, providing a foundation for physically aware and interactive image manipulation.

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides, existing benchmarks often oversimplify spatial cognition, reducing it to a single-dimensional metric, which fails to capture the hierarchical structure and interdependence of spatial abilities. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical spatial cognition framework that decomposes spatial intelligence into five progressively complex levels from basic observation to high-level planning. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct SpatialBench, a large-scale, fine-grained benchmark covering 15 tasks aligned with these cognitive levels. To provide a unified evaluation across heterogeneous tasks, we further introduce a high-level capability-oriented metric that reliably assesses a model's overall spatial reasoning ability. Extensive experiments over massive MLLMs reveal distinct performance stratification across cognitive levels: models exhibit strong perceptual grounding yet remain limited in symbolic reasoning, causal inference, and planning. Additional human tests demonstrate that humans perform selective, goal-directed abstraction, while MLLMs tend to over-attend to surface details without coherent spatial intent.

Materials and methods: In this multi-center retrospective study, T1 and T1ce of vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients were used to simulate low-dose T1ce with varying reductions of contrast agent dose. DL models were trained to restore standard-dose T1ce from the low-dose simulation. The image quality and segmentation performance of the DL-restored T1ce were evaluated. A head and neck radiologist was asked to rate DL-restored images in multiple aspects, including image quality and diagnostic characterization. Results: 203 MRI studies from 72 VS patients (mean age, 58.51 \\pm 14.73, 39 men) were evaluated. As the input dose increased, the structural similarity index measure of the restored T1ce increased from 0.639 \\pm 0.113 to 0.993 \\pm 0.009, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio increased from 21.6 \\pm 3.73 dB to 41.4 \\pm 4.84 dB. At 10% input dose, using DL-restored T1ce for segmentation improved the Dice from 0.673 to 0.734, the 95% Hausdorff distance from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and the average surface distance from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm. Both DL-restored T1ce from 10% and 30% input doses showed excellent images, with the latter being considered more informative.

With this intuition we designed several variants of pessimistic verification, which are simple workflows that could significantly improve the verification of open-ended math questions. In pessimistic verification we construct multiple parallel verifications for the same proof, and the proof is deemed incorrect if any one of them reports an error. This simple technique significantly improves the performance across many math verification benchmarks without incurring substantial computational resources. Its token efficiency even surpassed extended long-CoT in test-time scaling. Our case studies further indicate that the majority of false negatives in stronger models are actually caused by annotation errors in the original dataset, so our method's performance is in fact underestimated. Self-verification for mathematical problems can effectively improve the reliability and performance of language model outputs, and it also plays a critical role in enabling long-horizon mathematical tasks.

Our method encourages smoothness in the intermediate-layer embeddings of consecutive frames by modeling their changes as a Gaussian Random Walk (GRW). This penalizes abrupt representational shifts, thereby promoting low-acceleration solutions that better align with the natural temporal coherence inherent in videos. By leveraging this enforced smoothness, lightweight models can more effectively capture complex temporal dynamics. Applied to such models, our technique yields a 3.8% to 6.4% accuracy improvement on Kinetics-600. Notably, the MoViNets model family trained with our smooth regularization improves the current state of the art by 3.8% to 6.1% within their respective FLOP constraints, while MobileNetV3 and the MoViNets-Stream family achieve gains of 4.9% to 6.4% over prior state-of-the-art models with comparable memory footprints.

Models exhibited sharp domain-specific inconsistency: a Financial Advisor persona elicited 30.8% disclosure initially, while a Neurosurgeon persona elicited only 3.5%. This creates preconditions for a \"Reverse Gell-Mann Amnesia\" effect, where transparency in some domains leads users to overgeneralize trust to contexts where disclosure fails. Disclosure ranged from 2.8% to 73.6%, with a 14B model reaching 61.4% while a 70B produced just 4.1%. Model identity predicted behavior better than parameter count ($\u0394R_{adj}^{2} = 0.359$ vs 0.018). Reasoning optimization actively suppressed self-transparency in some models, with reasoning variants showing up to 48.4% lower disclosure than base counterparts.

The proposed framework consists of three steps: specifying arbitrary concepts, generating semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, and deriving compositional explanations from these masks. The paper compares the proposed framework with previous methods for computing compositional explanations both in terms of quantitative metrics and human interpretability, analyzes the differences in explanations when shifting from human-annotated data to model-annotated data, and showcases the additional capabilities provided by the framework in terms of flexibility of the explanations with respect to the tasks and properties of interest.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5176\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\u4e09\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a\u6307\u5b9a\u4efb\u610f\u6982\u5ff5\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ece\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63a9\u7801\u4e2d\u63a8\u5bfc\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4ece\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u5411\u6a21\u578b\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Responsible foresight entails the ethical anticipation of emerging opportunities and risks, with a focus on fostering proactive, sustainable, and accountable future design. This paper coins the term \"responsible computational foresight\", examining the role of human-centric artificial intelligence and computational modeling in advancing responsible foresight, establishing a set of foundational principles for this new field and presenting a suite of AI-driven foresight tools currently shaping it. AI, particularly in conjunction with simulations and scenario analysis, enhances policymakers' ability to address uncertainty, evaluate risks, and devise strategies geared toward sustainable, resilient futures. However, responsible foresight extends beyond mere technical forecasting; it demands a nuanced understanding of the interdependencies within social, environmental, economic and political systems, alongside a commitment to ethical, long-term decision-making that supports human intelligence. We argue that AI will play a role as a supportive tool in responsible, human-centered foresight, complementing rather than substituting policymaker judgment to enable the proactive shaping of resilient and ethically sound futures. This paper advocates for the thoughtful integration of AI into foresight practices to empower policymakers and communities as they confront the grand challenges of the 21st century.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u8ba1\u7b97\u524d\u77bb\u2019\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u5728\u652f\u6301\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u524d\u77bb\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03AI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\u800c\u975e\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6280\u672f\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u5168\u7403\u6311\u6218\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0c\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u524d\u77bb\u6210\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u5e94\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5851\u9020\u672a\u6765\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u2018\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u8ba1\u7b97\u524d\u77bb\u2019\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u524d\u77bb\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u8be5\u65b0\u9886\u57df\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5f53\u524d\u5851\u9020\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684AI\u9a71\u52a8\u524d\u77bb\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "result": "AI\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e0e\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u60c5\u666f\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u5236\u5b9a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u3001\u97e7\u6027\u672a\u6765\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3b\u5f20\u5c06\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6df1\u601d\u719f\u8651\u5730\u878d\u5165\u524d\u77bb\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u548c\u793e\u533a\u5e94\u5bf921\u4e16\u7eaa\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Manual measurement of this growth is time-consuming and often imprecise, as it is typically performed along 4 to 8 radial directions on a cross-sectional disc. In recent years, automated algorithms and datasets have emerged to enhance accuracy and automate the delineation of annual rings in cross-sectional images.\n  To address the scarcity of wood cross-section data, we introduce the UruDendro4 dataset, a collection of 102 image samples of Pinus taeda L., each manually annotated with annual growth rings. Unlike existing public datasets, UruDendro4 includes samples extracted at multiple heights along the stem, allowing for the volumetric modeling of annual growth using manually delineated rings. This dataset (images and annotations) allows the development of volumetric models for annual wood estimation based on cross-sectional imagery.\n  Additionally, we provide a performance baseline for automatic ring detection on this dataset using state-of-the-art methods. The highest performance was achieved by the DeepCS-TRD method, with a mean Average Precision of 0.838, a mean Average Recall of 0.782, and an Adapted Rand Error score of 0.084. A series of ablation experiments were conducted to empirically validate the final parameter configuration.

We study these abilities directly, without code execution or other tools, using the 8-puzzle: a classic task that requires state tracking and goal-directed planning while allowing precise, step-by-step evaluation. Four models are tested under common prompting conditions (Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Algorithm-of-Thought) and with tiered corrective feedback. Feedback improves success rates for some model-prompt combinations, but many successful runs are long, computationally expensive, and indirect. We then examine the models with an external move validator that provides only valid moves. Despite this level of assistance, none of the models solve any puzzles in this setting. Qualitative analysis reveals two dominant deficits across all models: (1) brittle internal state representations, leading to frequent invalid moves, and (2) weak heuristic planning, with models entering loops or selecting actions that do not reduce the distance to the goal state. These findings indicate that, in the absence of external tools such as code interpreters, current LLMs have substantial limitations in planning and that further progress may require mechanisms for maintaining explicit state and performing structured search.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u6216\u673a\u5236\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc78-puzzle\u4efb\u52a1\u76f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56db\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u601d\u7ef4\uff09\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u7ea0\u6b63\u53cd\u9988\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u79fb\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53cd\u9988\u5bf9\u67d0\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b-\u63d0\u793a\u7ec4\u5408\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u6210\u529f\u8fd0\u884c\u901a\u5e38\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u95f4\u63a5\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u6709\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u4f55\u8c1c\u9898\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7f3a\u9677\u4e3a\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5f31\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u6216\u673a\u5236\u6765\u7ef4\u62a4\u663e\u5f0f\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u6267\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u3002"}}

We propose BUSTR, a multitask vision-language framework that generates BUS reports without requiring paired image-report supervision. BUSTR constructs reports from structured descriptors (e.g., BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features, learns descriptor-aware visual representations with a multi-head Swin encoder trained using a multitask loss over dataset-specific descriptor sets, and aligns visual and textual tokens via a dual-level objective that combines token-level cross-entropy with a cosine-similarity alignment loss between input and output representations. We evaluate BUSTR on two public BUS datasets, BrEaST and BUS-BRA, which differ in size and available descriptors. Across both datasets, BUSTR consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics, particularly for key targets such as BI-RADS category and pathology.

This paper brings system dynamics and structural equation modeling together into a common mathematical framework that can be used to generate systems from distributions, develop methods, and compare results to inform the underlying epistemology of system dynamics for data science and AI/ML applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3AI/ML\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efbAI\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff08\u5982\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\uff09\u56e0\u57fa\u672c\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0d\u540c\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u6574\u5408\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efbAI/ML\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u5f00\u53d1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4e3aAI/ML\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u7ed3\u5408\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u5171\u540c\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u548cAI/ML\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efbAI/ML\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, in practical editing scenarios of the modern content creation landscape, many compositions are not intended to preserve realism. Instead, users of online platforms motivated by gaining community recognition often aim to create content that is more artistic, playful, or socially engaging. Taking inspiration from this observation, we define the expressive composition task, a new formulation of image composition that embraces stylistic diversity and looser placement logic, reflecting how users edit images on real-world creative platforms. To address this underexplored problem, we present StickerNet, a two-stage framework that first determines the composition type, then predicts placement parameters such as opacity, mask, location, and scale accordingly. Unlike prior work that constructs datasets by simulating object placements on real images, we directly build our dataset from 1.8 million editing actions collected on an anonymous online visual creation and editing platform, each reflecting user-community validated placement decisions. This grounding in authentic editing behavior ensures strong alignment between task definition and training supervision. User studies and quantitative evaluations show that StickerNet outperforms common baselines and closely matches human placement behavior, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning from real-world editing patterns despite the inherent ambiguity of the task. This work introduces a new direction in visual understanding that emphasizes expressiveness and user intent over realism.", "AI": {"tldr": "StickerNet introduces a new image composition task focusing on artistic and playful edits, using a dataset from real-world editing actions to outperform baselines and match human behavior.", "motivation": "Users of online platforms motivated by gaining community recognition often aim to create content that is more artistic, playful, or socially engaging, rather than preserving realism.", "method": "We present StickerNet, a two-stage framework that first determines the composition type, then predicts placement parameters such as opacity, mask, location, and scale accordingly.", "result": "User studies and quantitative evaluations show that StickerNet outperforms common baselines and closely matches human placement behavior.", "conclusion": "This work introduces a new direction in visual understanding that emphasizes expressiveness and user intent over realism."}}

Existing memory-augmented agents mainly store past trajectories for reuse. However, trajectory-based memory suffers from brevity bias, gradually losing essential domain knowledge. More critically, even in truly multimodal problem-solving settings, it records only a single-modality trace of past behavior, failing to preserve how visual attention and logical reasoning jointly contributed to the solution. This is fundamentally misaligned with human cognition: semantic memory is both multimodal and integrated, preserving visual and abstract knowledge through coordinated but distinct representational streams. We thus introduce ViLoMem, a dual-stream memory framework that constructs compact, schema-based memory. It separately encodes visual distraction patterns and logical reasoning errors, enabling MLLMs to learn from their successful and failed experiences. Following a grow-and-refine principle, the system incrementally accumulates and updates multimodal semantic knowledge -- preserving stable, generalizable strategies while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Across six multimodal benchmarks, ViLoMem consistently improves pass@1 accuracy and substantially reduces repeated visual and logical errors. Ablations confirm the necessity of dual-stream memory with explicit distraction--hallucination separation, demonstrating the value of error-aware multimodal memory for lifelong and cross-domain agentic learning.

This paper presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure multi-institutional histopathology classification. The approach leverages the ViT CLS token as a compact 768-dimensional feature representation for secure aggregation, encrypting these tokens using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to the server. We demonstrate that encrypting CLS tokens achieves a 30-fold communication reduction compared to gradient encryption while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. Through evaluation on a three-client federated setup for lung cancer histopathology classification, we show that gradients are highly susceptible to model inversion attacks (PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741), enabling near-perfect image reconstruction. In contrast, the proposed CLS-protected HE approach prevents such attacks while enabling encrypted inference directly on ciphertexts, requiring only 326 KB of encrypted data transmission per aggregation round.

While mainstream training-free diffusion-based methods have greatly advanced style transfer in recent years, their reliance on computationally inversion processes compromises efficiency and introduces visual distortions when inversion is inaccurate. To address these limitations, we propose a novel \\textit{inversion-free} style transfer framework based on dual rectified flows, which tackles the challenge of finding an unknown stylized distribution from two distinct inputs (content and style images), \\textit{only with forward pass}. Our approach predicts content and style trajectories in parallel, then fuses them through a dynamic midpoint interpolation that integrates velocities from both paths while adapting to the evolving stylized image.

Though effective, current systems adopt a dual-branch design that requires reference images at test time, which limits deployability and adds latency and data-collection burden. We introduce a Ref-COD framework that distills references into a class-prototype memory during training and synthesizes a reference vector at inference via a query-conditioned mixture of prototypes. Concretely, we maintain an EMA-updated prototype per category and predict mixture weights from the query to produce a guidance vector without any test-time references. To bridge the representation gap between reference statistics and camouflaged query features, we propose a bidirectional attention alignment module that adapts both the query features and the class representation. Thus, our approach yields a simple, efficient path to Ref-COD without mandatory references. We evaluate the proposed method on the large-scale R2C7K benchmark.

Most existing methods, based on real-valued modeling or local convolutional operations, are inadequate for capturing the underlying physics of coherent light propagation. Moreover, under low signal-to-noise conditions, these methods often converge to non-physical solutions, severely compromising the stability and reliability of the observation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel physics-driven Wavefront Propagating Compensation Network (WavePCNet) to simulate wavefront propagation and enhance the perception of obscured objects. This WavePCNet integrates the Tri-Phase Wavefront Complex-Propagation Reprojection (TriWCP) to incorporate complex amplitude transfer operators to precisely constrain coherent propagation behavior, along with a momentum memory mechanism to effectively suppress the accumulation of perturbations. Additionally, a High-frequency Cross-layer Compensation Enhancement is introduced to construct frequency-selective pathways with multi-scale receptive fields and dynamically model structural consistency across layers, further boosting the model's robustness and interpretability under complex environmental conditions.

Existing multimodal safety guards primarily evaluate only the input question and the final answer, neglecting the intermediate reasoning process. This oversight allows undetected harm, such as biased inferences or policy-violating use of visual context, to emerge during reasoning. We introduce GuardTrace-VL, a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors the full Question-Thinking-Answer (QTA) pipeline via joint image-text analysis, enabling detection of unsafe content as it emerges in the reasoning stage. To support training and evaluation, we construct the GuardTrace dataset, which is generated through diverse prompting strategies and refined via a MLRM- and human-based voting and verification pipeline. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage progressive training scheme combined with the data refinement process, enabling the model to learn nuanced and context-dependent safety preferences according to different risk levels. On our proposed test set covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, GuardTrace-VL model achieves an F1 score of 93.1% on unsafe reasoning detection tasks, representing a 13.5% improvement in F1 score compared to the previous strongest multimodal safety defense methods.

Model Transferability Estimation (MTE) methods address this by providing efficient proxy metrics to rank models without full fine-tuning. In practice, the choice of which MTE metric to use is often ad hoc or guided simply by a metric's average historical performance. However, we observe that the effectiveness of MTE metrics is highly task-dependent and no single metric is universally optimal across all target datasets. To address this gap, we introduce MetaRank, a meta-learning framework for automatic, task-aware MTE metric selection. We formulate metric selection as a learning-to-rank problem. Rather than relying on conventional meta-features, MetaRank encodes textual descriptions of both datasets and MTE metrics using a pretrained language model, embedding them into a shared semantic space. A meta-predictor is then trained offline on diverse meta-tasks to learn the intricate relationship between dataset characteristics and metric mechanisms, optimized with a listwise objective that prioritizes correctly ranking the top-performing metrics. During the subsequent online phase, MetaRank efficiently ranks the candidate MTE metrics for a new, unseen target dataset based on its textual description, enabling practitioners to select the most appropriate metric a priori.

Furthermore, these methods typically aggregate evidence from different views through manually assigned weights, lacking guarantees that the learned multi-view neighbor structures are consistent within the class space, thus undermining the trustworthiness of classification outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel TMVC framework that introduces prototypes to represent the neighbor structures of each view.

However, achieving physically consistent image retouching with precise parameter control (e.g., exposure, white balance, zoom) remains challenging. Existing methods either rely solely on ambiguous and entangled text prompts, which hinders precise camera control, or train separate heads/weights for parameter adjustment, which compromises scalability, multi-parameter composition, and sensitivity to subtle variations. To address these limitations, we propose CameraMaster, a unified camera-aware framework for image retouching. The key idea is to explicitly decouple the camera directive and then coherently integrate two critical information streams: a directive representation that captures the photographer's intent, and a parameter embedding that encodes precise camera settings. CameraMaster first uses the camera parameter embedding to modulate both the camera directive and the content semantics. The modulated directive is then injected into the content features via cross-attention, yielding a strongly camera-sensitive semantic context.

Yet current evaluation practices miss a fundamental question: Can captions stand-in for images in real downstream tasks? We propose a utility-based benchmark, CaptionQA, to evaluate model-generated captions, where caption quality is measured by how well it supports downstream tasks. CaptionQA is an extensible domain-dependent benchmark covering 4 domains--Natural, Document, E-commerce, and Embodied AI--each with fine-grained taxonomies (25 top-level and 69 subcategories) that identify useful information for domain-specific tasks. CaptionQA builds 33,027 densely annotated multiple-choice questions (50.3 per image on average) that explicitly require visual information to answer, providing a comprehensive probe of caption utility. In our evaluation protocol, an LLM answers these questions using captions alone, directly measuring whether captions preserve image-level utility and are utilizable by a downstream LLM. Evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals substantial gaps between the image and its caption utility. Notably, models nearly identical on traditional image-QA benchmarks lower by up to 32% in caption utility. We release CaptionQA along with an open-source pipeline for extension to new domains.

Thus, we propose FlowerDance, which not only generates refined motion with physical plausibility and artistic expressiveness, but also achieves significant generation efficiency on inference speed and memory utilization . Specifically, FlowerDance combines MeanFlow with Physical Consistency Constraints, which enables high-quality motion generation with only a few sampling steps. Moreover, FlowerDance leverages a simple but efficient model architecture with BiMamba-based backbone and Channel-Level Cross-Modal Fusion, which generates dance with efficient non-autoregressive manner. Meanwhile, FlowerDance supports motion editing, enabling users to interactively refine dance sequences.

Although advancements have been made in using multimodal large language models for analyzing lung CT scans, challenges remain in accurately describing nodule morphology and incorporating medical expertise. These limitations affect the reliability and effectiveness of these models in clinical settings. Collaborative multi-agent systems offer a promising strategy for achieving a balance between generality and precision in medical applications, yet their potential in pathology has not been thoroughly explored. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LungNoduleAgent, an innovative collaborative multi-agent system specifically designed for analyzing lung CT scans. LungNoduleAgent streamlines the diagnostic process into sequential components, improving precision in describing nodules and grading malignancy through three primary modules. The first module, the Nodule Spotter, coordinates clinical detection models to accurately identify nodules. The second module, the Radiologist, integrates localized image description techniques to produce comprehensive CT reports. Finally, the Doctor Agent System performs malignancy reasoning by using images and CT reports, supported by a pathology knowledge base and a multi-agent system framework. Extensive testing on two private datasets and the public LIDC-IDRI dataset indicates that LungNoduleAgent surpasses mainstream vision-language models, agent systems, and advanced expert models.

State-of-the-art learning-based approaches generally fall into two paradigms: model-based deep unrolling methods that enforce physical constraints by modeling the degradations, but often produce over-smoothed, artifact-laden textures, and generative models that achieve superior perceptual quality yet hallucinate details due to weak physical constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that uniquely reconciles these paradigms by taming a powerful generative prior with explicit, dense physical constraints.

Recent research has shown that long-term AD predictions by image generation often face difficulties maintaining disease-related characteristics when dealing with irregular time intervals in sequential data. Considering that the time-related aspects of the distribution can reflect changes in disease-related characteristics when images are distributed unevenly, this research proposes a model to estimate the temporal parameter within the Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution (T-NIG) to assist in generating images over the long term. The T-NIG model employs brain images from two different time points to create intermediate brain images, forecast future images, and predict the disease. T-NIG is designed by identifying features using coordinate neighborhoods. It incorporates a time parameter into the normal inverse gamma distribution to understand how features change in brain imaging sequences that have varying time intervals. Additionally, T-NIG utilizes uncertainty estimation to reduce both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in the model, which arise from insufficient temporal data. In particular, the T-NIG model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term prediction tasks within the dataset.

However, their robustness is still challenged by variations in rotation, scale, specular reflections, and defocus blur. In addition, most existing approaches rely on straightforward point-to-point comparisons, typically using cosine or L2 distance, without effectively leveraging the spatio-spatial-temporal structure of iris patterns. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and generalized matching pipeline that learns rich spatio-spatial-temporal representations of iris features. Our approach first splits each iris image along one dimension, generating a sequence of sub-images that serve as input to a 3D-CNN, enabling the network to capture both spatial and spatio-spatial-temporal cues. To further enhance the modeling of spatio-spatial-temporal feature dynamics, we train the model in curriculum manner. This design allows the network to embed temporal dependencies directly into the feature space, improving discriminability in the deep metric domain. The framework is trained end-to-end with triplet and ArcFace loss in a curriculum manner, enforcing highly discriminative embeddings despite challenges like rotation, scale, reflections, and blur.

Recent advances in foundation models have transformed visual and language understanding, yet their integration with radar sensing remains largely underexplored. Existing radar approaches are fragmented and task-specific; each downstream task employs distinct architectures and training objectives, preventing transfer across tasks. In this work, we introduce RadarFM: a radar foundation model that learns unified scene-level representations through structured spatial language supervision.

Although some priors introduce Knowledge Distillation to enhance student models, they overlook the fundamental differences in fine-grained vision comprehension caused by unbalanced vision tokens between the efficient student and vanilla teacher. In this paper, we propose EM-KD, a novel paradigm that enhances the Efficient MLLMs with Knowledge Distillation. To overcome the challenge of unbalanced vision tokens, we first calculate the Manhattan distance between the vision logits of teacher and student, and then align them in the spatial dimension with the Hungarian matching algorithm. After alignment, EM-KD introduces two distillation strategies: 1) Vision-Language Affinity Distillation (VLAD) and 2) Vision Semantic Distillation (VSD). Specifically, VLAD calculates the affinity matrix between text tokens and aligned vision tokens, and minimizes the smooth L1 distance of the student and the teacher affinity matrices. Considering the semantic richness of vision logits in the final layer, VSD employs the reverse KL divergence to measure the discrete probability distributions of the aligned vision logits over the vocabulary space. Comprehensive evaluation on diverse benchmarks demonstrates that EM-KD trained model outperforms prior Efficient MLLMs on both accuracy and efficiency with a large margin, validating its effectiveness.

Entropy-Guided Adaptive Pruning for Diffusion and Flow Models", "comment": "Project page: https://github.com/changlin31/EntPruner", "summary": "Large-scale vision generative models, including diffusion and flow models, have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, transferring these pre-trained models to downstream tasks often results in significant parameter redundancy. In this paper, we propose EntPruner, an entropy-guided automatic progressive pruning framework for diffusion and flow models. First, we introduce entropy-guided pruning, a block-level importance assessment strategy specifically designed for generative models. Unlike discriminative models, generative models require preserving the diversity and condition-fidelity of the output distribution. As the importance of each module can vary significantly across downstream tasks, EntPruner prioritizes pruning of less important blocks using data-dependent Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) as a guiding metric. CED quantifies how much the distribution diverges from the learned conditional data distribution after removing a block.

Blurring is naturally caused by the convolution of the sharp image with the blur kernel. Thus, allowing the network to learn the blur process in the kernel-level can significantly improve the image deblurring performance. But, current deep networks are still at the pixel-level learning stage, either performing end-to-end pixel-level restoration or stage-wise pseudo kernel-level restoration, failing to enable the deblur model to understand the essence of the blur. To this end, we propose Fourier Kernel Estimator (FKE), which considers the activation operation in Fourier space and converts the convolution problem in the spatial domain to a multiplication problem in Fourier space. Our FKE, jointly optimized with the deblur model, enables the network to learn the kernel-level blur process with low complexity and without any additional supervision. Furthermore, we change the convolution object of the kernel from ``image\" to network extracted ``feature\", whose rich semantic and structural information is more suitable to blur process learning. With the convolution of the feature and the estimated kernel, our model can learn the essence of blur in kernel-level. To further improve the efficiency of feature extraction, we design a decoupled multi-scale architecture with multiple hierarchical sub-unets with a reversible strategy, which allows better multi-scale encoding and decoding in low training memory. Extensive experiments indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art motion deblurring results and show potential for handling other kernel-related problems. Analysis also shows our kernel estimator is able to learn physically meaningful kernels.

The main concept involves learning an accurate alignment of visual elements and language expressions within a semantic space. Recent approaches address cross-modality alignment through conditional queries, tracking the target object using a query-response based mechanism built upon transformer structure. However, they exhibit two limitations: (1) these conditional queries lack inter-frame dependency and variation modeling, making accurate target tracking challenging amid significant frame-to-frame variations; and (2) they integrate textual constraints belatedly, which may cause the video features potentially focus on the non-referred objects. Therefore, we propose a novel RVOS architecture called ProxyFormer, which introduces a set of proxy queries to integrate visual and text semantics and facilitate the flow of semantics between them. By progressively updating and propagating proxy queries across multiple stages of video feature encoder, ProxyFormer ensures that the video features are focused on the object of interest. This dynamic evolution also enables the establishment of inter-frame dependencies, enhancing the accuracy and coherence of object tracking. To mitigate high computational costs, we decouple cross-modality interactions into temporal and spatial dimensions. Additionally, we design a Joint Semantic Consistency (JSC) training strategy to align semantic consensus between the proxy queries and the combined video-text pairs.

To address this, we propose a TEmporal-aware Automated Red-teaming framework, named TEAR, an automated framework designed to uncover safety risks specifically linked to the dynamic temporal sequencing of T2V models. TEAR employs a temporal-aware test generator optimized via a two-stage approach: initial generator training and temporal-aware online preference learning, to craft textually innocuous prompts that exploit temporal dynamics to elicit policy-violating video output. And a refine model is adopted to improve the prompt stealthiness and adversarial effectiveness cyclically.

Many recent MLLMs increasingly favor global native- resolution visual encoding over slice-based methods. To investigate this trend, we systematically compare their behavior on vision-language understanding and attention patterns, revealing that global encoding enhances overall capability but at the expense of greater computational overhead. To address this issue, we present LLaVA-UHD v3, an MLLM centered upon our proposed Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) method, which can be seamlessly integrated into standard Vision Transformer (ViT) to enable efficient native-resolution encoding. The PVC approach consists of two key modules: (i) refined patch embedding, which supports flexible patch-size scaling for fine-grained visual model- ing, (ii) windowed token compression, hierarchically deployed across ViT layers to progressively aggregate local token representations. Jointly modulated by these two modules, a widely pretrained ViT can be reconfigured into an efficient architecture while largely preserving generality. Evaluated across extensive benchmarks, the transformed ViT, termed ViT-UHD, demonstrates competitive performance with MoonViT while reducing TTFT (time-to-first-token) by 2.4x, when developed within an identical MLLM architecture. Building upon ViT-UHD, LLaVA-UHD v3 also achieves competitive performance to Qwen2-VL, while further reducing TTFT by 1.9x.

While test-time computation scaling has brought remarkable success in enabling reasoning-enhanced outputs for challenging natural language tasks, its adaptation to visual AR models remains unexplored and poses unique challenges. Naively applying test-time scaling strategies such as Best-of-N can be suboptimal: they consume full-length computation on erroneous generation trajectories, while the raster-scan decoding scheme lacks a blueprint of the entire canvas, limiting scaling benefits as only a few prompt-aligned candidates are generated. To address these, we introduce GridAR, a test-time scaling framework designed to elicit the best possible results from visual AR models. GridAR employs a grid-partitioned progressive generation scheme in which multiple partial candidates for the same position are generated within a canvas, infeasible ones are pruned early, and viable ones are fixed as anchors to guide subsequent decoding. Coupled with this, we present a layout-specified prompt reformulation strategy that inspects partial views to infer a feasible layout for satisfying the prompt. The reformulated prompt then guides subsequent image generation to mitigate the blueprint deficiency. Together, GridAR achieves higher-quality results under limited test-time scaling: with N=4, it even outperforms Best-of-N (N=8) by 14.4% on T2I-CompBench++ while reducing cost by 25.6%.

This guidance improves CLIP generalizations. However, these anchors-static in both value and position-lack cross-task and stage-adaptive flexibility. To address this limitation, we propose AnchorOPT, a dynamic anchor-based prompt learning framework. Specifically, AnchorOPT introduces dynamism in two key dimensions: (i) anchor values eschew handcrafted explicit textual tokens (e.g., \"shape\", \"color\"), instead learning dynamically from task-specific data; and (ii) the positional relationship between anchor and soft tokens is no longer fixed but adaptively optimized via a learnable position matrix conditioned on the training stage and task context. Training occurs in two stages: we first learn the anchor tokens, then freeze and transfer them to the second stage for optimization of soft tokens and the position matrix.

The core of our approach is a novel three-stage scene tokenization pipeline built upon a Multi-Scale Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) representation, paired with a Multi-Scale NDT Decoder (MSDec).

Next, the MSDec progressively fuses cross-scale NDT features, producing holistic scene tokens consumable by LLM endpoints. Beyond tokenization, MSDec is repurposed as a general interface for human-interactive prompting (points, boxes, masks) and segmentation-mask decoding, unifying diverse 3D scene understanding tasks within a single architecture.

Prevailing approaches predominantly operate in pairwise settings, aligning two modalities at a time. While some recent methods aim to capture higher-order interactions among multiple modalities, they often overlook or insufficiently preserve pairwise relationships, limiting their effectiveness on single-modality tasks. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Fusion (ConFu), a framework that jointly embeds both individual modalities and their fused combinations into a unified representation space, where modalities and their fused counterparts are aligned. ConFu extends traditional pairwise contrastive objectives with an additional fused-modality contrastive term, encouraging the joint embedding of modality pairs with a third modality. This formulation enables ConFu to capture higher-order dependencies, such as XOR-like relationships, that cannot be recovered through pairwise alignment alone, while still maintaining strong pairwise correspondence. We evaluate ConFu on synthetic and real-world multimodal benchmarks, assessing its ability to exploit cross-modal complementarity, capture higher-order dependencies, and scale with increasing multimodal complexity. Across these settings, ConFu demonstrates competitive performance on retrieval and classification tasks, while supporting unified one-to-one and two-to-one retrieval within a single contrastive framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "ConFu\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9879\u6269\u5c55\u4f20\u7edf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8054\u5408\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u9ad8\u9636\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e24\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u9ad8\u9636\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u5ffd\u89c6\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Contrastive Fusion\uff08ConFu\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u4f20\u7edf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9879\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8054\u5408\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "result": "ConFu\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u5e76\u6355\u6349\u9ad8\u9636\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "ConFu\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

However, a common issue with existing methods is the disparity between global and local feature structures. While local structures typically show strong consistency and compactness within class samples, global features often present intertwined boundaries and poorly separated clusters. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCBoost, a parameter-free plug-in designed to enhance the global feature structures of current deep clustering models. By harnessing reliable local structural cues, our method aims to elevate clustering performance effectively. Specifically, we first identify high-confidence samples through adaptive $k$-nearest neighbors-based consistency filtering, aiming to select a sufficient number of samples with high label reliability to serve as trustworthy anchors for self-supervision. Subsequently, these samples are utilized to compute a discriminative loss, which promotes both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, to guide network optimization. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets showcase that our DCBoost significantly improves the clustering performance of diverse existing deep clustering models. Notably, our method improves the performance of current state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., ProPos) by more than 3% and amplifies the silhouette coefficient by over $7\\times$.

The proposed approach integrates Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for spatial feature encoding with a latency-driven spike conversion layer and a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for classification. The Auckland Harbour Bridge dataset is recorded under various weather and lighting conditions, comprising 6,000 labelled frames that include both real and synthetically augmented unsafe cases. The presented system achieves a classification accuracy of 92.3% (+- 0.8%) with a per-frame inference time of 9.5 ms. Achieved sub-10 millisecond latency, combined with sparse spike activity (8.1%), enables real-time, low-power edge deployment. Unlike conventional CNN-based approaches, the hybrid SIFT-SNN pipeline explicitly preserves spatial feature grounding, enhances interpretability, supports transparent decision-making, and operates efficiently on embedded hardware. Although synthetic augmentation improved robustness, generalisation to unseen field conditions remains to be validated.

However, current recognition methods often capture coarse-grained motion patterns but struggle to identify subtle details in local regions evolving over time. In this work, we introduce the Action-Region Tracking (ART) framework, a novel solution leveraging a query-response mechanism to discover and track the dynamics of distinctive local details, enabling effective distinction of similar actions. Specifically, we propose a region-specific semantic activation module that employs discriminative and text-constrained semantics as queries to capture the most action-related region responses in each video frame, facilitating interaction among spatial and temporal dimensions with corresponding video features. The captured region responses are organized into action tracklets, which characterize region-based action dynamics by linking related responses across video frames in a coherent sequence. The text-constrained queries encode nuanced semantic representations derived from textual descriptions of action labels extracted by language branches within Visual Language Models (VLMs). To optimize the action tracklets, we design a multi-level tracklet contrastive constraint among region responses at spatial and temporal levels, enabling effective discrimination within each frame and correlation between adjacent frames. Additionally, a task-specific fine-tuning mechanism refines textual semantics such that semantic representations encoded by VLMs are preserved while optimized for task preferences.

However, existing methods fall short of human-like abstract visual thinking, as their flexibility is fundamentally limited by external tools. In this work, we introduce Monet, a training framework that enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to reason directly within the latent visual space by generating continuous embeddings that function as intermediate visual thoughts. We identify two core challenges in training MLLMs for latent visual reasoning: high computational cost in latent-vision alignment and insufficient supervision over latent embeddings, and address them with a three-stage distillation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline. We further reveal a limitation of applying GRPO to latent reasoning: it primarily enhances text-based reasoning rather than latent reasoning. To overcome this, we propose VLPO (Visual-latent Policy Optimization), a reinforcement learning method that explicitly incorporates latent embeddings into policy gradient updates. To support SFT, we construct Monet-SFT-125K, a high-quality text-image interleaved CoT dataset containing 125K real-world, chart, OCR, and geometry CoTs.

MeanFlow achieves FID 29.15 with single-step sampling -- a 50X reduction in inference time. We further extend CFM to image inpainting, implementing mask-guided sampling with four mask types (center, random bbox, irregular, half).

Prior studies on language models have reported an inverse scaling effect, where textual distractors lead to longer but less effective reasoning. To investigate whether similar phenomena occur in multimodal settings, we introduce Idis (Images with distractors), a visual question-answering dataset that systematically varies distractors along semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions. Our analyses reveal that visual distractors differ fundamentally from textual ones: although inverse scaling persists, adding visual distractors reduces accuracy without increasing reasoning length. We further show that tracking attribute counts within reasoning traces provides key insights into how distractors, reasoning length, and accuracy interact. Finally, we demonstrate that these trends extend to established visual bias benchmarks such as Waterbirds, and we propose a simple prompting strategy to mitigate bias-driven predictions in reasoning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u7269\u5728VLMs\u4e2d\u5bfc\u81f4\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u5e72\u6270\u7269\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c5e\u6027\u8ba1\u6570\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e72\u6270\u7269\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7c7b\u4f3c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u9006\u5411\u7f29\u653e\u6548\u5e94\uff08inverse scaling\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Idis\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u53d8\u5316\u5e72\u6270\u7269\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u7269\u5bfc\u81f4\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4e14\u5c5e\u6027\u8ba1\u6570\u8ffd\u8e2a\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5e72\u6270\u7269\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u7269\uff08distractors\uff09\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u5e72\u6270\u7269\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5c5e\u6027\u8ba1\u6570\u548c\u7b80\u5355\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u5e72\u6270\u7269\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002"}}

Attackers selectively modify partial but semantically critical frames while preserving the overall perceptual authenticity, making such forgeries particularly difficult to detect. Existing methods focus on independently detecting whether a single frame is forged, lacking the hierarchical structure to capture both transient and sustained anomalies across different temporal levels. To address these limitations, We identify three key levels relevant to partial audio forgery detection and present T3-Tracer, the first framework that jointly analyzes audio at the frame, segment, and audio levels to comprehensively detect forgery traces. T3-Tracer consists of two complementary core modules: the Frame-Audio Feature Aggregation Module (FA-FAM) and the Segment-level Multi-Scale Discrepancy-Aware Module (SMDAM). FA-FAM is designed to detect the authenticity of each audio frame. It combines both frame-level and audio-level temporal information to detect intra-frame forgery cues and global semantic inconsistencies. To further refine and correct frame detection, we introduce SMDAM to detect forgery boundaries at the segment level. It adopts a dual-branch architecture that jointly models frame features and inter-frame differences across multi-scale temporal windows, effectively identifying abrupt anomalies that appeared on the forged boundaries.

We propose FIELDS (Face reconstruction with accurate Inference of Expression using Learning with Direct Supervision) to address these limitations by extending self-supervised 2D image consistency cues with direct 3D expression parameter supervision and an auxiliary emotion recognition branch. Our encoder is guided by authentic expression parameters from spontaneous 4D facial scans, while an intensity-aware emotion loss encourages the 3D expression parameters to capture genuine emotion content without exaggeration. This dual-supervision strategy bridges the 2D/3D domain gap and mitigates expression-intensity bias, yielding high-fidelity 3D reconstructions that preserve subtle emotional cues. From a single image, FIELDS produces emotion-rich face models with highly realistic expressions, significantly improving in-the-wild facial expression recognition performance without sacrificing naturalness.", "AI": {"tldr": "FIELDS\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u54082D\u548c3D\u76d1\u7763\u53ca\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f3D\u9762\u90e8\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76843D\u9762\u90e8\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d562D\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f3D\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u7565\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u7ec6\u8282\u3002FIELDS\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a53D\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u6765\u6355\u6349\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "method": "FIELDS\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u76842D\u56fe\u50cf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ebf\u7d22\u3001\u76f4\u63a5\u76843D\u8868\u60c5\u53c2\u6570\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6765\u81ea\u81ea\u53d14D\u9762\u90e8\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u8868\u60c5\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f3a\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6765\u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u76843D\u9762\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "FIELDS\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5bcc\u542b\u60c5\u611f\u7684\u9ad8\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u9762\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91ce\u5916\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "FIELDS\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u54082D\u56fe\u50cf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u76843D\u8868\u60c5\u53c2\u6570\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u76843D\u9762\u90e8\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91ce\u5916\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing methods typically employ CNNs/Transformers to extract visual representations from the given images or incorporate auxiliary tasks to enhance the final results, with weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of the SAM (Segment Anything Model) foundation model to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge into the captioning framework. Specifically, we employ a CNN/Transformer model to extract global-level vision features, leverage the SAM foundation model to delineate semantic- and motion-level change regions, and utilize a specially constructed knowledge graph to provide information about objects of interest. These heterogeneous sources of information are then fused via cross-attention, and a Transformer decoder is used to generate the final natural language description of the observed changes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple widely used benchmark datasets.

However, the traditional convolutional neural network architecture lacks a critical property: shift equivariance and invariance, broken by downsampling and upsampling operations. Although data augmentation techniques can help the model learn the latter property empirically, a consistent and systematic way to achieve this goal is by designing downsampling and upsampling layers that theoretically guarantee these properties by construction. Adaptive Polyphase Sampling (APS) introduced the cornerstone for shift invariance, later extended to shift equivariance with Learnable Polyphase up/downsampling (LPS) applied to real-valued neural networks. In this paper, we extend the work on LPS to complex-valued neural networks both from a theoretical perspective and with a novel building block of a projection layer from $\\mathbb{C}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ before the Gumbel Softmax. We finally evaluate this extension on several computer vision problems, specifically for either the invariance property in classification tasks or the equivariance property in both reconstruction and semantic segmentation problems, using polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86LPS\u5230\u590d\u6570\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u2102\u5230\u211d\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u5c42\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5e73\u79fb\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5e73\u79fb\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u4ee5\u90e8\u5206\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u5c42\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u5757\uff0c\u5373\u5728Gumbel Softmax\u524d\u4ece\u2102\u5230\u211d\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u5c42\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06LPS\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u590d\u6570\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u79fb\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u79fb\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06LPS\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u590d\u6570\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Gumbel Softmax\u524d\u5f15\u5165\u4ece\u2102\u5230\u211d\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u5c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u5e73\u79fb\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6269\u5c55\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

To address this, we introduce AVFakeBench, the first comprehensive audio-video forgery detection benchmark that spans rich forgery semantics across both human subject and general subject. AVFakeBench comprises 12K carefully curated audio-video questions, covering seven forgery types and four levels of annotations. To ensure high-quality and diverse forgeries, we propose a multi-stage hybrid forgery framework that integrates proprietary models for task planning with expert generative models for precise manipulation. The benchmark establishes a multi-task evaluation framework covering binary judgment, forgery types classification, forgery detail selection, and explanatory reasoning.

Mainstream event representation learning algorithms typically use event frames, voxels, or tensors as input. Although these approaches have achieved notable progress, they struggle to address the undersampling problem caused by spatial sparsity. In this paper, we propose a novel hypergraph-guided spatio-temporal event stream completion mechanism, which connects event tokens across different times and spatial locations via hypergraphs and leverages contextual information message passing to complete these sparse events. The proposed method can flexibly incorporate RGB tokens as nodes in the hypergraph within this completion framework, enabling multi-modal hypergraph-based information completion. Subsequently, we aggregate hypergraph node information across different time steps through self-attention, enabling effective learning and fusion of multi-modal features.

To this end, we introduce LaGen, which to the best of our knowledge is the first framework capable of frame-by-frame autoregressive generation of long-horizon LiDAR scenes. LaGen is able to take a single-frame LiDAR input as a starting point and effectively utilize bounding box information as conditions to generate high-fidelity 4D scene point clouds. In addition, we introduce a scene decoupling estimation module to enhance the model's interactive generation capability for object-level content, as well as a noise modulation module to mitigate error accumulation during long-horizon generation.

In this paper, we propose a frequency-aware token reduction strategy that improves computational efficiency while preserving performance by mitigating rank collapsing.

However, its geometric inaccuracies and biased depth rendering currently prevent robust correspondence labeling. To address this, we introduce MatchGS, the first framework designed to systematically correct and leverage 3DGS for robust, zero-shot image matching. Our approach is twofold: (1) a geometrically-faithful data generation pipeline that refines 3DGS geometry to produce highly precise correspondence labels, enabling the synthesis of a vast and diverse range of viewpoints without compromising rendering fidelity; and (2) a 2D-3D representation alignment strategy that infuses 3DGS' explicit 3D knowledge into the 2D matcher, guiding 2D semi-dense matchers to learn viewpoint-invariant 3D representations. Our generated ground-truth correspondences reduce the epipolar error by up to 40 times compared to existing datasets, enable supervision under extreme viewpoint changes, and provide self-supervisory signals through Gaussian attributes. Consequently, state-of-the-art matchers trained solely on our data achieve significant zero-shot performance gains on public benchmarks, with improvements of up to 17.7%.

State-of-the-art methods often rely on Vision Transformers, which excel at capturing global context, yet their quadratic complexity is a significant barrier to efficient deployment, particularly for on-board processing in resource-constrained platforms. In contrast, emerging State Space Models like Mamba offer linear-time efficiency and are inherently suited to modeling long, continuous structures. We posit that these architectures have complementary strengths. To this end, we introduce PathMamba, a novel hybrid architecture that integrates Mamba's sequential modeling with the Transformer's global reasoning. Our design strategically uses Mamba blocks to trace the continuous nature of road networks, preserving topological structure, while integrating Transformer blocks to refine features with global context.

Existing defense methods often suffer from (1) high computational overhead and (2) poor generalization ability across diverse attack types. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel yet efficient teacher-student framework, namely Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation (MRPD) for distilling robust 3D point cloud model. It learns lightweight prompts by aligning student point cloud model's features with robust embeddings from three distinct teachers: a vision model processing depth projections, a high-performance 3D model, and a text encoder. To ensure a reliable knowledge transfer, this distillation is guided by a confidence-gated mechanism which dynamically balances the contribution of all input modalities. Notably, since the distillation is all during the training stage, there is no additional computational cost at inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRPD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against a wide range of white-box and black-box attacks, while even achieving better performance on clean data.

To address this, we introduce CaliTex, a framework of geometry-calibrated attention that explicitly aligns attention with 3D structure. It introduces two modules: Part-Aligned Attention that enforces spatial alignment across semantically matched parts, and Condition-Routed Attention which routes appearance information through geometry-conditioned pathways to maintain spatial fidelity.

However, this joint inference mechanism requires global attention layers that perform all-to-all attention computation on tokens from all views. For reconstruction of large scenes with long-sequence inputs, this causes a significant latency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose head-wise temporal merging (HTTM), a training-free 3D token merging method for accelerating VGGT. Existing merging techniques merge tokens uniformly across different attention heads, resulting in identical tokens in the layers' output, which hinders the model's representational ability. HTTM tackles this problem by merging tokens in multi-head granularity, which preserves the uniqueness of feature tokens after head concatenation. Additionally, this enables HTTM to leverage the spatial locality and temporal correspondence observed at the head level to achieve higher merging ratios with lower merging costs compared to existing methods.

It natively supports interleaved contexts of up to 256K tokens, seamlessly integrating text, images, and video. The model family includes both dense (2B/4B/8B/32B) and mixture-of-experts (30B-A3B/235B-A22B) variants to accommodate diverse latency-quality trade-offs. Qwen3-VL delivers three core pillars: (i) markedly stronger pure-text understanding, surpassing comparable text-only backbones in several cases; (ii) robust long-context comprehension with a native 256K-token window for both text and interleaved multimodal inputs, enabling faithful retention, retrieval, and cross-referencing across long documents and videos; and (iii) advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, demonstrating leading performance on comprehensive evaluations such as MMMU and visual-math benchmarks (e.g., MathVista and MathVision). Architecturally, we introduce three key upgrades: (i) an enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for stronger spatial-temporal modeling across images and video; (ii) DeepStack integration, which effectively leverages multi-level ViT features to tighten vision-language alignment; and (iii) text-based time alignment for video, evolving from T-RoPE to explicit textual timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. Under comparable token budgets and latency constraints, Qwen3-VL achieves superior performance in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures.

Our approach combines server-side foundation model training with on-device prototype-based classification, enabling efficient error correction through prototype updates rather than model retraining. The system consists of two key components: (1) a server-side pipeline that leverages knowledge distillation to transfer robust feature representations from foundation models to device-compatible architectures, and (2) a device-side mechanism that enables ultra-efficient error correction through prototype adaptation. We demonstrate our system's effectiveness on both image classification and object detection tasks, achieving over 50% error correction in one-shot scenarios on Food-101 and Flowers-102 datasets while maintaining minimal forgetting (less than 0.02%) and negligible computational overhead.

However, existing adversarial attack methods require costly end-to-end training and often generate noticeable perturbation patches. To address these limitations, we propose ADVLA, a framework that directly applies adversarial perturbations on features projected from the visual encoder into the textual feature space. ADVLA efficiently disrupts downstream action predictions under low-amplitude constraints, and attention guidance allows the perturbations to be both focused and sparse. We introduce three strategies that enhance sensitivity, enforce sparsity, and concentrate perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that under an $L_{\\infty}=4/255$ constraint, ADVLA combined with Top-K masking modifies less than 10% of the patches while achieving an attack success rate of nearly 100%. The perturbations are concentrated on critical regions, remain almost imperceptible in the overall image, and a single-step iteration takes only about 0.06 seconds, significantly outperforming conventional patch-based attacks.

Existing methods commonly employ various parameter-heavy strategies to extract a full feature description from the input patch. However, they still have difficulties in accurately and efficiently predicting normals for various point clouds. In this work, we present a new idea of feature extraction for robust normal estimation of point clouds. We use the fusion of multi-scale features from different neighborhood sizes to address the issue of selecting reasonable patch sizes for various data or geometries. We seek to model a patch feature fitting (PFF) based on multi-scale features to approximate the optimal geometric description for normal estimation and implement the approximation process via multi-scale feature aggregation and cross-scale feature compensation. The feature aggregation module progressively aggregates the patch features of different scales to the center of the patch and shrinks the patch size by removing points far from the center. It not only enables the network to precisely capture the structure characteristic in a wide range, but also describes highly detailed geometries.

Thus, we present Endo-G$^{2}$T, a geometry-guided and temporally aware training scheme for time-embedded 4DGS. First, geo-guided prior distillation converts confidence-gated monocular depth into supervision with scale-invariant depth and depth-gradient losses, using a warm-up-to-cap schedule to inject priors softly and avoid early overfitting. Second, a time-embedded Gaussian field represents dynamics in XYZT with a rotor-like rotation parameterization, yielding temporally coherent geometry with lightweight regularization that favors smooth motion and crisp opacity boundaries. Third, keyframe-constrained streaming improves efficiency and long-horizon stability through keyframe-focused optimization under a max-points budget, while non-keyframes advance with lightweight updates.

While VAR models have recently emerged as strong competitors to diffusion and flow models for image generation, they suffer from a critical limitation in diversity, often producing nearly identical images even for simple prompts. This issue has largely gone unnoticed amid the predominant focus on image quality. We address this limitation at test time in two stages. First, inspired by diversity enhancement techniques in diffusion models, we propose injecting noise into the text embedding. This introduces a trade-off between diversity and image quality: as diversity increases, the image quality sharply declines. To preserve quality, we propose scale-travel: a novel latent refinement technique inspired by time-travel strategies in diffusion models. Specifically, we use a multi-scale autoencoder to extract coarse-scale tokens that enable us to resume generation at intermediate stages.

While learning approaches have shown promising results, most still rely primarily on geometric features to assemble a whole from its parts. As a result, methods struggle when geometry alone is insufficient or ambiguous, for example, for small, eroded, or symmetric fragments. Additionally, solutions do not impose physical constraints that explicitly prevent overlapping assemblies. To address these limitations, we introduce E-M3RF, an equivariant multimodal 3D reassembly framework that takes as input the point clouds, containing both point positions and colors of fractured fragments, and predicts the transformations required to reassemble them using SE(3) flow matching. Each fragment is represented by both geometric and color features: i) 3D point positions are encoded as rotationconsistent geometric features using a rotation-equivariant encoder, ii) the colors at each 3D point are encoded with a transformer. The two feature sets are then combined to form a multimodal representation.

However, the substantial computational complexity and slow generation speed of diffusion models pose significant challenges for real-time, high-resolution video generation on resource-constrained mobile devices. In this work, we propose MobileI2V, a 270M lightweight diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation on mobile devices. The core lies in: (1) We analyzed the performance of linear attention modules and softmax attention modules on mobile devices, and proposed a linear hybrid architecture denoiser that balances generation efficiency and quality. (2) We design a time-step distillation strategy that compresses the I2V sampling steps from more than 20 to only two without significant quality loss, resulting in a 10-fold increase in generation speed. (3) We apply mobile-specific attention optimizations that yield a 2-fold speed-up for attention operations during on-device inference. MobileI2V enables, for the first time, fast 720p image-to-video generation on mobile devices, with quality comparable to existing models. Under one-step conditions, the generation speed of each frame of 720p video is less than 100 ms.

Despite its importance, manual ANA detection is slow, labor-intensive, and demands years of training. ANA detection is complicated by over 100 coexisting antibody types, resulting in vast fluorescent pattern combinations. Although machine learning and deep learning have enabled automation, ANA detection in real-world clinical settings presents unique challenges as it involves multi-instance, multi-label (MIML) learning. In this paper, a novel framework for ANA detection is proposed that handles the complexities of MIML tasks using unaltered microscope images without manual preprocessing. Inspired by human labeling logic, it identifies consistent ANA sub-regions and assigns aggregated labels accordingly. These steps are implemented using three task-specific components: an instance sampler, a probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher, and self-paced weight learning rate coefficients. The instance sampler suppresses low-confidence instances by modeling pattern confidence, while the dispatcher adaptively assigns labels based on instance distinguishability. Self-paced learning adjusts training according to empirical label observations. Our framework overcomes limitations of traditional MIML methods and supports end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on one ANA dataset and three public medical MIML benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework.

Moreover, this paradigm of ever-larger models stands in stark contrast with the principles of sustainable and environmentally responsible AI, as it leads to immense carbon footprints and resource inefficiency. In this work, we present a novel and efficient alternative: an Ensemble-of-Specialists framework for building Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). Our method decomposes the training process into lightweight, task-specific ConvNeXtV2 specialists that can be frozen and reused. This modular approach offers strong advantages in efficiency, interpretability, and extensibility.

This study presents an innovative methodology for sequential image generation, guided by quantitative metrics, to maintain the essential features indicative of disease progression. Furthermore, an age-scaling factor is integrated into the process to produce age-specific MRI images, facilitating the prediction of advanced stages of the disease. The results obtained from the ablation study suggest that the inclusion of quantitative metrics significantly improves the accuracy of MRI image synthesis.

However, its extension to video generation faces significant challenges. Existing video reward models rely on vision-language models designed for pixel-space inputs, confining ReFL optimization to near-complete denoising steps after computationally expensive VAE decoding. This pixel-space approach incurs substantial memory overhead and increased training time, and its late-stage optimization lacks early-stage supervision, refining only visual quality rather than fundamental motion dynamics and structural coherence. In this work, we show that pre-trained video generation models are naturally suited for reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process noisy latent representations at arbitrary timesteps and inherently preserve temporal information through their sequential modeling capabilities. Accordingly, we propose Process Reward Feedback Learning~(PRFL), a framework that conducts preference optimization entirely in latent space, enabling efficient gradient backpropagation throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding.

Variations in sunlight direction, cloud cover, and shadows break the constant-lighting assumption underlying both classical multi-view stereo (MVS) and structure from motion (SfM) pipelines and recent neural rendering methods, leading to geometry drift, color inconsistency, and shadow imprinting. This issue is especially critical in UAV-based reconstruction, where long flight durations and outdoor environments make lighting changes unavoidable. However, existing datasets either restrict capture to short time windows, thus lacking meaningful illumination diversity, or span months and seasons, where geometric and semantic changes confound the isolated study of lighting robustness.

Each scene is captured along repeatable, geo-referenced flight paths at multiple fixed times of day, producing natural lighting variation under consistent geometry, calibration, and viewpoints.

Our analysis reveals that this issue is rooted in three fundamental challenges of the joint diffusion process: (1) Correspondence Drift, where concurrently evolving noisy latents impede stable learning of alignment; (2) inefficient global attention mechanisms that fail to capture fine-grained temporal cues; and (3) the intra-modal bias of conventional Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which enhances conditionality but not cross-modal synchronization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Harmony, a novel framework that mechanistically enforces audio-visual synchronization. We first propose a Cross-Task Synergy training paradigm to mitigate drift by leveraging strong supervisory signals from audio-driven video and video-driven audio generation tasks. Then, we design a Global-Local Decoupled Interaction Module for efficient and precise temporal-style alignment. Finally, we present a novel Synchronization-Enhanced CFG (SyncCFG) that explicitly isolates and amplifies the alignment signal during inference.

A key limitation is that the standard denoising MSE objective provides no direct supervision on temporal consistency, allowing models to achieve low loss while still generating poor motion. We propose MoGAN, a motion-centric post-training framework that improves motion realism without reward models or human preference data. Built atop a 3-step distilled video diffusion model, we train a DiT-based optical-flow discriminator to differentiate real from generated motion, combined with a distribution-matching regularizer to preserve visual fidelity. With experiments on Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B, MoGAN substantially improves motion quality across benchmarks. On VBench, MoGAN boosts motion score by +7.3% over the 50-step teacher and +13.3% over the 3-step DMD model. On VideoJAM-Bench, MoGAN improves motion score by +7.4% over the teacher and +8.8% over DMD, while maintaining comparable or even better aesthetic and image-quality scores. A human study further confirms that MoGAN is preferred for motion quality (52% vs. 38% for the teacher; 56% vs. 29% for DMD). Overall, MoGAN delivers significantly more realistic motion without sacrificing visual fidelity or efficiency, offering a practical path toward fast, high-quality video generation.

Our method employs a Refine-Requery-Reinforce loop, where coarse pseudo-masks are generated from initial points (Refine), improved with self-constructed box prompts (Requery), and embeddings are aligned across iterations to reduce confirmation bias (Reinforce). Without relying on full-mask supervision, our approach progressively enhances SAM's segmentation quality and domain robustness through self-guided prompt adaptation . We evaluate our proposed method on three RSI benchmark datasets, including WHU, HRSID, and NWPU VHR-10, showing that our method consistently surpasses pretrained SAM and recent point-supervised segmentation methods.

Long-term AQA, as in figure skating or rhythmic gymnastics, is especially challenging since it requires modeling extended temporal dynamics while remaining robust to contextual confounders. Existing approaches either depend on costly annotations or rely on unidirectional temporal modeling, making them vulnerable to spurious correlations and unstable long-term representations. To this end, we propose CaFlow, a unified framework that integrates counterfactual de-confounding with bidirectional time-conditioned flow. The Causal Counterfactual Regularization (CCR) module disentangles causal and confounding features in a self-supervised manner and enforces causal robustness through counterfactual interventions, while the BiT-Flow module models forward and backward dynamics with a cycle-consistency constraint to produce smoother and more coherent representations. Extensive experiments on multiple long-term AQA benchmarks demonstrate that CaFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance.

However, their ability to follow diverse, fine-grained evaluation criteria remains underexplored. We develop Multi-Crit, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal judges on their capacity to follow pluralistic criteria and produce reliable criterion-level judgments. Covering both open-ended generation and verifiable reasoning tasks, Multi-Crit is built through a rigorous data curation pipeline that gathers challenging response pairs with multi-criterion human annotations. It further introduces three novel metrics for systematically assessing pluralistic adherence, criterion-switching flexibility, and the ability to recognize criterion-level preference conflicts. Comprehensive analysis of 25 LMMs reveals that 1) proprietary models still struggle to maintain consistent adherence to pluralistic criteria--especially in open-ended evaluation; 2) open-source models lag further behind in flexibly following diverse criteria; and 3) critic fine-tuning with holistic judgment signals enhances visual grounding but fails to generalize to pluralistic criterion-level judgment. Additional analyses on reasoning fine-tuning, test-time scaling, and boundary consistency between open-source and proprietary models further probe the limits of current multimodal judges.

To address this difficulty, the proposed research will develop a hybrid deep learning model which integrates U-Net based segmentation and a hybrid DenseNet-VGG classification network with multihead attention and spatial-channel attention capabilities. The segmentation model will precisely demarcate the tumors in a 3D volume of MRI data guided by spatial and contextual information. The classification network which combines a branch of both DenseNet and VGG, will incorporate the demarcated tumor on which features with attention mechanisms would be focused on clinically relevant features. High-dimensional 3D MRI data could successfully be utilized in the model through preprocessing steps which are normalization, resampling, and data augmentation. Through a variety of measures the framework is evaluated: measures of performance in segmentation are Dice coefficient and Mean Intersection over Union (IoU) and measures of performance in classification are accuracy precision, recall, and F1-score. The hybrid framework that has been proposed has demonstrated through physical testing that it has the capability of obtaining a Dice coefficient of 98% in tumor segmentation, and 99% on classification accuracy, outperforming traditional CNN models and attention-free methods. Utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms enhances notions of priority in aspects of the tumor that are clinically significant, and enhances interpretability and accuracy. The results suggest a great potential of the framework in facilitating the timely and reliable diagnosis and grading of glioma by clinicians is promising, allowing for better planning of patient treatment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8111\u80f6\u8d28\u7624\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5206\u5272\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8111\u80f6\u8d28\u7624\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u8bca\u65ad\u5bf9\u6cbb\u7597\u5e72\u9884\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u5272\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eU-Net\u7684\u5206\u5272\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u6df7\u5408DenseNet-VGG\u5206\u7c7b\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4-\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff08\u5982\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u3001\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff09\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef43D MRI\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u4e8698%\u7684Dice\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523099%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfCNN\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u65e0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8111\u80f6\u8d28\u7624\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6cbb\u7597\u89c4\u5212\u3002"}}

This paper is the first to systematically investigate this seemingly implausible question. Towards this end, we propose a contrastive learning framework to train CamFormer, a dedicated encoder that projects camera pose trajectories into a joint embedding space, aligning them with natural language. We find that, contrary to its apparent simplicity, the camera trajectory is a remarkably informative signal to uncover video content. In other words, \"how you move\" can indeed reveal \"what you are doing\" (egocentric) or \"observing\" (exocentric). We demonstrate the versatility of our learned CamFormer embeddings on a diverse suite of downstream tasks, ranging from cross-modal alignment to classification and temporal analysis. Importantly, our representations are robust across diverse camera pose estimation methods, including both high-fidelity multi-sensored and standard RGB-only estimators.

We introduce Canvas-to-Image, a unified framework that consolidates these heterogeneous controls into a single canvas interface, enabling users to generate images that faithfully reflect their intent. Our key idea is to encode diverse control signals into a single composite canvas image that the model can directly interpret for integrated visual-spatial reasoning. We further curate a suite of multi-task datasets and propose a Multi-Task Canvas Training strategy that optimizes the diffusion model to jointly understand and integrate heterogeneous controls into text-to-image generation within a unified learning paradigm. This joint training enables Canvas-to-Image to reason across multiple control modalities rather than relying on task-specific heuristics, and it generalizes well to multi-control scenarios during inference.
