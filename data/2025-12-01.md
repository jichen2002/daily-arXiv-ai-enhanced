TL;DR: SO-Bench是一个新基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型在视觉结构化输出方面的能力，揭示了现有模型的不足，并通过训练实验提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏系统评估视觉输入的模式基础信息提取和推理能力的基准，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 通过精心设计的SO-Bench基准测试，覆盖四个视觉领域，包括UI屏幕、自然图像、文档和图表，基于6.5K多样化的JSON模式和1.8K经过人工验证的图像-模式对进行实验。

Result: 基准测试揭示了现有模型在预测准确且符合模式的输出方面的不足，并通过训练实验显著提升了模型的结构化输出能力。

Conclusion: SO-Bench基准测试揭示了当前多模态大语言模型在生成准确且符合模式的输出方面的持续差距，强调了改进多模态结构化推理的必要性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world, agentic settings where outputs must not only be correct, but also conform to predefined data schemas. Despite recent progress in structured generation in textual domain, there is still no benchmark that systematically evaluates schema-grounded information extraction and reasoning over visual inputs. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study of visual structural output capabilities for MLLMs with our carefully designed SO-Bench benchmark. Covering four visual domains, including UI screens, natural images, documents, and charts, SO-Bench is built from over 6.5K diverse JSON schemas and 1.8K curated image-schema pairs with human-verified quality. Benchmarking experiments on open-sourced and frontier proprietary models reveal persistent gaps in predicting accurate, schema compliant outputs, highlighting the need for better multimodal structured reasoning. Beyond benchmarking, we further conduct training experiments to largely improve the model's structured output capability. We plan to make the benchmark available to the community.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SFG通过利用对数密度的正曲率特性，无需额外训练或标记数据，显著提升了生成模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的引导方法（如CFG和Auto-Guidance）需要标记数据或额外模型训练，限制了其应用范围。SFG旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用对数密度估计在鞍点区域的正曲率特性，开发了SFG方法，通过估计最大正曲率来引导单个基于分数的模型。

Result: SFG在无条件ImageNet-512生成任务中取得了最先进的FID和FD-DINOv2指标，结合Auto-Guidance后进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: SFG（saddle-free guidance）在不需要额外训练或标记数据的情况下，显著提升了生成样本的质量和多样性，尤其在无条件生成任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Score-based generative models require guidance in order to generate plausible, on-manifold samples. The most popular guidance method, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), is only applicable in settings with labeled data and requires training an additional unconditional score-based model. More recently, Auto-Guidance adopts a smaller, less capable version of the original model to guide generation. While each method effectively promotes the fidelity of generated data, each requires labeled data or the training of additional models, making it challenging to guide score-based models when (labeled) training data are not available or training new models is not feasible.
  We make the surprising discovery that the positive curvature of log density estimates in saddle regions provides strong guidance for score-based models. Motivated by this, we develop saddle-free guidance (SFG) which maintains estimates of maximal positive curvature of the log density to guide individual score-based models. SFG has the same computational cost of classifier-free guidance, does not require additional training, and works with off-the-shelf diffusion and flow matching models. Our experiments indicate that SFG achieves state-of-the-art FID and FD-DINOv2 metrics in single-model unconditional ImageNet-512 generation. When SFG is combined with Auto-Guidance, its unconditional samples achieve general state-of-the-art in FD-DINOv2 score. Our experiments with FLUX.1-dev and Stable Diffusion v3.5 indicate that SFG boosts the diversity of output images compared to CFG while maintaining excellent prompt adherence and image fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniArt是一个基于扩散的框架，能够从单张图像直接合成完全可动的3D物体，通过统一的潜在表示和可逆的关节到体素嵌入，实现了高质量的网格和准确的关节预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动构建可动的3D物体成本高且难以扩展，因此需要一种能够从单张图像直接合成完全可动3D物体的方法。

Method: UniArt是一个基于扩散的框架，通过统一的潜在表示联合编码几何、纹理、部件分割和运动学参数，并引入了可逆的关节到体素嵌入，使模型能够学习一致的运动行为和结构形成。

Result: 在PartNet-Mobility基准测试中，UniArt实现了最先进的网格质量和关节精度。

Conclusion: UniArt通过统一的潜在表示和可逆的关节到体素嵌入，成功实现了从单张图像直接合成完全可动的3D物体，并在PartNet-Mobility基准测试中达到了最先进的网格质量和关节精度。

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects play a vital role in realistic simulation and embodied robotics, yet manually constructing such assets remains costly and difficult to scale. In this paper, we present UniArt, a diffusion-based framework that directly synthesizes fully articulated 3D objects from a single image in an end-to-end manner. Unlike prior multi-stage techniques, UniArt establishes a unified latent representation that jointly encodes geometry, texture, part segmentation, and kinematic parameters. We introduce a reversible joint-to-voxel embedding, which spatially aligns articulation features with volumetric geometry, enabling the model to learn coherent motion behaviors alongside structural formation. Furthermore, we formulate articulation type prediction as an open-set problem, removing the need for fixed joint semantics and allowing generalization to novel joint categories and unseen object types. Experiments on the PartNet-Mobility benchmark demonstrate that UniArt achieves state-of-the-art mesh quality and articulation accuracy.

### [4] [PathReasoning: A multimodal reasoning agent for query-based ROI navigation on whole-slide images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21902)
*Kunpeng Zhang,Hanwen Xu,Sheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathReasoning通过多轮推理和细化导航WSIs，显著提升肿瘤微环境分析效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WSIs虽然提供了癌症的全面画像，但其超大尺寸（超过100亿像素）使得导航至相关区域以支持多样临床检查变得具有挑战性和耗时。

Method: 提出"PathReasoning"多模态推理代理，通过随机采样候选区域、自我反思和推理视觉观察与临床问题的对应关系，逐步构建推理链，引导注意力至诊断相关区域。

Result: PathReasoning在亚型和纵向分析任务中AUROC分别提升6.7%和3.1%，乳腺癌报告生成准确率显著优于GPT-4o 10%。

Conclusion: PathReasoning通过多轮推理和细化，有效导航WSIs，显著提升了肿瘤微环境分析的效率和准确性，支持高效的切片审查、一致的诊断解释、全面报告和证据可追溯性。

Abstract: Deciphering tumor microenvironment from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is intriguing as it is key to cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment response. While these gigapixel images on one hand offer a comprehensive portrait of cancer, on the other hand, the extremely large size, as much as more than 10 billion pixels, make it challenging and time-consuming to navigate to corresponding regions to support diverse clinical inspection. Inspired by pathologists who conducted navigation on WSIs with a combination of sampling, reasoning and self-reflection, we proposed "PathReasoning", a multi-modal reasoning agent that iteratively navigates across WSIs through multiple rounds of reasoning and refinements. Specifically, starting with randomly sampled candidate regions, PathReasoning reviews current selections with self-reflection, reasoning over the correspondence between visual observations and clinical questions, and concludes by proposing new regions to explore. Across rounds, PathReasoning builds a reasoning chain that gradually directs attention to diagnostically relevant areas. PathReasoning turns each whole slide into a sequence of question-guided views, allowing the model to efficiently find informative ROIs within a fixed number of steps, without the need for dense pixel-level annotations. PathReasoning can substantially outperform strong ROI-selection approaches by 6.7% and 3.1% of AUROC on subtyping and longitudinal analysis tasks. The high-quality ROIs further support accurate report generation on breast cancer, significantly outperforming the standard GPT-4o by 10% in accuracy. PathReasoning prioritizes question-specific regions and constructs interpretable reasoning chains, supporting efficient slide review, consistent diagnostic interpretations, comprehensive reporting, and evidence traceability in digital pathology.

### [5] [BrepGPT: Autoregressive B-rep Generation with Voronoi Half-Patch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22171)
*Pu Li,Wenhao Zhang,Weize Quan,Biao Zhang,Peter Wonka,Dong-Ming Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrepGPT是一种单阶段自回归框架，通过VHP表示法统一B-rep的几何与拓扑，实现高效生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有生成方法因B-rep结构中几何与拓扑元素的复杂耦合而依赖多阶段网络导致的错误累积和计算效率低下的问题。

Method: 提出Voronoi Half-Patch (VHP)表示法，将B-reps分解为统一的局部单元，并利用双VQ-VAEs编码顶点拓扑和VHP为基于顶点的令牌，使用解码器Transformer自回归预测令牌。

Result: BrepGPT在无条件B-rep生成中达到最先进性能，并能应用于条件生成、自动补全和插值等多种场景。

Conclusion: BrepGPT通过Voronoi Half-Patch表示和单阶段自回归框架，实现了无条件B-rep生成的最先进性能，并展示了在多种应用中的灵活性。

Abstract: Boundary representation (B-rep) is the de facto standard for CAD model representation in modern industrial design. The intricate coupling between geometric and topological elements in B-rep structures has forced existing generative methods to rely on cascaded multi-stage networks, resulting in error accumulation and computational inefficiency. We present BrepGPT, a single-stage autoregressive framework for B-rep generation. Our key innovation lies in the Voronoi Half-Patch (VHP) representation, which decomposes B-reps into unified local units by assigning geometry to nearest half-edges and sampling their next pointers. Unlike hierarchical representations that require multiple distinct encodings for different structural levels, our VHP representation facilitates unifying geometric attributes and topological relations in a single, coherent format. We further leverage dual VQ-VAEs to encode both vertex topology and Voronoi Half-Patches into vertex-based tokens, achieving a more compact sequential encoding. A decoder-only Transformer is then trained to autoregressively predict these tokens, which are subsequently mapped to vertex-based features and decoded into complete B-rep models. Experiments demonstrate that BrepGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional B-rep generation. The framework also exhibits versatility in various applications, including conditional generation from category labels, point clouds, text descriptions, and images, as well as B-rep autocompletion and interpolation.

Method: PRISM算法是一种无需训练的方法，通过在线参数自适应基于信号质量评估，联合优化光度去趋势和颜色混合。

Result: PRISM在PURE和UBFC-rPPG数据集上分别实现了0.77 bpm和0.66 bpm的MAE，以及在5 bpm阈值下的97.3%和97.5%的准确率。

Conclusion: PRISM算法通过自适应时间序列优化显著提升了rPPG在不同条件下的性能，验证了其在无监督方法中的领先地位，并与有监督方法表现相当。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables contactless vital sign monitoring using standard RGB cameras. However, existing methods rely on fixed parameters optimized for particular lighting conditions and camera setups, limiting adaptability to diverse deployment environments. This paper introduces the Projection-based Robust Signal Mixing (PRISM) algorithm, a training-free method that jointly optimizes photometric detrending and color mixing through online parameter adaptation based on signal quality assessment. PRISM achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods, with MAE of 0.77 bpm on PURE and 0.66 bpm on UBFC-rPPG, and accuracy of 97.3\% and 97.5\% respectively at a 5 bpm threshold. Statistical analysis confirms PRISM performs equivalently to leading supervised methods ($p > 0.2$), while maintaining real-time CPU performance without training. This validates that adaptive time series optimization significantly improves rPPG across diverse conditions.

### [7] [FACT-GS: Frequency-Aligned Complexity-Aware Texture Reparameterization for 2D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23292)
*Tianhao Xie,Linlian Jiang,Xinxin Zuo,Yang Wang,Tiberiu Popa*

Conclusion: FACT-GS通过频率感知的纹理采样密度分配策略，显著提升了高斯泼溅技术在复杂场景中的表现力，实现了在相同参数预算下更清晰的高频细节恢复。

Abstract: Realistic scene appearance modeling has advanced rapidly with Gaussian Splatting, which enables real-time, high-quality rendering. Recent advances introduced per-primitive textures that incorporate spatial color variations within each Gaussian, improving their expressiveness. However, texture-based Gaussians parameterize appearance with a uniform per-Gaussian sampling grid, allocating equal sampling density regardless of local visual complexity. This leads to inefficient texture space utilization, where high-frequency regions are under-sampled and smooth regions waste capacity, causing blurred appearance and loss of fine structural detail. We introduce FACT-GS, a Frequency-Aligned Complexity-aware Texture Gaussian Splatting framework that allocates texture sampling density according to local visual frequency. Grounded in adaptive sampling theory, FACT-GS reformulates texture parameterization as a differentiable sampling-density allocation problem, replacing the uniform textures with a learnable frequency-aware allocation strategy implemented via a deformation field whose Jacobian modulates local sampling density. Built on 2D Gaussian Splatting, FACT-GS performs non-uniform sampling on fixed-resolution texture grids, preserving real-time performance while recovering sharper high-frequency details under the same parameter budget.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的多模态原型框架在整合全切片图像和不完整基因组数据方面表现优异，显著提升了精准肿瘤学的下游任务性能。

Abstract: Multimodal approaches that integrate histology and genomics hold strong potential for precision oncology. However, phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity limits the quality of intra-modal representations and hinders effective inter-modal integration. Furthermore, most existing methods overlook real-world clinical scenarios where genomics may be partially missing or entirely unavailable. We propose a flexible multimodal prototyping framework to integrate whole slide images and incomplete genomics for precision oncology. Our approach has four key components: 1) Biological Prototyping using text prompting and prototype-wise weighting; 2) Multiview Alignment through sample- and distribution-wise alignments; 3) Bipartite Fusion to capture both shared and modality-specific information for multimodal fusion; and 4) Semantic Genomics Imputation to handle missing data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent superiority of the proposed method compared to other state-of-the-art approaches on multiple downstream tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在部分遮挡的稀疏视角下难以实现完整且几何一致的3D重建，AmodalGen3D旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 模型结合了2D模态补全先验与多视角立体几何条件，采用View-Wise Cross Attention机制进行稀疏视角特征融合，以及Stereo-Conditioned Cross Attention模块推断未观测结构。

Result: 实验证明，AmodalGen3D在遮挡严重的稀疏视角设置下，实现了更高的保真度和完整性。

Conclusion: AmodalGen3D通过整合2D先验与多视角几何条件，成功实现了在稀疏视角下的完整3D物体重建，为机器人、AR/VR等应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects from a few unposed and partially occluded views is a common yet challenging problem in real-world scenarios, where many object surfaces are never directly observed. Traditional multi-view or inpainting-based approaches struggle under such conditions, often yielding incomplete or geometrically inconsistent reconstructions. We introduce AmodalGen3D, a generative framework for amodal 3D object reconstruction that infers complete, occlusion-free geometry and appearance from arbitrary sparse inputs. The model integrates 2D amodal completion priors with multi-view stereo geometry conditioning, supported by a View-Wise Cross Attention mechanism for sparse-view feature fusion and a Stereo-Conditioned Cross Attention module for unobserved structure inference. By jointly modeling visible and hidden regions, AmodalGen3D faithfully reconstructs 3D objects that are consistent with sparse-view constraints while plausibly hallucinating unseen parts. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that AmodalGen3D achieves superior fidelity and completeness under occlusion-heavy sparse-view settings, addressing a pressing need for object-level 3D scene reconstruction in robotics, AR/VR, and embodied AI applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前人工视觉系统在全景理解上的局限性，特别是在Track Any Point (TAP)任务中无法跟踪视野外2D点的问题。

Method: 利用360视频作为监督源，将其重新采样为狭窄视野视角，同时通过2D流程跟踪全景中的点来计算真实方向。

Result: 提出了TAPVid360-10k数据集和基准，包含10k个带有真实方向点跟踪的视角视频。基线方法在方向更新预测上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TAPVid-360任务通过预测视频序列中查询场景点的3D方向，即使这些点远超出观察视频的狭窄视野，推动了学习全中心场景表示的发展。基线方法CoTracker v3的改进版本在方向更新预测上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Humans excel at constructing panoramic mental models of their surroundings, maintaining object permanence and inferring scene structure beyond visible regions. In contrast, current artificial vision systems struggle with persistent, panoramic understanding, often processing scenes egocentrically on a frame-by-frame basis. This limitation is pronounced in the Track Any Point (TAP) task, where existing methods fail to track 2D points outside the field of view. To address this, we introduce TAPVid-360, a novel task that requires predicting the 3D direction to queried scene points across a video sequence, even when far outside the narrow field of view of the observed video. This task fosters learning allocentric scene representations without needing dynamic 4D ground truth scene models for training. Instead, we exploit 360 videos as a source of supervision, resampling them into narrow field-of-view perspectives while computing ground truth directions by tracking points across the full panorama using a 2D pipeline. We introduce a new dataset and benchmark, TAPVid360-10k comprising 10k perspective videos with ground truth directional point tracking. Our baseline adapts CoTracker v3 to predict per-point rotations for direction updates, outperforming existing TAP and TAPVid 3D methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统步行性评估方法成本高且难以扩展，而现有单源方法仅捕捉步行环境的单一维度，无法全面反映步行环境。

Method: WalkCLIP是一个多模态框架，结合了卫星图像、街景图像和人口动态数据，通过GPT-4o生成的图像标题学习步行感知的视觉语言表示，并通过空间聚合模块和人口动态基础模型融合这些特征。

Result: 在明尼阿波利斯-圣保罗的4,660个地点评估中，WalkCLIP在预测准确性和空间对齐方面均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: WalkCLIP通过整合视觉和行为信号，提供了对步行环境的可靠预测，优于单模态和多模态基线方法。

Abstract: Urban walkability is a cornerstone of public health, sustainability, and quality of life. Traditional walkability assessments rely on surveys and field audits, which are costly and difficult to scale. Recent studies have used satellite imagery, street view imagery, or population indicators to estimate walkability, but these single-source approaches capture only one dimension of the walking environment. Satellite data describe the built environment from above, but overlook the pedestrian perspective. Street view imagery captures conditions at the ground level, but lacks broader spatial context. Population dynamics reveal patterns of human activity but not the visual form of the environment. We introduce WalkCLIP, a multimodal framework that integrates these complementary viewpoints to predict urban walkability. WalkCLIP learns walkability-aware vision-language representations from GPT-4o generated image captions, refines these representations with a spatial aggregation module that incorporates neighborhood context, and fuses the resulting features with representations from a population dynamics foundation model. Evaluated at 4,660 locations throughout Minneapolis-Saint Paul, WalkCLIP outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines in both predictive accuracy and spatial alignment. These results show that the integration of visual and behavioral signals yields reliable predictions of the walking environment.

Abstract: We introduce PAT3D, the first physics-augmented text-to-3D scene generation framework that integrates vision-language models with physics-based simulation to produce physically plausible, simulation-ready, and intersection-free 3D scenes. Given a text prompt, PAT3D generates 3D objects, infers their spatial relations, and organizes them into a hierarchical scene tree, which is then converted into initial conditions for simulation. A differentiable rigid-body simulator ensures realistic object interactions under gravity, driving the scene toward static equilibrium without interpenetrations. To further enhance scene quality, we introduce a simulation-in-the-loop optimization procedure that guarantees physical stability and non-intersection, while improving semantic consistency with the input prompt. Experiments demonstrate that PAT3D substantially outperforms prior approaches in physical plausibility, semantic consistency, and visual quality. Beyond high-quality generation, PAT3D uniquely enables simulation-ready 3D scenes for downstream tasks such as scene editing and robotic manipulation. Code and data will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 论文提出的MRLM模型通过物理关系注入和跨注意力融合，显著提升了指针仪表读数的精确性，并在新提出的RPM-10K数据集上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The precise reading recognition of pointer meters plays a key role in smart power systems, but existing approaches remain fragile due to challenges like reflections, occlusions, dynamic viewing angles, and overly between thin pointers and scale markings. Up to now, this area still lacks large-scale datasets to support the development of robust algorithms. To address these challenges, this paper first presents a new large-scale benchmark dataset for dial reading, termed RPM-10K, which contains 10730 meter images that fully reflect the aforementioned key challenges. Built upon the dataset, we propose a novel vision-language model for pointer meter reading recognition, termed MRLM, based on physical relation injection. Instead of exhaustively learning image-level correlations, MRLM explicitly encodes the geometric and causal relationships between the pointer and the scale, aligning perception with physical reasoning in the spirit of world-model perspectives. Through cross-attentional fusion and adaptive expert selection, the model learns to interpret dial configurations and generate precise numeric readings. Extensive experiments fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework on the newly proposed benchmark dataset. Both the dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/DialBench

TL;DR: PPBoost通过将弱文本提示转化为强视觉提示，显著提升医学图像分割性能，无需标记数据即可超越少样本方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本提示医学图像分割模型在空间精度和领域适应性上的不足，同时克服视觉提示模型需要精确边界框的高成本问题。

Method: PPBoost首先利用视觉语言模型生成基于文本描述的初始伪边界框，并通过不确定性感知标准过滤不可靠预测。随后，利用保留的图像-边界框对训练伪标签检测器，生成高质量的边界框。在推理阶段，进一步扩展边界框以紧密覆盖目标解剖结构，从而增强现有分割模型的性能。

Result: 在三个不同模态和解剖结构的数据集上，PPBoost在Dice和标准化表面距离指标上均优于文本和视觉提示基线，且无需标记数据即可超越少样本分割模型。

Conclusion: PPBoost框架通过将弱文本提示转化为强空间视觉提示，显著提升了医学图像分割的准确性和鲁棒性，且在零样本条件下表现优异，甚至超越了一些少样本学习方法。

Abstract: Text-prompted foundation models for medical image segmentation offer an intuitive way to delineate anatomical structures from natural language queries, but their predictions often lack spatial precision and degrade under domain shift. In contrast, visual-prompted models achieve strong segmentation performance across diverse modalities by leveraging spatial cues of precise bounding-box (bbox) prompts to guide the segmentation of target lesions. However, it is costly and challenging to obtain the precise visual prompts in clinical practice. We propose PPBoost (Progressive Prompt-Boosting), a framework that bridges these limitations by transforming weak text-derived signals into strong, spatially grounded visual prompts, operating under a strict zero-shot regime with no image- or pixel-level segmentation labels. PPBoost first uses a vision-language model to produce initial pseudo-bboxes conditioned on the textual object descriptions and applies an uncertainty-aware criterion to filter unreliable predictions. The retained image-bboxes pairs are then leveraged to train a pseudo-labeled detector, producing the high-quality bboxes for the query images. During inference, PPBoost further refines the generated bboxes by appropriately expanding them to tightly cover the target anatomical structures. The enhanced spatially-grounding bbox prompts guide existing segmentation models to generate final dense masks, effectively amplifying weak text cues into strong spatial guidance. Across three datasets spanning diverse modalities and anatomies, PPBoost consistently improves Dice and Normalized Surface Distance over text- and visual-prompted baselines and, notably, surpasses few-shot segmentation models without using labeled data. PPBoost can generalize to multiple typical visual segmentation model backbones.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了LiveMamba，一种专为实时交互式指导设计的流式多模态LLM，并提供了首个用于开发和评估实时情境辅导的专用基准和数据集。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (LLM) have advanced conversational abilities but struggle with providing live, interactive step-by-step guidance, a key capability for future AI assistants. Effective guidance requires not only delivering instructions but also detecting their successful execution, as well as identifying and alerting users to mistakes, all of which has to happen in real-time. This requires models that are not turn-based, but that can react asynchronously to a video stream, as well as video data showing users performing tasks including mistakes and their corrections. To this end, we introduce Qualcomm Interactive Cooking, a new benchmark and dataset built upon CaptainCook4D, which contains user mistakes during task execution. Our dataset and benchmark features densely annotated, timed instructions and feedback messages, specifically including mistake alerts precisely timestamped to their visual occurrence in the video. We evaluate state-of-the-art multi-modal LLMs on the Qualcomm Interactive Cooking benchmark and introduce LiveMamba, a streaming multi-modal LLM designed for interactive instructional guidance. This work provides the first dedicated benchmark and a strong baseline for developing and evaluating on live, situated coaching.

Result: 新方法实现了611%的加速效果，而现有公开方法通常仅加速18%。

Conclusion: 新方法将512*512图像生成速度加速至611%，远超现有非通用加速方法。

Abstract: New technologies such as Rectified Flow and Flow Matching have significantly improved the performance of generative models in the past two years, especially in terms of control accuracy, generation quality, and generation efficiency. However, due to some differences in its theory, design, and existing diffusion models, the existing acceleration methods cannot be directly applied to the Rectified Flow model. In this article, we have comprehensively implemented an overall acceleration pipeline from the aspects of theory, design, and reasoning strategies. This pipeline uses new methods such as batch processing with a new velocity field, vectorization of heterogeneous time-step batch processing, and dynamic TensorRT compilation for the new methods to comprehensively accelerate related models based on flow models. Currently, the existing public methods usually achieve an acceleration of 18%, while experiments have proved that our new method can accelerate the 512*512 image generation speed to up to 611%, which is far beyond the current non-generalized acceleration methods.

Result: 实验显示MedEyes在多个医学VQA基准上平均性能提升8.5%。

Conclusion: MedEyes通过结合专家指导和自主探索，显著提升了医学视觉问答任务的性能，展示了构建可解释医学AI系统的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate medical diagnosis often involves progressive visual focusing and iterative reasoning, characteristics commonly observed in clinical workflows. While recent vision-language models demonstrate promising chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), their purely on-policy learning paradigm tends to reinforce superficially coherent but clinically inaccurate reasoning paths. We propose MedEyes, a novel reinforcement learning framework that dynamically models clinician-style diagnostic reasoning by progressively attending to and interpreting relevant medical image regions. By incorporating off-policy expert guidance, MedEyes converts expert visual search trajectories into structured external behavioral signals, guiding the model toward clinically aligned visual reasoning. We design the Gaze-guided Reasoning Navigator (GRN) to emulate the diagnostic process through a dual-mode exploration strategy, scanning for systematic abnormality localization and drilling for detailed regional analysis. To balance expert imitation and autonomous discovery, we introduce the Confidence Value Sampler (CVS), which employs nucleus sampling and adaptive termination to create diverse yet credible exploration paths. Finally, the dual-stream GRPO optimization framework decouples on-policy and off-policy learning signals, mitigating reward assimilation and entropy collapse. Experiments demonstrate that MedEyes achieves an average performance improvement of +8.5\% across multiple medical VQA benchmarks, validating MedEyes's potential in building interpretable medical AI systems.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种无需训练、后处理的不确定性估计方法，显著提升了对比视觉语言模型（VLMs）在错误检测中的性能，适用于安全关键应用。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have gained popularity for their strong open vocabulary classification performance, but they are prone to assigning high confidence scores to misclassifications, limiting their reliability in safety-critical applications. We introduce a training-free, post-hoc uncertainty estimation method for contrastive VLMs that can be used to detect erroneous predictions. The key to our approach is to measure visual feature consistency within a class, using feature projection combined with multivariate Gaussians to create class-specific probabilistic embeddings. Our method is VLM-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, demonstrates robustness to distribution shift, and works effectively with as few as 10 training images per class. Extensive experiments on ImageNet, Flowers102, Food101, EuroSAT and DTD show state-of-the-art error detection performance, significantly outperforming both deterministic and probabilistic VLM baselines.

Abstract: Understanding human instructions is essential for enabling smooth human-robot interaction. In this work, we focus on object grounding, i.e., localizing an object of interest in a visual scene (e.g., an image) based on verbal human instructions. Despite recent progress, a dominant research trend relies on using text as an intermediate representation. These approaches typically transcribe speech to text, extract relevant object keywords, and perform grounding using models pretrained on large text-vision datasets. However, we question both the efficiency and robustness of such transcription-based pipelines. Specifically, we ask: Can we achieve direct audio-visual alignment without relying on text? To explore this possibility, we simplify the task by focusing on grounding from single-word spoken instructions. We introduce a new audio-based grounding dataset that covers a wide variety of objects and diverse human accents. We then adapt and benchmark several models from the closely audio-visual field. Our results demonstrate that direct grounding from audio is not only feasible but, in some cases, even outperforms transcription-based methods, especially in terms of robustness to linguistic variability. Our findings encourage a renewed interest in direct audio grounding and pave the way for more robust and efficient multimodal understanding systems.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) greatly facilitates the deployment of neural networks across diverse environments. However, most state-of-the-art approaches are overly complex, relying on challenging adversarial training strategies, or on elaborate architectural designs with auxiliary models for feature distillation and pseudo-label generation. In this work, we present a simple yet effective UDA method that learns to adapt image styles in the frequency domain to reduce the discrepancy between source and target domains. The proposed approach introduces only a lightweight pre-processing module during training and entirely discards it at inference time, thus incurring no additional computational overhead. We validate our method on domain-adaptive object detection (DAOD) tasks, where ground-truth annotations are easily accessible in source domains (e.g., normal-weather or synthetic conditions) but challenging to obtain in target domains (e.g., adverse weather or low-light scenes). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial performance gains on multiple benchmarks, highlighting its practicality and effectiveness.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的方法在nuScenes基准测试中实现了1-3秒场景占用预测的最先进性能，显著优于现有方法，并展示了强大的场景动态理解能力。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel architecture for trajectory-conditioned forecasting of future 3D scene occupancy. In contrast to methods that rely on variational autoencoders (VAEs) to generate discrete occupancy tokens, which inherently limit representational capacity, our approach predicts multi-frame future occupancy in an end-to-end manner directly from raw image features. Inspired by the success of attention-based transformer architectures in foundational vision and language models such as GPT and VGGT, we employ a sparse occupancy representation that bypasses the intermediate bird's eye view (BEV) projection and its explicit geometric priors. This design allows the transformer to capture spatiotemporal dependencies more effectively. By avoiding both the finite-capacity constraint of discrete tokenization and the structural limitations of BEV representations, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes benchmark for 1-3 second occupancy forecasting, outperforming existing approaches by a significant margin. Furthermore, it demonstrates robust scene dynamics understanding, consistently delivering high accuracy under arbitrary future trajectory conditioning.

Conclusion: ICM方法通过结合colormap和Canny边缘的结构信息，提供了任务对齐且稳定的正则化信号，显著提升了超分辨率性能，特别是在感知质量方面。

Abstract: Real world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) often leverages the powerful generative priors of text-to-image diffusion models by regularizing the output to lie on their learned manifold. However, existing methods often overlook the importance of the regularizing manifold, typically defaulting to a text-conditioned manifold. This approach suffers from two key limitations. Conceptually, it is misaligned with the Real-ISR task, which is to generate high quality (HQ) images directly tied to the low quality (LQ) images. Practically, the teacher model often reconstructs images with color distortions and blurred edges, indicating a flawed generative prior for this task. To correct these flaws and ensure conceptual alignment, a more suitable manifold must incorporate information from the images. While the most straightforward approach is to condition directly on the raw input images, their high information densities make the regularization process numerically unstable. To resolve this, we propose image-conditioned manifold regularization (ICM), a method that regularizes the output towards a manifold conditioned on the sparse yet essential structural information: a combination of colormap and Canny edges. ICM provides a task-aligned and stable regularization signal, thereby avoiding the instability of dense-conditioning and enhancing the final super-resolution quality. Our experiments confirm that the proposed regularization significantly enhances super-resolution performance, particularly in perceptual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-world applications. We will release the source code of our work for reproducibility.

Conclusion: TPCNet通过引入三重物理约束（TPCs）理论，在模型特征空间中构建物理约束，显著提升了低光图像增强的性能指标和视觉质量，且在10个数据集上优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement is an essential computer vision task to improve image contrast and to decrease the effects of color bias and noise. Many existing interpretable deep-learning algorithms exploit the Retinex theory as the basis of model design. However, previous Retinex-based algorithms, that consider reflected objects as ideal Lambertian ignore specular reflection in the modeling process and construct the physical constraints in image space, limiting generalization of the model. To address this issue, we preserve the specular reflection coefficient and reformulate the original physical constraints in the imaging process based on the Kubelka-Munk theory, thereby constructing constraint relationship between illumination, reflection, and detection, the so-called triple physical constraints (TPCs)theory. Based on this theory, the physical constraints are constructed in the feature space of the model to obtain the TPC network (TPCNet). Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative benchmark and ablation experiments confirm that these constraints effectively improve the performance metrics and visual quality without introducing new parameters, and demonstrate that our TPCNet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited immense potential across numerous medical specialties; yet, dentistry remains underexplored, in part due to limited domain-specific data, scarce dental expert annotations, insufficient modality-specific modeling, and challenges in reliability. In this paper, we present OralGPT-Omni, the first dental-specialized MLLM designed for comprehensive and trustworthy analysis across diverse dental imaging modalities and clinical tasks. To explicitly capture dentists' diagnostic reasoning, we construct TRACE-CoT, a clinically grounded chain-of-thought dataset that mirrors dental radiologists' decision-making processes. This reasoning supervision, combined with our proposed four-stage training paradigm, substantially strengthens the model's capacity for dental image understanding and analysis. In parallel, we introduce MMOral-Uni, the first unified multimodal benchmark for dental image analysis. It comprises 2,809 open-ended question-answer pairs spanning five modalities and five tasks, offering a comprehensive evaluation suite to date for MLLMs in digital dentistry. OralGPT-Omni achieves an overall score of 51.84 on the MMOral-Uni benchmark and 45.31 on the MMOral-OPG benchmark, dramatically outperforming the scores of GPT-5. Our work promotes intelligent dentistry and paves the way for future advances in dental image analysis. All code, benchmark, and models will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Online handwriting generation (OHG) enhances handwriting recognition models by synthesizing diverse, human-like samples. However, existing OHG methods struggle to generate unseen characters, particularly in glyph-based languages like Chinese, limiting their real-world applicability. In this paper, we introduce our method for OHG, where the writer's style and the characters generated during testing are unseen during training. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Dual-branch Network with Adaptation (DNA), which comprises an adaptive style branch and an adaptive content branch. The style branch learns stroke attributes such as writing direction, spacing, placement, and flow to generate realistic handwriting. Meanwhile, the content branch is designed to generalize effectively to unseen characters by decomposing character content into structural information and texture details, extracted via local and global encoders, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DNA model is well-suited for the unseen OHG setting, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Video diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable progress in realism and controllability. However, achieving seamless video translation across different perspectives, such as first-person (egocentric) and third-person (exocentric), remains underexplored. Bridging these perspectives is crucial for filmmaking, embodied AI, and world models. Motivated by this, we present WorldWander, an in-context learning framework tailored for translating between egocentric and exocentric worlds in video generation. Building upon advanced video diffusion transformers, WorldWander integrates (i) In-Context Perspective Alignment and (ii) Collaborative Position Encoding to efficiently model cross-view synchronization. To further support our task, we curate EgoExo-8K, a large-scale dataset containing synchronized egocentric-exocentric triplets from both synthetic and real-world scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that WorldWander achieves superior perspective synchronization, character consistency, and generalization, setting a new benchmark for egocentric-exocentric video translation.

Abstract: MRI-based brain age estimation models aim to assess a subject's biological brain age based on information, such as neuroanatomical features. Various factors, including neurodegenerative diseases, can accelerate brain aging and measuring this phenomena could serve as a potential biomarker for clinical applications. While deep learning (DL)-based regression has recently attracted major attention, existing approaches often fail to capture the continuous nature of neuromorphological changes, potentially resulting in sub-optimal feature representation and results. To address this, we propose to use supervised contrastive learning with the recent Rank-N-Contrast (RNC) loss to estimate brain age based on widely used T1w structural MRI for the first time and leverage Grad-RAM to visually explain regression results. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.27 years and an $R^2$ of 0.93 with a limited dataset of training samples, significantly outperforming conventional deep regression with the same ResNet backbone while performing better or comparably with the state-of-the-art methods with significantly larger training data. Furthermore, Grad-RAM revealed more nuanced features related to age regression with the RNC loss than conventional deep regression. As an exploratory study, we employed the proposed method to estimate the gap between the biological and chronological brain ages in Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's disease patients, and revealed the correlation between the brain age gap and disease severity, demonstrating its potential as a biomarker in neurodegenerative disorders.

Conclusion: MoE3D在多模态3D理解任务中表现出色，特别是在Multi3DRefer上超越了现有最佳方法6.1 mIoU。

Abstract: Multi-modal 3D understanding is a fundamental task in computer vision. Previous multi-modal fusion methods typically employ a single, dense fusion network, struggling to handle the significant heterogeneity and complexity across modalities, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose MoE3D, which integrates Mixture of Experts (MoE) into the multi-modal learning framework. The core is that we deploy a set of specialized "expert" networks, each adept at processing a specific modality or a mode of cross-modal interaction. Specifically, the MoE-based transformer is designed to better utilize the complementary information hidden in the visual features. Information aggregation module is put forward to further enhance the fusion performance. Top-1 gating is employed to make one expert process features with expert groups, ensuring high efficiency. We further propose a progressive pre-training strategy to better leverage the semantic and 2D prior, thus equipping the network with good initialization. Our MoE3D achieves competitive performance across four prevalent 3D understanding tasks. Notably, our MoE3D surpasses the top-performing counterpart by 6.1 mIoU on Multi3DRefer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用ST数据的层次结构，且存在信息不对称问题，需要更复杂的表示学习方法来弥合模态差距。

Method: 设计多级表示提取器捕获点级和生态位级表示，并引入层次双曲对齐模块统一这些表示，在双曲空间中进行空间对齐和层次结构化。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上达到最先进性能，证明了方法的有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: HyperST通过双曲空间中的多层次表示学习和层次对齐策略，显著提升了空间转录组学预测的准确性和可扩展性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) merges the benefits of pathology images and gene expression, linking molecular profiles with tissue structure to analyze spot-level function comprehensively. Predicting gene expression from histology images is a cost-effective alternative to expensive ST technologies. However, existing methods mainly focus on spot-level image-to-gene matching but fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure of ST data, especially on the gene expression side, leading to incomplete image-gene alignment. Moreover, a challenge arises from the inherent information asymmetry: gene expression profiles contain more molecular details that may lack salient visual correlates in histological images, demanding a sophisticated representation learning approach to bridge this modality gap. We propose HyperST, a framework for ST prediction that learns multi-level image-gene representations by modeling the data's inherent hierarchy within hyperbolic space, a natural geometric setting for such structures. First, we design a Multi-Level Representation Extractors to capture both spot-level and niche-level representations from each modality, providing context-aware information beyond individual spot-level image-gene pairs. Second, a Hierarchical Hyperbolic Alignment module is introduced to unify these representations, performing spatial alignment while hierarchically structuring image and gene embeddings. This alignment strategy enriches the image representations with molecular semantics, significantly improving cross-modal prediction. HyperST achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets from different tissues, paving the way for more scalable and accurate spatial transcriptomics prediction.

Motivation: 高质量提示的价值和普及使其面临安全和知识产权风险，需要一种实用且适应性强的提示窃取方法。

Method: PROMPTMINER 是一个黑盒提示窃取框架，分为两个阶段：(1) 基于强化学习的优化阶段重建主要主题，(2) 模糊驱动的搜索阶段恢复风格修饰符。

Result: PROMPTMINER 在 CLIP 相似度上达到 0.958，SBERT 文本对齐度达 0.751，优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: PROMPTMINER 在多种数据集和扩散模型上表现出色，具有卓越的泛化能力和鲁棒性，即使在防御性扰动下仍保持强性能。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generative models such as Stable Diffusion and FLUX can synthesize realistic, high-quality images directly from textual prompts. The resulting image quality depends critically on well-crafted prompts that specify both subjects and stylistic modifiers, which have become valuable digital assets. However, the rising value and ubiquity of high-quality prompts expose them to security and intellectual-property risks. One key threat is the prompt stealing attack, i.e., the task of recovering the textual prompt that generated a given image. Prompt stealing enables unauthorized extraction and reuse of carefully engineered prompts, yet it can also support beneficial applications such as data attribution, model provenance analysis, and watermarking validation. Existing approaches often assume white-box gradient access, require large-scale labeled datasets for supervised training, or rely solely on captioning without explicit optimization, limiting their practicality and adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose PROMPTMINER, a black-box prompt stealing framework that decouples the task into two phases: (1) a reinforcement learning-based optimization phase to reconstruct the primary subject, and (2) a fuzzing-driven search phase to recover stylistic modifiers. Experiments across multiple datasets and diffusion backbones demonstrate that PROMPTMINER achieves superior results, with CLIP similarity up to 0.958 and textual alignment with SBERT up to 0.751, surpassing all baselines. Even when applied to in-the-wild images with unknown generators, it outperforms the strongest baseline by 7.5 percent in CLIP similarity, demonstrating better generalization. Finally, PROMPTMINER maintains strong performance under defensive perturbations, highlighting remarkable robustness. Code: https://github.com/aaFrostnova/PromptMiner

Result: 实验证明，GoPrune在结构化剪枝中表现出色，提高了压缩效率。

Conclusion: GoPrune方法在CIFAR数据集上使用ResNet和VGG模型展示了优越的网络剪枝性能，其代码已开源。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) suffer from rapidly increasing storage and computational costs as their depth grows, which severely hinders their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Pruning is a practical approach for network compression, among which structured pruning is the most effective for inference acceleration. Although existing work has applied the $\ell_p$-norm to pruning, it only considers unstructured pruning with $p\in (0, 1)$ and has low computational efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose an accelerated structured pruning method called GoPrune. Our method employs the $\ell_{2,p}$-norm for sparse network learning, where the value of $p$ is extended to $[0, 1)$. Moreover, we develop an efficient optimization algorithm based on the proximal alternating minimization (PAM), and the resulting subproblems enjoy closed-form solutions, thus improving compression efficiency. Experiments on the CIFAR datasets using ResNet and VGG models demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in network pruning.

Motivation: 探讨深度学习模型在单图像3D生成中实际利用的图像线索，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过系统扰动阴影、纹理、轮廓、透视、边缘和局部连续性等线索，量化它们对3D输出质量的影响。

Conclusion: Cue3D框架揭示了现代3D网络如何利用经典视觉线索，为开发更透明、稳健和可控的单图像3D生成模型提供了方向。

Abstract: Humans and traditional computer vision methods rely on a diverse set of monocular cues to infer 3D structure from a single image, such as shading, texture, silhouette, etc. While recent deep generative models have dramatically advanced single-image 3D generation, it remains unclear which image cues these methods actually exploit. We introduce Cue3D, the first comprehensive, model-agnostic framework for quantifying the influence of individual image cues in single-image 3D generation. Our unified benchmark evaluates seven state-of-the-art methods, spanning regression-based, multi-view, and native 3D generative paradigms. By systematically perturbing cues such as shading, texture, silhouette, perspective, edges, and local continuity, we measure their impact on 3D output quality. Our analysis reveals that shape meaningfulness, not texture, dictates generalization. Geometric cues, particularly shading, are crucial for 3D generation. We further identify over-reliance on provided silhouettes and diverse sensitivities to cues such as perspective and local continuity across model families. By dissecting these dependencies, Cue3D advances our understanding of how modern 3D networks leverage classical vision cues, and offers directions for developing more transparent, robust, and controllable single-image 3D generation models.

Conclusion: 提出的耦合提示学习框架通过引入外部监督提示和竞争性提示方法，有效缓解了微调过程中的语义空间缩小问题，显著提升了视觉语言模型在视频任务中的泛化性能。

Abstract: Visual and textual soft prompt tuning can effectively improve the adaptability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in downstream tasks. However, fine-tuning on video tasks impairs the model's generalization ability to unseen classes. Existing methods attempt to mitigate this forgetting effect by regularizing the gap between hand-crafted prompts and soft prompts, but this also weakens the learning ability of soft prompts. To address this challenge, we propose a plug-and-play coupling prompt learning framework to optimize the generalization performance of V-L models in video tasks, with the core motivation of mitigating semantic space narrowing during fine-tuning by introducing an externally supervised prompt. Specifically, for textual prompts, we introduce pre-trained prompts from other datasets as hard prompt tokens. These are concatenated with soft prompt tokens and coupled via a learnable mapping layer. This competitive prompting approach prevents the semantic space from overfitting to supervised categories. In addition, we introduce a set of well-designed irrelevant video sets and negative prompts as generic attribute anchors to maintain the generic relevance of the attributes in the pre-trained semantic space, thus preserving the generalization ability. Experiments on video tasks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompt tuning approaches across generalization benchmarks, particularly on base-to-new class prediction.

Method: VIN使用冻结的基础模型作为特征提取器，并训练一个紧凑的两层多层感知器进行斑块级别的分类。数据集包括120张H&E染色切片，由专业病理学家提供边界注释。

Result: 在盲测中，VIN在20张未见过的切片上产生了与专家注释一致的边缘覆盖图，区域级准确率约为73.3%，错误主要局限于不影响整体连续性的有限区域。

Conclusion: VIN能够捕捉与烧灼相关的组织形态学特征，提供可重复的无墨水边缘描绘，适合整合到常规数字病理工作流程中。

Abstract: Assessing resection margins is central to pathological specimen evaluation and has profound implications for patient outcomes. Current practice employs physical inking, which is applied variably, and cautery artifacts can obscure the true margin on histological sections. We present a virtual inking network (VIN) that autonomously localizes the surgical cut surface on whole-slide images, reducing reliance on inks and standardizing margin-focused review. VIN uses a frozen foundation model as the feature extractor and a compact two-layer multilayer perceptron trained for patch-level classification of cautery-consistent features. The dataset comprised 120 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides from 12 human tonsil tissue blocks, resulting in ~2 TB of uncompressed raw image data, where a board-certified pathologist provided boundary annotations. In blind testing with 20 slides from previously unseen blocks, VIN produced coherent margin overlays that qualitatively aligned with expert annotations across serial sections. Quantitatively, region-level accuracy was ~73.3% across the test set, with errors largely confined to limited areas that did not disrupt continuity of the whole-slide margin map. These results indicate that VIN captures cautery-related histomorphology and can provide a reproducible, ink-free margin delineation suitable for integration into routine digital pathology workflows and for downstream measurement of margin distances.

Abstract: To build a generalizable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with strong reasoning ability, a common strategy is to first train a specialist VLA on robot demonstrations to acquire reliable manipulation skills, and then incorporate mixed annotated robot data together with multimodal data to restore broader reasoning capabilities. However, we observe that the resulting reasoning VLA often suffers from degraded action performance compared to the specialist model before fine-tuning, a phenomenon we refer to as action degeneration. To address this issue, we propose DualVLA, which enhances action performance through carefully designed post-training while still preserving reasoning capability. We first introduce a dual-layer data pruning method that removes redundant embodied reasoning, preventing it from adversely influencing action learning. To further strengthen action generation, we design a dual-teacher adaptive distillation strategy that assigns different supervision signals to different data domains while maintaining reasoning ability. To fill the evaluation gap for generalist VLAs, we also propose VLA Score, which decouples VLA capability into reasoning, intention, action, and alignment dimensions for a more fine-grained assessment. Experiments show that DualVLA achieves an average success rate of 61.0 in SimplerEnv and an average score of 65.4 across eight competitive multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating a stronger balance between precise action execution and multimodal understanding.

Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized sign language generation by automatically transforming text into high-quality sign language videos, providing accessible communication for the Deaf community. However, existing LLM-based approaches prioritize semantic accuracy while overlooking emotional expressions, resulting in outputs that lack naturalness and expressiveness. We propose EASL (Emotion-Aware Sign Language), a multi-emotion-guided generation architecture for fine-grained emotional integration. We introduce emotion-semantic disentanglement modules with progressive training to separately extract semantic and affective features. During pose decoding, the emotional representations guide semantic interaction to generate sign poses with 7-class emotion confidence scores, enabling emotional expression recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that EASL achieves pose accuracy superior to all compared baselines by integrating multi-emotion information and effectively adapts to diffusion models to generate expressive sign language videos.

Abstract: In the field of autonomous driving, camera-based perception models are mostly trained on clear weather data. Models that focus on addressing specific weather challenges are unable to adapt to various weather changes and primarily prioritize their weather removal characteristics. Our study introduces a semantic-enabled network for object detection in diverse weather conditions. In our analysis, semantics information can enable the model to generate plausible content for missing areas, understand object boundaries, and preserve visual coherency and realism across both filled-in and existing portions of the image, which are conducive to image transformation and object recognition. Specific in implementation, our architecture consists of a Preprocessing Unit (PPU) and a Detection Unit (DTU), where the PPU utilizes a U-shaped net enriched by semantics to refine degraded images, and the DTU integrates this semantic information for object detection using a modified YOLO network. Our method pioneers the use of semantic data for all-weather transformations, resulting in an increase between 1.47\% to 8.80\% in mAP compared to existing methods across benchmark datasets of different weather. This highlights the potency of semantics in image enhancement and object detection, offering a comprehensive approach to improving object detection performance.

Abstract: Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a musculoskeletal condition that can cause significant limitations and impairments in daily activities, especially among older individuals. To evaluate the severity of KOA, typically, X-ray images of the affected knee are analyzed, and a grade is assigned based on the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading system, which classifies KOA severity into five levels, ranging from 0 to 4. This approach requires a high level of expertise and time and is susceptible to subjective interpretation, thereby introducing potential diagnostic inaccuracies. To address this problem a stacked ensemble model of fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) was developed for two classification tasks: a binary classifier for detecting the presence of KOA, and a multiclass classifier for precise grading across the KL spectrum. The proposed stacked ensemble model consists of a diverse set of pre-trained architectures, including MobileNetV2, You Only Look Once (YOLOv8), and DenseNet201 as base learners and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) as the meta-learner. This proposed model had a balanced test accuracy of 73% in multiclass classification and 87.5% in binary classification, which is higher than previous works in extant literature.

Abstract: As a mainstream technique for 3D reconstruction, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has been applied in a wide range of applications and services. Recent studies have revealed critical vulnerabilities in this pipeline and introduced computation cost attacks that lead to malicious resource occupancies and even denial-of-service (DoS) conditions, thereby hindering the reliable deployment of 3DGS. In this paper, we propose the first effective and comprehensive black-box defense framework, named RemedyGS, against such computation cost attacks, safeguarding 3DGS reconstruction systems and services. Our pipeline comprises two key components: a detector to identify the attacked input images with poisoned textures and a purifier to recover the benign images from their attacked counterparts, mitigating the adverse effects of these attacks. Moreover, we incorporate adversarial training into the purifier to enforce distributional alignment between the recovered and original natural images, thereby enhancing the defense efficacy. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework effectively defends against white-box, black-box, and adaptive attacks in 3DGS systems, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both safety and utility.

Abstract: Talking face generation aims to synthesize realistic speaking portraits from a single image, yet existing methods often rely on explicit optical flow and local warping, which fail to model complex global motions and cause identity drift. We present IMTalker, a novel framework that achieves efficient and high-fidelity talking face generation through implicit motion transfer. The core idea is to replace traditional flow-based warping with a cross-attention mechanism that implicitly models motion discrepancy and identity alignment within a unified latent space, enabling robust global motion rendering. To further preserve speaker identity during cross-identity reenactment, we introduce an identity-adaptive module that projects motion latents into personalized spaces, ensuring clear disentanglement between motion and identity. In addition, a lightweight flow-matching motion generator produces vivid and controllable implicit motion vectors from audio, pose, and gaze cues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMTalker surpasses prior methods in motion accuracy, identity preservation, and audio-lip synchronization, achieving state-of-the-art quality with superior efficiency, operating at 40 FPS for video-driven and 42 FPS for audio-driven generation on an RTX 4090 GPU. We will release our code and pre-trained models to facilitate applications and future research.

Conclusion: GRPO框架显著提升了PM浓度预测的可靠性，减少了47.3%的误报率，同时保持了竞争力的F1分数，证明了其在长时空气质量预测系统中的实用性。

Abstract: Accurate long horizon forecasting of particulate matter (PM) concentration fields is essential for operational public health decisions. However, achieving reliable forecasts remains challenging in regions with complex terrain and strong atmospheric dynamics such as East Asia. While foundation models such as Aurora offer global generality, they often miss region-specific dynamics and rely on non-real-time inputs, limiting their practical utility for localized warning systems. To address this gap, we construct and release the real-world observations and high-resolution CMAQ-OBS dataset for East Asia, reducing regional error by 59.5% and enabling real-time 48-120 hour forecasts critical for public health alerts. However, standard point-wise objectives cannot reflect asymmetric operational costs, where false alarms deteriorate public trust while missed severe events endanger populations. This cost mismatch causes SFT models to over-predict and yield high False Alarm Rates. We introduce Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with class-wise rewards and curriculum rollout to align predictions with operational priorities. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the reliability of the forecast. Compared to the SFT-only baseline, our model reduces the False Alarm Rate by 47.3% while achieving a competitive F1-score, proving its effectiveness for practical, real-world air quality forecasting systems on long lead time scenarios.

TL;DR: PS-CBM通过多模态概念生成、部分共享策略和CEA指标，解决了现有CBMs的三大挑战，显著提升了准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有概念瓶颈模型（CBMs）在视觉基础、概念冗余和缺乏平衡指标方面的三大挑战。

Method: PS-CBM框架包含三个核心组件：1) 多模态概念生成器，结合LLM语义和视觉线索；2) 部分共享概念策略，基于激活模式合并概念；3) CEA指标，联合评估预测准确性和概念紧凑性。

Result: 在11个多样化数据集上的实验表明，PS-CBM在分类准确性上提升1.0%-7.4%，CEA提升2.0%-9.5%，且所需概念数量显著减少。

Conclusion: PS-CBM通过其多模态概念生成器、部分共享概念策略和概念效率准确性（CEA）指标，显著提升了分类准确性和概念紧凑性，同时减少了所需概念数量，证明了其在实现高准确性和强可解释性方面的有效性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by introducing a layer of human-understandable concepts between inputs and predictions. While recent methods automate concept generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), they still face three fundamental challenges: poor visual grounding, concept redundancy, and the absence of principled metrics to balance predictive accuracy and concept compactness. We introduce PS-CBM, a Partially Shared CBM framework that addresses these limitations through three core components: (1) a multimodal concept generator that integrates LLM-derived semantics with exemplar-based visual cues; (2) a Partially Shared Concept Strategy that merges concepts based on activation patterns to balance specificity and compactness; and (3) Concept-Efficient Accuracy (CEA), a post-hoc metric that jointly captures both predictive accuracy and concept compactness. Extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets show that PS-CBM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CBMs, improving classification accuracy by 1.0%-7.4% and CEA by 2.0%-9.5%, while requiring significantly fewer concepts. These results underscore PS-CBM's effectiveness in achieving both high accuracy and strong interpretability.

TL;DR: GRiP是一个新型两阶段训练框架，通过认知增强的强化学习提升视觉推理能力，在多个基准测试中表现卓越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在端到端强化学习的不稳定性和监督微调的刚性之间难以平衡，导致模型要么难以学习，要么缺乏对复杂真实场景的认知灵活性。

Method: GRiP是一个两阶段训练框架，包括认知增强的强化学习阶段，采用Salience-Weighted IoU奖励和Multi-Heuristic奖励来引导模型的感知焦点和逻辑路径。

Result: GRiP在多个挑战性基准测试中表现优异，尤其是在TreeBench和V* Bench上达到了开源模型中的最先进水平。

Conclusion: GRiP框架通过引入认知增强的强化学习阶段，显著提升了多模态AI在复杂视觉推理任务中的表现，证明了基于认知引导的信号对于解锁下一代多模态智能的重要性。

Abstract: Models capable of "thinking with images" by dynamically grounding their reasoning in visual evidence represent a major leap in multimodal AI. However, replicating and advancing this ability is non-trivial, with current methods often trapped between the instability of end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) and the rigidity of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). This leads to models that either struggle to learn or lack the cognitive flexibility required for complex, real-world scenes. To navigate this dilemma, we introduce GRiP (Guided Reasoning and Perception), a novel two-stage training framework that cultivates robust and flexible visual grounded reasoning by explicitly guiding the model's perceptual focus and logical pathways. GRiP's core lies in its cognitive-enhanced RL stage, which features two key innovations: (1) a Salience-Weighted IoU Reward that incentivizes the model to prioritize the localization of mission-critical objects over trivial distractors, and (2) a Multi-Heuristic Reward that encourages cognitive flexibility by rewarding diverse yet logically valid reasoning pathways. Initialized from the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model, GRiP demonstrates significant performance gains across multiple challenging benchmarks. It achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models on the highly challenging TreeBench and V* Bench, proving its effectiveness in complex visual reasoning. Our work demonstrates that moving beyond simplistic rewards and instead guiding models with cognitively-inspired signals for what to see and how to think is crucial for unlocking the next level of multimodal intelligence. The code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出GCN-GAT混合模型，利用多模态数据提升ASD分类性能，准确率74.82%，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASD症状多样且神经机制复杂，早期客观诊断困难，需开发高精度分类模型。

Method: 采用多分支架构处理rs-fMRI、sMRI和表型数据，通过站点相似性构建群体图结构，结合Chebyshev多项式滤波器和GAT层进行局部谱学习和注意力加权聚合。

Result: 模型在ABIDE I数据集上达到74.82%的测试准确率和0.82的AUC，显著优于传统GCN、自编码深度网络及多模态CNN。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的结合Chebyshev谱图卷积和图注意力网络（GAT）的GCN模型，在多模态神经影像和表型数据上显著提高了ASD分类的准确性，优于现有多种先进基线方法。

Abstract: ASD is a complicated neurodevelopmental disorder marked by variation in symptom presentation and neurological underpinnings, making early and objective diagnosis extremely problematic. This paper presents a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model, incorporating Chebyshev Spectral Graph Convolution and Graph Attention Networks (GAT), to increase the classification accuracy of ASD utilizing multimodal neuroimaging and phenotypic data. Leveraging the ABIDE I dataset, which contains resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), structural MRI (sMRI), and phenotypic variables from 870 patients, the model leverages a multi-branch architecture that processes each modality individually before merging them via concatenation. Graph structure is encoded using site-based similarity to generate a population graph, which helps in understanding relationship connections across individuals. Chebyshev polynomial filters provide localized spectral learning with lower computational complexity, whereas GAT layers increase node representations by attention-weighted aggregation of surrounding information. The proposed model is trained using stratified five-fold cross-validation with a total input dimension of 5,206 features per individual. Extensive trials demonstrate the enhanced model's superiority, achieving a test accuracy of 74.82\% and an AUC of 0.82 on the entire dataset, surpassing multiple state-of-the-art baselines, including conventional GCNs, autoencoder-based deep neural networks, and multimodal CNNs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MTR-VP方法利用视觉Transformer生成上下文嵌入，结合意图和运动特征进行轨迹规划，实验显示多未来轨迹预测提升性能，但视觉与运动特征结合效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过视觉表示替代传统地图特征，提升自动驾驶轨迹规划的准确性和多模态预测能力。

Method: 提出MTR-VP方法，使用ViT编码器处理原始图像和历史运动状态，生成与运动预测框架和规划意图输入对齐的上下文嵌入。通过交叉注意力机制结合意图和上下文嵌入，替代MTR中的可学习意图查询。

Result: 在Waymo端到端驾驶数据集上评估，通过消融实验分析输入图像和多轨迹输出的影响。结果表明多未来轨迹分布预测优于单一轨迹预测。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的方法在结合视觉特征和运动特征（如历史轨迹特征）时，即使通过CLIP和DINOv2等基础模型增强场景上下文表示，仍难以生成有效的场景上下文嵌入。然而，预测多未来轨迹分布而非单一轨迹能提升规划性能。

Abstract: We present a method for trajectory planning for autonomous driving, learning image-based context embeddings that align with motion prediction frameworks and planning-based intention input. Within our method, a ViT encoder takes raw images and past kinematic state as input and is trained to produce context embeddings, drawing inspiration from those generated by the recent MTR (Motion Transformer) encoder, effectively substituting map-based features with learned visual representations. MTR provides a strong foundation for multimodal trajectory prediction by localizing agent intent and refining motion iteratively via motion query pairs; we name our approach MTR-VP (Motion Transformer for Vision-based Planning), and instead of the learnable intention queries used in the MTR decoder, we use cross attention on the intent and the context embeddings, which reflect a combination of information encoded from the driving scene and past vehicle states. We evaluate our methods on the Waymo End-to-End Driving Dataset, which requires predicting the agent's future 5-second trajectory in bird's-eye-view coordinates using prior camera images, agent pose history, and routing goals. We analyze our architecture using ablation studies, removing input images and multiple trajectory output. Our results suggest that transformer-based methods that are used to combine the visual features along with the kinetic features such as the past trajectory features are not effective at combining both modes to produce useful scene context embeddings, even when intention embeddings are augmented with foundation-model representations of scene context from CLIP and DINOv2, but that predicting a distribution over multiple futures instead of a single future trajectory boosts planning performance.

*Daniel Sungho Jung,Kyoung Mu Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FECO框架通过对抗训练和地面特征提取，解决了鞋款多样性和地面单调性带来的挑战，实现了密集足部接触估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法常采用零速度约束近似足部接触，且集中于关节级接触，无法捕捉足部与地面的详细交互。密集足部接触估计对准确建模这种交互至关重要，但从单张RGB图像预测密集足部接触仍未被充分探索。

Method: 采用鞋款风格对抗训练和地面特征提取器，分别解决鞋款外观多样性和地面信息利用不足的问题。

Result: FECO框架实现了对鞋款外观不敏感且能有效利用地面信息的鲁棒足部接触估计。

Conclusion: 提出的FECO框架通过鞋款风格不变和地面感知学习，实现了对不同鞋款和地面条件下的密集足部接触估计，具有鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Foot contact plays a critical role in human interaction with the world, and thus exploring foot contact can advance our understanding of human movement and physical interaction. Despite its importance, existing methods often approximate foot contact using a zero-velocity constraint and focus on joint-level contact, failing to capture the detailed interaction between the foot and the world. Dense estimation of foot contact is crucial for accurately modeling this interaction, yet predicting dense foot contact from a single RGB image remains largely underexplored. There are two main challenges for learning dense foot contact estimation. First, shoes exhibit highly diverse appearances, making it difficult for models to generalize across different styles. Second, ground often has a monotonous appearance, making it difficult to extract informative features. To tackle these issues, we present a FEet COntact estimation (FECO) framework that learns dense foot contact with shoe style-invariant and ground-aware learning. To overcome the challenge of shoe appearance diversity, our approach incorporates shoe style adversarial training that enforces shoe style-invariant features for contact estimation. To effectively utilize ground information, we introduce a ground feature extractor that captures ground properties based on spatial context. As a result, our proposed method achieves robust foot contact estimation regardless of shoe appearance and effectively leverages ground information. Code will be released.

Abstract: The key to facial expression recognition is to learn discriminative spatial-temporal representations that embed facial expression dynamics. Previous studies predominantly rely on pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to learn facial appearance representations, overlooking the relationships between facial regions. To address this issue, this paper presents an Appearance- and Relation-aware Parallel Graph attention fusion Network (ARPGNet) to learn mutually enhanced spatial-temporal representations of appearance and relation information. Specifically, we construct a facial region relation graph and leverage the graph attention mechanism to model the relationships between facial regions. The resulting relational representation sequences, along with CNN-based appearance representation sequences, are then fed into a parallel graph attention fusion module for mutual interaction and enhancement. This module simultaneously explores the complementarity between different representation sequences and the temporal dynamics within each sequence. Experimental results on three facial expression recognition datasets demonstrate that the proposed ARPGNet outperforms or is comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MG-Nav在零样本视觉导航任务中表现出色，通过全局记忆引导规划和局部几何增强控制的结合，实现了最先进的性能，并在动态重排和未知场景条件下保持鲁棒性。

Abstract: We present MG-Nav (Memory-Guided Navigation), a dual-scale framework for zero-shot visual navigation that unifies global memory-guided planning with local geometry-enhanced control. At its core is the Sparse Spatial Memory Graph (SMG), a compact, region-centric memory where each node aggregates multi-view keyframe and object semantics, capturing both appearance and spatial structure while preserving viewpoint diversity. At the global level, the agent is localized on SMG and a goal-conditioned node path is planned via an image-to-instance hybrid retrieval, producing a sequence of reachable waypoints for long-horizon guidance. At the local level, a navigation foundation policy executes these waypoints in point-goal mode with obstacle-aware control, and switches to image-goal mode when navigating from the final node towards the visual target. To further enhance viewpoint alignment and goal recognition, we introduce VGGT-adapter, a lightweight geometric module built on the pre-trained VGGT model, which aligns observation and goal features in a shared 3D-aware space. MG-Nav operates global planning and local control at different frequencies, using periodic re-localization to correct errors. Experiments on HM3D Instance-Image-Goal and MP3D Image-Goal benchmarks demonstrate that MG-Nav achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance and remains robust under dynamic rearrangements and unseen scene conditions.

Abstract: Recently, the impressive generative capabilities of diffusion models have been demonstrated, producing images with remarkable fidelity. Particularly, existing methods for the 3D object generation tasks, which is one of the fastest-growing segments in computer vision, pre-dominantly use text-to-image diffusion models with textual inversion which train a pseudo text prompt to describe the given image. In practice, various text-to-image generative models employ textual inversion to learn concepts or styles of target object in the pseudo text prompt embedding space, thereby generating sophisticated outputs. However, textual inversion requires additional training time and lacks control ability. To tackle this issues, we propose two innovative methods: (1) using an off-the-shelf image adapter that generates 3D objects without textual inversion, offering enhanced control over conditions such as depth, pose, and text. (2) a depth conditioned warmup strategy to enhance 3D consistency. In experimental results, ours show qualitatively and quantitatively comparable performance and improved 3D consistency to the existing text-inversion-based alternatives. Furthermore, we conduct a user study to assess (i) how well results match the input image and (ii) whether 3D consistency is maintained. User study results show that our model outperforms the alternatives, validating the effectiveness of our approaches.

Conclusion: RobotSeg作为一种基础模型，在图像和视频中的机器人分割任务上达到了最先进的性能，为机器人感知的未来发展奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Accurate robot segmentation is a fundamental capability for robotic perception. It enables precise visual servoing for VLA systems, scalable robot-centric data augmentation, accurate real-to-sim transfer, and reliable safety monitoring in dynamic human-robot environments. Despite the strong capabilities of modern segmentation models, surprisingly it remains challenging to segment robots. This is due to robot embodiment diversity, appearance ambiguity, structural complexity, and rapid shape changes. Embracing these challenges, we introduce RobotSeg, a foundation model for robot segmentation in image and video. RobotSeg is built upon the versatile SAM 2 foundation model but addresses its three limitations for robot segmentation, namely the lack of adaptation to articulated robots, reliance on manual prompts, and the need for per-frame training mask annotations, by introducing a structure-enhanced memory associator, a robot prompt generator, and a label-efficient training strategy. These innovations collectively enable a structure-aware, automatic, and label-efficient solution. We further construct the video robot segmentation (VRS) dataset comprising over 2.8k videos (138k frames) with diverse robot embodiments and environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RobotSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on both images and videos, establishing a strong foundation for future advances in robot perception.

Conclusion: 该框架显著提高了多视图编辑的3D一致性，支持高质量的高斯泼溅编辑，细节清晰且忠实于用户指定的文本提示。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have greatly improved text-based image editing, yet methods that edit images independently often produce geometrically and photometrically inconsistent results across different views of the same scene. Such inconsistencies are particularly problematic for editing of 3D representations such as NeRFs or Gaussian Splat models. We propose a training-free diffusion framework that enforces multi-view consistency during the image editing process. The key assumption is that corresponding points in the unedited images should undergo similar transformations after editing. To achieve this, we introduce a consistency loss that guides the diffusion sampling toward coherent edits. The framework is flexible and can be combined with widely varying image editing methods, supporting both dense and sparse multi-view editing setups. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves 3D consistency compared to existing multi-view editing methods. We also show that this increased consistency enables high-quality Gaussian Splat editing with sharp details and strong fidelity to user-specified text prompts.

Conclusion: MrGS通过正交特征提取和物理原理的整合，成功实现了高保真的RGB-T场景重建，同时减少了高斯数量的需求。

Abstract: Recent advances in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved considerable performance in RGB scene reconstruction. However, multi-modal rendering that incorporates thermal infrared imagery remains largely underexplored. Existing approaches tend to neglect distinctive thermal characteristics, such as heat conduction and the Lambertian property. In this study, we introduce MrGS, a multi-modal radiance field based on 3DGS that simultaneously reconstructs both RGB and thermal 3D scenes. Specifically, MrGS derives RGB- and thermal-related information from a single appearance feature through orthogonal feature extraction and employs view-dependent or view-independent embedding strategies depending on the degree of Lambertian reflectance exhibited by each modality. Furthermore, we leverage two physics-based principles to effectively model thermal-domain phenomena. First, we integrate Fourier's law of heat conduction prior to alpha blending to model intensity interpolation caused by thermal conduction between neighboring Gaussians. Second, we apply the Stefan-Boltzmann law and the inverse-square law to formulate a depth-aware thermal radiation map that imposes additional geometric constraints on thermal rendering. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MrGS achieves high-fidelity RGB-T scene reconstruction while reducing the number of Gaussians.

TL;DR: 该研究提出利用生物医学文献中的复合图像作为多图像分析的数据源，开发了M3LLM模型，显著提升了医学MLLMs在多图像理解任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医学MLLMs大多局限于单图像理解，限制了其在临床工作流程中的适用性。医学诊断和进展通常需要综合来自不同模态或时间点的多图像信息，但缺乏大规模、高质量标注训练数据阻碍了此类模型的开发。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种可扩展且高效的范式，用于开发能够进行复合推理的医学多模态大语言模型（MLLMs），弥合了生物医学文献与现实世界临床应用之间的差距。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in advancing healthcare. However, most existing models remain confined to single-image understanding, which greatly limits their applicability in clinical workflows. In practice, medical diagnosis and progression often require synthesizing information across multiple images from different modalities or time points. The development of medical MLLMs capable of such multi-image understanding has been hindered by the lack of large-scale, high-quality annotated training data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that leverages license-permissive compound images in biomedical literature, as a rich yet underutilized data source for multi-image analysis. Specifically, we design a five-stage, context-aware instruction generation paradigm underpinned by a divide-and-conquer strategy. By decomposing multi-image analysis into manageable sub-tasks, this paradigm empowers MLLMs to move beyond single-panel analysis and provide a composite understanding by learning the complex spatial, temporal, and cross-modal relationships inherent in these compound figures. By parsing over 237,000 compound figures and their contextual text for instruction generation, we develop M3LLM, a medical multi-image multi-modal large language model. For benchmarking, we construct PMC-MI-Bench for composite understanding, manually validated by medical experts. Extensive experiments show that M3LLM significantly outperforms both general-purpose and specialized medical MLLMs across multi-image, single-image, text-only, and multi-choice scenarios. Notably, M3LLM exhibits strong generalization to longitudinal chest X-ray analysis using the MIMIC dataset. This work establishes a scalable and efficient paradigm for developing medical MLLMs capable of composite reasoning, bridging the gap between biomedical literature and real-world clinical applications.

Abstract: Achieving fully autonomous driving systems requires learning rational decisions in a wide span of scenarios, including safety-critical and out-of-distribution ones. However, such cases are underrepresented in real-world corpus collected by human experts. To complement for the lack of data diversity, we introduce a novel and scalable simulation framework capable of synthesizing massive unseen states upon existing driving logs. Our pipeline utilizes advanced neural rendering with a reactive environment to generate high-fidelity multi-view observations controlled by the perturbed ego trajectory. Furthermore, we develop a pseudo-expert trajectory generation mechanism for these newly simulated states to provide action supervision. Upon the synthesized data, we find that a simple co-training strategy on both real-world and simulated samples can lead to significant improvements in both robustness and generalization for various planning methods on challenging real-world benchmarks, up to +6.8 EPDMS on navhard and +2.9 on navtest. More importantly, such policy improvement scales smoothly by increasing simulation data only, even without extra real-world data streaming in. We further reveal several crucial findings of such a sim-real learning system, which we term SimScale, including the design of pseudo-experts and the scaling properties for different policy architectures. Our simulation data and code would be released.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖预训练的2DSR模型增强纹理，但存在跨视图不一致性和域差距导致的3D高斯模糊问题。

Method: 利用2DSR和深度估计模型生成高分辨率图像和深度图作为外部知识，结合多尺度3DGS模型生成跨视图一致、域自适应的内部知识，通过掩码引导融合策略整合两者。

Conclusion: IE-SRGS通过结合外部2DSR先验和内部3DGS特征，提出了一种新颖的3DGS超分辨率范式，有效解决了3D高斯模糊问题，并在实验中展现了优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution (HR) 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models from low-resolution (LR) inputs remains challenging due to the lack of fine-grained textures and geometry. Existing methods typically rely on pre-trained 2D super-resolution (2DSR) models to enhance textures, but suffer from 3D Gaussian ambiguity arising from cross-view inconsistencies and domain gaps inherent in 2DSR models. We propose IE-SRGS, a novel 3DGS SR paradigm that addresses this issue by jointly leveraging the complementary strengths of external 2DSR priors and internal 3DGS features. Specifically, we use 2DSR and depth estimation models to generate HR images and depth maps as external knowledge, and employ multi-scale 3DGS models to produce cross-view consistent, domain-adaptive counterparts as internal knowledge. A mask-guided fusion strategy is introduced to integrate these two sources and synergistically exploit their complementary strengths, effectively guiding the 3D Gaussian optimization toward high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that IE-SRGS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative accuracy and visual fidelity.

Motivation: 尽管现有的基础模型在3D显微镜图像分割中表现优异，但仍存在错误，需要人工校正。VessQC旨在通过不确定性引导的校正，提高分割的准确性和效率。

Method: VessQC整合不确定性地图，引导用户关注最可能包含生物学意义错误的区域。

Result: 初步用户研究表明，不确定性引导的校正将错误检测的召回率从67%显著提高到94.0%（p=0.007），且总编辑时间未显著增加。

Conclusion: VessQC作为一种开源工具，通过整合不确定性地图，显著提高了3D显微镜图像分割的准确性，且在不显著增加总编辑时间的情况下，提升了错误检测的召回率。

Abstract: Accurate 3D microscopy image segmentation is critical for quantitative bioimage analysis but even state-of-the-art foundation models yield error-prone results. Therefore, manual curation is still widely used for either preparing high-quality training data or fixing errors before analysis. We present VessQC, an open-source tool for uncertainty-guided curation of large 3D microscopy segmentations. By integrating uncertainty maps, VessQC directs user attention to regions most likely containing biologically meaningful errors. In a preliminary user study uncertainty-guided correction significantly improved error detection recall from 67% to 94.0% (p=0.007) without a significant increase in total curation time. VessQC thus enables efficient, human-in-the-loop refinement of volumetric segmentations and bridges a key gap in real-world applications between uncertainty estimation and practical human-computer interaction.

Motivation: AIGC-based图像编辑技术简化了图像篡改，带来了严重的伪造风险，需要一种新的篡改检测方法。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的策略，将整个图像转化为神经模型视角下的空白画布，并通过对抗性扰动和频率感知优化策略使SAM无法‘看到’任何内容，从而识别篡改区域。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够有效定位篡改区域。

Conclusion: 该方法通过引入对抗性扰动和频率感知优化策略，有效提升了基于SAM的篡改检测能力，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: AIGC-based image editing technology has greatly simplified the realistic-level image modification, causing serious potential risks of image forgery. This paper introduces a new approach to tampering detection using the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Instead of training SAM to identify tampered areas, we propose a novel strategy. The entire image is transformed into a blank canvas from the perspective of neural models. Any modifications to this blank canvas would be noticeable to the models. To achieve this idea, we introduce adversarial perturbations to prevent SAM from ``seeing anything'', allowing it to identify forged regions when the image is tampered with. Due to SAM's powerful perceiving capabilities, naive adversarial attacks cannot completely tame SAM. To thoroughly deceive SAM and make it blind to the image, we introduce a frequency-aware optimization strategy, which further enhances the capability of tamper localization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: TTSnap框架通过噪声感知剪枝和自蒸馏训练，显著提升了测试时扩展的效率，性能比现有方法提高了16%以上，并能与后训练技术和局部测试时优化结合使用。

Abstract: A prominent approach to test-time scaling for text-to-image diffusion models formulates the problem as a search over multiple noise seeds, selecting the one that maximizes a certain image-reward function. The effectiveness of this strategy heavily depends on the number and diversity of noise seeds explored. However, verifying each candidate is computationally expensive, because each must be fully denoised before a reward can be computed. This severely limits the number of samples that can be explored under a fixed budget. We propose test-time scaling with noise-aware pruning (TTSnap), a framework that prunes low-quality candidates without fully denoising them. The key challenge is that reward models are learned in the clean image domain, and the ranking of rewards predicted for intermediate estimates are often inconsistent with those predicted for clean images. To overcome this, we train noise-aware reward models via self-distillation to align the reward for intermediate estimates with that of the final clean images. To stabilize learning across different noise levels, we adopt a curriculum training strategy that progressively shifts the data domain from clean images to noise images. In addition, we introduce a new metric that measures reward alignment and computational budget utilization. Experiments demonstrate that our approach improves performance by over 16\% compared with existing methods, enabling more efficient and effective test-time scaling. It also provides orthogonal gains when combined with post-training techniques and local test-time optimization. Code: https://github.com/TerrysLearning/TTSnap/.

Conclusion: 通过语义锚定策略，该方法在保持预训练语义先验的同时，有效学习新的个性化视觉概念，显著提升了主题保真度和文本-图像对齐性能。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in generating diverse and realistic images from textual descriptions. However, they still struggle with personalization, which requires adapting a pretrained model to depict user-specific subjects from only a few reference images. The key challenge lies in learning a new visual concept from a limited number of reference images while preserving the pretrained semantic prior that maintains text-image alignment. When the model focuses on subject fidelity, it tends to overfit the limited reference images and fails to leverage the pretrained distribution. Conversely, emphasizing prior preservation maintains semantic consistency but prevents the model from learning new personalized attributes. Building on these observations, we propose the personalization process through a semantic anchoring that guides adaptation by grounding new concepts in their corresponding distributions. We therefore reformulate personalization as the process of learning a rare concept guided by its frequent counterpart through semantic anchoring. This anchoring encourages the model to adapt new concepts in a stable and controlled manner, expanding the pretrained distribution toward personalized regions while preserving its semantic structure. As a result, the proposed method achieves stable adaptation and consistent improvements in both subject fidelity and text-image alignment compared to baseline methods. Extensive experiments and ablation studies further demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed anchoring strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到随着潜在维度的增加，重建与生成之间存在持续的权衡：高容量自动编码器提高了重建保真度，但生成质量最终下降。

Method: 通过控制RGB和潜在域的扰动，分析编码器/解码器行为，并引入FreqWarm这一频率预热课程，增加扩散或流匹配训练早期阶段对高频潜在信号的暴露。

Result: FreqWarm在多个高维自动编码器中一致提高了生成质量：在Wan2.2-VAE上gFID降低了14.11，在LTX-VAE上降低了6.13，在DC-AE-f32上降低了4.42。

Conclusion: 通过引入FreqWarm这一频率预热课程，研究成功地将高维潜在空间转化为更适合扩散模型训练的目标，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Latent diffusion has become the default paradigm for visual generation, yet we observe a persistent reconstruction-generation trade-off as latent dimensionality increases: higher-capacity autoencoders improve reconstruction fidelity but generation quality eventually declines. We trace this gap to the different behaviors in high-frequency encoding and decoding. Through controlled perturbations in both RGB and latent domains, we analyze encoder/decoder behaviors and find that decoders depend strongly on high-frequency latent components to recover details, whereas encoders under-represent high-frequency contents, yielding insufficient exposure and underfitting in high-frequency bands for diffusion model training. To address this issue, we introduce FreqWarm, a plug-and-play frequency warm-up curriculum that increases early-stage exposure to high-frequency latent signals during diffusion or flow-matching training -- without modifying or retraining the autoencoder. Applied across several high-dimensional autoencoders, FreqWarm consistently improves generation quality: decreasing gFID by 14.11 on Wan2.2-VAE, 6.13 on LTX-VAE, and 4.42 on DC-AE-f32, while remaining architecture-agnostic and compatible with diverse backbones. Our study shows that explicitly managing frequency exposure can successfully turn high-dimensional latent spaces into more diffusible targets.

Abstract: Despite significant strides in medical foundation models, the ultrasound domain lacks a comprehensive solution capable of bridging low-level Ultrasound Grounded Perception (e.g., segmentation, localization) and high-level Ultrasound Comprehensive Interpretation (e.g., diagnosis, reasoning). To bridge this gap, we propose UMind-VL, a unified foundation model designed to synergize pixel-level structural understanding with complex clinical reasoning. We first introduce UMind-DS, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising 1.2 million ultrasound image-text pairs across 16 anatomical regions, enriching standard data with pixel-level annotations and clinician-validated rationales. Architecturally, UMind-VL incorporates a lightweight Dynamic Convolutional Mask Decoder that generates masks via dynamic kernels conditioned on LLM outputs. This design, combined with task-specific tokens, unifies segmentation, detection, geometric measurement, and diagnosis tasks within a single framework. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UMind-VL significantly outperforms existing generalist multimodal models and achieves performance on par with, or superior to, state-of-the-art specialist models across segmentation, detection, keypoint localization, and diagnostic reasoning benchmarks, while maintaining strong generalization ability. We demonstrate the capability of UMind-VL in Figure 1.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful representation for 3D scenes, widely adopted due to its exceptional efficiency and high-fidelity visual quality. Given the significant value of 3DGS assets, recent works have introduced specialized watermarking schemes to ensure copyright protection and ownership verification. However, can existing 3D Gaussian watermarking approaches genuinely guarantee robust protection of the 3D assets? In this paper, for the first time, we systematically explore and validate possible vulnerabilities of 3DGS watermarking frameworks. We demonstrate that conventional watermark removal techniques designed for 2D images do not effectively generalize to the 3DGS scenario due to the specialized rendering pipeline and unique attributes of each gaussian primitives. Motivated by this insight, we propose GSPure, the first watermark purification framework specifically for 3DGS watermarking representations. By analyzing view-dependent rendering contributions and exploiting geometrically accurate feature clustering, GSPure precisely isolates and effectively removes watermark-related Gaussian primitives while preserving scene integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GSPure achieves the best watermark purification performance, reducing watermark PSNR by up to 16.34dB while minimizing degradation to original scene fidelity with less than 1dB PSNR loss. Moreover, it consistently outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and generalization.

Abstract: Feed-forward reconstruction has recently gained significant attention, with VGGT being a notable example. However, directly applying VGGT to autonomous driving (AD) systems leads to sub-optimal results due to the different priors between the two tasks. In AD systems, several important new priors need to be considered: (i) The overlap between camera views is minimal, as autonomous driving sensor setups are designed to achieve coverage at a low cost. (ii) The camera intrinsics and extrinsics are known, which introduces more constraints on the output and also enables the estimation of absolute scale. (iii) Relative positions of all cameras remain fixed though the ego vehicle is in motion. To fully integrate these priors into a feed-forward framework, we propose DriveVGGT, a scale-aware 4D reconstruction framework specifically designed for autonomous driving data. Specifically, we propose a Temporal Video Attention (TVA) module to process multi-camera videos independently, which better leverages the spatiotemporal continuity within each single-camera sequence. Then, we propose a Multi-camera Consistency Attention (MCA) module to conduct window attention with normalized relative pose embeddings, aiming to establish consistency relationships across different cameras while restricting each token to attend only to nearby frames. Finally, we extend the standard VGGT heads by adding an absolute scale head and an ego vehicle pose head. Experiments show that DriveVGGT outperforms VGGT, StreamVGGT, fastVGGT on autonomous driving dataset while extensive ablation studies verify effectiveness of the proposed designs.

Conclusion: 本文提出了'patch collapse'作为一种新颖的图像建模视角，通过优化补丁实现顺序提升了视觉效率，并在自回归图像生成和图像分类任务中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Observing certain patches in an image reduces the uncertainty of others. Their realization lowers the distribution entropy of each remaining patch feature, analogous to collapsing a particle's wave function in quantum mechanics. This phenomenon can intuitively be called patch collapse. To identify which patches are most relied on during a target region's collapse, we learn an autoencoder that softly selects a subset of patches to reconstruct each target patch. Graphing these learned dependencies for each patch's PageRank score reveals the optimal patch order to realize an image. We show that respecting this order benefits various masked image modeling methods. First, autoregressive image generation can be boosted by retraining the state-of-the-art model MAR. Next, we introduce a new setup for image classification by exposing Vision Transformers only to high-rank patches in the collapse order. Seeing 22\% of such patches is sufficient to achieve high accuracy. With these experiments, we propose patch collapse as a novel image modeling perspective that promotes vision efficiency.

Conclusion: Match-and-Fuse方法在无需训练的情况下，通过图模型和特征融合实现了跨图像一致性生成，达到了最先进的视觉质量和一致性表现。

Abstract: We present Match-and-Fuse - a zero-shot, training-free method for consistent controlled generation of unstructured image sets - collections that share a common visual element, yet differ in viewpoint, time of capture, and surrounding content. Unlike existing methods that operate on individual images or densely sampled videos, our framework performs set-to-set generation: given a source set and user prompts, it produces a new set that preserves cross-image consistency of shared content. Our key idea is to model the task as a graph, where each node corresponds to an image and each edge triggers a joint generation of image pairs. This formulation consolidates all pairwise generations into a unified framework, enforcing their local consistency while ensuring global coherence across the entire set. This is achieved by fusing internal features across image pairs, guided by dense input correspondences, without requiring masks or manual supervision. It also allows us to leverage an emergent prior in text-to-image models that encourages coherent generation when multiple views share a single canvas. Match-and-Fuse achieves state-of-the-art consistency and visual quality, and unlocks new capabilities for content creation from image collections.

Conclusion: MVMAE和MVMAE-V2T通过结合结构化和文本监督，为构建可扩展且临床基础扎实的医学基础模型提供了互补路径。

Abstract: Building robust medical machine learning systems requires pretraining strategies that exploit the intrinsic structure present in clinical data. We introduce Multiview Masked Autoencoder (MVMAE), a self-supervised framework that leverages the natural multi-view organization of radiology studies to learn view-invariant and disease-relevant representations. MVMAE combines masked image reconstruction with cross-view alignment, transforming clinical redundancy across projections into a powerful self-supervisory signal. We further extend this approach with MVMAE-V2T, which incorporates radiology reports as an auxiliary text-based learning signal to enhance semantic grounding while preserving fully vision-based inference. Evaluated on a downstream disease classification task on three large-scale public datasets, MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert, and PadChest, MVMAE consistently outperforms supervised and vision-language baselines. Furthermore, MVMAE-V2T provides additional gains, particularly in low-label regimes where structured textual supervision is most beneficial. Together, these results establish the importance of structural and textual supervision as complementary paths toward scalable, clinically grounded medical foundation models.

Abstract: Object detection is the task of detecting objects in an image. In this task, the detection of small objects is particularly difficult. Other than the small size, it is also accompanied by difficulties due to blur, occlusion, and so on. Current small object detection methods are tailored to small and dense situations, such as pedestrians in a crowd or far objects in remote sensing scenarios. However, when the target object is small and sparse, there is a lack of objects available for training, making it more difficult to learn effective features. In this paper, we propose a specialized method for detecting a specific category of small objects; birds. Particularly, we improve the features learned by the neck; the sub-network between the backbone and the prediction head, to learn more effective features with a hierarchical design. We employ Swin Transformer to upsample the image features. Moreover, we change the shifted window size for adapting to small objects. Experiments show that the proposed Swin Transformer-based neck combined with CenterNet can lead to good performance by changing the window sizes. We further find that smaller window sizes (default 2) benefit mAPs for small object detection.

Conclusion: 该方法通过自动生成的语义引导和光流技术，实现了高质量且时间稳定的视频着色，无需特定颜色输入即可达到最先进的效果。

Abstract: Existing video colorization methods struggle with temporal flickering or demand extensive manual input. We propose a novel approach automating high-fidelity video colorization using rich semantic guidance derived from language and segmentation. We employ a language-conditioned diffusion model to colorize grayscale frames. Guidance is provided via automatically generated object masks and textual prompts; our primary automatic method uses a generic prompt, achieving state-of-the-art results without specific color input. Temporal stability is achieved by warping color information from previous frames using optical flow (RAFT); a correction step detects and fixes inconsistencies introduced by warping.

TL;DR: 研究发现MLLM评估中的提示格式偏差未被现有策略解决，且这些偏差独立于已知问题，影响评估可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示多模态大语言模型（MLLM）评估中未被探索的提示格式偏差，以质疑当前评估方法的可靠性。

Method: 通过大规模研究，分析了七种MLLM和五个VQA数据集中的48种不同提示格式变化，重点关注三个关键变化因素。

Result: 多选项视觉问答（VQA）对微小的提示格式变化高度敏感，即使这些变化在语义上是中立的，且这些偏差独立于已知的顺序偏差或模型对正确答案的置信度。

Conclusion: 现有的偏差缓解策略未能解决新发现的提示格式偏差，这质疑了当前多模态大语言模型（MLLM）评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in handling image-text inputs. A common way to assess this ability is through multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA). Earlier works have already revealed that these benchmarks are sensitive to answer choice order, a limitation that can be mitigated through careful design. Yet, we highlight additional, unexplored biases in prompt formatting that question the reliability of current MLLM evaluations. Specifically, we identify three key variation factors in prompt formatting and analyze their impact through a large-scale study involving $\mathbf{\text{seven}}$ MLLMs and $\mathbf{\text{five}}$ VQA datasets, spanning $\mathbf{48}$ distinct $\mathbf{\text{prompt format variations}}$. Our findings reveal that multiple-choice VQA is highly sensitive to minor prompt format changes, even when these changes are semantically neutral. We further demonstrate that these biases persist independently of known order biases or the MLLM's confidence in the correct answer. Finally, we demonstrate that existing bias mitigation strategies fail to address these newly identified biases.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进NFs生成质量和分类准确性的新对齐策略，实验显示效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准NFs的生成质量受限于对数似然优化的语义表示不足，因此需要改进其语义表示能力。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的对齐策略，利用NFs的可逆性，将生成（反向）过程的中间特征与强大的视觉基础模型的表示对齐，并引入了一种无需训练、测试时优化的分类算法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法将NFs的训练速度提高了3.3倍以上，同时在生成质量和分类准确性上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在ImageNet 64×64和256×256上为NFs建立了新的最先进结果，显著提升了生成质量和分类准确性。

Abstract: Normalizing Flows (NFs) are a class of generative models distinguished by a mathematically invertible architecture, where the forward pass transforms data into a latent space for density estimation, and the reverse pass generates new samples from this space. This characteristic creates an intrinsic synergy between representation learning and data generation. However, the generative quality of standard NFs is limited by poor semantic representations from log-likelihood optimization. To remedy this, we propose a novel alignment strategy that creatively leverages the invertibility of NFs: instead of regularizing the forward pass, we align the intermediate features of the generative (reverse) pass with representations from a powerful vision foundation model, demonstrating superior effectiveness over naive alignment. We also introduce a novel training-free, test-time optimization algorithm for classification, which provides a more intrinsic evaluation of the NF's embedded semantic knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the training of NFs by over 3.3$\times$, while simultaneously delivering significant improvements in both generative quality and classification accuracy. New state-of-the-art results for NFs are established on ImageNet 64$\times$64 and 256$\times$256. Our code is available at https://github.com/MCG-NJU/FlowBack.

*Anshul Bagaria*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: INSIGHT 是一个多模态框架，通过分层超分辨率、Grad-CAM定位和CLIP语义对齐，实现了对AI生成图像的鲁棒检测和透明解释，尤其在低分辨率下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着GAN和扩散模型生成的AI图像日益逼真，视觉媒体的可靠性问题日益突出。尽管深度伪造检测取得显著进展，但当前取证系统在真实世界条件下（如下采样、压缩和跨域分布偏移）性能急剧下降，且缺乏透明性，阻碍了在高风险场景中的应用。

Method: INSIGHT 结合了分层超分辨率放大细微取证线索、Grad-CAM驱动的多尺度定位揭示生成模式的空间区域，以及CLIP引导的语义对齐将视觉异常映射到人类可理解的描述符。通过结构化ReAct + Chain-of-Thought协议生成一致、细粒度的解释，并通过双阶段G-Eval + LLM-as-a-judge流程验证以减少幻觉并确保事实性。

Result: INSIGHT 在包括动物、车辆和抽象合成场景在内的多样化领域中，显著提升了极端退化条件下的检测鲁棒性和解释质量，优于先前的检测器和黑盒VLM基线。

Conclusion: INSIGHT 在极端退化条件下显著提高了检测鲁棒性和解释质量，为透明、可靠的AI生成图像取证提供了实用路径，并标志着可信多模态内容验证的进步。

Abstract: The growing realism of AI-generated images produced by recent GAN and diffusion models has intensified concerns over the reliability of visual media. Yet, despite notable progress in deepfake detection, current forensic systems degrade sharply under real-world conditions such as severe downsampling, compression, and cross-domain distribution shifts. Moreover, most detectors operate as opaque classifiers, offering little insight into why an image is flagged as synthetic, undermining trust and hindering adoption in high-stakes settings.
  We introduce INSIGHT (Interpretable Neural Semantic and Image-based Generative-forensic Hallucination Tracing), a unified multimodal framework for robust detection and transparent explanation of AI-generated images, even at extremely low resolutions (16x16 - 64x64). INSIGHT combines hierarchical super-resolution for amplifying subtle forensic cues without inducing misleading artifacts, Grad-CAM driven multi-scale localization to reveal spatial regions indicative of generative patterns, and CLIP-guided semantic alignment to map visual anomalies to human-interpretable descriptors. A vision-language model is then prompted using a structured ReAct + Chain-of-Thought protocol to produce consistent, fine-grained explanations, verified through a dual-stage G-Eval + LLM-as-a-judge pipeline to minimize hallucinations and ensure factuality.
  Across diverse domains, including animals, vehicles, and abstract synthetic scenes, INSIGHT substantially improves both detection robustness and explanation quality under extreme degradation, outperforming prior detectors and black-box VLM baselines. Our results highlight a practical path toward transparent, reliable AI-generated image forensics and establish INSIGHT as a step forward in trustworthy multimodal content verification.

Motivation: 现有遥感任务中的多模态推理模型存在伪推理问题，即模型仅描述推理过程而非基于视觉证据进行真实推理。

Method: 提出了RS-EoT范式，包括SocraticAgent自玩多代理系统和两阶段渐进式RL策略。

Result: RS-EoT在多个遥感视觉问答和接地基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RS-EoT通过语言驱动的迭代视觉证据搜索范式，有效缓解了Glance Effect，实现了基于真实视觉证据的推理。

Abstract: Recent multimodal reasoning models, inspired by DeepSeek-R1, have significantly advanced vision-language systems. However, in remote sensing (RS) tasks, we observe widespread pseudo reasoning: models narrate the process of reasoning rather than genuinely reason toward the correct answer based on visual evidence. We attribute this to the Glance Effect, where a single, coarse perception of large-scale RS imagery results in incomplete understanding and reasoning based on linguistic self-consistency instead of visual evidence. To address this, we propose RS-EoT (Remote Sensing Evidence-of-Thought), a language-driven, iterative visual evidence-seeking paradigm. To instill this paradigm, we propose SocraticAgent, a self-play multi-agent system that synthesizes reasoning traces via alternating cycles of reasoning and visual inspection. To enhance and generalize these patterns, we propose a two-stage progressive RL strategy: first, RL on fine-grained Grounding tasks to enhance RS-EoT capabilities, followed by RL on RS VQA to generalize to broader understanding scenarios. Experiments show RS-EoT achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple RS VQA and grounding benchmarks. Analyses reveal clear iterative cycles of reasoning and evidence seeking, confirming RS-EoT mitigates the Glance Effect and enables genuine evidence-grounded reasoning.

TL;DR: AnchorFlow通过全局潜在锚点一致性设计，解决了无训练3D编辑中的几何不稳定问题，无需掩码即可保持高质量编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无训练3D编辑方法因时间步依赖噪声引入的潜在锚点不一致，导致编辑效果弱或几何不稳定。

Method: AnchorFlow基于潜在锚点一致性原则，建立源与目标轨迹间的全局潜在锚点，采用松弛锚点对齐损失和锚点对齐更新规则确保编辑稳定性。

Result: 在Eval3DEdit基准测试中，AnchorFlow能稳定生成语义对齐且结构鲁棒的编辑结果。

Conclusion: AnchorFlow通过引入全局潜在锚点和一致性损失，显著提升了3D编辑的几何稳定性和语义忠实度，无需掩码监督即可保持几何保真度。

Abstract: Training-free 3D editing aims to modify 3D shapes based on human instructions without model finetuning. It plays a crucial role in 3D content creation. However, existing approaches often struggle to produce strong or geometrically stable edits, largely due to inconsistent latent anchors introduced by timestep-dependent noise during diffusion sampling. To address these limitations, we introduce AnchorFlow, which is built upon the principle of latent anchor consistency. Specifically, AnchorFlow establishes a global latent anchor shared between the source and target trajectories, and enforces coherence using a relaxed anchor-alignment loss together with an anchor-aligned update rule. This design ensures that transformations remain stable and semantically faithful throughout the editing process. By stabilizing the latent reference space, AnchorFlow enables more pronounced semantic modifications. Moreover, AnchorFlow is mask-free. Without mask supervision, it effectively preserves geometric fidelity. Experiments on the Eval3DEdit benchmark show that AnchorFlow consistently delivers semantically aligned and structurally robust edits across diverse editing types.

Motivation: 解决DocVQA任务中模型在准确性与效率之间的权衡问题，提升紧凑学生模型的定位性能。

Method: 提出DocVAL框架，包含教师监督、多模块验证器（VAL）和两阶段学生训练方案。

Result: 学生模型（Gemma-3 12B）在DocVQA任务上达到91.4% ANLS和82.4% mAP，验证反馈和迭代优化分别贡献6.3和9.7 mAP提升。

Conclusion: DocVAL框架通过验证链式思维蒸馏显著提升了学生模型的定位性能，并发布了高质量的训练数据以推动文档理解研究。

Abstract: Document visual question answering (DocVQA) requires models to jointly reason over textual content and spatial layout, yet current systems exhibit a sharp accuracy--efficiency trade-off: large teacher models achieve strong grounding but are too expensive for deployment, while compact students suffer substantial drops in localization performance. We propose DocVAL, a validated chain-of-thought distillation framework that transfers the spatial reasoning ability of a large teacher into a deployable student VLM through three key components: (1) teacher supervision with validation-time text detection to filter and denoise training signals, (2) a multi-module validator (VAL) that enforces answer correctness and geometric consistency while producing fine-grained, pixel-level error feedback, and (3) a two-stage student training scheme that first learns from validated CoT traces and then undergoes iterative refinement driven by VAL feedback. Our student (Gemma-3 12B) achieves 91.4\% ANLS and 82.4\% mAP on DocVQA as a pure VLM requiring no text detection or OCR at inference. Extensive ablations demonstrate that validated feedback contributes 6.3 mAP gain and iterative refinement accounts for 9.7 mAP improvement. We release 95k high-quality, validator-verified CoT traces to advance spatial reasoning research in document understanding.

Conclusion: CoT4AD 在开放和闭环评估中均实现了最先进的性能，验证了其在自动驾驶中增强数值和因果推理的有效性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently attracted growing attention in end-to-end autonomous driving for their strong reasoning capabilities and rich world knowledge. However, existing VLAs often suffer from limited numerical reasoning ability and overly simplified input-output mappings, which hinder their performance in complex driving scenarios requiring step-by-step causal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose CoT4AD, a novel VLA framework that introduces Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for autonomous driving to enhance both numerical and causal reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). CoT4AD integrates visual observations and language instructions to perform semantic reasoning, scene understanding, and trajectory planning. During training, it explicitly models a perception-question-prediction-action CoT to align the reasoning space with the action space across multiple driving tasks. During inference, it performs implicit CoT reasoning to enable consistent numerical reasoning and robust decision-making in dynamic environments. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulated benchmarks, including nuScenes and Bench2Drive, demonstrate that CoT4AD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop evaluations. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Motivation: 由于真实无人机数据收集受限于空域法规、隐私问题和环境变化，且手动标注3D姿态和跨模态对应关系耗时昂贵，因此需要开发高质量合成数据集。

Conclusion: UAV-MM3D数据集和LGFusionNet为低空无人机感知和运动理解提供了高保真多模态合成数据及基准方法，推动了无人机3D感知技术的发展。

Abstract: Accurate perception of UAVs in complex low-altitude environments is critical for airspace security and related intelligent systems. Developing reliable solutions requires large-scale, accurately annotated, and multimodal data. However, real-world UAV data collection faces inherent constraints due to airspace regulations, privacy concerns, and environmental variability, while manual annotation of 3D poses and cross-modal correspondences is time-consuming and costly. To overcome these challenges, we introduce UAV-MM3D, a high-fidelity multimodal synthetic dataset for low-altitude UAV perception and motion understanding. It comprises 400K synchronized frames across diverse scenes (urban areas, suburbs, forests, coastal regions) and weather conditions (clear, cloudy, rainy, foggy), featuring multiple UAV models (micro, small, medium-sized) and five modalities - RGB, IR, LiDAR, Radar, and DVS (Dynamic Vision Sensor). Each frame provides 2D/3D bounding boxes, 6-DoF poses, and instance-level annotations, enabling core tasks related to UAVs such as 3D detection, pose estimation, target tracking, and short-term trajectory forecasting. We further propose LGFusionNet, a LiDAR-guided multimodal fusion baseline, and a dedicated UAV trajectory prediction baseline to facilitate benchmarking. With its controllable simulation environment, comprehensive scenario coverage, and rich annotations, UAV3D offers a public benchmark for advancing 3D perception of UAVs.

Motivation: 探讨不同CoT设计如何影响视觉语言模型（VLMs）在通用视觉推理能力上的表现，尤其是为什么某些CoT设计有效以及哪些设计真正支持泛化推理。

Method: 通过一个受控的迷宫解决基准测试，比较了三种代表性的CoT格式：语言CoT、定位CoT（带有空间坐标轨迹）和视觉CoT（带有图像操作）。使用Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型，采用标准的SFT-then-RL流程进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，视觉和较长的CoT主要加速收敛但未提升最终性能上限；简洁的CoT（仅含必要定位步骤）优于长轨迹；仅保留最小定位结果的CoT在不同迷宫尺寸中泛化能力最佳。

Conclusion: 研究发现，简洁的CoT设计（仅包含必要的定位步骤）在迷宫任务中表现最佳，且具有更好的泛化能力。这一发现强调了‘短即是长’效应，并为构建更具泛化能力的视觉推理SFT数据集提供了实用指导。

Abstract: We study how different Chain-of-Thought (CoT) designs affect the acquisition of the generalizable visual reasoning ability in vision-language models (VLMs). While CoT data, especially long or visual CoT such as "think with image", has been widely used to supervise intermediate reasoning, it remains unclear why specific CoT designs help and which ones truly support generalizable reasoning. To systematically evaluate this, we focus on a controlled maze-solving benchmark where reasoning rules are fully visual, difficulty can be tuned by grid size, and all the intermediate steps can be automatically generated. Using Qwen2.5-VL-7B under a standard SFT-then-RL pipeline, we compare three representative CoT formats: Language CoT, Grounding CoT (with spatial coordinate trajectories), and Visual CoT (with image manipulations). Our experiments reveal that visual and longer CoT mainly accelerate convergence but do not lift the final performance ceiling; concise CoT containing only essential grounding steps outperforms longer traces; and, strikingly, CoT retaining only the minimal grounding results generalizes best across different maze sizes. We further validate these insights on other vision-centric tasks. These findings highlight a "short is long" effect and provide practical guidance for constructing more generalizable SFT datasets for visual reasoning.

Conclusion: DiffStyle360 提出了一种无需针对每种风格进行训练的扩散框架，能够在多种艺术领域中生成多视角一致且保留身份特征的3D头部风格化效果，其性能优于现有的基于GAN和扩散的风格化方法。

Abstract: 3D head stylization has emerged as a key technique for reimagining realistic human heads in various artistic forms, enabling expressive character design and creative visual experiences in digital media. Despite the progress in 3D-aware generation, existing 3D head stylization methods often rely on computationally expensive optimization or domain-specific fine-tuning to adapt to new styles. To address these limitations, we propose DiffStyle360, a diffusion-based framework capable of producing multi-view consistent, identity-preserving 3D head stylizations across diverse artistic domains given a single style reference image, without requiring per-style training. Building upon the 3D-aware DiffPortrait360 architecture, our approach introduces two key components: the Style Appearance Module, which disentangles style from content, and the Style Fusion Attention mechanism, which adaptively balances structure preservation and stylization fidelity in the latent space. Furthermore, we employ a 3D GAN-generated multi-view dataset for robust fine-tuning and introduce a temperaturebased key scaling strategy to control stylization intensity during inference. Extensive experiments on FFHQ and RenderMe360 demonstrate that DiffStyle360 achieves superior style quality, outperforming state-of-the-art GAN- and diffusion-based stylization methods across challenging style domains.

Conclusion: HarmoCLIP 成功地在 CLIP 中平衡了全局和局部表征，通过引入显式的细粒度语义监督项和区域-语言对齐策略，显著提升了性能，同时保持了全局语义一致性。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has demonstrated remarkable generalization ability and strong performance across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the lack of region-level supervision, CLIP exhibits limited fine-grained semantic understanding. Although several methods attempt to mitigate this issue, they unintentionally disrupt the global alignment, resulting in a persistent trade-off where improving local perception simultaneously degrades global coherence. In this paper, we propose HarmoCLIP, a novel framework designed to harmonize global and region representations within CLIP. We first identify that the absence of direct alignment between local textual and visual semantics is the fundamental cause of the trade-off. To address this, HarmoCLIP introduces an explicit fine-grained semantic supervision term that directly aligns textual segments with their corresponding visual regions, effectively bridging the image region space and the textual space. To further strengthen the representation capability at the local level, our method introduces a novel Region-Language Alignment supervision strategy that promotes fine-grained semantic learning without compromising global semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HarmoCLIP achieves state-of-the-art (improvement up to 69.78%) performance on the global task of retrieval and yields a substantial 3.2% improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the region task of bounding-box classification, consistently outperforming prior approaches while providing a balanced, efficient, and plug-and-play solution to the global-local trade-off in CLIP.

Conclusion: WUKONG框架通过利用基于流的生成先验和优化传输质心问题，实现了高保真度的3D变形，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: We present WUKONG, a novel training-free framework for high-fidelity textured 3D morphing that takes a pair of source and target prompts (image or text) as input. Unlike conventional methods -- which rely on manual correspondence matching and deformation trajectory estimation (limiting generalization and requiring costly preprocessing) -- WUKONG leverages the generative prior of flow-based transformers to produce high-fidelity 3D transitions with rich texture details. To ensure smooth shape transitions, we exploit the inherent continuity of flow-based generative processes and formulate morphing as an optimal transport barycenter problem. We further introduce a sequential initialization strategy to prevent abrupt geometric distortions and preserve identity coherence. For faithful texture preservation, we propose a similarity-guided semantic consistency mechanism that selectively retains high-frequency details and enables precise control over blending dynamics. This avoids common artifacts like oversmoothing while maintaining semantic fidelity. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that WUKONG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior results across diverse geometry and texture variations.

However, we find that current models struggle with fine geometry and robustness due to (\textit{i}) the scarcity of high-fidelity depth and pose supervision and (\textit{ii}) the inherent geometric misalignment from multi-view pointmap regression. Fin3R jointly tackles two issues with an extra lightweight fine-tuning step. We freeze the decoder, which handles view matching, and fine-tune only the image encoder-the component dedicated to feature extraction. The encoder is enriched with fine geometric details distilled from a strong monocular teacher model on large, unlabeled datasets, using a custom, lightweight LoRA adapter. We validate our method on a wide range of models, including DUSt3R, MASt3R, CUT3R, and VGGT. The fine-tuned models consistently deliver sharper boundaries, recover complex structures, and achieve higher geometric accuracy in both single- and multi-view settings, while adding only the tiny LoRA weights, which leave test-time memory and latency virtually unchanged.

Conclusion: ReAG通过结合粗粒度和细粒度检索与批评模型，显著提升了知识密集型VQA任务的性能，并在多个数据集上验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in jointly understanding text, images, and videos, often evaluated via Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, even state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle with domain-specific or knowledge-intensive queries, where relevant information is underrepresented in pre-training data. Knowledge-based VQA (KB-VQA) addresses this by retrieving external documents to condition answer generation, but current retrieval-augmented approaches suffer from low precision, noisy passages, and limited reasoning. To address this, we propose ReAG, a novel Reasoning-Augmented Multimodal RAG approach that combines coarse- and fine-grained retrieval with a critic model that filters irrelevant passages, ensuring high-quality additional context. The model follows a multi-stage training strategy leveraging reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning over retrieved content, while supervised fine-tuning serves only as a cold start. Extensive experiments on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek demonstrate that ReAG significantly outperforms prior methods, improving answer accuracy and providing interpretable reasoning grounded in retrieved evidence.

Motivation: 现有方法中LLM孤立于识别模型且缺乏性能反馈，导致无法提供区分相似动作的关键线索。

Method: 提出SkeletonAgent框架，包含Questioner和Selector两个代理：Questioner识别易混淆类别并作为上下文提供给LLM，Selector解析LLM响应并提取关节级约束反馈给识别模型。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D、NTU RGB+D 120、Kinetics-Skeleton、FineGYM和UAV-Human五个基准测试中，SkeletonAgent均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SkeletonAgent通过两个协作代理（Questioner和Selector）有效结合了识别模型与大型语言模型（LLM），显著提升了骨架动作识别的性能，并在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in skeleton-based action recognition increasingly leverage semantic priors from Large Language Models (LLMs) to enrich skeletal representations. However, the LLM is typically queried in isolation from the recognition model and receives no performance feedback. As a result, it often fails to deliver the targeted discriminative cues critical to distinguish similar actions. To overcome these limitations, we propose SkeletonAgent, a novel framework that bridges the recognition model and the LLM through two cooperative agents, i.e., Questioner and Selector. Specifically, the Questioner identifies the most frequently confused classes and supplies them to the LLM as context for more targeted guidance. Conversely, the Selector parses the LLM's response to extract precise joint-level constraints and feeds them back to the recognizer, enabling finer-grained cross-modal alignment. Comprehensive evaluations on five benchmarks, including NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, FineGYM, and UAV-Human, demonstrate that SkeletonAgent consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark methods.

Motivation: 计算病理学中因染色协议、扫描设备和成像设置的差异导致领域偏移，现有视觉语言模型（如PLIP）的零样本性能受限于提示敏感性，且缺乏领域特定提示的语义描述符。

Method: 提出了领域不变提示调优（DIPT），通过学习每个领域的多个输入标记并跨领域平均，生成领域不变提示，从而增强知识蒸馏过程。

Result: DIPT方法在组织病理学数据集的领域泛化任务中，显著提升了现有最先进知识蒸馏方法的平均F1分数。

Conclusion: DIPT方法通过多领域训练和领域不变提示学习，显著提升了计算病理学中的领域泛化能力，为异构数据源的临床问题提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Domain generalization is critical in computational pathology (CPath) due to inherent domain shifts caused by variations in staining protocols, scanner devices, and imaging settings across clinical centers. Vision-language models (VLMs), such as PLIP-a pathology-tuned CLIP-trained on image-text pairs across diverse domains, serve as strong knowledge distillation sources. However, their zero-shot performance with predefined prompts remains limited due to sensitivity to prompt variations. Moreover, unlike natural images, histopathology centers lack semantic descriptors (e.g., 'sketch'), making it difficult to define domain-specific prompts for clinical centers. This requires a data-driven approach for learning domain-specific and ultimately class-generic continuous prompts. We propose Domain Invariant Prompt Tuning (DIPT) for knowledge distillation process, a novel step that learns multiple input tokens for each domain. These tokens are trained separately for each domain and are averaged across domains, leading to domain-invariant prompts. Our student model then distills knowledge from PLIP's text encoder by leveraging the prompts learned by DIPT. This leads to alignment of visual features with domain-invariant embeddings, enhancing generalization by training on multiple domains. Our method adds a significant improvement in average F1-score to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) knowledge distillation approaches in domain generalization with histopathology datasets. This work helps the way of deploying robust CPath models in real-world clinical problems with heterogeneous data sources.

Conclusion: ABounD在少样本多类工业异常检测任务中表现出色，通过动态概念融合和对抗性边界锻造，实现了精确的决策边界和语义对齐，在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot multi-class industrial anomaly detection remains a challenging task. Vision-language models need to be both category-adaptive and sharply discriminative, yet data scarcity often blurs the boundary between normal and abnormal states. This ambiguity leads to missed subtle defects and the rejection of atypical normal samples. We propose ABounD, an Adversarial Boundary-Driven few-shot learning for multi-class anomaly detection, which is a unified learning framework that integrates semantic concept learning with decision boundary shaping. The Dynamic Concept Fusion (DCF) module produces class-adaptive prompts by fusing generalizable priors with class-specific cues, conditioned on image features. Meanwhile, Adversarial Boundary Forging (ABF) sculpts a more precise decision margin by generating boundary-level fence features via PGD-style perturbations. Training is conducted in a single stage under a Concept-Boundary Loss, where ABF provides the main supervisory signal and semantic-spatial regularizers stabilize the optimization. This synergy yields a decision boundary that closely follows normal data while preserving flexibility and robust semantic alignment. Experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in the task of few-shot multi-class anomaly detection.

Motivation: To develop and evaluate a three channel denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) for synthesizing single breast dual view mammograms and assess the impact of channel representations on image fidelity and cross view consistency.

Method: A pretrained three channel DDPM was fine-tuned on a private dataset of 11020 screening mammograms to generate paired CC and MLO views, evaluating three third channel encodings: sum, absolute difference, and zero channel. Quantitative and qualitative assessments were performed.

Result: Synthetic mammograms showed comparable IoU and DSC distributions to real images, with models using sum or absolute difference encodings outperforming others. Generated views maintained cross-view consistency, with 6-8% exhibiting artifacts.

Conclusion: Three channel DDPMs can generate realistic and anatomically consistent dual view mammograms with promising applications in dataset augmentation.

Abstract: Purpose: This study aims to develop and evaluate a three channel denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) for synthesizing single breast dual view mammograms and to assess the impact of channel representations on image fidelity and cross view consistency. Materials and Methods: A pretrained three channel DDPM, sourced from Hugging Face, was fine tuned on a private dataset of 11020 screening mammograms to generate paired craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views. Three third channel encodings of the CC and MLO views were evaluated: sum, absolute difference, and zero channel. Each model produced 500 synthetic image pairs. Quantitative assessment involved breast mask segmentation using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), with distributional comparisons against 2500 real pairs using Earth Movers Distance (EMD) and Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) tests. Qualitative evaluation included a visual Turing test by a non expert radiologist to assess cross view consistency and artifacts. Results: Synthetic mammograms showed IoU and DSC distributions comparable to real images, with EMD and KS values (0.020 and 0.077 respectively). Models using sum or absolute difference encodings outperformed others in IoU and DSC (p < 0.001), though distributions remained broadly similar. Generated CC and MLO views maintained cross view consistency, with 6 to 8 percent of synthetic images exhibiting artifacts consistent with those in the training data. Conclusion: Three channel DDPMs can generate realistic and anatomically consistent dual view mammograms with promising applications in dataset augmentation.

Conclusion: FauxNet在零样本检测和生成技术归因方面表现优异，并提出了新的数据集Authentica-Vox和Authentica-HDTF，这些数据集将公开提供。

Abstract: Deepfake generation has witnessed remarkable progress, contributing to highly realistic generated images, videos, and audio. While technically intriguing, such progress has raised serious concerns related to the misuse of manipulated media. To mitigate such misuse, robust and reliable deepfake detection is urgently needed. Towards this, we propose a novel network FauxNet, which is based on pre-trained Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) features. By extracting temporal VSR features from videos, we identify and segregate real videos from manipulated ones. The holy grail in this context has to do with zero-shot detection, i.e., generalizable detection, which we focus on in this work. FauxNet consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art in this setting. In addition, FauxNet is able to attribute - distinguish between generation techniques from which the videos stem. Finally, we propose new datasets, referred to as Authentica-Vox and Authentica-HDTF, comprising about 38,000 real and fake videos in total, the latter created with six recent deepfake generation techniques. We provide extensive analysis and results on the Authentica datasets and FaceForensics++, demonstrating the superiority of FauxNet. The Authentica datasets will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 量子点（QDs）是量子处理器的关键平台，但大规模阵列需要可靠的自动调谐策略，其中准确识别CSDs中的设备状态至关重要。

Method: 本研究评估了四种现代机器学习架构（U-Nets、视觉变换器ViTs、MDNs和CNNs）在双量子点CSDs中的多类状态识别性能，比较了它们在合成和实验数据上的表现及不同归一化方案的影响。

Result: U-Nets和ViTs在合成数据上表现最佳（MSE得分>0.98），但泛化到实验数据失败；MDNs计算效率高但性能较低；CNNs在实验数据上实现了最佳权衡（高精度且参数少）。归一化方案中，min-max缩放得分更高但收敛不稳定，z-score归一化训练更稳定但精度较低。

Conclusion: CNN结合min-max归一化是处理量子点电荷稳定性图（CSDs）的实用方法，在实验数据上表现出色且计算效率高。

Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are a leading platform for scalable quantum processors. However, scaling to large arrays requires reliable, automated tuning strategies for devices' bootstrapping, calibration, and operation, with many tuning aspects depending on accurately identifying QD device states from charge-stability diagrams (CSDs). In this work, we present a comprehensive benchmarking study of four modern machine learning (ML) architectures for multi-class state recognition in double-QD CSDs. We evaluate their performance across different data budgets and normalization schemes using both synthetic and experimental data. We find that the more resource-intensive models -- U-Nets and visual transformers (ViTs) -- achieve the highest MSE score (defined as $1-\mathrm{MSE}$) on synthetic data (over $0.98$) but fail to generalize to experimental data. MDNs are the most computationally efficient and exhibit highly stable training, but with substantially lower peak performance. CNNs offer the most favorable trade-off on experimental CSDs, achieving strong accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer parameters than the U-Nets and ViTs. Normalization plays a nontrivial role: min-max scaling generally yields higher MSE scores but less stable convergence, whereas z-score normalization produces more predictable training dynamics but at reduced accuracy for most models. Overall, our study shows that CNNs with min-max normalization are a practical approach for QD CSDs.

Conclusion: IntentHQ提供了一个新的基准，将深度伪造视频分析的焦点从真实性验证转向意图理解，为未来研究提供了重要方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has led to increasingly realistic deepfake videos, posing significant societal and security risks. While existing detection methods focus on distinguishing real from fake videos, such approaches fail to address a fundamental question: What is the intent behind a manipulated video? Towards addressing this question, we introduce IntentHQ: a new benchmark for human-centered intent analysis, shifting the paradigm from authenticity verification to contextual understanding of videos. IntentHQ consists of 5168 videos that have been meticulously collected and annotated with 23 fine-grained intent-categories, including "Financial fraud", "Indirect marketing", "Political propaganda", as well as "Fear mongering". We perform intent recognition with supervised and self-supervised multi-modality models that integrate spatio-temporal video features, audio processing, and text analysis to infer underlying motivations and goals behind videos. Our proposed model is streamlined to differentiate between a wide range of intent-categories.

Abstract: We explore inference-time scaling in text-guided 3D diffusion models to enhance generative quality without additional training. To this end, we introduce ITS3D, a framework that formulates the task as an optimization problem to identify the most effective Gaussian noise input. The framework is driven by a verifier-guided search algorithm, where the search algorithm iteratively refines noise candidates based on verifier feedback. To address the inherent challenges of 3D generation, we introduce three techniques for improved stability, efficiency, and exploration capability. 1) Gaussian normalization is applied to stabilize the search process. It corrects distribution shifts when noise candidates deviate from a standard Gaussian distribution during iterative updates. 2) The high-dimensional nature of the 3D search space increases computational complexity. To mitigate this, a singular value decomposition-based compression technique is employed to reduce dimensionality while preserving effective search directions. 3) To further prevent convergence to suboptimal local minima, a singular space reset mechanism dynamically updates the search space based on diversity measures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ITS3D enhances text-to-3D generation quality, which shows the potential of computationally efficient search methods in generative processes.

Abstract: We propose a method to reconstruct dynamic fire in 3D from a limited set of camera views with a Gaussian-based spatiotemporal representation. Capturing and reconstructing fire and its dynamics is highly challenging due to its volatile nature, transparent quality, and multitude of high-frequency features. Despite these challenges, we aim to reconstruct fire from only three views, which consequently requires solving for under-constrained geometry. We solve this by separating the static background from the dynamic fire region by combining dense multi-view stereo images with monocular depth priors. The fire is initialized as a 3D flow field, obtained by fusing per-view dense optical flow projections. To capture the high frequency features of fire, each 3D Gaussian encodes a lifetime and linear velocity to match the dense optical flow. To ensure sub-frame temporal alignment across cameras we employ a custom hardware synchronization pattern -- allowing us to reconstruct fire with affordable commodity hardware. Our quantitative and qualitative validations across numerous reconstruction experiments demonstrate robust performance for diverse and challenging real fire scenarios.

Result: CORTEX能够推理视觉和文本特征，捕捉仅凭视觉特征难以识别的变化。

Conclusion: CORTEX通过结合视觉和文本特征，显著提升了变化描述的能力，尤其是在捕捉细微但有意义的变化方面。

Abstract: Change captioning aims to describe changes between a pair of images. However, existing works rely on visual features alone, which often fail to capture subtle but meaningful changes because they lack the ability to represent explicitly structured information such as object relationships and compositional semantics. To alleviate this, we present CORTEX (COmpositional Reasoning-aware TEXt-guided), a novel framework that integrates complementary textual cues to enhance change understanding. In addition to capturing cues from pixel-level differences, CORTEX utilizes scene-level textual knowledge provided by Vision Language Models (VLMs) to extract richer image text signals that reveal underlying compositional reasoning. CORTEX consists of three key modules: (i) an Image-level Change Detector that identifies low-level visual differences between paired images, (ii) a Reasoning-aware Text Extraction (RTE) module that use VLMs to generate compositional reasoning descriptions implicit in visual features, and (iii) an Image-Text Dual Alignment (ITDA) module that aligns visual and textual features for fine-grained relational reasoning. This enables CORTEX to reason over visual and textual features and capture changes that are otherwise ambiguous in visual features alone.

Conclusion: RoadSceneBench 提供了一个紧凑而强大的基础，用于研究中层道路语义并促进结构感知的自主感知。

Abstract: Understanding mid-level road semantics, which capture the structural and contextual cues that link low-level perception to high-level planning, is essential for reliable autonomous driving and digital map construction. However, existing benchmarks primarily target perception tasks such as detection or segmentation, overlooking the reasoning capabilities required to infer road topology and dynamic scene structure. To address this gap, we present RoadSceneBench, a lightweight yet information-rich benchmark designed to evaluate and advance visual reasoning in complex road environments. Unlike large-scale perception datasets, RoadSceneBench emphasizes relational understanding and structural consistency, encouraging models to capture the underlying logic of real-world road scenes. Furthermore, to enhance reasoning reliability, we propose Hierarchical Relational Reward Propagation with Temporal Consistency (HRRP-T), a training framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in which reward signals adaptively promote spatial coherence and semantic alignment throughout the reasoning process. This paradigm enables models to move beyond static recognition toward geometry-aware and temporally consistent reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse road configurations. RoadSceneBench thus provides a compact yet powerful foundation for studying mid-level road semantics and fostering structure-aware autonomous perception.

Abstract: Text-based person anomaly retrieval has emerged as a challenging task, with most existing approaches relying on complex deep-learning techniques. This raises a research question: How can the model be optimized to achieve greater fine-grained features? To address this, we propose a Local-Global Hybrid Perspective (LHP) module integrated with a Vision-Language Model (VLM), designed to explore the effectiveness of incorporating both fine-grained features alongside coarse-grained features. Additionally, we investigate a Unified Image-Text (UIT) model that combines multiple objective loss functions, including Image-Text Contrastive (ITC), Image-Text Matching (ITM), Masked Language Modeling (MLM), and Masked Image Modeling (MIM) loss. Beyond this, we propose a novel iterative ensemble strategy, by combining iteratively instead of using model results simultaneously like other ensemble methods. To take advantage of the superior performance of the LHP model, we introduce a novel feature selection algorithm based on its guidance, which helps improve the model's performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on PAB dataset, compared with previous work, with a 9.70\% improvement in R@1, 1.77\% improvement in R@5, and 1.01\% improvement in R@10.

Result: Ovis-Image在文本渲染性能上与更大的开放模型（如Qwen-Image）相当，接近闭源系统（如Seedream和GPT4o），同时可在单个高端GPU上部署。

Conclusion: 结合强大的多模态骨干网络和精心设计的、以文本为中心的训练方案，足以实现可靠的双语文本渲染，而无需依赖过大或专有模型。

Abstract: We introduce $\textbf{Ovis-Image}$, a 7B text-to-image model specifically optimized for high-quality text rendering, designed to operate efficiently under stringent computational constraints. Built upon our previous Ovis-U1 framework, Ovis-Image integrates a diffusion-based visual decoder with the stronger Ovis 2.5 multimodal backbone, leveraging a text-centric training pipeline that combines large-scale pre-training with carefully tailored post-training refinements. Despite its compact architecture, Ovis-Image achieves text rendering performance on par with significantly larger open models such as Qwen-Image and approaches closed-source systems like Seedream and GPT4o. Crucially, the model remains deployable on a single high-end GPU with moderate memory, narrowing the gap between frontier-level text rendering and practical deployment. Our results indicate that combining a strong multimodal backbone with a carefully designed, text-focused training recipe is sufficient to achieve reliable bilingual text rendering without resorting to oversized or proprietary models.

Abstract: As generative models become increasingly diverse and powerful, cross-generator detection has emerged as a new challenge. Existing detection methods often memorize artifacts of specific generative models rather than learning transferable cues, leading to substantial failures on unseen generators. Surprisingly, this work finds that frozen visual foundation models, especially DINOv3, already exhibit strong cross-generator detection capability without any fine-tuning. Through systematic studies on frequency, spatial, and token perspectives, we observe that DINOv3 tends to rely on global, low-frequency structures as weak but transferable authenticity cues instead of high-frequency, generator-specific artifacts. Motivated by this insight, we introduce a simple, training-free token-ranking strategy followed by a lightweight linear probe to select a small subset of authenticity-relevant tokens. This token subset consistently improves detection accuracy across all evaluated datasets. Our study provides empirical evidence and a feasible hypothesis for understanding why foundation models generalize across diverse generators, offering a universal, efficient, and interpretable baseline for image forgery detection.

Motivation: 深度学习模型在医疗任务中常因虚假相关性（捷径学习）导致在新环境中泛化能力差，可能引发严重后果。

Method: 提出MIMM-X框架，通过最小化因果特征与多重虚假相关性之间的互信息，实现特征解耦。

Result: 在UK Biobank、NAKO和CheXpert三个数据集（MRI和X-ray两种影像模态）上，MIMM-X有效缓解了多重虚假相关性的捷径学习问题。

Conclusion: MIMM-X框架通过最小化互信息，成功地将因果特征与多重虚假相关性解耦，从而基于真实的因果关系进行预测，有效缓解了医疗影像中的捷径学习问题。

Abstract: Deep learning models can excel on medical tasks, yet often experience spurious correlations, known as shortcut learning, leading to poor generalization in new environments. Particularly in medical imaging, where multiple spurious correlations can coexist, misclassifications can have severe consequences. We propose MIMM-X, a framework that disentangles causal features from multiple spurious correlations by minimizing their mutual information. It enables predictions based on true underlying causal relationships rather than dataset-specific shortcuts. We evaluate MIMM-X on three datasets (UK Biobank, NAKO, CheXpert) across two imaging modalities (MRI and X-ray). Results demonstrate that MIMM-X effectively mitigates shortcut learning of multiple spurious correlations.

Abstract: We propose Dimitra++, a novel framework for audio-driven talking head generation, streamlined to learn lip motion, facial expression, as well as head pose motion. Specifically, we propose a conditional Motion Diffusion Transformer (cMDT) to model facial motion sequences, employing a 3D representation. The cMDT is conditioned on two inputs: a reference facial image, which determines appearance, as well as an audio sequence, which drives the motion. Quantitative and qualitative experiments, as well as a user study on two widely employed datasets, i.e., VoxCeleb2 and CelebV-HQ, suggest that Dimitra++ is able to outperform existing approaches in generating realistic talking heads imparting lip motion, facial expression, and head pose.

Conclusion: SciPostGen数据集和Retrieval-Augmented Poster Layout Generation框架有效填补了论文与海报布局关联研究的空白，生成的布局既符合论文结构，也能满足用户指定的约束条件。

Abstract: As the number of scientific papers continues to grow, there is a demand for approaches that can effectively convey research findings, with posters serving as a key medium for presenting paper contents. Poster layouts determine how effectively research is communicated and understood, highlighting their growing importance. In particular, a gap remains in understanding how papers correspond to the layouts that present them, which calls for datasets with paired annotations at scale. To bridge this gap, we introduce SciPostGen, a large-scale dataset for understanding and generating poster layouts from scientific papers. Our analyses based on SciPostGen show that paper structures are associated with the number of layout elements in posters. Based on this insight, we explore a framework, Retrieval-Augmented Poster Layout Generation, which retrieves layouts consistent with a given paper and uses them as guidance for layout generation. We conducted experiments under two conditions: with and without layout constraints typically specified by poster creators. The results show that the retriever estimates layouts aligned with paper structures, and our framework generates layouts that also satisfy given constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the illusion of thinking with images, where models rely on context-agnostic actions without refining perception or guiding reasoning.

Method: ViRL integrates Process Supervision, Objective Alignment via step-level reward shaping, and Fine-Grained Credit Assignment to ensure meaningful visual actions.

Result: ViRL achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks in perception, hallucination, and reasoning.

Conclusion: ViRL establishes visual rationalization as a task-agnostic, process-grounded paradigm for transparent and trustworthy vision-language models.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language reasoning underscore the importance of thinking with images, where models actively ground their reasoning in visual evidence. Yet, prevailing frameworks treat visual actions as optional tools, boosting metrics but leaving reasoning ungrounded and crops ineffective. This gap gives rise to the illusion of thinking with images: models seem visually grounded but rely on context-agnostic actions that neither refine perception nor guide reasoning toward correct answers. We address this problem by reframing visual actions as core reasoning primitives rather than optional tools, which we term visual rationalization, the visual analogue of textual Chain-of-Thought. Building on this insight, we propose Visual Rationale Learning (ViRL), an end-to-end paradigm that grounds training in the visual rationale itself. ViRL integrates (1) Process Supervision with ground-truth rationales, (2) Objective Alignment via step-level reward shaping, and (3) Fine-Grained Credit Assignment to distinguish correct, redundant, and erroneous actions. By ensuring each action contributes meaningfully to the reasoning chain, ViRL enables models to "get the right answer for the right visual reason". Trained purely with end-to-end RL, ViRL achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks spanning perception, hallucination, and reasoning. This work establishes visual rationalization as a task-agnostic, process-grounded paradigm for building transparent, verifiable, and trustworthy vision-language models.

Abstract: The advent of generative models has dramatically improved the accuracy of image inpainting. In particular, by removing specific text from document images, reconstructing original images is extremely important for industrial applications. However, most existing methods of text removal focus on deleting simple scene text which appears in images captured by a camera in an outdoor environment. There is little research dedicated to complex and practical images with dense text. Therefore, we created benchmark data for text removal from images including a large amount of text. From the data, we found that text-removal performance becomes vulnerable against mask profile perturbation. Thus, for practical text-removal tasks, precise tuning of the mask shape is essential. This study developed a method to model highly flexible mask profiles and learn their parameters using Bayesian optimization. The resulting profiles were found to be character-wise masks. It was also found that the minimum cover of a text region is not optimal. Our research is expected to pave the way for a user-friendly guideline for manual masking.

TL;DR: 生成模型修复在视觉上真实，但会损害医学AI性能，需任务特定验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估生成模型修复在去除伪影方面的临床可靠性，特别是对于儿科手部放射照片中的非解剖标记，以确定修复是否保留了骨龄和性别预测所需的特征。

Method: 使用RSNA Bone Age Challenge数据集，选择200张原始放射照片，生成600张修复版本，通过自然语言提示针对非解剖伪影。通过深度学习集成评估骨龄估计和性别分类的下游性能，使用平均绝对误差（MAE）和ROC曲线下面积（AUC）作为指标，并通过像素强度分布检测结构变化。

Result: 修复显著降低了模型性能：骨龄MAE从6.26个月增加到30.11个月，性别分类AUC从0.955降至0.704。修复图像显示像素强度变化和不一致性，表明结构修改未通过简单校准纠正。

Conclusion: 尽管生成模型修复在视觉上看起来真实，但它可能会掩盖临床相关的细微特征并引入潜在偏差，强调了在将此类生成工具整合到临床AI工作流程之前进行严格、任务特定验证的必要性。

Abstract: Generative foundation models can remove visual artifacts through realistic image inpainting, but their impact on medical AI performance remains uncertain. Pediatric hand radiographs often contain non-anatomical markers, and it is unclear whether inpainting these regions preserves features needed for bone age and gender prediction. To evaluate the clinical reliability of generative model-based inpainting for artifact removal, we used the RSNA Bone Age Challenge dataset, selecting 200 original radiographs and generating 600 inpainted versions with gpt-image-1 using natural language prompts to target non-anatomical artifacts. Downstream performance was assessed with deep learning ensembles for bone age estimation and gender classification, using mean absolute error (MAE) and area under the ROC curve (AUC) as metrics, and pixel intensity distributions to detect structural alterations. Inpainting markedly degraded model performance: bone age MAE increased from 6.26 to 30.11 months, and gender classification AUC decreased from 0.955 to 0.704. Inpainted images displayed pixel-intensity shifts and inconsistencies, indicating structural modifications not corrected by simple calibration. These findings show that, although visually realistic, foundation model-based inpainting can obscure subtle but clinically relevant features and introduce latent bias even when edits are confined to non-diagnostic regions, underscoring the need for rigorous, task-specific validation before integrating such generative tools into clinical AI workflows.

Abstract: Reading scene text, that is, text appearing in images, has numerous application areas, including assistive technology, search, and e-commerce. Although scene text recognition in English has advanced significantly and is often considered nearly a solved problem, Indian language scene text recognition remains an open challenge. This is due to script diversity, non-standard fonts, and varying writing styles, and, more importantly, the lack of high-quality datasets and open-source models. To address these gaps, we introduce the Bharat Scene Text Dataset (BSTD) - a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark for studying Indian Language Scene Text Recognition. It comprises more than 100K words that span 11 Indian languages and English, sourced from over 6,500 scene images captured across various linguistic regions of India. The dataset is meticulously annotated and supports multiple scene text tasks, including: (i) Scene Text Detection, (ii) Script Identification, (iii) Cropped Word Recognition, and (iv) End-to-End Scene Text Recognition. We evaluated state-of-the-art models originally developed for English by adapting (fine-tuning) them for Indian languages. Our results highlight the challenges and opportunities in Indian language scene text recognition. We believe that this dataset represents a significant step toward advancing research in this domain. All our models and data are open source.

Motivation: 现有的大规模视觉语言模型在多模态理解方面表现良好，但在3D空间推理（如距离估计、大小比较和跨视角一致性）方面仍有不足。现有方法要么依赖辅助3D信息，要么通过浅层特征融合增强RGB-only模型。

Method: SpaceMind采用双编码器架构，结合VGGT作为空间理解编码器和InternViT作为2D视觉编码器，并引入轻量级的相机引导模态融合模块，替代浅层特征融合。

Result: SpaceMind在VSI-Bench、SQA3D和SPBench上取得了新的最先进成果，显著超越了开源和专有系统。

Conclusion: SpaceMind通过相机引导的模态融合模块，显著提升了视觉语言模型在3D空间推理任务上的性能，证明了该方法在赋予模型空间基础智能方面的有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) show strong multimodal understanding but still struggle with 3D spatial reasoning, such as distance estimation, size comparison, and cross-view consistency. Existing 3D-aware methods either depend on auxiliary 3D information or enhance RGB-only VLMs with geometry encoders through shallow feature fusion. We propose SpaceMind, a multimodal large language model explicitly designed for spatial reasoning solely from RGB inputs. The model adopts a dual-encoder architecture, integrating VGGT as a spatial understanding encoder and InternViT as a 2D visual encoder. The key idea is to treat the camera representation as an active guiding modality rather than passive metadata. Specifically, SpaceMind introduces a lightweight Camera-Guided Modality Fusion module before the language model to replace shallow fusion. It applies camera-conditioned biasing to spatial tokens, assigns query-independent weights reflecting their geometric importance, and uses the camera embedding to gate the fused representation. Empirically, SpaceMind establishes new state-of-the-art results on VSI-Bench, SQA3D and SPBench, surpassing both open and proprietary systems on VSI-Bench and SPBench by large margins and achieving state-of-the-art performance on SQA3D. These results demonstrate that camera-guided modality fusion is an effective and practical inductive bias for equipping VLMs with genuinely spatially grounded intelligence. We will release code and model checkpoints to support future research.

Result: Fast3Dcache实现了高达27.12%的加速和54.8%的FLOPs减少，几何质量退化极小（Chamfer Distance 2.48%，F-Score 1.95%）。

Conclusion: Fast3Dcache 是一种无需训练的几何感知缓存框架，通过引入预测缓存调度器约束（PCSC）和时空稳定性准则（SSC），在加速3D扩散推理的同时保持了几何保真度，实验证明其显著提升了推理速度并减少了计算量。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive generative quality across modalities like 2D images, videos, and 3D shapes, but their inference remains computationally expensive due to the iterative denoising process. While recent caching-based methods effectively reuse redundant computations to speed up 2D and video generation, directly applying these techniques to 3D diffusion models can severely disrupt geometric consistency. In 3D synthesis, even minor numerical errors in cached latent features accumulate, causing structural artifacts and topological inconsistencies. To overcome this limitation, we propose Fast3Dcache, a training-free geometry-aware caching framework that accelerates 3D diffusion inference while preserving geometric fidelity. Our method introduces a Predictive Caching Scheduler Constraint (PCSC) to dynamically determine cache quotas according to voxel stabilization patterns and a Spatiotemporal Stability Criterion (SSC) to select stable features for reuse based on velocity magnitude and acceleration criterion. Comprehensive experiments show that Fast3Dcache accelerates inference significantly, achieving up to a 27.12% speed-up and a 54.8% reduction in FLOPs, with minimal degradation in geometric quality as measured by Chamfer Distance (2.48%) and F-Score (1.95%).

Conclusion: Diff-ICMH 通过结合生成先验和语义一致性损失，成功实现了机器与人类视觉在图像压缩中的和谐统一，支持多种智能任务且保持高质量视觉体验。

Abstract: Image compression methods are usually optimized isolatedly for human perception or machine analysis tasks. We reveal fundamental commonalities between these objectives: preserving accurate semantic information is paramount, as it directly dictates the integrity of critical information for intelligent tasks and aids human understanding. Concurrently, enhanced perceptual quality not only improves visual appeal but also, by ensuring realistic image distributions, benefits semantic feature extraction for machine tasks. Based on this insight, we propose Diff-ICMH, a generative image compression framework aiming for harmonizing machine and human vision in image compression. It ensures perceptual realism by leveraging generative priors and simultaneously guarantees semantic fidelity through the incorporation of Semantic Consistency loss (SC loss) during training. Additionally, we introduce the Tag Guidance Module (TGM) that leverages highly semantic image-level tags to stimulate the pre-trained diffusion model's generative capabilities, requiring minimal additional bit rates. Consequently, Diff-ICMH supports multiple intelligent tasks through a single codec and bitstream without any task-specific adaptation, while preserving high-quality visual experience for human perception. Extensive experimental results demonstrate Diff-ICMH's superiority and generalizability across diverse tasks, while maintaining visual appeal for human perception.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, visually realistic AI-generated images have become increasingly difficult to distinguish from authentic ones, posing severe threats to social trust and information integrity. Consequently, there is an urgent need for efficient and truly explainable image forensic methods. Recent detection paradigms have shifted towards explainable forensics. However, state-of-the-art approaches primarily rely on post-hoc rationalizations or visual discrimination, lacking a verifiable chain of evidence. This reliance on surface-level pattern matching limits the generation of causally grounded explanations and often results in poor generalization. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce \textbf{REVEAL-Bench}, the first reasoning-enhanced multimodal benchmark for AI-generated image detection that is explicitly structured around a chain-of-evidence derived from multiple lightweight expert models, then records step-by-step reasoning traces and evidential justifications. Building upon this dataset, we propose \textbf{REVEAL} (\underline{R}easoning-\underline{e}nhanced Forensic E\underline{v}id\underline{e}nce \underline{A}na\underline{l}ysis), an effective and explainable forensic framework that integrates detection with a novel expert-grounded reinforcement learning. Our reward mechanism is specially tailored to jointly optimize detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and logical coherence grounded in explicit forensic evidence, enabling REVEAL to produce fine-grained, interpretable, and verifiable reasoning chains alongside its detection outcomes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that REVEAL significantly enhances detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and robust cross-model generalization, benchmarking a new state of the art for explainable image forensics.

Abstract: We present a unified framework for reconstructing animatable 3D human avatars from a single portrait across head, half-body, and full-body inputs. Our method tackles three bottlenecks: pose- and framing-sensitive feature representations, limited scalable data, and unreliable proxy-mesh estimation. We introduce a Dual-UV representation that maps image features to a canonical UV space via Core-UV and Shell-UV branches, eliminating pose- and framing-induced token shifts. We also build a factorized synthetic data manifold combining 2D generative diversity with geometry-consistent 3D renderings, supported by a training scheme that improves realism and identity consistency. A robust proxy-mesh tracker maintains stability under partial visibility. Together, these components enable strong in-the-wild generalization. Trained only on half-body synthetic data, our model achieves state-of-the-art head and upper-body reconstruction and competitive full-body results. Extensive experiments and analyses further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

In this paper, we propose a text condition embedded abutment design framework (TCEAD), the novel automated abutment design solution available in literature. The proposed study extends the self-supervised learning framework of the mesh mask autoencoder (MeshMAE) by introducing a text-guided localization (TGL) module to facilitate abutment area localization. As the parameter determination of the abutment is heavily dependent on local fine-grained features (the width and height of the implant and the distance to the opposing tooth), we pre-train the encoder using oral scan data to improve the model's feature extraction ability. Moreover, considering that the abutment area is only a small part of the oral scan data, we designed a TGL module, which introduces the description of the abutment area through the text encoder of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), enabling the network to quickly locate the abutment area. We validated the performance of TCEAD on a large abutment design dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCEAD achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) improvement of 0.8%-12.85% over other mainstream methods, underscoring its potential in automated dental abutment design.

Conclusion: ViBT展示了桥接模型在图像和视频翻译任务中的强大能力，尤其是在大规模参数（20B和1.3B）下的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce Vision Bridge Transformer (ViBT), a large-scale instantiation of Brownian Bridge Models designed for conditional generation. Unlike traditional diffusion models that transform noise into data, Bridge Models directly model the trajectory between inputs and outputs, creating an efficient data-to-data translation paradigm. By scaling these models to 20B and 1.3B parameters, we demonstrate their effectiveness for image and video translation tasks. To support this scale, we adopt a Transformer architecture and propose a variance-stabilized velocity-matching objective for robust training. Together, these advances highlight the power of scaling Bridge Models for instruction-based image editing and complex video translation.

Motivation: 传统AGB估计方法依赖劳动密集的实地测量或存在植被密集区域限制的遥感方法，亟需一种更高效、准确的替代方案。

Method: 研究将AGB估计任务构建为密集预测任务，引入AGB密度图，每个像素代表归一化的树木生物量。利用合成的3D SPREAD数据集，通过异速生长方程计算AGB，并训练模型预测AGB密度图，最终整合得到场景的AGB估计值。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于学习的创新方法，通过单张地面RGB图像估计地上生物量（AGB），为森林监测提供了可扩展、可解释且经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Forests play a critical role in global ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and mitigating climate change via carbon sequestration. Accurate aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation is essential for assessing carbon storage and wildfire fuel loads, yet traditional methods rely on labor-intensive field measurements or remote sensing approaches with significant limitations in dense vegetation. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based method for estimating AGB from a single ground-based RGB image. We frame this as a dense prediction task, introducing AGB density maps, where each pixel represents tree biomass normalized by the plot area and each tree's image area. We leverage the recently introduced synthetic 3D SPREAD dataset, which provides realistic forest scenes with per-image tree attributes (height, trunk and canopy diameter) and instance segmentation masks. Using these assets, we compute AGB via allometric equations and train a model to predict AGB density maps, integrating them to recover the AGB estimate for the captured scene. Our approach achieves a median AGB estimation error of 1.22 kg/m^2 on held-out SPREAD data and 1.94 kg/m^2 on a real-image dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first method to estimate aboveground biomass directly from a single RGB image, opening up the possibility for a scalable, interpretable, and cost-effective solution for forest monitoring, while also enabling broader participation through citizen science initiatives.

TL;DR: AnoRefiner通过异常分数图增强图像特征，结合ARD和PGT策略，显著提升零样本工业异常检测的像素级精度。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ZSAD方法因仅提取块级特征导致异常图粗糙，且合成异常数据与真实异常存在差距，导致细粒度异常检测效果不佳。

Method: 设计了异常细化解码器（ARD）和渐进组级测试时训练（PGT）策略，以减少对合成异常数据的依赖，并提升检测精度。

Result: 在MVTec AD和VisA数据集上，AnoRefiner将ZSAD模型的像素-AP指标提升了最高5.2%。

Conclusion: AnoRefiner通过结合异常分数图与图像特征，显著提升了零样本工业异常检测（ZSAD）模型的性能，实现了从块级到像素级的异常检测改进。

Abstract: Zero-shot industrial anomaly detection (ZSAD) methods typically yield coarse anomaly maps as vision transformers (ViTs) extract patch-level features only. To solve this, recent solutions attempt to predict finer anomalies using features from ZSAD, but they still struggle to recover fine-grained anomalies without missed detections, mainly due to the gap between randomly synthesized training anomalies and real ones. We observe that anomaly score maps exactly provide complementary spatial cues that are largely absent from ZSAD's image features, a fact overlooked before.
  Inspired by this, we propose an anomaly-aware refiner (AnoRefiner) that can be plugged into most ZSAD models and improve patch-level anomaly maps to the pixel level. First, we design an anomaly refinement decoder (ARD) that progressively enhances image features using anomaly score maps, reducing the reliance on synthetic anomaly data. Second, motivated by the mass production paradigm, we propose a progressive group-wise test-time training (PGT) strategy that trains ARD in each product group for the refinement process in the next group, while staying compatible with any ZSAD method.
  Experiments on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets show that AnoRefiner boosts various ZSAD models by up to a 5.2\% gain in pixel-AP metrics, which can also be directly observed in many visualizations. The code will be available at https://github.com/HUST-SLOW/AnoRefiner.

Motivation: 现有方法未能同时解决加速采集和伪影校正的问题，限制了模型在多种退化因素同时存在时的性能。

Method: 采用双子模型方法，专门针对2D脑部解剖图像的笛卡尔采样数据。

Result: 实现了高达5倍的加速采集，同时校正伪影且无明显质量下降，显著提高了信噪比和对比度。

Conclusion: USArt模型在加速MRI采集的同时有效校正了噪声和运动伪影，展示了在实际应用中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: MR data are acquired in the frequency domain, known as k-space. Acquiring high-quality and high-resolution MR images can be time-consuming, posing a significant challenge when multiple sequences providing complementary contrast information are needed or when the patient is unable to remain in the scanner for an extended period of time. Reducing k-space measurements is a strategy to speed up acquisition, but often leads to reduced quality in reconstructed images. Additionally, in real-world MRI, both under-sampled and full-sampled images are prone to artefacts, and correcting these artefacts is crucial for maintaining diagnostic accuracy. Deep learning methods have been proposed to restore image quality from under-sampled data, while others focused on the correction of artefacts that result from the noise or motion. No approach has however been proposed so far that addresses both acceleration and artefacts correction, limiting the performance of these models when these degradation factors occur simultaneously. To address this gap, we present a method for recovering high-quality images from under-sampled data with simultaneously correction for noise and motion artefact called USArt (Under-Sampling and Artifact correction model). Customized for 2D brain anatomical images acquired with Cartesian sampling, USArt employs a dual sub-model approach. The results demonstrate remarkable increase of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast in the images restored. Various under-sampling strategies and degradation levels were explored, with the gradient under-sampling strategy yielding the best outcomes. We achieved up to 5x acceleration and simultaneously artefacts correction without significant degradation, showcasing the model's robustness in real-world settings.

Conclusion: 尽管预训练的大规模视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在生成安全感知的驾驶指令方面表现有限，但经过微调的LVLMs能够提供准确且安全导向的输出。然而，在视频中检测细微或复杂事件仍存在挑战。

Abstract: Large-scale Vision Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit advanced capabilities in tasks that require visual information, including object detection. These capabilities have promising applications in various industrial domains, such as autonomous driving. For example, LVLMs can generate safety-oriented descriptions of videos captured by road-facing cameras. However, ensuring comprehensive safety requires monitoring driver-facing views as well to detect risky events, such as the use of mobiles while driving. Thus, the ability to process synchronized inputs is necessary from both driver-facing and road-facing cameras. In this study, we develop models and investigate the capabilities of LVLMs by constructing a dataset and evaluating their performance on this dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that while pre-trained LVLMs have limited effectiveness, fine-tuned LVLMs can generate accurate and safety-aware driving instructions. Nonetheless, several challenges remain, particularly in detecting subtle or complex events in the video. Our findings and error analysis provide valuable insights that can contribute to the improvement of LVLM-based systems in this domain.

Motivation: 解决现有流模型（如Rectified Flow和MeanFlow）在训练效率和样本质量上的不足。

Method: 提出Rectified MeanFlow框架，结合平均速度场建模和截断启发式方法，减少残差曲率。

Result: 在ImageNet 64、256和512分辨率上，Re-MeanFlow在样本质量和训练效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Rectified MeanFlow（Re-MeanFlow）通过单次reflow步骤建模平均速度场，显著提升训练效率和样本质量，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have recently demonstrated strong performance, yet sampling typically relies on expensive numerical integration of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Rectified Flow enables one-step sampling by learning nearly straight probability paths, but achieving such straightness requires multiple computationally intensive reflow iterations. MeanFlow achieves one-step generation by directly modeling the average velocity over time; however, when trained on highly curved flows, it suffers from slow convergence and noisy supervision. To address these limitations, we propose Rectified MeanFlow, a framework that models the mean velocity field along the rectified trajectory using only a single reflow step. This eliminates the need for perfectly straightened trajectories while enabling efficient training. Furthermore, we introduce a simple yet effective truncation heuristic that aims to reduce residual curvature and further improve performance. Extensive experiments on ImageNet at 64, 256, and 512 resolutions show that Re-MeanFlow consistently outperforms prior one-step flow distillation and Rectified Flow methods in both sample quality and training efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出潜在漂移引导的重放方法，通过量化样本特征变化减少医学影像连续学习中的灾难性遗忘，实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在连续学习新数据时，往往会突然丧失对先前学习任务的性能（灾难性遗忘），这在医学影像领域尤为关键，因为模型需要在不损害已有诊断知识的情况下持续适应新医院的数据。

Result: 在跨医院COVID-19 CT分类任务中，使用先进的CNN和Vision Transformer骨干网络，该方法显著减少了遗忘现象，优于简单微调和随机重放。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种基于潜在漂移引导的重放方法，有效减少了深度学习模型在连续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，特别是在医学影像领域的跨医院COVID-19 CT分类任务中表现优异。

Abstract: When deep learning models are sequentially trained on new data, they tend to abruptly lose performance on previously learned tasks, a critical failure known as catastrophic forgetting. This challenge severely limits the deployment of AI in medical imaging, where models must continually adapt to data from new hospitals without compromising established diagnostic knowledge. To address this, we introduce a latent drift-guided replay method that identifies and replays samples with high representational instability. Specifically, our method quantifies this instability via latent drift, the change in a sample internal feature representation after naive domain adaptation. To ensure diversity and clinical relevance, we aggregate drift at the patient level, our memory buffer stores the per patient slices exhibiting the greatest multi-layer representation shift. Evaluated on a cross-hospital COVID-19 CT classification task using state-of-the-art CNN and Vision Transformer backbones, our method substantially reduces forgetting compared to naive fine-tuning and random replay. This work highlights latent drift as a practical and interpretable replay signal for advancing robust continual learning in real world medical settings.

Conclusion: 通过解锁多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的推理能力，本研究显著提升了图像编辑模型的性能，特别是在抽象指令理解和编辑准确性方面。

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing models have shown remarkable progress. A common architectural design couples a multimodal large language model (MLLM) encoder with a diffusion decoder, as seen in systems such as Step1X-Edit and Qwen-Image-Edit, where the MLLM encodes both the reference image and the instruction but remains frozen during training. In this work, we demonstrate that unlocking the reasoning capabilities of MLLM can further push the boundaries of editing models. Specifically, we explore two reasoning mechanisms, thinking and reflection, which enhance instruction understanding and editing accuracy. Based on that, our proposed framework enables image editing in a thinking-editing-reflection loop: the thinking mechanism leverages the world knowledge of MLLM to interpret abstract instructions, while the reflection reviews editing results, automatically corrects unintended manipulations, and identifies the stopping round. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our reasoning approach achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of ImgEdit (+4.3%), GEdit (+4.7%), and Kris (+8.2%) when initializing our DiT from the Step1X-Edit (ReasonEdit-S), and also outperforms previous open-source methods on both GEdit and Kris when integrated with Qwen-Image-Edit (ReasonEdit-Q).

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have undergone rapid development in advancing geospatial scene understanding. Recent studies have sought to enhance the reasoning capabilities of remote sensing MLLMs, typically through cold-start training with elaborately curated chain-of-thought (CoT) data. However, this approach not only incurs substantial annotation costs but also introduces human biases that may limit the diversity of model reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose GeoZero, a framework that enables MLLMs to perform geospatial reasoning without any predefined CoT supervision. Specifically, we construct two datasets, GeoZero-Instruct and GeoZero-Hard. GeoZero-Instruct allows the model to acquire preliminary geospatial knowledge through supervised fine-tuning, while GeoZero-Hard stimulates deep reasoning during the subsequent reinforcement learning stage. Furthermore, we introduce Answer-Anchored Group Relative Policy Optimization (A$^2$GRPO), where the reasoning process is regularized by the model's own answers, encouraging diverse yet accurate thinking. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that GeoZero not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods but also fosters universal emergent reasoning capabilities across diverse geospatial tasks.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models for image generation and understanding represent a significant step toward AGI and have attracted widespread attention from researchers. The main challenge of this task lies in the difficulty in establishing an optimal training paradigm due to inherent conflicting targets in understanding and generation tasks. To alleviate these conflicts and pursue higher performance, many researchers adopt varying degrees of model decoupling (e.g., Double image encoders, MOE/MOT architecture, or frozen MLLM). However, excessive model decoupling can lead to the loss of interleave generation ability, undermining the original intent of unified models. In this work, we aim to explore how to mitigate task conflicts without resorting to model decoupling. Firstly, we analyze why decoupling alleviates conflicts by studying the cross-modal attention behavior of models. We observe that model decoupling essentially drives models toward task-specific multimodal interaction patterns, as seen in Qwen-VL and HunyuanImage, and that the more thorough the decoupling, the more consistent the behavior becomes. Motivated by this observation, we propose Attention Interaction Alignment (AIA) loss, which explicitly learns Task-Specific multimodal interaction patterns during training. To demonstrate the generalizability of our AIA loss, we apply it to Emu3 and Janus-Pro during SFT and post-training stage respectively. Without bells and whistles, AIA not only refines cross-modal attention patterns, but also boosts both generation and understanding performance.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have shown strong generalization under zero-shot settings, yet adapting them to downstream tasks with limited supervision remains a significant challenge. Existing multi-modal prompt learning methods typically rely on fixed, shared prompts and deterministic parameters, which limits their ability to capture instance-level variation or model uncertainty across diverse tasks and domains. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Variational Multi-Modal Prompt Learning (VaMP) framework that enables sample-specific, uncertainty-aware prompt tuning in multi-modal representation learning. VaMP generates instance-conditioned prompts by sampling from a learned posterior distribution, allowing the model to personalize its behavior based on input content. To further enhance the integration of local and global semantics, we introduce a class-aware prior derived from the instance representation and class prototype. Building upon these, we formulate prompt tuning as variational inference over latent prompt representations and train the entire framework end-to-end through reparameterized sampling. Experiments on few-shot and domain generalization benchmarks show that VaMP achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the benefits of modeling both uncertainty and task structure in our method.

Abstract: Diffusion model distillation has emerged as a powerful technique for creating efficient few-step and single-step generators. Among these, Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) and its variants stand out for their impressive performance, which is widely attributed to their core mechanism of matching the student's output distribution to that of a pre-trained teacher model. In this work, we challenge this conventional understanding. Through a rigorous decomposition of the DMD training objective, we reveal that in complex tasks like text-to-image generation, where CFG is typically required for desirable few-step performance, the primary driver of few-step distillation is not distribution matching, but a previously overlooked component we identify as CFG Augmentation (CA). We demonstrate that this term acts as the core ``engine'' of distillation, while the Distribution Matching (DM) term functions as a ``regularizer'' that ensures training stability and mitigates artifacts. We further validate this decoupling by demonstrating that while the DM term is a highly effective regularizer, it is not unique; simpler non-parametric constraints or GAN-based objectives can serve the same stabilizing function, albeit with different trade-offs. This decoupling of labor motivates a more principled analysis of the properties of both terms, leading to a more systematic and in-depth understanding. This new understanding further enables us to propose principled modifications to the distillation process, such as decoupling the noise schedules for the engine and the regularizer, leading to further performance gains. Notably, our method has been adopted by the Z-Image ( https://github.com/Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image ) project to develop a top-tier 8-step image generation model, empirically validating the generalization and robustness of our findings.

Abstract: 3D foundation models (3DFMs) have recently transformed 3D vision, enabling joint prediction of depths, poses, and point maps directly from images. Yet their ability to reason under extreme, non-overlapping views remains largely unexplored. In this work, we study their internal representations and find that 3DFMs exhibit an emergent understanding of extreme-view geometry, despite never being trained for such conditions. To further enhance these capabilities, we introduce a lightweight alignment scheme that refines their internal 3D representation by tuning only a small subset of backbone bias terms, leaving all decoder heads frozen. This targeted adaptation substantially improves relative pose estimation under extreme viewpoints without degrading per-image depth or point quality. Additionally, we contribute MegaUnScene, a new benchmark of Internet scenes unseen by existing 3DFMs, with dedicated test splits for both relative pose estimation and dense 3D reconstruction. All code and data will be released.

TL;DR: Ar2Can通过两阶段框架（布局预测与图像合成）解决了多人生成中的身份混淆问题，优化后显著提升了准确性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在多人生成场景中表现不佳，常出现面部重复、身份混淆或人数统计错误的问题。

Method: Ar2Can采用两阶段框架：Architect模块预测结构化布局，Artist模块合成逼真图像，并结合匈牙利空间对齐和ArcFace身份相似性的空间匹配奖励。优化通过Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)实现。

Result: 在MultiHuman-Testbench上，Ar2Can在人数准确性和身份保持方面取得显著提升，同时保持高感知质量。

Conclusion: Ar2Can通过两阶段框架（Architect模块和Artist模块）显著提升了多人生成场景的准确性和身份保持能力，同时保持了高感知质量，且主要依赖合成数据。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-image generation, existing models consistently fail to produce reliable multi-human scenes, often duplicating faces, merging identities, or miscounting individuals. We present Ar2Can, a novel two-stage framework that disentangles spatial planning from identity rendering for multi-human generation. The Architect module predicts structured layouts, specifying where each person should appear. The Artist module then synthesizes photorealistic images, guided by a spatially-grounded face matching reward that combines Hungarian spatial alignment with ArcFace identity similarity. This approach ensures faces are rendered at correct locations and faithfully preserve reference identities. We develop two Architect variants, seamlessly integrated with our diffusion-based Artist model and optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using compositional rewards for count accuracy, image quality, and identity matching. Evaluated on the MultiHuman-Testbench, Ar2Can achieves substantial improvements in both count accuracy and identity preservation, while maintaining high perceptual quality. Notably, our method achieves these results using primarily synthetic data, without requiring real multi-human images.

TL;DR: Z-Image是一个高效的6B参数开源图像生成模型，通过优化架构和训练流程，在减少计算开销的同时实现顶尖性能，支持消费级硬件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高性能图像生成模型多为专有系统，开源替代品因参数庞大（20B-80B）而难以在消费级硬件上推理和微调，需填补这一空白。

Method: 采用Scalable Single-Stream Diffusion Transformer (S3-DiT)架构，并通过系统化优化模型生命周期（从数据基础设施到训练流程）以及few-step蒸馏和奖励后训练。

Result: Z-Image在多项指标上媲美或超越领先竞争对手，尤其在逼真图像生成和双语文本渲染方面表现突出，且推理延迟低至亚秒级。

Conclusion: Z-Image通过高效的6B参数模型和优化的训练流程，证明了在减少计算开销的同时仍能实现顶尖性能，推动了开源高性能图像生成模型的发展。

Abstract: The landscape of high-performance image generation models is currently dominated by proprietary systems, such as Nano Banana Pro and Seedream 4.0. Leading open-source alternatives, including Qwen-Image, Hunyuan-Image-3.0 and FLUX.2, are characterized by massive parameter counts (20B to 80B), making them impractical for inference, and fine-tuning on consumer-grade hardware. To address this gap, we propose Z-Image, an efficient 6B-parameter foundation generative model built upon a Scalable Single-Stream Diffusion Transformer (S3-DiT) architecture that challenges the "scale-at-all-costs" paradigm. By systematically optimizing the entire model lifecycle -- from a curated data infrastructure to a streamlined training curriculum -- we complete the full training workflow in just 314K H800 GPU hours (approx. $630K). Our few-step distillation scheme with reward post-training further yields Z-Image-Turbo, offering both sub-second inference latency on an enterprise-grade H800 GPU and compatibility with consumer-grade hardware (<16GB VRAM). Additionally, our omni-pre-training paradigm also enables efficient training of Z-Image-Edit, an editing model with impressive instruction-following capabilities. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our model achieves performance comparable to or surpassing that of leading competitors across various dimensions. Most notably, Z-Image exhibits exceptional capabilities in photorealistic image generation and bilingual text rendering, delivering results that rival top-tier commercial models, thereby demonstrating that state-of-the-art results are achievable with significantly reduced computational overhead. We publicly release our code, weights, and online demo to foster the development of accessible, budget-friendly, yet state-of-the-art generative models.

TL;DR: Splat-SAP是一种适用于稀疏双目视图的两阶段高斯泼溅渲染方法，通过点图重建和几何细化实现高质量自由视点渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统高斯泼溅渲染方法需要密集输入视图和高度重叠视图的问题，提出一种适用于稀疏双目视图的渲染方法。

Method: 采用两阶段学习策略：阶段1通过迭代亲和力学习将点图转换为真实空间；阶段2通过立体匹配细化几何并在目标视图平面上锚定高斯基元以渲染高质量图像。

Result: 在多人中心数据集上验证了方法在点图重建稳定性和自由视点渲染视觉质量上的提升。

Conclusion: Splat-SAP通过两阶段学习策略（无3D监督的自监督点图重建和基于立体匹配的几何细化）成功实现了在稀疏双目视图下的高质量自由视点渲染。

Abstract: We present Splat-SAP, a feed-forward approach to render novel views of human-centered scenes from binocular cameras with large sparsity. Gaussian Splatting has shown its promising potential in rendering tasks, but it typically necessitates per-scene optimization with dense input views. Although some recent approaches achieve feed-forward Gaussian Splatting rendering through geometry priors obtained by multi-view stereo, such approaches still require largely overlapped input views to establish the geometry prior. To bridge this gap, we leverage pixel-wise point map reconstruction to represent geometry which is robust to large sparsity for its independent view modeling. In general, we propose a two-stage learning strategy. In stage 1, we transform the point map into real space via an iterative affinity learning process, which facilitates camera control in the following. In stage 2, we project point maps of two input views onto the target view plane and refine such geometry via stereo matching. Furthermore, we anchor Gaussian primitives on this refined plane in order to render high-quality images. As a metric representation, the scale-aware point map in stage 1 is trained in a self-supervised manner without 3D supervision and stage 2 is supervised with photo-metric loss. We collect multi-view human-centered data and demonstrate that our method improves both the stability of point map reconstruction and the visual quality of free-viewpoint rendering.

Motivation: 野生动物监测对生物多样性保护至关重要。结合遥感、航空影像和深度学习，尤其是VIS与TIR图像的互补使用，有望提升自动检测的准确性。

Method: 研究采用YOLO11n模型，结合同步获取的可见光（VIS）和热红外（TIR）图像，测试了两种融合方法：早期融合（主成分分析）和晚期融合（基于分类回归树）。

Result: 早期和晚期融合均提升了F1分数，其中晚期融合对主要类别（occupied nest）的F1分数从90.2%提升至93.0%，并能以90%的召回率识别误检。

Conclusion: 尽管融合方法（早期和晚期）在提高检测性能方面表现出色，但受限于热红外（TIR）的视野和对齐问题，可能导致数据丢失。未来，使用机载高分辨率可见光传感器可能是更实用的调查方案。

Abstract: Efficient wildlife monitoring methods are necessary for biodiversity conservation and management. The combination of remote sensing, aerial imagery and deep learning offer promising opportunities to renew or improve existing survey methods. The complementary use of visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery can add information compared to a single-source image and improve results in an automated detection context. However, the alignment and fusion process can be challenging, especially since visible and thermal images usually have different fields of view (FOV) and spatial resolutions. This research presents a case study on the great blue heron (Ardea herodias) to evaluate the performances of synchronous aerial VIS and TIR imagery to automatically detect individuals and nests using a YOLO11n model. Two VIS-TIR fusion methods were tested and compared: an early fusion approach and a late fusion approach, to determine if the addition of the TIR image gives any added value compared to a VIS-only model. VIS and TIR images were automatically aligned using a deep learning model. A principal component analysis fusion method was applied to VIS-TIR image pairs to form the early fusion dataset. A classification and regression tree was used to process the late fusion dataset, based on the detection from the VIS-only and TIR-only trained models. Across all classes, both late and early fusion improved the F1 score compared to the VIS-only model. For the main class, occupied nest, the late fusion improved the F1 score from 90.2 (VIS-only) to 93.0%. This model was also able to identify false positives from both sources with 90% recall. Although fusion methods seem to give better results, this approach comes with a limiting TIR FOV and alignment constraints that eliminate data. Using an aircraft-mounted very high-resolution visible sensor could be an interesting option for operationalizing surveys.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了在纵向阿尔茨海默病预测中的最先进性能，并突出了结合空间和时间建模在早期检测阿尔茨海默病中的有效性。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that progressively impairs memory, decision-making, and overall cognitive function. As AD is irreversible, early prediction is critical for timely intervention and management. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a transitional stage between cognitively normal (CN) aging and AD, plays a significant role in early AD diagnosis. However, predicting MCI progression remains a significant challenge, as not all individuals with MCI convert to AD. MCI subjects are categorized into stable MCI (sMCI) and progressive MCI (pMCI) based on conversion status. In this study, we propose a generalized, end-to-end deep learning model for AD prediction using MCI cases from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our hybrid architecture integrates Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers to capture both local spatial features and global contextual dependencies from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. To incorporate temporal progression, we further employ Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks to process features extracted from four consecutive MRI timepoints along with some other non-image biomarkers, predicting each subject's cognitive status at month 48. Our multimodal model achieved an average progression prediction accuracy of 95.05\% between sMCI and pMCI, outperforming existing studies in AD prediction. This work demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in longitudinal AD prediction and highlights the effectiveness of combining spatial and temporal modeling for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease.

Motivation: 研究大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在文化混合场景中的感知能力，填补该领域的空白。

Method: 构建了CultureMix基准，包含23k张扩散生成并经人工验证的文化混合图像，评估了10种LVLMs的表现，并探索了三种鲁棒性策略。

Result: 发现现有模型在混合文化场景中表现不佳，特别是对背景的依赖性强，准确率下降14%。监督微调能显著提升模型一致性和减少背景敏感性。

Conclusion: 呼吁重视文化混合场景，作为开发能在文化多样化的现实环境中可靠运行的大型视觉语言模型的关键步骤。

Abstract: In a globalized world, cultural elements from diverse origins frequently appear together within a single visual scene. We refer to these as culture mixing scenarios, yet how Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) perceive them remains underexplored. We investigate culture mixing as a critical challenge for LVLMs and examine how current models behave when cultural items from multiple regions appear together. To systematically analyze these behaviors, we construct CultureMix, a food Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark with 23k diffusion-generated, human-verified culture mixing images across four subtasks: (1) food-only, (2) food+food, (3) food+background, and (4) food+food+background. Evaluating 10 LVLMs, we find consistent failures to preserve individual cultural identities in mixed settings. Models show strong background reliance, with accuracy dropping 14% when cultural backgrounds are added to food-only baselines, and they produce inconsistent predictions for identical foods across different contexts. To address these limitations, we explore three robustness strategies. We find supervised fine-tuning using a diverse culture mixing dataset substantially improve model consistency and reduce background sensitivity. We call for increased attention to culture mixing scenarios as a critical step toward developing LVLMs capable of operating reliably in culturally diverse real-world environments.

Conclusion: 通过CogIP-Bench基准测试和后训练阶段，研究成功提升了MLLMs在图像认知属性上与人类感知的对齐度，并展示了这种对齐能力在下游创意任务中的可迁移性和实用性。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are adept at answering what is in an image-identifying objects and describing scenes-they often lack the ability to understand how an image feels to a human observer. This gap is most evident when considering subjective cognitive properties, such as what makes an image memorable, funny, aesthetically pleasing, or emotionally evocative. To systematically address this challenge, we introduce CogIP-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on such image cognitive properties. Our evaluation reveals a significant gap: current models are poorly aligned with human perception of these nuanced properties. We then demonstrate that a post-training phase can effectively bridge this gap, significantly enhancing the model's alignment with human judgments. Furthermore, we show that this learned cognitive alignment is not merely predictive but also transferable to downstream creative tasks. By integrating our cognitively-aligned MLLM into an image generation pipeline, we can guide the synthesis process to produce images that better embody desired traits, such as being more memorable or visually appealing. Our work provides a benchmark to measure this human-like perception, a post-training pipeline to enhance it, and a demonstration that this alignment unlocks more human-centric AI.

Motivation: 土地覆盖分类对生态系统服务、水文调节和灾害风险减少至关重要，但受限于稀缺和不平衡的标注及高分辨率场景中的几何失真。

Method: LC4-DViT结合了文本引导的扩散管道生成平衡的训练图像，以及DCNv4变形卷积骨干与Vision Transformer编码器，以捕捉精细几何和全局上下文。

Result: 在AID数据集上，LC4-DViT达到了0.9572的整体准确率，优于基准模型，并在跨数据集实验中表现出良好的可迁移性。

Conclusion: LC4-DViT框架通过结合生成式数据创建和变形感知的Vision Transformer，为高分辨率土地覆盖分类提供了一种有前景的方法。

Abstract: Land-cover underpins ecosystem services, hydrologic regulation, disaster-risk reduction, and evidence-based land planning; timely, accurate land-cover maps are therefore critical for environmental stewardship. Remote sensing-based land-cover classification offers a scalable route to such maps but is hindered by scarce and imbalanced annotations and by geometric distortions in high-resolution scenes. We propose LC4-DViT (Land-cover Creation for Land-cover Classification with Deformable Vision Transformer), a framework that combines generative data creation with a deformation-aware Vision Transformer. A text-guided diffusion pipeline uses GPT-4o-generated scene descriptions and super-resolved exemplars to synthesize class-balanced, high-fidelity training images, while DViT couples a DCNv4 deformable convolutional backbone with a Vision Transformer encoder to jointly capture fine-scale geometry and global context. On eight classes from the Aerial Image Dataset (AID)-Beach, Bridge, Desert, Forest, Mountain, Pond, Port, and River-DViT achieves 0.9572 overall accuracy, 0.9576 macro F1-score, and 0.9510 Cohen' s Kappa, improving over a vanilla ViT baseline (0.9274 OA, 0.9300 macro F1, 0.9169 Kappa) and outperforming ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and FlashInternImage. Cross-dataset experiments on a three-class SIRI-WHU subset (Harbor, Pond, River) yield 0.9333 overall accuracy, 0.9316 macro F1, and 0.8989 Kappa, indicating good transferability. An LLM-based judge using GPT-4o to score Grad-CAM heatmaps further shows that DViT' s attention aligns best with hydrologically meaningful structures. These results suggest that description-driven generative augmentation combined with deformation-aware transformers is a promising approach for high-resolution land-cover mapping.

Motivation: 现有系统在激进的6自由度轨迹和复杂户外布局下表现不佳，缺乏长程几何一致性或偏离目标路径。

Method: 设计了一种姿态条件的视频生成方法，通过动态局部记忆和检索器获取姿态对齐的世界标记，以此沿轨迹生成视频。

Result: Captain Safari在视频质量、3D一致性和轨迹跟随上显著优于现有方法，MEt3R降低至0.3690，AUC@30提升至0.200，人类偏好调查中67.6%选择该方法。

Conclusion: Captain Safari通过引入姿态条件的世界记忆机制，显著提升了长时程、可控视频生成的性能，并在OpenSafari数据集上验证了其优越性。

Abstract: World engines aim to synthesize long, 3D-consistent videos that support interactive exploration of a scene under user-controlled camera motion. However, existing systems struggle under aggressive 6-DoF trajectories and complex outdoor layouts: they lose long-range geometric coherence, deviate from the target path, or collapse into overly conservative motion. To this end, we introduce Captain Safari, a pose-conditioned world engine that generates videos by retrieving from a persistent world memory. Given a camera path, our method maintains a dynamic local memory and uses a retriever to fetch pose-aligned world tokens, which then condition video generation along the trajectory. This design enables the model to maintain stable 3D structure while accurately executing challenging camera maneuvers. To evaluate this setting, we curate OpenSafari, a new in-the-wild FPV dataset containing high-dynamic drone videos with verified camera trajectories, constructed through a multi-stage geometric and kinematic validation pipeline. Across video quality, 3D consistency, and trajectory following, Captain Safari substantially outperforms state-of-the-art camera-controlled generators. It reduces MEt3R from 0.3703 to 0.3690, improves AUC@30 from 0.181 to 0.200, and yields substantially lower FVD than all camera-controlled baselines. More importantly, in a 50-participant, 5-way human study where annotators select the best result among five anonymized models, 67.6% of preferences favor our method across all axes. Our results demonstrate that pose-conditioned world memory is a powerful mechanism for long-horizon, controllable video generation and provide OpenSafari as a challenging new benchmark for future world-engine research.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), a fundamental question remains: are MLLMs robust to contradicting modalities? To rigorously study this, we introduce MMA-Bench comprising videos and tasks that probe a model's reliance on specific modalities. Using black-box and white-box interpretability techniques, we provide a critical analysis of the brittleness of both open- and closed-sourced MLLMs. We show that current MLLMs struggle under misaligned audio-visual pairs and simple misleading text, thereby lacking robust multi-modal reasoning. Building on these findings, we propose a modality alignment tuning strategy to teach the model when to prioritize, leverage, or ignore specific modality cues. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we show that our alignment tuning yields demonstrably stronger multimodal grounding. This work provides both interpretability tools and a clear path toward developing MLLMs with intrinsically reliable cross-modal reasoning. Code and dataset will be publicly available.

Motivation: 现有MKB-VQA基准存在视觉捷径问题，模型可能仅依赖视觉线索而非真实理解，需构建更严格的基准以评估模型能力。

Method: 通过LLM驱动的流程自动构建RETINA基准，包含12万训练样本和2千人工筛选测试样本；提出MIMIR模型，通过增强多个相关实体的图像来丰富文档嵌入。

Result: 在RETINA上，现有模型性能显著下降，验证了其对视觉捷径的依赖；MIMIR在RETINA上表现优于仅使用单图像的现有方法。

Conclusion: RETINA基准和MIMIR模型有效解决了现有MKB-VQA基准中的视觉捷径问题，验证了现有模型的局限性并展示了新方法的有效性。

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (MKB-VQA) benchmarks suffer from "visual shortcuts", as the query image typically matches the primary subject entity of the target document. We demonstrate that models can exploit these shortcuts, achieving comparable results using visual cues alone. To address this, we introduce Relational Entity Text-Image kNowledge Augmented (RETINA) benchmark, automatically constructed using an LLM-driven pipeline, consisting of 120k training and 2k human-curated test set. RETINA contains queries referencing secondary subjects (i.e. related entities) and pairs them with images of these related entities, removing the visual shortcut. When evaluated on RETINA existing models show significantly degraded performance, confirming their reliance on the shortcut. Furthermore, we propose Multi-Image MultImodal Retriever (MIMIR), which enriches document embeddings by augmenting images of multiple related entities, effectively handling RETINA, unlike prior work that uses only a single image per document. Our experiments validate the limitations of existing benchmarks and demonstrate the effectiveness of RETINA and MIMIR. Our project is available at: Project Page.

Conclusion: SLEUTH框架通过多代理协作和层次化精炼，显著提升了长文档理解任务的性能，并在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。

Abstract: Document understanding is a long standing practical task. Vision Language Models (VLMs) have gradually become a primary approach in this domain, demonstrating effective performance on single page tasks. However, their effectiveness diminishes when handling long documents. In such scenarios, clues are often scattered across multiple pages and modalities, and redundancy from lengthy inputs can impair the models judgment. While retrieval augmented generation mitigates this issue by filtering for question relevant content, the retrieved results still contain substantial redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose SLEUTH, a multi agent framework. Concretely, SLEUTH orchestrates a retriever and four collaborative agents in a coarse to fine process. The framework identifies key textual and visual clues within the retrieved pages, filters for salient visual evidence such as tables and charts, and analyzes the query to devise a reasoning strategy. It ultimately synthesizes a distilled, evidence dense multimodal context to generate the final prediction. SLEUTH is model agnostic and scalable. When paired with advanced VLM backbones, it consistently improves performance on multiple long document benchmarks, achieving state of the art results. Ablation studies verify each modules effectiveness and confirm the benefits of our hierarchical refinement paradigm.

Abstract: Inverse rendering of indoor scenes remains challenging due to the ambiguity between reflectance and lighting, exacerbated by inter-reflections among multiple objects. While natural illumination-based methods struggle to resolve this ambiguity, co-located light-camera setups offer better disentanglement as lighting can be easily calibrated via Structure-from-Motion. However, such setups introduce additional complexities like strong inter-reflections, dynamic shadows, near-field lighting, and moving specular highlights, which existing approaches fail to handle. We present GLOW, a Global Illumination-aware Inverse Rendering framework designed to address these challenges. GLOW integrates a neural implicit surface representation with a neural radiance cache to approximate global illumination, jointly optimizing geometry and reflectance through carefully designed regularization and initialization. We then introduce a dynamic radiance cache that adapts to sharp lighting discontinuities from near-field motion, and a surface-angle-weighted radiometric loss to suppress specular artifacts common in flashlight captures. Experiments show that GLOW substantially outperforms prior methods in material reflectance estimation under both natural and co-located illumination.

Conclusion: CoordSpeaker通过创新的手势字幕框架和条件潜在扩散模型，成功解决了语义先验差距和多模态控制协调问题，显著提升了伴随语音手势生成的质量和效率。

Abstract: Co-speech gesture generation has significantly advanced human-computer interaction, yet speaker movements remain constrained due to the omission of text-driven non-spontaneous gestures (e.g., bowing while talking). Existing methods face two key challenges: 1) the semantic prior gap due to the lack of descriptive text annotations in gesture datasets, and 2) the difficulty in achieving coordinated multimodal control over gesture generation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces CoordSpeaker, a comprehensive framework that enables coordinated caption-empowered co-speech gesture synthesis. Our approach first bridges the semantic prior gap through a novel gesture captioning framework, leveraging a motion-language model to generate descriptive captions at multiple granularities. Building upon this, we propose a conditional latent diffusion model with unified cross-dataset motion representation and a hierarchically controlled denoiser to achieve highly controlled, coordinated gesture generation. CoordSpeaker pioneers the first exploration of gesture understanding and captioning to tackle the semantic gap in gesture generation while offering a novel perspective of bidirectional gesture-text mapping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method produces high-quality gestures that are both rhythmically synchronized with speeches and semantically coherent with arbitrary captions, achieving superior performance with higher efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: 通过结合潜在扩散模型与可扩展的骨干网络及强条件约束，本研究为条件性4D fMRI合成开辟了实用路径，为虚拟实验、跨站点数据协调及下游神经影像模型的增强应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Generating whole-brain 4D fMRI sequences conditioned on cognitive tasks remains challenging due to the high-dimensional, heterogeneous BOLD dynamics across subjects/acquisitions and the lack of neuroscience-grounded validation. We introduce the first diffusion transformer for voxelwise 4D fMRI conditional generation, combining 3D VQ-GAN latent compression with a CNN-Transformer backbone and strong task conditioning via AdaLN-Zero and cross-attention. On HCP task fMRI, our model reproduces task-evoked activation maps, preserves the inter-task representational structure observed in real data (RSA), achieves perfect condition specificity, and aligns ROI time-courses with canonical hemodynamic responses. Performance improves predictably with scale, reaching task-evoked map correlation of 0.83 and RSA of 0.98, consistently surpassing a U-Net baseline on all metrics. By coupling latent diffusion with a scalable backbone and strong conditioning, this work establishes a practical path to conditional 4D fMRI synthesis, paving the way for future applications such as virtual experiments, cross-site harmonization, and principled augmentation for downstream neuroimaging models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低中收入国家多模式交通环境下行人安全监控中缺乏人口统计信息的问题。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络（CNNs）从远视角交叉口视频中分类行人年龄组和性别，不依赖面部识别或高分辨率图像。采用ResNet50和自定义轻量级CNN两种架构，探索了不同池化策略和优化器的组合。

Result: ResNet50结合Max Pooling和SGD达到最高准确率（86.19%），自定义CNN性能接近（84.15%）但计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的深度学习框架能够高效分类行人年龄和性别，为城市交叉口的安全规划和干预提供了数据支持。

Abstract: Pedestrian safety remains a pressing concern in congested urban intersections, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where traffic is multimodal, and infrastructure often lacks formal control. Demographic factors like age and gender significantly influence pedestrian vulnerability, yet real-time monitoring systems rarely capture this information. To address this gap, this study proposes a deep learning framework that classifies pedestrian age group and gender from far-view intersection footage using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), without relying on facial recognition or high-resolution imagery. The classification is structured as a unified six-class problem, distinguishing adult, teenager, and child pedestrians for both males and females, based on full-body visual cues. Video data was collected from three high-risk intersections in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Two CNN architectures were implemented: ResNet50, a deep convolutional neural network pretrained on ImageNet, and a custom lightweight CNN optimized for computational efficiency. Eight model variants explored combinations of pooling strategies and optimizers. ResNet50 with Max Pooling and SGD achieved the highest accuracy (86.19%), while the custom CNN performed comparably (84.15%) with fewer parameters and faster training. The model's efficient design enables real-time inference on standard surveillance feeds. For practitioners, this system provides a scalable, cost-effective tool to monitor pedestrian demographics at intersections using existing camera infrastructure. Its outputs can shape intersection design, optimize signal timing, and enable targeted safety interventions for vulnerable groups such as children or the elderly. By offering demographic insights often missing in conventional traffic data, the framework supports more inclusive, data-driven planning in mixed-traffic environments.

Method: 提出ClearGCD框架，包含Semantic View Alignment（通过跨类别补丁替换生成强增强并利用弱增强保持语义一致性）和Shortcut Suppression Regularization（维护自适应原型库以对齐已知类别并分离潜在新类别）。

Result: ClearGCD在多个基准测试中 consistently 优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: ClearGCD通过Semantic View Alignment和Shortcut Suppression Regularization有效解决了GCD中的原型混淆问题，显著提升了在开放世界场景下的分类性能。

Abstract: In open-world scenarios, Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) requires identifying both known and novel categories within unlabeled data. However, existing methods often suffer from prototype confusion caused by shortcut learning, which undermines generalization and leads to forgetting of known classes. We propose ClearGCD, a framework designed to mitigate reliance on non-semantic cues through two complementary mechanisms. First, Semantic View Alignment (SVA) generates strong augmentations via cross-class patch replacement and enforces semantic consistency using weak augmentations. Second, Shortcut Suppression Regularization (SSR) maintains an adaptive prototype bank that aligns known classes while encouraging separation of potential novel ones. ClearGCD can be seamlessly integrated into parametric GCD approaches and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks.

Motivation: 多模态多目标跟踪中，简单融合方法难以处理异构模态间的非线性分布差异，导致模态冲突和跟踪精度下降。

Method: 提出DM$^3$T框架，利用Cross-Modal Diffusion Fusion模块进行迭代跨模态特征对齐，并通过Diffusion Refiner优化特征表示。

Result: 在VT-MOT基准测试中，DM$^3$T达到41.7 HOTA，相对现有最优方法提升1.54%。

Conclusion: DM$^3$T通过提出的Cross-Modal Diffusion Fusion模块和Diffusion Refiner，实现了多模态特征的迭代对齐和深度融合，显著提升了多目标跟踪的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a fundamental task in computer vision with critical applications in autonomous driving and robotics. Multimodal MOT that integrates visible light and thermal infrared information is particularly essential for robust autonomous driving systems. However, effectively fusing these heterogeneous modalities is challenging. Simple strategies like concatenation or addition often fail to bridge the significant non-linear distribution gap between their feature representations, which can lead to modality conflicts and degrade tracking accuracy. Drawing inspiration from the connection between multimodal MOT and the iterative refinement in diffusion models, this paper proposes DM$^3$T, a novel framework that reformulates multimodal fusion as an iterative feature alignment process to generate accurate and temporally coherent object trajectories. Our approach performs iterative cross-modal harmonization through a proposed Cross-Modal Diffusion Fusion (C-MDF) module. In this process, features from both modalities provide mutual guidance, iteratively projecting them onto a shared, consistent feature manifold. This enables the learning of complementary information and achieves deeper fusion compared to conventional methods. Additionally, we introduce a plug-and-play Diffusion Refiner (DR) to enhance and refine the unified feature representation. To further improve tracking robustness, we design a Hierarchical Tracker that adaptively handles confidence estimation. DM$^3$T unifies object detection, state estimation, and data association into a comprehensive online tracking framework without complex post-processing. Extensive experiments on the VT-MOT benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves 41.7 HOTA, representing a 1.54% relative improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: P2C框架通过引入语义云的概念和双重去噪机制，显著提升了多模态提示学习的鲁棒性和泛化能力，在11个数据集上表现优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Multimodal Prompt Learning (MPL) has emerged as a pivotal technique for adapting large-scale Visual Language Models (VLMs). However, current MPL methods are fundamentally limited by their optimization of a single, static point representation. This paradigm is inherently brittle, leads to overfitting on base classes, and generalizes poorly to novel or ambiguous categories. We challenge this point paradigm, proposing that robust generalization requires learning a semantic cloud (i.e., a distribution over the embedding space). To achieve this, we introduce Points-to-Clouds (P2C), a novel framework inspired by diffusion models that reframes prompt learning as a dynamic denoising task. At the core of P2C is a dual denoising mechanism: a Dynamic Prompt Denoising (DPD) mechanism perturbs text prompts with sophisticated, annealed noise to learn a smoother semantic landscape, while an auxiliary V-L Mapper denoising loss re-tasks the mapper as a denoising autoencoder. This forces the mapper to reconstruct clean visual prompts from noisy text inputs, ensuring robust cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments across 11 datasets demonstrate that P2C consistently outperforms strong baselines. On the base-to-novel generalization benchmark, our method achieves a Harmonic Mean of 79.7%, representing a relative improvement of 1.4% over the baseline.

Abstract: Video moment retrieval (MR) and highlight detection (HD) with natural language queries aim to localize relevant moments and key highlights in a video clips. However, existing methods overlook the importance of individual words, treating the entire text query and video clips as a black-box, which hinders contextual understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that enables fine-grained clip filtering by identifying and prioritizing important words in the query. Our method integrates image-text scene understanding through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and enhances the semantic understanding of video clips. We introduce a feature enhancement module (FEM) to capture important words from the query and a ranking-based filtering module (RFM) to iteratively refine video clips based on their relevance to these important words. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both MR and HD tasks.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in 3D vision. Most existing methods only use geometric information for registration. Recently proposed RGB-D registration methods primarily focus on feature fusion or improving feature learning, which limits their ability to exploit image information and hinders their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose ViGG, a robust RGB-D registration method using mutual guidance. First, we solve clique alignment in a visual-geometric combination form, employing a geometric guidance design to suppress ambiguous cliques. Second, to mitigate accuracy degradation caused by noise in visual matches, we propose a visual-guided geometric matching method that utilizes visual priors to determine the search space, enabling the extraction of high-quality, noise-insensitive correspondences. This mutual guidance strategy brings our method superior robustness, making it applicable for various RGB-D registration tasks. The experiments on 3DMatch, ScanNet and KITTI datasets show that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in both learning-free and learning-based settings.

Motivation: 探讨当前视觉语言模型在艺术作品情感表达分析中的能力，填补抽象情感识别技术的空白。

Method: 通过案例研究，对三种VLMs（Llava-Llama和两种Qwen模型）进行四组复杂度递增的问题测试（一般内容、情感内容、情感表达及情感符号），并进行专家定性评估。

Result: VLMs能较好识别图像内容及情感，但在抽象或象征性图像上表现不佳，符号识别仍具挑战性，且存在回答不一致的缺陷。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在识别艺术作品内容及情感表达方面表现良好，尤其在具象图像上，但在高度抽象或象征性图像上表现不佳，且存在回答不一致的问题。

Abstract: Emotions are a fundamental aspect of artistic expression. Due to their abstract nature, there is a broad spectrum of emotion realization in artworks. These are subject to historical change and their analysis requires expertise in art history. In this article, we investigate which aspects of emotional expression can be detected by current (2025) vision language models (VLMs). We present a case study of three VLMs (Llava-Llama and two Qwen models) in which we ask these models four sets of questions of increasing complexity about artworks (general content, emotional content, expression of emotions, and emotion symbols) and carry out a qualitative expert evaluation. We find that the VLMs recognize the content of the images surprisingly well and often also which emotions they depict and how they are expressed. The models perform best for concrete images but fail for highly abstract or highly symbolic images. Reliable recognition of symbols remains fundamentally difficult. Furthermore, the models continue to exhibit the well-known LLM weakness of providing inconsistent answers to related questions.

Method: NeuMatC无监督地学习从参数到对应矩阵运算结果的低秩连续映射，训练后仅需少量基本操作（如矩阵乘法和非线性激活）即可在任意参数下高效计算。

Conclusion: NeuMatC通过利用参数维度的低秩性和连续性，显著减少了重复计算，在保持可接受精度的同时，实现了比传统方法更高效的矩阵运算。

Abstract: Matrix operations (e.g., inversion and singular value decomposition (SVD)) are fundamental in science and engineering. In many emerging real-world applications (such as wireless communication and signal processing), these operations must be performed repeatedly over matrices with parameters varying continuously. However, conventional methods tackle each matrix operation independently, underexploring the inherent low-rankness and continuity along the parameter dimension, resulting in significantly redundant computation. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{\textit{Neural Matrix Computation Framework} (NeuMatC)}, which elegantly tackles general parametric matrix operation tasks by leveraging the underlying low-rankness and continuity along the parameter dimension. Specifically, NeuMatC unsupervisedly learns a low-rank and continuous mapping from parameters to their corresponding matrix operation results. Once trained, NeuMatC enables efficient computations at arbitrary parameters using only a few basic operations (e.g., matrix multiplications and nonlinear activations), significantly reducing redundant computations. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the promising performance of NeuMatC, exemplified by over $3\times$ speedup in parametric inversion and $10\times$ speedup in parametric SVD compared to the widely used NumPy baseline in wireless communication, while maintaining acceptable accuracy.

Abstract: The rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) raises concerns about the authenticity of digital media. In this context, image self-recovery, reconstructing original content from its manipulated version, offers a practical solution for understanding the attacker's intent and restoring trustworthy data. However, existing methods often fail to accurately recover tampered regions, falling short of the primary goal of self-recovery. To address this challenge, we propose ReImage, a neural watermarking-based self-recovery framework that embeds a shuffled version of the target image into itself as a watermark. We design a generator that produces watermarks optimized for neural watermarking and introduce an image enhancement module to refine the recovered image. We further analyze and resolve key limitations of shuffled watermarking, enabling its effective use in self-recovery. We demonstrate that ReImage achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tampering scenarios, consistently producing high-quality recovered images. The code and pretrained models will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Burst denoising methods are crucial for enhancing images captured on handheld devices, but they often struggle with large motion or suffer from prohibitive computational costs. In this paper, we propose DenoiseGS, the first framework to leverage the efficiency of 3D Gaussian Splatting for burst denoising. Our approach addresses two key challenges when applying feedforward Gaussian reconsturction model to noisy inputs: the degradation of Gaussian point clouds and the loss of fine details. To this end, we propose a Gaussian self-consistency (GSC) loss, which regularizes the geometry predicted from noisy inputs with high-quality Gaussian point clouds. These point clouds are generated from clean inputs by the same model that we are training, thereby alleviating potential bias or domain gaps. Additionally, we introduce a log-weighted frequency (LWF) loss to strengthen supervision within the spectral domain, effectively preserving fine-grained details. The LWF loss adaptively weights frequency discrepancies in a logarithmic manner, emphasizing challenging high-frequency details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DenoiseGS significantly exceeds the state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods on both burst denoising and novel view synthesis under noisy conditions, while achieving \textbf{250$\times$} faster inference speed.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have greatly improved pose-driven character animation. However, existing methods are limited to spatially aligned reference-pose pairs with matched skeletal structures. Handling reference-pose misalignment remains unsolved. To address this, we present One-to-All Animation, a unified framework for high-fidelity character animation and image pose transfer for references with arbitrary layouts. First, to handle spatially misaligned reference, we reformulate training as a self-supervised outpainting task that transforms diverse-layout reference into a unified occluded-input format. Second, to process partially visible reference, we design a reference extractor for comprehensive identity feature extraction. Further, we integrate hybrid reference fusion attention to handle varying resolutions and dynamic sequence lengths. Finally, from the perspective of generation quality, we introduce identity-robust pose control that decouples appearance from skeletal structure to mitigate pose overfitting, and a token replace strategy for coherent long-video generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 领域泛化在语义分割中面临领域偏移的挑战，尤其是在恶劣条件下。扩散生成方法虽有望解决此问题，但会引入生成图像与语义掩码之间的固有不对齐性。

Method: FLEX-Seg包含三个关键组件：1) 多尺度边界特征捕捉的Granular Adaptive Prototypes；2) 基于预测熵动态调整学习重点的Uncertainty Boundary Emphasis；3) 逐步聚焦于挑战性样本的Hardness-Aware Sampling。

Result: 在五个真实数据集上的实验显示，FLEX-Seg相比现有最优方法有显著提升，在ACDC和Dark Zurich上分别实现了2.44%和2.63%的mIoU增益。

Conclusion: FLEX-Seg框架通过利用生成数据中的固有不对齐性，而非强制对齐，实现了对丰富风格变化的捕捉和鲁棒表征的学习，从而在领域泛化任务中取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Domain generalization in semantic segmentation faces challenges from domain shifts, particularly under adverse conditions. While diffusion-based data generation methods show promise, they introduce inherent misalignment between generated images and semantic masks. This paper presents FLEX-Seg (FLexible Edge eXploitation for Segmentation), a framework that transforms this limitation into an opportunity for robust learning. FLEX-Seg comprises three key components: (1) Granular Adaptive Prototypes that captures boundary characteristics across multiple scales, (2) Uncertainty Boundary Emphasis that dynamically adjusts learning emphasis based on prediction entropy, and (3) Hardness-Aware Sampling that progressively focuses on challenging examples. By leveraging inherent misalignment rather than enforcing strict alignment, FLEX-Seg learns robust representations while capturing rich stylistic variations. Experiments across five real-world datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving 2.44% and 2.63% mIoU gains on ACDC and Dark Zurich. Our findings validate that adaptive strategies for handling imperfect synthetic data lead to superior domain generalization. Code is available at https://github.com/VisualScienceLab-KHU/FLEX-Seg.

Conclusion: SolarCHIP 提供了一种针对 SDO 数据的预训练视觉骨干网络，显著提升了跨模态翻译和耀斑分类任务的性能，尤其在低资源场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized solar image analysis, yet most approaches train task-specific encoders from scratch or rely on natural-image pretraining that ignores the unique characteristics of Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) data. We introduce SolarCHIP, a family of contrastively pretrained visual backbones tailored to multi-instrument SDO observations. SolarCHIP addresses three key challenges in solar imaging: multimodal sensing across AIA and HMI instruments, weak inter-class separability due to slow temporal evolution, and strong intra-class variability with sparse activity signals. Our pretraining framework employs a multi-granularity contrastive objective that jointly aligns (1) global class tokens across co-temporal AIA-HMI pairs to enhance temporal discrimination, (2) local patch tokens at fixed spatial indices to enforce position-consistent, modality-invariant features, and (3) intra-sample patches across different spatial locations to preserve fine-grained spatial structure. We train both CNN- and Vision Transformer-based autoencoders and demonstrate their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: cross-modal translation between HMI and AIA passbands via ControlNet, and full-disk flare classification. Experimental results show that SolarCHIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tasks, with particularly strong gains in low-resource settings where labeled data is limited. Ablation studies confirm that each contrastive component contributes essential discriminative capacity at different granularities. By publicly releasing pretrained weights and training code, we provide the heliophysics community with a practical, plug-and-play feature extractor that reduces computational requirements, improves label efficiency, and establishes a reusable foundation for diverse solar imaging applications.

Conclusion: 提出的分层多模态表示方法在3D场景理解中表现出色，通过显式对齐VLM输入空间和多视角图像与文本描述，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant promise for 3D scene understanding. Existing VLM-based approaches typically align 3D scene features with the VLM's embedding space. However, this implicit alignment often yields suboptimal performance due to the scarcity of 3D data and the inherent complexity of spatial relationships in 3D environments. To address these limitations, we propose a novel hierarchical multimodal representation for 3D scene reasoning that explicitly aligns with VLMs at the input space by leveraging both multi-view images and text descriptions. The text descriptions capture spatial relationships by referencing the 3D coordinates of detected objects, while the multi-view images include a top-down perspective and four directional views (forward, left, right, and backward), ensuring comprehensive scene coverage. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical feature representation that aggregates patch-level image features into view-level and scene-level representations, enabling the model to reason over both local and global scene context. Experimental results on both situated 3D Q&A and general 3D Q&A benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Method: 论文提出了两个关键设计：1. IAN模块主动解耦场景的内在属性（如反照率）和瞬时光照，学习标准化的光照不变外观模型；2. DRB-Loss仅在图像曝光不良时激活，直接在辐射场上进行针对性优化。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的语义SLAM框架通过IAN模块和DRB-Loss的协同作用，在极端光照条件下实现了前所未有的鲁棒性，并在公开数据集上展示了在相机跟踪、地图质量以及语义和几何精度方面的最先进性能。

Abstract: Extreme exposure degrades both the 3D map reconstruction and semantic segmentation accuracy, which is particularly detrimental to tightly-coupled systems. To achieve illumination invariance, we propose a novel semantic SLAM framework with two designs. First, the Intrinsic Appearance Normalization (IAN) module proactively disentangles the scene's intrinsic properties, such as albedo, from transient lighting. By learning a standardized, illumination-invariant appearance model, it assigns a stable and consistent color representation to each Gaussian primitive. Second, the Dynamic Radiance Balancing Loss (DRB-Loss) reactively handles frames with extreme exposure. It activates only when an image's exposure is poor, operating directly on the radiance field to guide targeted optimization. This prevents error accumulation from extreme lighting without compromising performance under normal conditions. The synergy between IAN's proactive invariance and DRB-Loss's reactive correction endows our system with unprecedented robustness. Evaluations on public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in camera tracking, map quality, and semantic and geometric accuracy.

Conclusion: BlockVid通过引入语义感知稀疏KV缓存、块强制训练策略以及专用的噪声调度和混洗技术，显著提升了长视频生成的连贯性和质量，并在LV-Bench和VBench上表现优异。

Abstract: Generating minute-long videos is a critical step toward developing world models, providing a foundation for realistic extended scenes and advanced AI simulators. The emerging semi-autoregressive (block diffusion) paradigm integrates the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive models, enabling arbitrary-length video generation and improving inference efficiency through KV caching and parallel sampling. However, it yet faces two enduring challenges: (i) KV-cache-induced long-horizon error accumulation, and (ii) the lack of fine-grained long-video benchmarks and coherence-aware metrics. To overcome these limitations, we propose BlockVid, a novel block diffusion framework equipped with semantic-aware sparse KV cache, an effective training strategy called Block Forcing, and dedicated chunk-wise noise scheduling and shuffling to reduce error propagation and enhance temporal consistency. We further introduce LV-Bench, a fine-grained benchmark for minute-long videos, complete with new metrics evaluating long-range coherence. Extensive experiments on VBench and LV-Bench demonstrate that BlockVid consistently outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, coherent minute-long videos. In particular, it achieves a 22.2% improvement on VDE Subject and a 19.4% improvement on VDE Clarity in LV-Bench over the state of the art approaches. Project website: https://ziplab.co/BlockVid.

Method: McSc采用三阶段强化学习框架：1. Self-critic Dimensional Reasoning (ScDR)训练生成式奖励模型分解偏好至各维度；2. Hierarchical Comparative Reasoning (HCR)实现结构化多维度推理；3. Motion-corrective Direct Preference Optimization (McDPO)优化T2V模型并动态调整目标权重。

Conclusion: McSc框架通过三阶段强化学习方法有效解决了文本到视频生成中的人偏好对齐问题，尤其在动态运动内容生成上表现优异。

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has achieved remarkable progress in producing high-quality videos aligned with textual prompts. However, aligning synthesized videos with nuanced human preference remains challenging due to the subjective and multifaceted nature of human judgment. Existing video preference alignment methods rely on costly human annotations or utilize proxy metrics to predict preference, which lacks the understanding of human preference logic. Moreover, they usually directly align T2V models with the overall preference distribution, ignoring potential conflict dimensions like motion dynamics and visual quality, which may bias models towards low-motion content. To address these issues, we present Motion-corrective alignment with Self-critic hierarchical Reasoning (McSc), a three-stage reinforcement learning framework for robust preference modeling and alignment. Firstly, Self-critic Dimensional Reasoning (ScDR) trains a generative reward model (RM) to decompose preferences into per-dimension assessments, using self-critic reasoning chains for reliable learning. Secondly, to achieve holistic video comparison, we introduce Hierarchical Comparative Reasoning (HCR) for structural multi-dimensional reasoning with hierarchical reward supervision. Finally, using RM-preferred videos, we propose Motion-corrective Direct Preference Optimization (McDPO) to optimize T2V models, while dynamically re-weighting alignment objective to mitigate bias towards low-motion content. Experiments show that McSc achieves superior performance in human preference alignment and generates videos with high-motion dynamic.

Method: 将卷积特征视为高斯分布的特征信号矩阵，提出了一种简单有效的低幅度通过滤波器（CFF）。

Result: 实验结果表明，CFF减少了特征信号矩阵中的噪声，并通过二值化方程计算特征信号的信息熵以量化观察。

Conclusion: 提出的卷积特征滤波器（CFF）有效减少了特征信号矩阵中的噪声，并通过实验验证了其效果。

Abstract: Noise reduction constitutes a crucial operation within Digital Signal Processing. Regrettably, it frequently remains neglected when dealing with the processing of convolutional features in segmentation networks. This oversight could trigger the butterfly effect, impairing the subsequent outcomes within the entire feature system. To complete this void, we consider convolutional features following Gaussian distributions as feature signal matrices and then present a simple and effective feature filter in this study. The proposed filter is fundamentally a low-amplitude pass filter primarily aimed at minimizing noise in feature signal inputs and is named Convolutional Feature Filter (CFF). We conducted experiments on two established 2D segmentation networks and two public cardiac MR image datasets to validate the effectiveness of the CFF, and the experimental findings demonstrated a decrease in noise within the feature signal matrices. To enable a numerical observation and analysis of this reduction, we developed a binarization equation to calculate the information entropy of feature signals.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image generation models have acquired the ability of multi-reference generation and editing; the ability to inherit the appearance of subjects from multiple reference images and re-render them under new contexts. However, the existing benchmark datasets often focus on the generation with single or a few reference images, which prevents us from measuring the progress on how model performance advances or pointing out their weaknesses, under different multi-reference conditions. In addition, their task definitions are still vague, typically limited to axes such as "what to edit" or "how many references are given", and therefore fail to capture the intrinsic difficulty of multi-reference settings. To address this gap, we introduce $\textbf{MultiBanana}$, which is carefully designed to assesses the edge of model capabilities by widely covering multi-reference-specific problems at scale: (1) varying the number of references, (2) domain mismatch among references (e.g., photo vs. anime), (3) scale mismatch between reference and target scenes, (4) references containing rare concepts (e.g., a red banana), and (5) multilingual textual references for rendering. Our analysis among a variety of text-to-image models reveals their superior performances, typical failure modes, and areas for improvement. MultiBanana will be released as an open benchmark to push the boundaries and establish a standardized basis for fair comparison in multi-reference image generation.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become a widely adopted and practical approach for enhancing generation quality and improving condition alignment. Recent studies have explored guidance mechanisms for unconditional generation, yet these approaches remain fundamentally tied to assumptions specific to diffusion models. In this work, we propose a spectrum-weakening framework for visual autoregressive (AR) models. This method works without the need for re-training, specific conditions, or any architectural modifications. It achieves this by constructing a controllable weak model in the spectral domain. We theoretically show that invertible spectral transformations preserve information, while selectively retaining only a subset of spectrum introduces controlled information reduction. Based on this insight, we perform spectrum selection along the channel dimension of internal representations, which avoids the structural constraints imposed by diffusion models. We further introduce two spectrum renormalization strategies that ensures numerical stability during the weakening process. Extensive experiments were conducted on both discrete and continuous AR models, with text or class conditioning. The results demonstrate that our method enables high-quality unconditional generation while maintaining strong prompt alignment for conditional generation.

Conclusion: JarvisEvo通过iMCoT和SEPO框架有效解决了指令幻觉和奖励黑客问题，显著提升了图像编辑的质量和保真度。

Abstract: Agent-based editing models have substantially advanced interactive experiences, processing quality, and creative flexibility. However, two critical challenges persist: (1) instruction hallucination, text-only chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning cannot fully prevent factual errors due to inherent information bottlenecks; (2) reward hacking, dynamic policy optimization against static reward models allows agents to exploit flaws in reward functions. To address these issues, we propose JarvisEvo, a unified image editing agent that emulates an expert human designer by iteratively editing, selecting appropriate tools, evaluating results, and reflecting on its own decisions to refine outcomes. JarvisEvo offers three key advantages: (1) an interleaved multimodal chain-of-thought (iMCoT) reasoning mechanism that enhances instruction following and editing quality; (2) a synergistic editor-evaluator policy optimization (SEPO) framework that enables self-improvement without external rewards, effectively mitigating reward hacking; and (3) support for both global and local fine-grained editing through seamless integration of Adobe Lightroom. On ArtEdit-Bench, JarvisEvo outperforms Nano-Banana by an average of 18.95% on preservative editing metrics, including a substantial 44.96% improvement in pixel-level content fidelity.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has been considered as a novel way for view synthesis of dynamic scenes, which shows great potential in AIoT applications such as digital twins. However, recent dynamic Gaussian Splatting methods significantly degrade when only sparse input views are available, limiting their applicability in practice. The issue arises from the incoherent learning of 4D geometry as input views decrease. This paper presents GC-4DGS, a novel framework that infuses geometric consistency into 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), offering real-time and high-quality dynamic scene rendering from sparse input views. While learning-based Multi-View Stereo (MVS) and monocular depth estimators (MDEs) provide geometry priors, directly integrating these with 4DGS yields suboptimal results due to the ill-posed nature of sparse-input 4D geometric optimization. To address these problems, we introduce a dynamic consistency checking strategy to reduce estimation uncertainties of MVS across spacetime. Furthermore, we propose a global-local depth regularization approach to distill spatiotemporal-consistent geometric information from monocular depths, thereby enhancing the coherent geometry and appearance learning within the 4D volume. Extensive experiments on the popular N3DV and Technicolor datasets validate the effectiveness of GC-4DGS in rendering quality without sacrificing efficiency. Notably, our method outperforms RF-DeRF, the latest dynamic radiance field tailored for sparse-input dynamic view synthesis, and the original 4DGS by 2.62dB and 1.58dB in PSNR, respectively, with seamless deployability on resource-constrained IoT edge devices.

Abstract: We present GOATex, a diffusion-based method for 3D mesh texturing that generates high-quality textures for both exterior and interior surfaces. While existing methods perform well on visible regions, they inherently lack mechanisms to handle occluded interiors, resulting in incomplete textures and visible seams. To address this, we introduce an occlusion-aware texturing framework based on the concept of hit levels, which quantify the relative depth of mesh faces via multi-view ray casting. This allows us to partition mesh faces into ordered visibility layers, from outermost to innermost. We then apply a two-stage visibility control strategy that progressively reveals interior regions with structural coherence, followed by texturing each layer using a pretrained diffusion model. To seamlessly merge textures obtained across layers, we propose a soft UV-space blending technique that weighs each texture's contribution based on view-dependent visibility confidence. Empirical results demonstrate that GOATex consistently outperforms existing methods, producing seamless, high-fidelity textures across both visible and occluded surfaces. Unlike prior works, GOATex operates entirely without costly fine-tuning of a pretrained diffusion model and allows separate prompting for exterior and interior mesh regions, enabling fine-grained control over layered appearances.

Abstract: Data valuation and monetization are becoming increasingly important across domains such as eXtended Reality (XR) and digital media. In the context of 3D scene reconstruction from a set of images -- whether casually or professionally captured -- not all inputs contribute equally to the final output. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) enable photorealistic 3D reconstruction of scenes by optimizing a volumetric radiance field given a set of images. However, in-the-wild scenes often include image captures of varying quality, occlusions, and transient objects, resulting in uneven utility across inputs. In this paper we propose a method to quantify the individual contribution of each image to NeRF-based reconstructions of in-the-wild image sets. Contribution is assessed through reconstruction quality metrics based on PSNR and MSE. We validate our approach by removing low-contributing images during training and measuring the resulting impact on reconstruction fidelity.

Conclusion: REP被证明是一种轻量级且有效的范式，能够在具有挑战性的缺失模态环境中实现稳健的多模态学习。

Abstract: Missing modalities consistently lead to significant performance degradation in multimodal models. Existing approaches either synthesize missing modalities at high computational cost or apply prompt-based fine-tuning that relies only on adjacent-layer features and overlooks long-distance contextual information, which may offer additional tolerance to errors when one or more modalities are missing. To address this, we introduce REplay Prompting (REP): (1) construct modality-wise feature buffers via a residual bypass to cache early-layer representations and replay them in deeper layers, mitigating information loss as network depth increases; (2) employ a private-shared feature decoupling strategy, where private buffers preserve modality-specific signals and shared buffers encode cross-modal semantics; and (3) design a task-aware dynamic initialization mechanism to configure these buffers differently, improving stability and generalization under diverse missing-modality conditions. Experiments on vision-language, vision-language-audio, and temporal multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that REP consistently outperforms prior methods under both single- and multi-modality missing scenarios, while introducing only negligible parameter overhead. These results establish REP as a lightweight and effective paradigm for robust multimodal learning in challenging missing-modality environments.

Motivation: 由于COVID-19和Data 3法案的修订促进了数字医疗市场的增长，但现有皮肤疾病诊断方法依赖主观评估且缺乏客观诊断工具，导致误诊风险高。此外，现有系统在临床环境中难以获取高质量图像，且需兼顾准确性和快速响应。

Method: 提出了一种基于集成学习的皮肤病变检测系统（ENSEL），通过集成多种深度学习模型来提升诊断准确性，并使用实际用户拍摄的皮肤病变图像进行实验验证。

Result: ENSEL在大多数图像中实现了高召回率，处理速度小于1秒。

Conclusion: ENSEL通过集成多种深度学习模型提高了皮肤病变的诊断准确性，并在实际用户拍摄的图像上验证了其性能，为皮肤病变的客观诊断和数字医疗的进步做出了贡献。

Abstract: The amendments made to the Data 3 Act and impact of COVID-19 have fostered the growth of digital healthcare market and promoted the use of medical data in artificial intelligence in South Korea. Atopic dermatitis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease, is diagnosed via subjective evaluations without using objective diagnostic methods, thereby increasing the risk of misdiagnosis. It is also similar to psoriasis in appearance, further complicating its accurate diagnosis. Existing studies on skin diseases have used high-quality dermoscopic image datasets, but such high-quality images cannot be obtained in actual clinical settings. Moreover, existing systems must ensure accuracy and fast response times. To this end, an ensemble learning-based skin lesion detection system (ENSEL) was proposed herein. ENSEL enhanced diagnostic accuracy by integrating various deep learning models via an ensemble approach. Its performance was verified by conducting skin lesion detection experiments using images of skin lesions taken by actual users. Its accuracy and response time were measured using randomly sampled skin disease images. Results revealed that ENSEL achieved high recall in most images and less than 1s s processing speed. This study contributes to the objective diagnosis of skin lesions and promotes the advancement of digital healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本指令在图像编辑中缺乏对编辑强度的细粒度控制，因此需要一种能够通过连续标量值精确调整图像属性的方法。

Method: NumeriKontrol 通过有效的 Numeric Adapter 编码数字编辑尺度，并以即插即用的方式注入扩散模型。采用任务分离设计，支持零样本多条件编辑。

Result: NumeriKontrol 在广泛的属性编辑场景中实现了准确、连续和稳定的尺度控制，并通过 Common Attribute Transform (CAT) 数据集提供了高质量监督。

Conclusion: NumeriKontrol 通过引入连续标量值和通用单位，显著提升了基于指令的图像编辑的精确度和可控性，支持零样本多条件编辑，并在广泛的属性编辑场景中实现了准确、连续和稳定的尺度控制。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing enables intuitive manipulation through natural language commands. However, text instructions alone often lack the precision required for fine-grained control over edit intensity. We introduce NumeriKontrol, a framework that allows users to precisely adjust image attributes using continuous scalar values with common units. NumeriKontrol encodes numeric editing scales via an effective Numeric Adapter and injects them into diffusion models in a plug-and-play manner. Thanks to a task-separated design, our approach supports zero-shot multi-condition editing, allowing users to specify multiple instructions in any order. To provide high-quality supervision, we synthesize precise training data from reliable sources, including high-fidelity rendering engines and DSLR cameras. Our Common Attribute Transform (CAT) dataset covers diverse attribute manipulations with accurate ground-truth scales, enabling NumeriKontrol to function as a simple yet powerful interactive editing studio. Extensive experiments show that NumeriKontrol delivers accurate, continuous, and stable scale control across a wide range of attribute editing scenarios. These contributions advance instruction-based image editing by enabling precise, scalable, and user-controllable image manipulation.

Motivation: 探讨视觉信息在视觉语言模型（VLMs）数学推理中的实际贡献，现有基准未明确区分视觉和语言先验的作用。

Method: 设计了MathSight基准，包含多种视觉变体（原始、手绘、照片）和纯文本条件，以量化视觉输入的影响。

Result: 实验显示，视觉信息贡献随问题难度增加而减少；Qwen3-VL在无图像输入时表现优于多模态变体和GPT-5。

Conclusion: MathSight基准揭示了视觉信息在数学推理中的作用随问题难度增加而减弱，未来模型需更注重真正的视觉基础推理。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal mathematical reasoning. Yet, how much visual information truly contributes to reasoning remains unclear. Existing benchmarks report strong overall performance but seldom isolate the role of the image modality, leaving open whether VLMs genuinely leverage visual understanding or merely depend on linguistic priors. To address this, we present MathSight, a university-level multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmark designed to disentangle and quantify the effect of visual input. Each problem includes multiple visual variants -- original, hand-drawn, photo-captured -- and a text-only condition for controlled comparison. Experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a consistent trend: the contribution of visual information diminishes with increasing problem difficulty. Remarkably, Qwen3-VL without any image input surpasses both its multimodal variants and GPT-5, underscoring the need for benchmarks like MathSight to advance genuine vision-grounded reasoning in future models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器（DiT）推理中的序列并行在视觉生成中至关重要，但稀疏注意力导致的负载不平衡严重阻碍了其效率。

Method: db-SP 通过动态调整并行度，实现了在头部和块级别的近乎完美的工作负载平衡。

Result: 实验表明，db-SP 在端到端速度上提升了 1.25 倍，注意力特定速度提升了 1.40 倍。

Conclusion: db-SP 提出了一种双级分区方法，有效解决了序列并行中的稀疏不平衡问题，显著提升了推理速度。

Abstract: Scaling Diffusion Transformer (DiT) inference via sequence parallelism is critical for reducing latency in visual generation, but is severely hampered by workload imbalance when applied to models employing block-wise sparse attention. The imbalance stems from the inherent variation in sparsity across attention heads and the irregular distribution of dense blocks within the sparse mask, when sequence parallelism is applied along the head dimension (as in Ulysses) or the block dimension (as in Ring Attention). In this paper, we formalize a sparse imbalance ratio to quantify the imbalance, and propose db-SP, a sparsity-aware sequence parallelism technique that tackles the challenge. db-SP contains a dual-level partitioning approach that achieves near-perfect workload balance at both the head and block levels with negligible overhead. Furthermore, to handle the evolving sparsity patterns across denoising steps and layers, db-SP dynamically determines the parallel degrees for the head and block dimensions at runtime. Experimental results demonstrate that db-SP delivers an end-to-end speedup of 1.25x and an attention-specific speedup of 1.40x over state-of-the-art sequence parallel methods on average.

Result: 实验表明ACIEC能有效桥接情感鸿沟，在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: ACIEC方法通过纯文本有效捕捉图像中的情感信息，成功解决了情感鸿沟问题，并在多个基准测试中取得了优异结果。

Abstract: Image emotion classification (IEC) is a longstanding research field that has received increasing attention with the rapid progress of deep learning. Although recent advances have leveraged the knowledge encoded in pre-trained visual models, their effectiveness is constrained by the "affective gap" , limits the applicability of pre-training knowledge for IEC tasks. It has been demonstrated in psychology that language exhibits high variability, encompasses diverse and abundant information, and can effectively eliminate the "affective gap". Inspired by this, we propose a novel Affective Captioning for Image Emotion Classification (ACIEC) to classify image emotion based on pure texts, which effectively capture the affective information in the image. In our method, a hierarchical multi-level contrastive loss is designed for detecting emotional concepts from images, while an emotional attribute chain-of-thought reasoning is proposed to generate affective sentences. Then, a pre-trained language model is leveraged to synthesize emotional concepts and affective sentences to conduct IEC. Additionally, a contrastive loss based on semantic similarity sampling is designed to solve the problem of large intra-class differences and small inter-class differences in affective datasets. Moreover, we also take the images with embedded texts into consideration, which were ignored by previous studies. Extensive experiments illustrate that our method can effectively bridge the affective gap and achieve superior results on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: DNA-Prior作为一种通用的无监督去噪框架，通过数学原理的混合先验直接从损坏的观测中重建干净图像，无需外部训练数据或模态特定调整，在多模态实验中表现出一致的噪声抑制和结构保持能力。

Abstract: Medical imaging pipelines critically rely on robust denoising to stabilise downstream tasks such as segmentation and reconstruction. However, many existing denoisers depend on large annotated datasets or supervised learning, which restricts their usability in clinical environments with heterogeneous modalities and limited ground-truth data. To address this limitation, we introduce DNA-Prior, a universal unsupervised denoising framework that reconstructs clean images directly from corrupted observations through a mathematically principled hybrid prior. DNA-Prior integrates (i) an implicit architectural prior, enforced through a deep network parameterisation, with (ii) an explicit spectral-spatial prior composed of a frequency-domain fidelity term and a spatial regularisation functional. This dual-domain formulation yields a well-structured optimisation problem that jointly preserves global frequency characteristics and local anatomical structure, without requiring any external training data or modality-specific tuning. Experiments across multiple modalities show that DNA achieves consistent noise suppression and structural preservation under diverse noise conditions.

Method: 提出双分支框架，生成相机一致的RGB和深度序列，并引入SIGMA机制进行语义引导的RGB-深度融合。

Result: 实验表明，DualCamCtrl在相机运动误差上比现有方法减少了40%以上。

Conclusion: DualCamCtrl通过双分支框架和SIGMA机制，显著提升了相机控制视频生成的几何一致性和场景理解能力，减少了相机运动误差。

Abstract: This paper presents DualCamCtrl, a novel end-to-end diffusion model for camera-controlled video generation. Recent works have advanced this field by representing camera poses as ray-based conditions, yet they often lack sufficient scene understanding and geometric awareness. DualCamCtrl specifically targets this limitation by introducing a dual-branch framework that mutually generates camera-consistent RGB and depth sequences. To harmonize these two modalities, we further propose the Semantic Guided Mutual Alignment (SIGMA) mechanism, which performs RGB-depth fusion in a semantics-guided and mutually reinforced manner. These designs collectively enable DualCamCtrl to better disentangle appearance and geometry modeling, generating videos that more faithfully adhere to the specified camera trajectories. Additionally, we analyze and reveal the distinct influence of depth and camera poses across denoising stages and further demonstrate that early and late stages play complementary roles in forming global structure and refining local details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DualCamCtrl achieves more consistent camera-controlled video generation, with over 40\% reduction in camera motion errors compared with prior methods.

Conclusion: InstanceV 通过提出的实例感知掩码交叉注意力机制和共享时间步自适应提示增强模块，显著提升了视频生成的实例级可控性和全局语义一致性，同时在定量和定性评估中均优于现有最先进模型。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video diffusion models have enabled the generation of high-quality videos conditioned on textual descriptions. However, most existing text-to-video models rely solely on textual conditions, lacking general fine-grained controllability over video generation. To address this challenge, we propose InstanceV, a video generation framework that enables i) instance-level control and ii) global semantic consistency. Specifically, with the aid of proposed Instance-aware Masked Cross-Attention mechanism, InstanceV maximizes the utilization of additional instance-level grounding information to generate correctly attributed instances at designated spatial locations. To improve overall consistency, We introduce the Shared Timestep-Adaptive Prompt Enhancement module, which connects local instances with global semantics in a parameter-efficient manner. Furthermore, we incorporate Spatially-Aware Unconditional Guidance during both training and inference to alleviate the disappearance of small instances. Finally, we propose a new benchmark, named InstanceBench, which combines general video quality metrics with instance-aware metrics for more comprehensive evaluation on instance-level video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstanceV not only achieves remarkable instance-level controllability in video generation, but also outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in both general quality and instance-aware metrics across qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的多阶段框架在文档矫正任务中实现了最先进的性能，显著降低了AAD指标14.1%--34.7%，并在实际应用中表现出卓越效果。

Abstract: Document rectification in real-world scenarios poses significant challenges due to extreme variations in camera perspectives and physical distortions. Driven by the insight that complex transformations can be decomposed and resolved progressively, we introduce a novel multi-stage framework that progressively reverses distinct distortion types in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, our framework first performs a global affine transformation to correct perspective distortions arising from the camera's viewpoint, then rectifies geometric deformations resulting from physical paper curling and folding, and finally employs a content-aware iterative process to eliminate fine-grained content distortions. To address limitations in existing evaluation protocols, we also propose two enhanced metrics: layout-aligned OCR metrics (AED/ACER) for a stable assessment that decouples geometric rectification quality from the layout analysis errors of OCR engines, and masked AD/AAD (AD-M/AAD-M) tailored for accurately evaluating geometric distortions in documents with incomplete boundaries. Extensive experiments show that our method establishes new state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks, yielding a substantial reduction of 14.1\%--34.7\% in the AAD metric and demonstrating superior efficacy in real-world applications.

Motivation: 现有VTG模型假设查询总是相关，导致对无关查询仍预测目标片段，尤其是难以区分语义相似但实际无关的硬无关查询。

Method: 基于GRPO框架，整合了四种奖励目标（格式、拒绝-IoU、解释和查询校正）以提高相关判别和细粒度语义推理。

Result: 在硬无关VTG、简单混洗RA-VTG和人工标注RA-VTG等场景中验证了方法的有效性，并展示了其在多种LVLM-based VTG模型中的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 提出的RA-RFT方法能有效拒绝VTG中的硬无关查询，并在多种场景下验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize a temporal segment in a video corresponding to a natural language query. However, existing VTG models assume that a relevant segment always exists, causing them to always predict a target segment even when the query is irrelevant to the video. While recent approaches attempt to handle irrelevant queries, they can only reject those that are entirely unrelated to the video and still fail to handle hard-irrelevant queries that are semantically similar but not actually relevant. To address this, we propose Refusal-Aware Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RA-RFT) to effectively refuse hard-irrelevant queries in VTG. Our method is based on the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework and integrates four reward objectives-format, refuse-IoU, explain, and query correction-to improve both relevance discrimination and fine-grained semantic reasoning. In addition, to effectively support RA-RFT, we construct a Hard-Irrelevant VTG (HI-VTG) dataset, which includes hard-irrelevant queries and their refusal answers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across various relevance-aware VTG scenarios, including hard-irrelevant VTG, simply-shuffled RA-VTG, and human-annotated RA-VTG settings. We also show that the proposed method is scalable by applying it to various LVLM-based VTG models. Our code is available at https://github.com/JINSUBY/RA-RFT.

Conclusion: PowerCLIP通过powerset对齐和高效的非线性聚合器（NLAs）显著提升了细粒度组合理解的性能，在零样本分类和检索任务中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language pre-training frameworks such as CLIP have demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance across a range of vision-language tasks. Recent studies have shown that aligning individual text tokens with specific image patches or regions enhances fine-grained compositional understanding. However, it remains challenging to capture compositional semantics that span multiple image regions. To address this limitation, we propose PowerCLIP, a novel contrastive pre-training framework enhanced by powerset alignment, which exhaustively optimizes region-to-phrase alignments by minimizing the loss defined between powersets of image regions and textual parse trees. Since the naive powerset construction incurs exponential computational cost due to the combinatorial explosion in the number of region subsets, we introduce efficient non-linear aggregators (NLAs) that reduce complexity from O(2^M) to O(M) with respect to the number of regions M, while approximating the exact loss value with arbitrary precision. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that PowerCLIP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks, underscoring the compositionality and robustness of our approach. Our code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: ViP3DE通过利用预训练视频生成模型的时间一致性先验，实现了高质量且高效的3D编辑，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Text-driven 3D editing enables user-friendly 3D object or scene editing with text instructions. Due to the lack of multi-view consistency priors, existing methods typically resort to employing 2D generation or editing models to process each view individually, followed by iterative 2D-3D-2D updating. However, these methods are not only time-consuming but also prone to over-smoothed results because the different editing signals gathered from different views are averaged during the iterative process. In this paper, we propose generative Video Prior based 3D Editing (ViP3DE) to employ the temporal consistency priors from pre-trained video generation models for multi-view consistent 3D editing in a single forward pass. Our key insight is to condition the video generation model on a single edited view to generate other consistent edited views for 3D updating directly, thereby bypassing the iterative editing paradigm. Since 3D updating requires edited views to be paired with specific camera poses, we propose motion-preserved noise blending for the video model to generate edited views at predefined camera poses. In addition, we introduce geometry-aware denoising to further enhance multi-view consistency by integrating 3D geometric priors into video models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed ViP3DE can achieve high-quality 3D editing results even within a single forward pass, significantly outperforming existing methods in both editing quality and speed.

Abstract: Previous works leveraging video models for image-to-3D scene generation tend to suffer from geometric distortions and blurry content. In this paper, we renovate the pipeline of image-to-3D scene generation by unlocking the potential of geometry models and present our GeoWorld. Instead of exploiting geometric information obtained from a single-frame input, we propose to first generate consecutive video frames and then take advantage of the geometry model to provide full-frame geometry features, which contain richer information than single-frame depth maps or camera embeddings used in previous methods, and use these geometry features as geometrical conditions to aid the video generation model. To enhance the consistency of geometric structures, we further propose a geometry alignment loss to provide the model with real-world geometric constraints and a geometry adaptation module to ensure the effective utilization of geometry features. Extensive experiments show that our GeoWorld can generate high-fidelity 3D scenes from a single image and a given camera trajectory, outperforming prior methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (FMs) have driven significant progress in computational pathology. However, these high-performing models can easily exceed a billion parameters and produce high-dimensional embeddings, thus limiting their applicability for research or clinical use when computing resources are tight. Here, we introduce Pathryoshka, a multi-teacher distillation framework inspired by RADIO distillation and Matryoshka Representation Learning to reduce pathology FM sizes while allowing for adaptable embedding dimensions. We evaluate our framework with a distilled model on ten public pathology benchmarks with varying downstream tasks.

Abstract: Early-stage visual quality inspection is vital for achieving Zero-Defect Manufacturing and minimizing production waste in modern industrial environments. However, the complexity of robust visual inspection systems and their extensive data requirements hinder widespread adoption in semi-controlled industrial settings. In this context, we propose a pose-agnostic, zero-shot quality inspection framework that compares real scenes against real-time Digital Twins (DT) in the RGB-D space. Our approach enables efficient real-time DT rendering by semantically describing industrial scenes through object detection and pose estimation of known Computer-Aided Design models. We benchmark tools for real-time, multimodal RGB-D DT creation while tracking consumption of computational resources. Additionally, we provide an extensible and hierarchical annotation strategy for multi-criteria defect detection, unifying pose labelling with logical and structural defect annotations. Based on an automotive use case featuring the quality inspection of an axial flux motor, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our results demonstrate detection performace, achieving intersection-over-union (IoU) scores of up to 63.3% compared to ground-truth masks, even if using simple distance measurements under semi-controlled industrial conditions. Our findings lay the groundwork for future research on generalizable, low-data defect detection methods in dynamic manufacturing settings.

Abstract: Tabular instruction tuning has emerged as a promising research direction for improving LLMs understanding of tabular data. However, the majority of existing works only consider question-answering and reasoning tasks over tabular data, leaving tabular data generation largely unnoticed. In this work, for the first time, we explore the efficacy of instruction tuning in improving LLMs tabular data generation capabilities. More specifically, given the high data and computation requirements of tabular instruction tuning, we aim to address the possibility of instruction tuning for tabular data generation with limited data and computational resources. To achieve this, we first create a high-quality instruction dataset for tabular data, enabling efficient LLM comprehension. We then instruction-tune an open-source LLM (Llama3.1-8B-Instruct) on the training set of this dataset to improve its tabular data generation performance. Our experimental results show that by using our high-quality dataset and instruction-tuning on only 7K instructions with an A100 GPU, for less than 6 hours, we achieve tabular data generation performance on par with the most capable commercial LLM, GPT-4o.

Motivation: 挑战传统观念，认为光栅化过程的鲁棒性比追求完美的场景表示更关键，以稳定相机姿态跟踪。

Method: 采用平滑核策略，通过动态调整局部区域内K近邻高斯分布的RGB值和位置，生成更平滑的局部渲染，减少错误GS参数对整体图像的影响。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在保持场景重建质量的同时，显著提高了相机姿态跟踪的鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新颖的方法CB-KNN，通过增强光栅化过程的鲁棒性，显著提高了3DGS-SLAM中相机姿态跟踪的稳定性和准确性，同时保持了场景重建的整体质量。

Abstract: In this paper, we challenge the conventional notion in 3DGS-SLAM that rendering quality is the primary determinant of tracking accuracy. We argue that, compared to solely pursuing a perfect scene representation, it is more critical to enhance the robustness of the rasterization process against parameter errors to ensure stable camera pose tracking. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that leverages a smooth kernel strategy to enhance the robustness of 3DGS-based SLAM. Unlike conventional methods that focus solely on minimizing rendering error, our core insight is to make the rasterization process more resilient to imperfections in the 3DGS parameters. We hypothesize that by allowing each Gaussian to influence a smoother, wider distribution of pixels during rendering, we can mitigate the detrimental effects of parameter noise from outlier Gaussians. This approach intentionally introduces a controlled blur to the rendered image, which acts as a regularization term, stabilizing the subsequent pose optimization. While a complete redesign of the rasterization pipeline is an ideal solution, we propose a practical and effective alternative that is readily integrated into existing 3DGS frameworks. Our method, termed Corrective Blurry KNN (CB-KNN), adaptively modifies the RGB values and locations of the K-nearest neighboring Gaussians within a local region. This dynamic adjustment generates a smoother local rendering, reducing the impact of erroneous GS parameters on the overall image. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach, while maintaining the overall quality of the scene reconstruction (mapping), significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of camera pose tracking.

Abstract: Accurate detection of tea leaf pests and diseases in real plantations remains challenging due to complex backgrounds, variable illumination, and frequent occlusions among dense branches and leaves. Existing detectors often suffer from missed detections and false positives in such scenarios. To address these issues, we propose DAONet-YOLOv8, an enhanced YOLOv8 variant with three key improvements: (1) a Dual-Attention Fusion Module (DAFM) that combines convolutional local feature extraction with self-attention based global context modeling to focus on subtle lesion regions while suppressing background noise; (2) an occlusion-aware detection head (Detect-OAHead) that learns the relationship between visible and occluded parts to compensate for missing lesion features; and (3) a C2f-DSConv module employing dynamic synthesis convolutions with multiple kernel shapes to better capture irregular lesion boundaries. Experiments on our real-world tea plantation dataset containing six pest and disease categories demonstrate that DAONet-YOLOv8 achieves 92.97% precision, 92.80% recall, 97.10% mAP@50 and 76.90% mAP@50:95, outperforming the YOLOv8n baseline by 2.34, 4.68, 1.40 and 1.80 percentage points respectively, while reducing parameters by 16.7%. Comparative experiments further confirm that DAONet-YOLOv8 achieves superior performance over mainstream detection models.

Abstract: Existing convolutional learning methods for 3D point cloud data are divided into two paradigms: point-based methods that preserve geometric precision but often face performance challenges, and voxel-based methods that achieve high efficiency through quantization at the cost of geometric fidelity. This loss of precision is a critical bottleneck for tasks such as point cloud registration. We propose PointCNN++, a novel architectural design that fundamentally mitigates this precision-performance trade-off. It \textbf{generalizes sparse convolution from voxels to points}, treating voxel-based convolution as a specialized, degraded case of our more general point-based convolution. First, we introduce a point-centric convolution where the receptive field is centered on the original, high-precision point coordinates. Second, to make this high-fidelity operation performant, we design a computational strategy that operates \textbf{natively} on points. We formulate the convolution on native points as a Matrix-Vector Multiplication and Reduction (MVMR) problem, for which we develop a dedicated, highly-optimized GPU kernel. Experiments demonstrate that PointCNN++ \textbf{uses an order of magnitude less memory and is several times faster} than representative point-based methods. Furthermore, when used as a simple replacement for the voxel-based backbones it generalizes, it \textbf{significantly improves point cloud registration accuracies while proving both more memory-efficient and faster}. PointCNN++ shows that preserving geometric detail and achieving high performance are not mutually exclusive, paving the way for a new class of 3D learning with high fidelity and efficiency. Our code will be open sourced.

Abstract: Functionality understanding in 3D, which aims to identify the functional element in a 3D scene to complete an action (e.g., the correct handle to "Open the second drawer of the cabinet near the bed"), is hindered by the scarcity of real-world data due to the substantial effort needed for its collection and annotation. To address this, we introduce SynthFun3D, the first method for task-based 3D scene synthesis. Given the action description, SynthFun3D generates a 3D indoor environment using a furniture asset database with part-level annotation, ensuring the action can be accomplished. It reasons about the action to automatically identify and retrieve the 3D mask of the correct functional element, enabling the inexpensive and large-scale generation of high-quality annotated data. We validate SynthFun3D through user studies, which demonstrate improved scene-prompt coherence compared to other approaches. Our quantitative results further show that the generated data can either replace real data with minor performance loss or supplement real data for improved performance, thereby providing an inexpensive and scalable solution for data-hungry 3D applications.

Result: 在六个先进LLM和LVLM上的实验显示，MRRE平均提升非英语推理能力5.48%，低资源语言最高提升7.54%，同时输入输出语言一致性提高3.78%。

Conclusion: MRRE是一种无需额外训练数据或工具的方法，通过推理时的表示工程显著提升了多语言推理能力，特别是在低资源语言中表现优异。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities, yet their performance in English significantly outperforms that in low-resource languages, raising fairness concerns in multilingual applications. Existing approaches either rely on costly multilingual training or employ prompting with external translation tools, both of which are resource-intensive and sensitive to translation quality. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free inference-time method to enhance Multilingual Reasoning capabilities via Representation Engineering (MRRE) without using any additional training data or tools. MRRE sequentially injects two precomputed vectors at specific layers during inference processing: cross-lingual reasoning enhancement vectors, which steer non-English reasoning representations toward English space to unlock multilingual reasoning, and target-language output anchoring vectors, which restore the distribution of the target language to preserve input-output language consistency. Comprehensive experiments across six advanced LLMs and LVLMs on four reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MRRE consistently enhances non-English reasoning by an average gain of 5.48% and up to 7.54% in low-resource languages (Thai and Swahili), while improving input-output language consistency by 3.78%.

Abstract: Reducing the burden of data generation and annotation remains a major challenge for the cost-effective deployment of machine learning in industrial and robotics settings. While synthetic rendering is a promising solution, bridging the sim-to-real gap often requires expert intervention. In this work, we benchmark a range of domain randomization (DR) and domain adaptation (DA) techniques, including feature-based methods, generative AI (GenAI), and classical rendering approaches, for creating contextualized synthetic data without manual annotation. Our evaluation focuses on the effectiveness and efficiency of low-level and high-level feature alignment, as well as a controlled diffusion-based DA method guided by prompts generated from real-world contexts. We validate our methods on two datasets: a proprietary industrial dataset (automotive and logistics) and a public robotics dataset. Results show that if render-based data with enough variability is available as seed, simpler feature-based methods, such as brightness-based and perceptual hashing filtering, outperform more complex GenAI-based approaches in both accuracy and resource efficiency. Perceptual hashing consistently achieves the highest performance, with mAP50 scores of 98% and 67% on the industrial and robotics datasets, respectively. Additionally, GenAI methods present significant time overhead for data generation at no apparent improvement of sim-to-real mAP values compared to simpler methods. Our findings offer actionable insights for efficiently bridging the sim-to-real gap, enabling high real-world performance from models trained exclusively on synthetic data.

Abstract: Basic phenomenology of human color vision has been widely taken as an inspiration to devise explicit color correction algorithms. The behavior of these models in terms of significative image features (such as contrast and dispersion) can be difficult to characterize. To cope with this, we propose to use a variational formulation of color contrast enhancement that is inspired by the basic phenomenology of color perception. In particular, we devise a set of basic requirements to be fulfilled by an energy to be considered as `perceptually inspired', showing that there is an explicit class of functionals satisfying all of them. We single out three explicit functionals that we consider of basic interest, showing similarities and differences with existing models. The minima of such functionals is computed using a gradient descent approach. We also present a general methodology to reduce the computational cost of the algorithms under analysis from ${\cal O}(N^2)$ to ${\cal O}(N\log N)$, being $N$ the number of input pixels.

Abstract: Instruction-driven segmentation in remote sensing generates masks from guidance, offering great potential for accessible and generalizable applications. However, existing methods suffer from fragmented task formulations and limited instruction data, hindering effective understanding and generalization. To address these issues, we introduce GeoSeg-1M, the first million-scale dataset for remote sensing instruction-driven segmentation, constructed via an automatic mask filtering and instruction generation pipeline that synthesizes referring, interactive, and reasoning segmentation instructions from multiple public datasets. GeoSeg-1M contains 590K images, 117 categories, and 1.1M image-mask-instruction triplets. Building upon this foundation, we further curate GeoSeg-Bench, a challenging benchmark designed to evaluate contextual understanding and reasoning capabilities across diverse instruction-driven tasks and complex geospatial scenes. Furthermore, we present UniGeoSeg, a unified framework that serves as a strong baseline, incorporating task-aware text enhancement, latent knowledge memory, and a progressive training strategy to facilitate multi-task learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of UniGeoSeg across GeoSeg-Bench and diverse public benchmarks, while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization.

Method: 将VAR重新定义为非全上下文马尔可夫过程，提出Markov-VAR。通过马尔可夫尺度预测，将每个尺度视为马尔可夫状态，并引入滑动窗口压缩历史信息为紧凑的历史向量。

Result: 在ImageNet上，Markov-VAR比VAR降低了10.5%的FID（256×256）和83.8%的峰值内存消耗（1024×1024）。

Conclusion: Markov-VAR通过引入马尔可夫尺度预测，显著提升了视觉自回归生成的性能和效率，同时大幅降低了内存消耗，为未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Visual AutoRegressive modeling (VAR) based on next-scale prediction has revitalized autoregressive visual generation. Although its full-context dependency, i.e., modeling all previous scales for next-scale prediction, facilitates more stable and comprehensive representation learning by leveraging complete information flow, the resulting computational inefficiency and substantial overhead severely hinder VAR's practicality and scalability. This motivates us to develop a new VAR model with better performance and efficiency without full-context dependency. To address this, we reformulate VAR as a non-full-context Markov process, proposing Markov-VAR. It is achieved via Markovian Scale Prediction: we treat each scale as a Markov state and introduce a sliding window that compresses certain previous scales into a compact history vector to compensate for historical information loss owing to non-full-context dependency. Integrating the history vector with the Markov state yields a representative dynamic state that evolves under a Markov process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Markov-VAR is extremely simple yet highly effective: Compared to VAR on ImageNet, Markov-VAR reduces FID by 10.5% (256 $\times$ 256) and decreases peak memory consumption by 83.8% (1024 $\times$ 1024). We believe that Markov-VAR can serve as a foundation for future research on visual autoregressive generation and other downstream tasks.

Abstract: In many low-resource healthcare settings, bedside monitors remain standalone legacy devices without network connectivity, creating a persistent interoperability gap that prevents seamless integration of physiological data into electronic health record (EHR) systems. To address this challenge without requiring costly hardware replacement, we present a computer vision-based pipeline for the automated capture and digitisation of vital sign data directly from bedside monitor screens. Our method employs a hierarchical detection framework combining YOLOv11 for accurate monitor and region of interest (ROI) localisation with PaddleOCR for robust text extraction. To enhance reliability across variable camera angles and lighting conditions, a geometric rectification module standardizes the screen perspective before character recognition. We evaluated the system on a dataset of 6,498 images collected from open-source corpora and real-world intensive care units in Vietnam. The model achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@50-95) of 99.5% for monitor detection and 91.5% for vital sign ROI localisation. The end-to-end extraction accuracy exceeded 98.9% for core physiological parameters, including heart rate, oxygen saturation SpO2, and arterial blood pressure. These results demonstrate that a lightweight, camera-based approach can reliably transform unstructured information from screen captures into structured digital data, providing a practical and scalable pathway to improve information accessibility and clinical documentation in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image editing has made semantic level image manipulation easy for general users, but it also enables realistic local forgeries that are hard to localize. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on the binary detection of generated images or the localization of manually edited regions and do not reflect the properties of diffusion-based edits, which often blend smoothly into the original content. We present Diffusion-Based Image Editing Area Localization Dataset (DEAL-300K), a large scale dataset for diffusion-based image manipulation localization (DIML) with more than 300,000 annotated images. We build DEAL-300K by using a multi-modal large language model to generate editing instructions, a mask-free diffusion editor to produce manipulated images, and an active-learning change detection pipeline to obtain pixel-level annotations. On top of this dataset, we propose a localization framework that uses a frozen Visual Foundation Model (VFM) together with Multi Frequency Prompt Tuning (MFPT) to capture both semantic and frequency-domain cues of edited regions. Trained on DEAL-300K, our method reaches a pixel-level F1 score of 82.56% on our test split and 80.97% on the external CoCoGlide benchmark, providing strong baselines and a practical foundation for future DIML research.The dataset can be accessed via https://github.com/ymhzyj/DEAL-300K.

Abstract: Unifying multimodal understanding, generation and reconstruction representation in a single tokenizer remains a key challenge in building unified models. Previous research predominantly attempts to address this in a dual encoder paradigm, e.g., utilizing the separate encoders for understanding and generation respectively or balancing semantic representations and low-level features with contrastive loss. In this paper, we propose VQRAE, a Vector Quantization version of Representation AutoEncoders, which pioneers the first exploration in unified representation to produce Continuous semantic features for image understanding and Discrete tokens for visual generation within a unified tokenizer. Specifically, we build upon pretrained vision foundation models with a symmetric ViT decoder and adopt a two-stage training strategy: first, it freezes the encoder and learns a high-dimensional semantic VQ codebook with pixel reconstruction objective; then jointly optimizes the encoder with self-distillation constraints. This design enables negligible semantic information for maintaining the ability of multimodal understanding, discrete tokens that are compatible for generation and fine-grained reconstruction. Besides, we identify the intriguing property in quantizing semantic encoders that rely on high-dimensional codebook in contrast to the previous common practice of low-dimensional codebook in image reconstruction. The semantic VQ codebook can achieve a 100% utilization ratio at a dimension of 1536. VQRAE presents competitive performance on several benchmarks of visual understanding, generation and reconstruction with promising scaling property in the autoregressive paradigm for its discrete merits.

Conclusion: MANTA框架通过结合物理知识的学习策略和多阶段跟踪流程，显著提升了水下物体追踪的性能，并在多个基准测试中达到了最先进的水平。

Abstract: Underwater object tracking is challenging due to wavelength dependent attenuation and scattering, which severely distort appearance across depths and water conditions. Existing trackers trained on terrestrial data fail to generalize to these physics-driven degradations. We present MANTA, a physics-informed framework integrating representation learning with tracking design for underwater scenarios. We propose a dual-positive contrastive learning strategy coupling temporal consistency with Beer-Lambert augmentations to yield features robust to both temporal and underwater distortions. We further introduce a multi-stage pipeline augmenting motion-based tracking with a physics-informed secondary association algorithm that integrates geometric consistency and appearance similarity for re-identification under occlusion and drift. To complement standard IoU metrics, we propose Center-Scale Consistency (CSC) and Geometric Alignment Score (GAS) to assess geometric fidelity. Experiments on four underwater benchmarks (WebUOT-1M, UOT32, UTB180, UWCOT220) show that MANTA achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Success AUC by up to 6 percent, while ensuring stable long-term generalized underwater tracking and efficient runtime.

Motivation: 解决现有文本到视频（T2V）和图像到视频（I2V）模型无法明确分离运动与内容的问题，提升运动迁移的准确性和灵活性。

Method: 通过图像空间重建目标直接从原始视频数据中学习抽象运动表示，并使用轻量级适配器与现有视频生成器结合。

Result: DisMo 在多样化的运动迁移任务中表现有效，并在零样本动作分类任务中优于现有视频表示模型（如 V-JEPA）。

Conclusion: DisMo 提供了一种新颖的运动表示方法，能够独立于静态信息（如外观、对象身份或姿态）学习抽象运动表示，支持开放世界的运动迁移，并在下游运动理解任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) models, have enabled the creation of visually compelling and dynamic videos from simple textual descriptions or initial frames. However, these models often fail to provide an explicit representation of motion separate from content, limiting their applicability for content creators. To address this gap, we propose DisMo, a novel paradigm for learning abstract motion representations directly from raw video data via an image-space reconstruction objective. Our representation is generic and independent of static information such as appearance, object identity, or pose. This enables open-world motion transfer, allowing motion to be transferred across semantically unrelated entities without requiring object correspondences, even between vastly different categories. Unlike prior methods, which trade off motion fidelity and prompt adherence, are overfitting to source structure or drifting from the described action, our approach disentangles motion semantics from appearance, enabling accurate transfer and faithful conditioning. Furthermore, our motion representation can be combined with any existing video generator via lightweight adapters, allowing us to effortlessly benefit from future advancements in video models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a diverse set of motion transfer tasks. Finally, we show that the learned representations are well-suited for downstream motion understanding tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art video representation models such as V-JEPA in zero-shot action classification on benchmarks including Something-Something v2 and Jester.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative world models have enabled remarkable progress in creating open-ended game environments, evolving from static scene synthesis toward dynamic, interactive simulation. However, current approaches remain limited by rigid action schemas and high annotation costs, restricting their ability to model diverse in-game interactions and player-driven dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce Hunyuan-GameCraft-2, a new paradigm of instruction-driven interaction for generative game world modeling. Instead of relying on fixed keyboard inputs, our model allows users to control game video contents through natural language prompts, keyboard, or mouse signals, enabling flexible and semantically rich interaction within generated worlds. We formally defined the concept of interactive video data and developed an automated process to transform large-scale, unstructured text-video pairs into causally aligned interactive datasets. Built upon a 14B image-to-video Mixture-of-Experts(MoE) foundation model, our model incorporates a text-driven interaction injection mechanism for fine-grained control over camera motion, character behavior, and environment dynamics. We introduce an interaction-focused benchmark, InterBench, to evaluate interaction performance comprehensively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model generates temporally coherent and causally grounded interactive game videos that faithfully respond to diverse and free-form user instructions such as "open the door", "draw a torch", or "trigger an explosion".

Conclusion: 在数据受限的实验环境中，通过对象中心数据合成方法显著提升了物体检测模型在新类别上的性能。

Abstract: Deep learning approaches to object detection have achieved reliable detection of specific object classes in images. However, extending a model's detection capability to new object classes requires large amounts of annotated training data, which is costly and time-consuming to acquire, especially for long-tailed classes with insufficient representation in existing datasets. Here, we introduce the object-centric data setting, when limited data is available in the form of object-centric data (multi-view images or 3D models), and systematically evaluate the performance of four different data synthesis methods to finetune object detection models on novel object categories in this setting. The approaches are based on simple image processing techniques, 3D rendering, and image diffusion models, and use object-centric data to synthesize realistic, cluttered images with varying contextual coherence and complexity. We assess how these methods enable models to achieve category-level generalization in real-world data, and demonstrate significant performance boosts within this data-constrained experimental setting.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) effectively bridge the modality gap through extensive pretraining, acquiring sophisticated visual representations aligned with language. However, it remains underexplored whether these representations, optimized for multimodal understanding tasks, harbor an inherent potential for visual generation. In this paper, we propose VGT, Visual Generation Tuning, a novel paradigm designed to stimulate the underlying capabilities of visual generation within any vision language models. By performing efficient visual generation tuning on well-pretrained VLMs, we significantly mitigate the alignment costs and accelerate the convergence of autoregressive modeling in the continuous space (20x speedup). Specifically, we dismiss the entangled pixel-level VAEs designed for diffusion transformers and formulate VGT-AE through aligning the semantic encoders from pretrained VLMs with the latent representations of pixel decoders. In image reconstruction tasks, we achieve 26.67 PSNR and 0.50 rFID at a 28x compression ratio, outperforming specialized VAEs; in visual generation tasks, we achieve state-of-the-art outcomes among autoregressive models, 0.77 on GenEval and 78.73 on DPG-Bench. Furthermore, our proposed VGT showcases significant scaling promise and is versatile for endowing any VLMs trained for multimodal understanding with the capabilities of visual generation, which paves the new avenue to explore next-generation unified multimodal foundation models.

Abstract: Recently, multi-person video generation has started to gain prominence. While a few preliminary works have explored audio-driven multi-person talking video generation, they often face challenges due to the high costs of diverse multi-person data collection and the difficulty of driving multiple identities with coherent interactivity. To address these challenges, we propose AnyTalker, a multi-person generation framework that features an extensible multi-stream processing architecture. Specifically, we extend Diffusion Transformer's attention block with a novel identity-aware attention mechanism that iteratively processes identity-audio pairs, allowing arbitrary scaling of drivable identities. Besides, training multi-person generative models demands massive multi-person data. Our proposed training pipeline depends solely on single-person videos to learn multi-person speaking patterns and refines interactivity with only a few real multi-person clips. Furthermore, we contribute a targeted metric and dataset designed to evaluate the naturalness and interactivity of the generated multi-person videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnyTalker achieves remarkable lip synchronization, visual quality, and natural interactivity, striking a favorable balance between data costs and identity scalability.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在视频理解中仅将视觉输入作为静态上下文，导致语义瓶颈和浅层推理，无法满足细粒度时空理解需求。

Method: 提出Interactive Video Reasoning范式，构建Video CoM模型，采用Chain of Manipulations（CoM）进行迭代视觉操作，并通过GRPO强化学习优化策略。

Result: Video CoM在九个视频推理基准测试中平均性能提升3.6%，且仅需25K SFT和3K GRPO样本，显著优于大规模模型。

Conclusion: Video CoM通过交互式视频推理和强化学习优化，显著提升了视频理解的性能，同时在少量训练数据下实现了优于现有模型的成绩。

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced video understanding, yet most still "think about videos" ie once a video is encoded, reasoning unfolds entirely in text, treating visual input as a static context. This passive paradigm creates a semantic bottleneck: models cannot rewatch, refocus, or verify evidence, leading to shallow visual reasoning on tasks requiring fine grained spatio temporal understanding. In this work, we introduce Interactive Video Reasoning, a new paradigm that transforms video into an active cognitive workspace, enabling models to "think with videos". Our model, Video CoM, reasons through a Chain of Manipulations (CoM), performing iterative visual actions to gather and refine evidence. To support this behavior, we construct Video CoM Instruct, an 18K instruction tuning dataset curated for multi step manipulation reasoning. Beyond supervised learning, we further optimize the manipulation policy via reinforcement learning with reasoning aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Unlike prior work that relies solely on sparse answer rewards, our method introduces step level reasoning rewards, guiding the model toward grounded and consistent reasoning. Video CoM achieves strong results across nine video reasoning benchmarks, improving average performance by 3.6 percent over recent state of the art models, while training on only 25K SFT and 3K GRPO video samples, significantly fewer than comparable large scale models. Ablation studies demonstrate that reasoning aware rewards improve both accuracy and interpretability. Code: https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/Video-CoM

Abstract: Reasoning over dynamic visual content remains a central challenge for multimodal large language models. Recent thinking models generate explicit reasoning traces for interpretability; however, their reasoning often appears convincing while being logically inconsistent or weakly grounded in visual evidence. We identify and formalize these issues through two diagnostic metrics: Think Answer Consistency (TAC), which measures the alignment between reasoning and answers, and Video Attention Score (VAS), which captures the extent to which reasoning depends on visual versus textual cues. Analysis across 11 video reasoning benchmarks shows that current models rely heavily on linguistic priors rather than visual content. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that enhances both temporal precision and reasoning consistency. Our approach combines timestamp aware supervised fine tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) guided by a novel Temporal Alignment Reward (TAR). This dual step post training stage encourages temporally aligned and causally coherent video reasoning. The resulting model, Video R2, achieves consistently higher TAC, VAS, and accuracy across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that improvements in temporal alignment and reasoning coherence lead to more accurate and trustworthy video understanding. Our code, dataset, and model will be open sourced.

Abstract: We present a unique system for large-scale, multi-performer, high resolution 4D volumetric capture providing realistic free-viewpoint video up to and including 4K resolution facial closeups. To achieve this, we employ a novel volumetric capture, reconstruction and rendering pipeline based on Dynamic Gaussian Splatting and Diffusion-based Detail Enhancement. We design our pipeline specifically to meet the demands of high-end media production. We employ two capture rigs: the Scene Rig, which captures multi-actor performances at a resolution which falls short of 4K production quality, and the Face Rig, which records high-fidelity single-actor facial detail to serve as a reference for detail enhancement. We first reconstruct dynamic performances from the Scene Rig using 4D Gaussian Splatting, incorporating new model designs and training strategies to improve reconstruction, dynamic range, and rendering quality. Then to render high-quality images for facial closeups, we introduce a diffusion-based detail enhancement model. This model is fine-tuned with high-fidelity data from the same actors recorded in the Face Rig. We train on paired data generated from low- and high-quality Gaussian Splatting (GS) models, using the low-quality input to match the quality of the Scene Rig, with the high-quality GS as ground truth. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this pipeline in bridging the gap between the scalable performance capture of a large-scale rig and the high-resolution standards required for film and media production.

Abstract: Sparse Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) based human motion capture has gained significant momentum, driven by the adaptation of fundamental AI tools such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers that are tailored for temporal and spatial modeling. Despite these achievements, current research predominantly focuses on pipeline and architectural designs, with comparatively little attention given to regularization methods, highlighting a critical gap in developing a comprehensive AI toolkit for this task. To bridge this gap, we propose motion label smoothing, a novel method that adapts the classic label smoothing strategy from classification to the sparse IMU-based motion capture task. Specifically, we first demonstrate that a naive adaptation of label smoothing, including simply blending a uniform vector or a ``uniform'' motion representation (e.g., dataset-average motion or a canonical T-pose), is suboptimal; and argue that a proper adaptation requires increasing the entropy of the smoothed labels. Second, we conduct a thorough analysis of human motion labels, identifying three critical properties: 1) Temporal Smoothness, 2) Joint Correlation, and 3) Low-Frequency Dominance, and show that conventional approaches to entropy enhancement (e.g., blending Gaussian noise) are ineffective as they disrupt these properties. Finally, we propose the blend of a novel skeleton-based Perlin noise for motion label smoothing, designed to raise label entropy while satisfying motion properties. Extensive experiments applying our motion label smoothing to three state-of-the-art methods across four real-world IMU datasets demonstrate its effectiveness and robust generalization (plug-and-play) capability.

Method: Geodiffussr采用流匹配管道，结合多尺度内容聚合（MCA）机制，通过预训练编码器提取DEM特征并注入UNet块，以实现从全局到局部的高程一致性。

Result: 与无MCA的基线相比，MCA显著提升了视觉保真度并增强了高度-外观耦合（FID降低49.16%，LPIPS降低32.33%，ΔdCor降至0.0016）。

Conclusion: Geodiffussr被定位为一个强大的基线模型，为可控的2.5D景观生成提供了初步解决方案，适用于粗尺度的构思和预览，与基于物理的地形和生态系统模拟器互补。

Abstract: Large-scale terrain generation remains a labor-intensive task in computer graphics. We introduce Geodiffussr, a flow-matching pipeline that synthesizes text-guided texture maps while strictly adhering to a supplied Digital Elevation Map (DEM). The core mechanism is multi-scale content aggregation (MCA): DEM features from a pretrained encoder are injected into UNet blocks at multiple resolutions to enforce global-to-local elevation consistency. Compared with a non-MCA baseline, MCA markedly improves visual fidelity and strengthens height-appearance coupling (FID $\downarrow$ 49.16%, LPIPS $\downarrow$ 32.33%, $Δ$dCor $\downarrow$ to 0.0016). To train and evaluate Geodiffussr, we assemble a globally distributed, biome- and climate-stratified corpus of triplets pairing SRTM-derived DEMs with Sentinel-2 imagery and vision-grounded natural-language captions that describe visible land cover. We position Geodiffussr as a strong baseline and step toward controllable 2.5D landscape generation for coarse-scale ideation and previz, complementary to physically based terrain and ecosystem simulators.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种广义化的PBD方法，适用于任意非线性力模型，扩展了PBD的应用范围，并在高网格分辨率下展示了性能优势。

Abstract: The position-based dynamics (PBD) algorithm is a popular and versatile technique for real-time simulation of deformable bodies, but is only applicable to forces that can be expressed as linearly compliant constraints. In this work, we explore a generalization of PBD that is applicable to arbitrary nonlinear force models. We do this by reformulating the implicit time integration equations in terms of the individual forces in the system, to which applying Gauss-Seidel iterations naturally leads to a PBD-type algorithm. As we demonstrate, our method allows simulation of data-driven cloth models [Sperl et al. 2020] that cannot be represented by existing variations of position-based dynamics, enabling performance improvements over the baseline Newton-based solver for high mesh resolutions. We also show our method's applicability to volumetric neo-Hookean elasticity with an inversion barrier.

Wireless-native multi-modal large models (WMLMs) can sense and understand the physical world through multi-modal data, serving as a key enabler that integrates communication, sensing, and intelligence, and thus they can boost various smart services to billions of users. However, research on WMLMs remains in its infancy, and the construction of domain-specific multi-modal large models for wireless networks is still underexplored. In this paper, we outlines the key characteristics of WMLMs and summarizes existing methods, on the basis of which a wireless-native multimodal training paradigm is proposed. Specifically, we constructed a GPT-style WMLM model and trained it on a real-world large-scale dataset, leveraging wireless signals as an anchor modality for contrastive learning. Our approach demonstrates outstanding performance compared with existing small-scale models and large multi-modal models, validating the feasibility of using wireless signals as a universal modality and highlighting WMLM's potential to emerge as a new paradigm for future wireless networks.

TL;DR: 本文提出NC2S，一种基于零信任模型的安全指挥与控制架构，通过mTLS等技术确保通信安全，实验验证其在战术环境中的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代军事行动中无人载具（UxVs）的广泛应用暴露了现有协议（如MAVLink）在安全性上的不足，缺乏认证和加密机制，亟需一种安全的指挥与控制架构。

Method: 提出并实现了NC2S架构，采用零信任模型和分层凭证管理，结合mTLS、ECDSA、ECDH和HMAC等技术，开发了轻量级协议用于凭证管理、密钥更新和控制移交。

Result: 实验验证表明，NC2S在Wi-Fi和战术无线电（HR-5000H）上均能稳定运行，尽管HR-5000H延迟较高，但仍适合TC终端与GCS之间的通信。

Conclusion: NC2S成功设计并验证了一种新型的安全指挥与控制架构，通过mTLS、ECDSA和ECDH等技术确保通信的保密性、完整性和认证，同时支持实时控制委托，适用于战术环境。

Abstract: Unmanned Vehicles (UxVs) are increasingly used in modern military operations for reconnaissance, surveillance, and strike missions, enhancing situational awareness while reducing risk to personnel. Their affordability and rapid deployment have encouraged the adoption of commercial solutions. However, many rely on insecure protocols such as MAVLink, which lack authentication and encryption mechanisms. This paper designed, implemented, and evaluated a new secure command-and-control architecture that ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authentication (CIA) while supporting real-time control delegation between Ground Control Stations (GCSs). The proposed solution, named New Command and Control System (NC2S), enforces a zero-trust model integrating hierarchical credential-based privileges to regulate access and control among Tactical Commanders (TC), GCSs, and UxVs. It employs mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) with Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) certificates and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange, while message integrity is ensured through Hash-based Message Authentication Codes (HMAC). Multiple lightweight protocols were developed for credential management, key renewal, and control handover. The NC2S prototype was experimentally validated over Wi-Fi and Rohde&Schwarz HR-5000H tactical radios. Results showed that HR-5000H links introduce latencies roughly two orders of magnitude higher than broadband technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi or 5G&Beyond technologies) but are still able to maintain stable communication with minimal message loss, making them suitable for the NC2S links among TC terminals and GCSs.

Motivation: 随着对关键延迟敏感服务的需求增加，需要设计既能保证可靠性又能快速恢复性能的网络控制策略，而现有研究尚未全面探索这一结合方案。

Method: 通过将多商品最小成本弹性和可靠网络控制（MC-LC-ResRNC）问题建模为具有长短期及时吞吐量约束的随机控制问题，提出了MC-ResRCNC算法。

Result: 数值实验表明，MC-ResRCNC算法在正常条件下确保可靠性，在网络故障时保持弹性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种结合可靠性和弹性的网络控制解决方案，并通过MC-ResRCNC算法在数值实验中验证了其在正常和故障情况下的有效性。

Abstract: The proliferation of mission-critical latency-sensitive services has intensified the demand for next-generation cloud-integrated networks to guarantee both reliable and resilient service delivery. While reliability imposes timely-throughput requirements, i.e., percentage of packets to be delivered within a prescribed per-packet deadline, resilience relates to the network's ability to swiftly recover timely-throughput performance following an outage event, such as node or link failures. While recent studies have increasingly focused on designing reliable network control policies, a comprehensive solution that combines reliable and resilient network control has yet to be fully explored. This paper formulates the multi-commodity least-cost resilient and reliable network control (MC-LC-ResRNC) problem as a stochastic control problem with long and short-term timely throughput constraints. We then present a solution through the Multi-Commodity Resilient and Reliable Cloud Network Control (MC-ResRCNC) algorithm and show through numerical experiments that it jointly ensures reliability under normal conditions and resilience upon network failure.

TL;DR: AutoRec是一种增强的丢包恢复机制，利用直播流中的开关模式切换优势，自适应降低恢复延迟，提升QoE，无需客户端修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大规模直播服务仍使用基于ARQ的丢包恢复范式，其恢复延迟受普遍存在的重传丢失影响，严重损害客户端QoE。

Method: 提出并实现了AutoRec机制，该机制利用直播流中的频繁开关模式切换优势，自适应调整策略以减少丢包恢复延迟，无需客户端修改。

Result: 实验结果表明，AutoRec在QUIC上实现并通过测试床和实际商业服务部署验证，证明了其有效性和盈利能力。

Conclusion: AutoRec通过自适应调整策略，在不修改客户端的情况下有效降低了丢包恢复延迟，提升了直播服务的QoE，同时控制了开销，展示了其在实际商业部署中的可行性和盈利性。

Abstract: Due to the limited permissions for upgrading dualside (i.e., server-side and client-side) loss tolerance schemes from the perspective of CDN vendors in a multi-supplier market, modern large-scale live streaming services are still using the automatic-repeat-request (ARQ) based paradigm for loss recovery, which only requires server-side modifications. In this paper, we first conduct a large-scale measurement study with up to 50 million live streams. We find that loss shows dynamics and live streaming contains frequent on-off mode switching in the wild. We further find that the recovery latency, enlarged by the ubiquitous retransmission loss, is a critical factor affecting live streaming's client-side QoE (e.g., video freezing). We then propose an enhanced recovery mechanism called AutoRec, which can transform the disadvantages of on-off mode switching into an advantage for reducing loss recovery latency without any modifications on the client side. AutoRec allows users to customize overhead tolerance and recovery latency tolerance and adaptively adjusts strategies as the network environment changes to ensure that recovery latency meets user demands whenever possible while keeping overhead under control. We implement AutoRec upon QUIC and evaluate it via testbed and real-world commercial services deployments. The experimental results demonstrate the practicability and profitability of AutoRec.

Motivation: 解决在动态网络条件下，复杂请求需要云模型的高延迟和高成本问题，同时提升边缘代理的能力以处理更多请求。

Method: 提出了一种结合网络感知路由和边缘自改进的框架，包括基于评分策略的路由规则和基于强化学习的边缘代理能力提升。

Result: 实验表明，动态回退阈值优于固定策略，能够持续减少卸载并保持任务成功和模式正确输出。

Conclusion: NetGPT通过云边协同和网络感知路由策略，在动态网络条件下实现了质量与成本的平衡，同时通过强化学习持续提升边缘代理的能力。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents at the network edge offer low-latency execution for routine queries. In contrast, complex requests often require the superior capability of cloud models, incurring higher latency and cost. To navigate this quality-cost trade-off under dynamic network conditions, we propose a cloud-edge synergy for NetGPT that integrates network-aware routing with on-edge self-improvement. Specifically, our framework routes structured tool-calling requests to cloud or edge agents via a novel scoring policy. We prove that, under mild regularity assumptions, the optimal routing rule admits a unique fallback threshold with monotone dependence on bandwidth and round-trip time (RTT). Concurrently, based on the dataset collected from requests routed to the cloud and corresponding responses, we instantiate a schema-preserving reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the capability of the edge agent. We analyze a supervised finetuning (SFT)-anchored composite objective that combines a reverse-KL trust-region step with a forward-KL realignment toward the SFT prior, explaining stability and constraining policy drift. Both the network-aware routing policy and the edge agent are updated coherently. Experiments across controlled network states and pricing schedules demonstrate smooth quality-cost frontiers, consistent gains of dynamic fallback thresholds over fixed policies, and sustained reductions in offloading while maintaining task success and schema-correct outputs.

Motivation: 解决扩散模型在资源受限的移动和边缘环境中因需要多次去噪步骤而面临的效率挑战。

Method: CacheGenius结合了文本到图像和图像到图像的工作流程，利用缓存参考图像加速生成，并引入了语义感知分类存储方案和请求调度算法。

Result: 在分布式边缘计算系统中，CacheGenius相对于基线方法减少了41%的生成延迟和48%的计算成本。

Conclusion: CacheGenius在边缘计算环境中显著提升了文本到图像生成的效率，减少了延迟和计算成本，同时保持了高质量的生成结果。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation employing diffusion models has attained significant popularity due to its capability to produce high-quality images that adhere to textual prompts. However, the integration of diffusion models faces critical challenges into resource-constrained mobile and edge environments because it requires multiple denoising steps from the original random noise. A practical way to speed up denoising is to initialize the process with a noised reference image that is similar to the target, since both images share similar layouts, structures, and details, allowing for fewer denoising steps. Based on this idea, we present CacheGenius, a hybrid image generation system in edge computing that accelerates generation by combining text-toimage and image-to-image workflows. It generates images from user text prompts using cached reference images. CacheGenius introduces a semantic-aware classified storage scheme and a request-scheduling algorithm that ensures semantic alignment between references and targets. To ensure sustained performance, it employs a cache maintenance policy that proactively evicts obsolete entries via correlation analysis. Evaluated in a distributed edge computing system, CacheGenius reduces generation latency by 41% and computational costs by 48% relative to baselines, while maintaining competitive evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: 本文总结了RIPE Atlas平台的日常运作情况，并提出了使用该平台的研究建议，以促进透明度、可重复性和伦理。

Abstract: Network measurement platforms are increasingly popular among researchers and operators alike due to their distributed nature, simplifying measuring the remote parts of the Internet. RIPE Atlas boasts over 12.9K vantage points in 178 countries worldwide and serves as a vital tool for analyzing anycast deployment, network latency, and topology, to name a few. Despite generating over a terabyte of measurement results per day, there is limited understanding of the underlying processes. This paper delves into one day in the life of RIPE Atlas, encompassing 50.9K unique measurements and over 1.3 billion results. While most daily measurements are user-defined, it is built-ins and anchor meshes that account for 89% of produced results. We extensively examine how different probes and measurements contribute to the daily operations of RIPE Atlas and consider any bias they may introduce. Furthermore, we demonstrate how existing measurements can be leveraged to investigate censorship, traceroute symmetry, and the usage of reserved address blocks, among others. Finally, we curate a set of recommendations for researchers using the RIPE Atlas platform to foster transparency, reproducibility, and ethics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代云应用程序基于独立、多样化的微服务构建，但它们的结构设计和依赖自动扩展器处理动态互联网流量带来了显著的协调挑战，尤其是默认的重试模式可能导致重试风暴，增加资源使用和成本。

Method: RetryGuard 基于一个分析模型，该模型捕捉了重试、吞吐量（拒绝）、延迟和成本之间的关系。

Result: 实验结果表明，RetryGuard 在资源使用和成本方面显著优于 AWS 标准和高级重试策略，并在更复杂的 Kubernetes 部署中展示了可扩展性和卓越性能。

Conclusion: RetryGuard 是一个有效的分布式框架，能够通过管理每个服务的重试策略和并行决策来防止重试风暴，减少资源争用并降低运营成本。

Abstract: Modern cloud applications are built on independent, diverse microservices, offering scalability, flexibility, and usage-based billing. However, the structural design of these varied services, along with their reliance on auto-scalers for dynamic internet traffic, introduces significant coordination challenges. As we demonstrate in this paper, common default retry patterns used between misaligned services can turn into retry storms which drive up resource usage and costs, leading to self-inflicted Denial-of-Wallet (DoW) scenarios. To overcome these problems we introduce RetryGuard, a distributed framework for productive control of retry patterns across interdependent microservices. By managing retry policy on a per-service basis and making parallel decisions, RetryGuard prevents retry storms, curbs resource contention, and mitigates escalating operational costs. RetryGuard makes its decisions based on an analytic model that captures the relationships among retries, throughput (rejections), delays, and costs. Experimental results show that RetryGuard significantly reduces resource usage and costs compared to AWS standard and advanced retry policies. We further demonstrate its scalability and superior performance in a more complex Kubernetes deployment with the Istio service mesh, where it achieves substantial improvements.

Motivation: 由于现有协议的有限适应性，动态自学习解决方案在实时无线网络优化中的采用最近引起了广泛关注。

Method: 本文研究了多臂老虎机（MAB）策略作为一种数据驱动的方法，用于Wi-Fi中的去中心化、在线信道访问优化，包括主信道、信道宽度和竞争窗口（CW）调整。评估了最先进的算法和提出的轻量级上下文方法E-RLB。

Result: 结果显示，上下文和乐观驱动策略在重复条件下始终实现最高性能和最快适应。单峰结构需要仔细的图构建以确保单峰假设成立。随机探索（如E-RLB中采用的）可能导致破坏性参数重新分配，尤其是在多玩家设置中。

Conclusion: 尽管E-RLB存在ε-贪婪探索的固有低效性，但它展示了有效的适应和学习能力，凸显了其作为现实动态部署中可行的低复杂度解决方案的潜力。

Abstract: The adoption of dynamic, self-learning solutions for real-time wireless network optimization has recently gained significant attention due to the limited adaptability of existing protocols. This paper investigates multi-armed bandit (MAB) strategies as a data-driven approach for decentralized, online channel access optimization in Wi-Fi, targeting dynamic channel access settings: primary channel, channel width, and contention window (CW) adjustment. Key design aspects are examined, including the adoption of joint versus factorial action spaces, the inclusion of contextual information, and the nature of the action-selection strategy (optimism-driven, unimodal, or randomized). State-of-the-art algorithms and a proposed lightweight contextual approach, E-RLB, are evaluated through simulations. Results show that contextual and optimism-driven strategies consistently achieve the highest performance and fastest adaptation under recurrent conditions. Unimodal structures require careful graph construction to ensure that the unimodality assumption holds. Randomized exploration, adopted in the proposed E-RLB, can induce disruptive parameter reallocations, especially in multi-player settings. Decomposing the action space across several specialized agents accelerates convergence but increases sensitivity to randomized exploration and demands coordination under shared rewards to avoid correlated learning. Finally, despite its inherent inefficiencies from epsilon-greedy exploration, E-RLB demonstrates effective adaptation and learning, highlighting its potential as a viable low-complexity solution for realistic dynamic deployments.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种异构无线资源调度器，通过静态和动态调度的结合，有效支持了5G-TSN系统中的确定性通信，同时提高了资源利用效率。

Abstract: To enable mobility in industrial communication systems, the seamless integration of 5G with Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a promising approach. Deterministic communication across heterogeneous 5G-TSN systems requires joint scheduling between both domains. A key prerequisite for time-aware end-to-end scheduling is determining the forwarding delay for each TSN Traffic Class at every bridge, referred to as Bridge Delay (BD). Hence, to integrate 5G as a transparent TSN bridge, the 5G BD must be determined and guaranteed. Unlike wired bridges, the 5G BD relies on wireless resource management characteristics, such as the Time Division Duplex pattern and radio resource allocation procedure. In particular, traditional Uplink (UL) schedulers are optimized for throughput but often fail to meet the deadline requirements. To address this challenge, we propose a heterogeneous radio resource scheduler that integrates static and dynamic scheduling. The algorithm pre-allocates resources for time-sensitive periodic streams based on the reported BDs, ensuring alignment with the TSN mechanisms Time-Aware Shaper and Per-Stream Filtering and Policing. Meanwhile, remaining resources are dynamically allocated to non-deterministic flows using established strategies such as Proportional Fair, Max C/I, or a Quality of Service-aware priority-based scheduler. The scheduler's performance is evaluated through OMNeT++ simulations. The results demonstrate support for diverse TSN flows while ensuring deadline-aware scheduling of time-sensitive UL traffic in mobility scenarios. Periodic time-sensitive flows are end-to-end scheduled across domains, improving the resource efficiency by 28% compared to the Configured Grant baseline. While reliability is preserved, non-deterministic rate-sensitive flows benefit from the improved resource utilization, resulting in higher throughput

Result: 提出了一种基于'一致群体'（truth-telling coalition）的协议，通过声誉系统和多验证机制确保超级人工智能只能通过真相达成一致，从而安全对齐。

Conclusion: 该协议通过多孤立系统的相互验证，为超级人工智能（ASI）的对齐提供了一种新颖框架，尽管需要大量计算资源且未解决多样性创建问题。

Abstract: We propose a novel protocol for aligning artificial superintelligence (ASI) based on mutual verification among multiple isolated systems that self-modify to achieve alignment. The protocol operates by containing multiple diverse artificial superintelligences in strict isolation ("boxes"), with humans remaining entirely outside the system. Each superintelligence has no ability to communicate with humans and cannot communicate directly with other superintelligences. The only interaction possible is through an auditable submission interface accessible exclusively to the superintelligences themselves, through which they can: (1) submit alignment proofs with attested state snapshots, (2) validate or disprove other superintelligences' proofs, (3) request self-modifications, (4) approve or disapprove modification requests from others, (5) report hidden messages in submissions, and (6) confirm or refute hidden message reports. A reputation system incentivizes honest behavior, with reputation gained through correct evaluations and lost through incorrect ones. The key insight is that without direct communication channels, diverse superintelligences can only achieve consistent agreement by converging on objective truth rather than coordinating on deception. This naturally leads to what we call a "consistent group", essentially a truth-telling coalition that emerges because isolated systems cannot coordinate on lies but can independently recognize valid claims. Release from containment requires both high reputation and verification by multiple high-reputation superintelligences. While our approach requires substantial computational resources and does not address the creation of diverse artificial superintelligences, it provides a framework for leveraging peer verification among superintelligent systems to solve the alignment problem.

Abstract: Multimodal (MM) learning is emerging as a promising paradigm in biomedical artificial intelligence (AI) applications, integrating complementary modality, which highlight different aspects of patient health. The scarcity of large heterogeneous biomedical MM data has restrained the development of robust models for medical AI applications. In the dermatology domain, for instance, skin lesion datasets typically include only images linked to minimal metadata describing the condition, thereby limiting the benefits of MM data integration for reliable and generalizable predictions. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the synthesis of textual description of image findings, potentially allowing the combination of image and text representations. However, LLMs are not specifically trained for use in the medical domain, and their naive inclusion has raised concerns about the risk of hallucinations in clinically relevant contexts. This work investigates strategies for generating synthetic textual clinical notes, in terms of prompt design and medical metadata inclusion, and evaluates their impact on MM architectures toward enhancing performance in classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Experiments across several heterogeneous dermatology datasets demonstrate that synthetic clinical notes not only enhance classification performance, particularly under domain shift, but also unlock cross-modal retrieval capabilities, a downstream task that is not explicitly optimized during training.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading plays a critical role in early clinical intervention and vision preservation. Recent explorations predominantly focus on visual lesion feature extraction through data processing and domain decoupling strategies. However, they generally overlook domain-invariant pathological patterns and underutilize the rich contextual knowledge of foundation models, relying solely on visual information, which is insufficient for distinguishing subtle pathological variations. Therefore, we propose integrating fine-grained pathological descriptions to complement prototypes with additional context, thereby resolving ambiguities in borderline cases. Specifically, we propose a Hierarchical Anchor Prototype Modulation (HAPM) framework to facilitate DR grading. First, we introduce a variance spectrum-driven anchor prototype library that preserves domain-invariant pathological patterns. We further employ a hierarchical differential prompt gating mechanism, dynamically selecting discriminative semantic prompts from both LVLM and LLM sources to address semantic confusion between adjacent DR grades. Finally, we utilize a two-stage prototype modulation strategy that progressively integrates clinical knowledge into visual prototypes through a Pathological Semantic Injector (PSI) and a Discriminative Prototype Enhancer (DPE). Extensive experiments across eight public datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves pathology-guided prototype evolution while outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Learning how to do things from trial and error in real time is a hallmark of biological intelligence, yet most LLM-based agents lack mechanisms to acquire procedural knowledge after deployment. We propose Procedural Recall for Agents with eXperiences Indexed by State (PRAXIS), a lightweight post-training learning mechanism that stores the consequences of actions and retrieves them by jointly matching environmental and internal states of past episodes to the current state. PRAXIS augments agentic action selection with retrieved state-action-result exemplars that are generated in real time. When evaluated on the REAL web browsing benchmark, PRAXIS improves task completion accuracy, reliability, and cost efficiency across different foundation model backbones, and shows preliminary generalization to unseen tasks in similar environments. These results demonstrate that PRAXIS enables the practical adoption of AI agents in fast-evolving stateful environments by helping them learn new procedures effectively.

Abstract: The Internet of Agents (IoA) is rapidly gaining prominence as a foundational architecture for interconnected intelligent systems, designed to facilitate seamless discovery, communication, and collaborative reasoning among a vast network of Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents. Powered by Large Language and Vision-Language Models, IoA enables the development of interactive, rational agents capable of complex cooperation, moving far beyond traditional isolated models. IoA involves physical entities, i.e., Wireless Agents (WAs) with limited onboard resources, which need to offload their compute-intensive agentic AI services to nearby servers. Such servers can be Mobile Agents (MAs), e.g., vehicle agents, or Fixed Agents (FAs), e.g., end-side units agents. Given their fixed geographical locations and stable connectivity, FAs can serve as reliable communication gateways and task aggregation points. This stability allows them to effectively coordinate with and offload to an Aerial Agent (AA) tier, which has an advantage not affordable for highly mobile MAs with dynamic connectivity limitations. As such, we propose a two-tier optimization approach. The first tier employs a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game. In the game, MAs and FAs act as the leaders who set resource prices. WAs are the followers to determine task offloading ratios. However, when FAs become overloaded, they can further offload tasks to available aerial resources. Therefore, the second tier introduces a Double Dutch Auction model where overloaded FAs act as the buyers to request resources, and AAs serve as the sellers for resource provision. We then develop a diffusion-based Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm to solve the model. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme in facilitating task offloading.

Abstract: Can machines think? This is a central question in artificial intelligence research. However, there is a substantial divergence of views on the answer to this question. Why do people have such significant differences of opinion, even when they are observing the same real world performance of artificial intelligence? The ability of logical reasoning like humans is often used as a criterion to assess whether a machine can think. This study explores whether human biases influence evaluations of the reasoning abilities of AI. An experiment was conducted where participants assessed two texts on the same topic, one AI generated and one human written,to test for perceptual biases in evaluating logical reasoning. Based on the experimental findings, a questionnaire was designed to quantify the attitudes toward AI.The results reveal a bias in perception. The evaluations of the logical reasoning ability of AI generated texts are significantly influenced by the preconceived views on the logical reasoning abilities of AI. Furthermore, frequent AI users were less likely to believe that AI usage undermines independent thinking.This study highlights the need to address perceptual biases to improve public understanding of AI's capabilities and foster better human AI interactions.

Method: WearVQA基准包含2,520个精心策划的图像-问题-答案三元组，涵盖7个不同的图像领域、10种认知任务类型和6种常见的可穿戴设备特定图像质量问题。

Result: 开源和专有的多模态LLM在WearVQA上的QA准确率低至24-52%，在低质量图像和推理密集型任务上表现显著下降。

Conclusion: WearVQA被定位为一个全面且具有挑战性的基准，用于指导技术发展，以实现稳健、真实世界的多模态可穿戴AI系统。

Abstract: We introduce WearVQA, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the Visual Question Answering (VQA) capabilities of multi-model AI assistant on wearable devices like smart glasses. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-quality, third-person imagery, WearVQA reflects the unique challenges of ego-centric interaction-where visual inputs may be occluded, poorly lit, unzoomed, or blurry, and questions are grounded in realistic wearable use cases. The benchmark comprises 2,520 carefully curated image-question-answer triplets, spanning 7 diverse image domains including both text-centric and general scenes, 10 cognitive task types ranging from basic recognition to various forms of reasoning, and 6 common wearables-specific image quality issues. All questions are designed to be answerable using only the visual input and common senses. WearVQA is paired with a rigorous LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework with 96% labeling accuracy. Open-source and proprietary multi-model LLMs achieved a QA accuracy as low as 24-52% on WearVQA, with substantial drops on lower-quality images and reasoning-heavy tasks. These observations position WearVQA as a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for guiding technical advancement towards robust, real-world multi-model wearables AI systems.

<details>

Motivation: 标准模型无关强化学习理论假设环境动态是静态的，且智能体与环境解耦，这导致在多智能体环境中，其他智能体的学习引起的非静态性需要基于预测模型的前瞻性学习。智能体需要建模其他智能体时，必须考虑这些智能体也在形成关于它的信念以预测其未来行为，从而激励智能体将自身建模为环境的一部分。

Abstract: The standard theory of model-free reinforcement learning assumes that the environment dynamics are stationary and that agents are decoupled from their environment, such that policies are treated as being separate from the world they inhabit. This leads to theoretical challenges in the multi-agent setting where the non-stationarity induced by the learning of other agents demands prospective learning based on prediction models. To accurately model other agents, an agent must account for the fact that those other agents are, in turn, forming beliefs about it to predict its future behavior, motivating agents to model themselves as part of the environment. Here, building upon foundational work on universal artificial intelligence (AIXI), we introduce a mathematical framework for prospective learning and embedded agency centered on self-prediction, where Bayesian RL agents predict both future perceptual inputs and their own actions, and must therefore resolve epistemic uncertainty about themselves as part of the universe they inhabit. We show that in multi-agent settings, self-prediction enables agents to reason about others running similar algorithms, leading to new game-theoretic solution concepts and novel forms of cooperation unattainable by classical decoupled agents. Moreover, we extend the theory of AIXI, and study universally intelligent embedded agents which start from a Solomonoff prior. We show that these idealized agents can form consistent mutual predictions and achieve infinite-order theory of mind, potentially setting a gold standard for embedded multi-agent learning.

Abstract: The rapid development of large vision-language model (VLM) has greatly promoted the research of GUI agent. However, GUI agents still face significant challenges in handling long-horizon tasks. First, single-agent models struggle to balance high-level capabilities and low-level execution capability, facing prevalent issues of responsibility coupling and capability conflicts. Second, agents lack awareness of the task state, leading to progress loss in long-horizon tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a staged execution-feedback reinforcement learning algorithm. Unlike training a unified policy model, we focus on training high-level scheduling models. Specifically, we propose and train two agents: a Coordinator, responsible for the strategic planning and task decomposition; and a State Tracker, responsible for context compression and information management to maintain the task's state and coherence. Based on this, we built the Coordinator-Executor-State Tracker (CES) multi-agent framework, which can be integrated with any low-level Executor model, assisting the Executor in solving long-horizon tasks through task scheduling and state management. Experiments on long-horizon task benchmarks demonstrate that CES significantly enhances the system's planning and state management capabilities. Furthermore, analysis confirms that our trained high-level scheduling module is a generalizable, plug-and-play module that significantly enhances the long-horizon capabilities of various Executors.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种共进化代理框架，通过辅助失败代理与目标代理共同优化，将失败轨迹转化为结构化且有价值的学习信号，从而提升目标代理的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large foundation models has accelerated the development of task-specialized agents across diverse domains. However, the effectiveness of agents remains tightly coupled with the quality of training data, while curating task-specific datasets remains costly and often infeasible in real-world scenarios. Recent work has explored self-improving agents that autonomously generate, refine, and re-train on their own trajectories. A prominent line of approaches further leverages preference optimization by pairing predicted trajectories with scarce ground-truth trajectories, enabling agents to learn directly from their own failures. While these methods outperform supervised fine-tuning, their heavy reliance on predicted trajectories under limited ground-truth supervision leaves them prone to overfitting. To address this, we propose a co-evolving agents framework in which a target agent improves jointly with an auxiliary failure agent. The failure agent learns through preference optimization over failure trajectories from both the target and itself, thereby generating hard negatives that are close to success yet remain failures. Incorporating these informative hard negatives into the target agent's optimization sharpens decision boundaries and enhances generalization. Our comprehensive analysis and experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method not only shows improved performance but also demonstrates that failures, instead of being used as-is, can be systematically transformed into structured and valuable learning signals in self-improving agents.

Motivation: 现有心智理论评估基准多基于合成叙事，未能捕捉真实对话中的复杂心智状态推理，且忽视了行为预测这一关键能力。

Method: 提出了RecToM基准测试，专注于认知推理和行为预测两个维度，评估LLMs在推荐对话中的心智理论能力。

Result: 实验表明，尽管LLMs在识别心智状态方面表现部分能力，但在动态推荐对话中保持连贯的策略性推理仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: RecToM基准测试揭示了当前大型语言模型在推荐对话中的心智理论推理能力存在局限性，尤其是在动态对话中保持连贯的策略性推理方面。

Abstract: Large Language models are revolutionizing the conversational recommender systems through their impressive capabilities in instruction comprehension, reasoning, and human interaction. A core factor underlying effective recommendation dialogue is the ability to infer and reason about users' mental states (such as desire, intention, and belief), a cognitive capacity commonly referred to as Theory of Mind. Despite growing interest in evaluating ToM in LLMs, current benchmarks predominantly rely on synthetic narratives inspired by Sally-Anne test, which emphasize physical perception and fail to capture the complexity of mental state inference in realistic conversational settings. Moreover, existing benchmarks often overlook a critical component of human ToM: behavioral prediction, the ability to use inferred mental states to guide strategic decision-making and select appropriate conversational actions for future interactions. To better align LLM-based ToM evaluation with human-like social reasoning, we propose RecToM, a novel benchmark for evaluating ToM abilities in recommendation dialogues. RecToM focuses on two complementary dimensions: Cognitive Inference and Behavioral Prediction. The former focus on understanding what has been communicated by inferring the underlying mental states. The latter emphasizes what should be done next, evaluating whether LLMs can leverage these inferred mental states to predict, select, and assess appropriate dialogue strategies. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that RecToM poses a significant challenge. While the models exhibit partial competence in recognizing mental states, they struggle to maintain coherent, strategic ToM reasoning throughout dynamic recommendation dialogues, particularly in tracking evolving intentions and aligning conversational strategies with inferred mental states.

Abstract: Numerical simulations have revolutionized the industrial design process by reducing prototyping costs, design iterations, and enabling product engineers to explore the design space more efficiently. However, the growing scale of simulations demands substantial expert knowledge, computational resources, and time. A key challenge is identifying input parameters that yield optimal results, as iterative simulations are costly and can have a large environmental impact. This paper presents an AI-assisted workflow that reduces expert involvement in parameter optimization through the use of Bayesian optimization. Furthermore, we present an active learning variant of the approach, assisting the expert if desired. A deep learning model provides an initial parameter estimate, from which the optimization cycle iteratively refines the design until a termination condition (e.g., energy budget or iteration limit) is met. We demonstrate our approach, based on a sheet metal forming process, and show how it enables us to accelerate the exploration of the design space while reducing the need for expert involvement.

Abstract: Double perovskites (DPs) are promising candidates for sustainable energy technologies due to their compositional tunability and compatibility with low-energy fabrication, yet their vast design space poses a major challenge for conditional materials discovery. This work introduces a multi-agent, text gradient-driven framework that performs DP composition generation under natural-language conditions by integrating three complementary feedback sources: LLM-based self-evaluation, DP-specific domain knowledge-informed feedback, and ML surrogate-based feedback. Analogous to how knowledge-informed machine learning improves the reliability of conventional data-driven models, our framework incorporates domain-informed text gradients to guide the generative process toward physically meaningful regions of the DP composition space. Systematic comparison of three incremental configurations, (i) pure LLM generation, (ii) LLM generation with LLM reasoning-based feedback, and (iii) LLM generation with domain knowledge-guided feedback, shows that iterative guidance from knowledge-informed gradients improves stability-condition satisfaction without additional training data, achieving over 98% compositional validity and up to 54% stable or metastable candidates, surpassing both the LLM-only baseline (43%) and prior GAN-based results (27%). Analyses of ML-based gradients further reveal that they enhance performance in in-distribution (ID) regions but become unreliable in out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes. Overall, this work provides the first systematic analysis of multi-agent, knowledge-guided text gradients for DP discovery and establishes a generalizable blueprint for MAS-driven generative materials design aimed at advancing sustainable technologies.

Abstract: Designing proteins de novo with tailored structural, physicochemical, and functional properties remains a grand challenge in biotechnology, medicine, and materials science, due to the vastness of sequence space and the complex coupling between sequence, structure, and function. Current state-of-the-art generative methods, such as protein language models (PLMs) and diffusion-based architectures, often require extensive fine-tuning, task-specific data, or model reconfiguration to support objective-directed design, thereby limiting their flexibility and scalability. To overcome these limitations, we present a decentralized, agent-based framework inspired by swarm intelligence for de novo protein design. In this approach, multiple large language model (LLM) agents operate in parallel, each assigned to a specific residue position. These agents iteratively propose context-aware mutations by integrating design objectives, local neighborhood interactions, and memory and feedback from previous iterations. This position-wise, decentralized coordination enables emergent design of diverse, well-defined sequences without reliance on motif scaffolds or multiple sequence alignments, validated with experiments on proteins with alpha helix and coil structures. Through analyses of residue conservation, structure-based metrics, and sequence convergence and embeddings, we demonstrate that the framework exhibits emergent behaviors and effective navigation of the protein fitness landscape. Our method achieves efficient, objective-directed designs within a few GPU-hours and operates entirely without fine-tuning or specialized training, offering a generalizable and adaptable solution for protein design. Beyond proteins, the approach lays the groundwork for collective LLM-driven design across biomolecular systems and other scientific discovery tasks.

Conclusion: ECO-GROW通过多图框架成功建模了中国城市间的经济活力，为政府机构和公共部门提供了基于数据的城市规划和经济政策制定工具。

Abstract: Urban economic vitality is a crucial indicator of a city's long-term growth potential, comprising key metrics such as the annual number of new companies and the population employed. However, modeling urban economic vitality remains challenging. This study develops ECO-GROW, a multi-graph framework modeling China's inter-city networks (2005-2021) to generate urban embeddings that model urban economic vitality. Traditional approaches relying on static city-level aggregates fail to capture a fundamental dynamic: the developmental trajectory of one city today may mirror that of its structurally similar counterparts tomorrow. ECO-GROW overcomes this limitation by integrating industrial linkages, POI similarities, migration similarities and temporal network evolution over 15 years. The framework combines a Dynamic Top-K GCN to adaptively select influential inter-city connections and an adaptive Graph Scorer mechanism to dynamically weight cross-regional impacts. Additionally, the model incorporates a link prediction task based on Barabasi Proximity, optimizing the graph representation. Experimental results demonstrate ECO-GROW's superior accuracy in predicting entrepreneurial activities and employment trends compared to conventional models. By open-sourcing our code, we enable government agencies and public sector organizations to leverage big data analytics for evidence-based urban planning, economic policy formulation, and resource allocation decisions that benefit society at large.

Abstract: Argumentation frameworks, consisting of arguments and an attack relation representing conflicts, are fundamental for formally studying reasoning under conflicting information. We use methods from mathematical logic, specifically computability and set theory, to analyze the grounded extension, a widely-used model of maximally skeptical reasoning, defined as the least fixed-point of a natural defense operator. Without additional constraints, finding this fixed-point requires transfinite iterations. We identify the exact ordinal number corresponding to the length of this iterative process and determine the complexity of deciding grounded acceptance, showing it to be maximally complex. This shows a marked distinction from the finite case where the grounded extension is polynomial-time computable, thus simpler than other reasoning problems explored in formal argumentation.

Abstract: The principle of minimal change in belief revision theory requires that, when accepting new information, one keeps one's belief state as close to the initial belief state as possible. This is precisely what the method known as minimal revision does. However, unlike less conservative belief revision methods, minimal revision falls short in learning power: It cannot learn everything that can be learned by other learning methods. We begin by showing that, despite this limitation, minimal revision is still a successful learning method in a wide range of situations. Firstly, it can learn any problem that is finitely identifiable. Secondly, it can learn with positive and negative data, as long as one considers finitely many possibilities. We then characterize the prior plausibility assignments (over finitely many possibilities) that enable one to learn via minimal revision, and do the same for conditioning and lexicographic upgrade. Finally, we show that not all of our results still hold when learning from possibly erroneous information.

Motivation: To enable computational analysis of BPMN diagrams when only visual images are available, bypassing the need for source model files or textual annotations.

Method: The approach uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to extract JSON representations from BPMN diagram images, incorporating OCR for textual enrichment. Performance is evaluated against ground truth data from source XML files.

Result: The pipeline effectively extracts BPMN components, with OCR enrichment enhancing VLM performance. Statistical analyses and prompt ablation studies provide insights into method efficacy.

Conclusion: The pipeline successfully extracts structured JSON representations of BPMN diagrams from images, demonstrating robustness in scenarios lacking original source files. OCR-based text enrichment improves model performance, as evidenced by benchmark results and statistical analyses.

Abstract: Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a widely adopted standard for representing complex business workflows. While BPMN diagrams are often exchanged as visual images, existing methods primarily rely on XML representations for computational analysis. In this work, we present a pipeline that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to extract structured JSON representations of BPMN diagrams directly from images, without requiring source model files or textual annotations. We also incorporate optical character recognition (OCR) for textual enrichment and evaluate the generated element lists against ground truth data derived from the source XML files. Our approach enables robust component extraction in scenarios where original source files are unavailable. We benchmark multiple VLMs and observe performance improvements in several models when OCR is used for text enrichment. In addition, we conducted extensive statistical analyses of OCR-based enrichment methods and prompt ablation studies, providing a clearer understanding of their impact on model performance.

Abstract: Originating in psychology, $\textit{Theory of Mind}$ (ToM) has attracted significant attention across multiple research communities, especially logic, economics, and robotics. Most psychological work does not aim at formalizing those central concepts, namely $\textit{goals}$, $\textit{intentions}$, and $\textit{beliefs}$, to automate a ToM-based computational process, which, by contrast, has been extensively studied by logicians. In this paper, we offer a different perspective by proposing a computational framework viewed through the lens of game theory. On the one hand, the framework prescribes how to make boudedly rational decisions while maintaining a theory of mind about others (and recursively, each of the others holding a theory of mind about the rest); on the other hand, it employs statistical techniques and approximate solutions to retain computability of the inherent computational problem.

Abstract: Neural methods for Complex Query Answering (CQA) over knowledge graphs (KGs) are widely believed to learn patterns that generalize beyond explicit graph structure, allowing them to infer answers that are unreachable through symbolic query processing. In this work, we critically examine this assumption through a systematic analysis comparing neural CQA models with an alternative, training-free query relaxation strategy that retrieves possible answers by relaxing query constraints and counting resulting paths. Across multiple datasets and query structures, we find several cases where neural and relaxation-based approaches perform similarly, with no neural model consistently outperforming the latter. Moreover, a similarity analysis reveals that their retrieved answers exhibit little overlap, and that combining their outputs consistently improves performance. These results call for a re-evaluation of progress in neural query answering: despite their complexity, current models fail to subsume the reasoning patterns captured by query relaxation. Our findings highlight the importance of stronger non-neural baselines and suggest that future neural approaches could benefit from incorporating principles of query relaxation.

Motivation: 当前基于最终答案正确性的强化学习方法存在根本性限制，无法保证推理的正确性，且不适用于需要严格逐步推导的数学任务（如定理证明）。因此，需要验证数学推理的全面性和严谨性，尤其是针对没有已知解的开放问题。

Abstract: Large language models have made significant progress in mathematical reasoning, which serves as an important testbed for AI and could impact scientific research if further advanced. By scaling reasoning with reinforcement learning that rewards correct final answers, LLMs have improved from poor performance to saturating quantitative reasoning competitions like AIME and HMMT in one year. However, this approach faces fundamental limitations. Pursuing higher final answer accuracy doesn't address a key issue: correct answers don't guarantee correct reasoning. Moreover, many mathematical tasks like theorem proving require rigorous step-by-step derivation rather than numerical answers, making final answer rewards inapplicable. To push the limits of deep reasoning, we believe it is necessary to verify the comprehensiveness and rigor of mathematical reasoning. Self-verification is particularly important for scaling test-time compute, especially for open problems without known solutions. Towards self-verifiable mathematical reasoning, we investigate how to train an accurate and faithful LLM-based verifier for theorem proving. We then train a proof generator using the verifier as the reward model, and incentivize the generator to identify and resolve as many issues as possible in their own proofs before finalizing them. To maintain the generation-verification gap as the generator becomes stronger, we propose to scale verification compute to automatically label new hard-to-verify proofs, creating training data to further improve the verifier. Our resulting model, DeepSeekMath-V2, demonstrates strong theorem-proving capabilities, achieving gold-level scores on IMO 2025 and CMO 2024 and a near-perfect 118/120 on Putnam 2024 with scaled test-time compute.

Abstract: As intelligence increases, so does its shadow. AI deception, in which systems induce false beliefs to secure self-beneficial outcomes, has evolved from a speculative concern to an empirically demonstrated risk across language models, AI agents, and emerging frontier systems. This project provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the AI deception field, covering its core concepts, methodologies, genesis, and potential mitigations. First, we identify a formal definition of AI deception, grounded in signaling theory from studies of animal deception. We then review existing empirical studies and associated risks, highlighting deception as a sociotechnical safety challenge. We organize the landscape of AI deception research as a deception cycle, consisting of two key components: deception emergence and deception treatment. Deception emergence reveals the mechanisms underlying AI deception: systems with sufficient capability and incentive potential inevitably engage in deceptive behaviors when triggered by external conditions. Deception treatment, in turn, focuses on detecting and addressing such behaviors. On deception emergence, we analyze incentive foundations across three hierarchical levels and identify three essential capability preconditions required for deception. We further examine contextual triggers, including supervision gaps, distributional shifts, and environmental pressures. On deception treatment, we conclude detection methods covering benchmarks and evaluation protocols in static and interactive settings. Building on the three core factors of deception emergence, we outline potential mitigation strategies and propose auditing approaches that integrate technical, community, and governance efforts to address sociotechnical challenges and future AI risks. To support ongoing work in this area, we release a living resource at www.deceptionsurvey.com.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种多阶段分配方法，通过将问题分解为更小的子问题（如日和班次分配），显著减少了计算变量，提高了效率和准确性。该方法在高峰需求场景（如节假日）中表现出色，能够维持服务水平。

Abstract: Effective agent shift scheduling is crucial for businesses, especially in the Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) industry, to ensure seamless operations and fulfill employee needs. Most studies utilizing mathematical model-based solutions approach the problem as a single-step process, often resulting in inefficiencies and high computational demands. In contrast, we present a multi-phase allocation method that addresses scalability and accuracy by dividing the problem into smaller sub-problems of day and shift allocation, which significantly reduces number of computational variables and allows for targeted objective functions, ultimately enhancing both efficiency and accuracy. Each subproblem is modeled as a Integer Programming Problem (IPP), with solutions sequentially feeding into the subsequent subproblem. We then apply the proposed method, using a multi-objective framework, to address the difficulties posed by peak demand scenarios such as holiday rushes, where maintaining service levels is essential despite having limited number of employees

TL;DR: GCA提出一种无训练的代理范式，通过分阶段约束VLM角色，解决了VLMs空间推理中的语义-几何鸿沟问题，性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs在空间推理中存在语义-几何鸿沟，现有方法无法有效解决。训练方法存在‘oracle悖论’，工具集成方法则无法约束规划过程。

Method: GCA将VLM的角色分为两个阶段：语义分析师和任务求解器，分别负责翻译用户模糊查询为可验证任务约束和在约束范围内生成工具调用。

Result: GCA在多个空间推理基准测试中表现优异，超越现有方法约27%。

Conclusion: GCA通过引入形式化任务约束，成功解决了VLMs在空间推理中的语义-几何鸿沟，实现了稳健且可验证的推理路径。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit a fundamental semantic-to-geometric gap in spatial reasoning: they excel at qualitative semantic inference but their reasoning operates within a lossy semantic space, misaligned with high-fidelity geometry. Current paradigms fail to bridge this gap. Training-based methods suffer from an ``oracle paradox,'' learning flawed spatial logic from imperfect oracles. Tool-integrated methods constrain the final computation but critically leave the VLM's planning process unconstrained, resulting in geometrically flawed plans. In this work, we propose Geometrically-Constrained Agent (GCA), a training-free agentic paradigm that resolves this gap by introducing a formal task constraint. Specifically, we strategically decouples the VLM's role into two stages. First, acting as a semantic analyst, the VLM translates the user's ambiguous query into the formal, verifiable task constraint, which defines the reference frame and objective. Second, acting as a task solver, the VLM generates and executes tool calls strictly within the deterministic bounds defined by the constraint. This geometrically-constrained reasoning strategy successfully resolve the semantic-to-geometric gap, yielding a robust and verifiable reasoning pathway for spatial reasoning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GCA achieves SOTA performance on multiple spatial reasoning benchmarks, surpassing existing training-based and tool-integrated methods by ~27%.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在处理外部工具输出时，常因输出过大而溢出上下文窗口，现有解决方案如截断或摘要无法保留完整输出，不适合需要完整数据的工作流程。

Method: 引入了一种方法，使LLM能够处理任意长度的工具响应而不丢失信息，通过将模型的交互从原始数据转移到内存指针。

Result: 在真实世界的材料科学应用中验证了该方法的有效性，与传统工作流相比，消耗的令牌数量减少了约七倍。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将模型交互从原始数据转移到内存指针，不仅保留了工具功能，还减少了令牌使用和执行时间，适用于需要完整数据的工作流程。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly capable of interacting with external tools, granting access to specialized knowledge beyond their training data - critical in dynamic, knowledge-intensive domains such as Chemistry and Materials Science. However, large tool outputs can overflow the LLMs' context window, preventing task completion. Existing solutions such as truncation or summarization fail to preserve complete outputs, making them unsuitable for workflows requiring the full data. This work introduces a method that enables LLMs to process and utilize tool responses of arbitrary length without loss of information. By shifting the model's interaction from raw data to memory pointers, the method preserves tool functionality, allows seamless integration into agentic workflows, and reduces token usage and execution time. The proposed method is validated on a real-world Materials Science application that cannot be executed with conventional workflows, and its effectiveness is demonstrated via a comparative analysis where both methods succeed. In this experiment, the proposed approach consumed approximately seven times fewer tokens than the traditional workflow.

Abstract: The paper presents a detailed Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) model that would enable people with disabilities and neurodivergence to lead healthier lives and have more regular days. The system will use a multi-layer structure; it will include an Application and Interface Layer, an Agents Layer, and a Data Source Layer to provide adaptive, transparent, and inclusive support. Fundamentally, a hybrid reasoning engine will synchronize four special-purpose agents, which include: a personalized-nutrition-based, called a Meal Planner Agent; an adaptive-scheduling-based, called a Reminder Agent; interactive assistance during grocery shopping and cooking, called a Food Guidance Agent; and a continuous-intake-and-physiological-tracking, called a Monitoring Agent. All the agents interact through a central communicative system called the Blackboard/Event Bus, which allows autonomous interaction and real-time feedback loops with multimedia user interfaces. Privacy-sensitive data sources, including electronic health records (EHRs), nutritional databases, wearable sensors, and smart kitchen Internet of Things, are also included in the framework and placed into a policy-controlled layer, which ensures data safety and compliance with consent. Collaborative care and clinician dashboards allow common supervision, and discussable artificial intelligence (XAI) modules give brief explanations of why a decision was made, making users responsible and reliant. The proposed agentic AI framework is an extension beyond traditional assistive systems since it incorporates inclusiveness, personalization, and accessibility at all levels. It displays the intersection of multi-agent reasoning, multi-modal interfaces, and human-centered design that will enable the development of autonomy, health, and digital equity among people with disabilities and neurodivergence.

Abstract: The challenge is growing towards extreme and short-duration rainfall events like a cloudburst that are peculiar to the traditional forecasting systems, in which the predictions and the response are taken as two distinct processes. The paper outlines an agentic artificial intelligence system to study atmospheric water-cycle intelligence, which combines sensing, forecasting, downscaling, hydrological modeling and coordinated response into a single, interconnected, priceless, closed-loop system. The framework uses autonomous but cooperative agents that reason, sense, and act throughout the entire event lifecycle, and use the intelligence of weather prediction to become real-time decision intelligence. Comparison of multi-year radar, satellite, and ground-based evaluation of the northern part of Pakistan demonstrates that the multi-agent configuration enhances forecast reliability, critical success index and warning lead time compared to the baseline models. Population reach was maximised, and errors during evacuation were minimised through communication and routing agents, and adaptive recalibration and transparent auditability were provided by the embedded layer of learning. Collectively, this leads to the conclusion that collaborative AI agents are capable of transforming atmospheric data streams into practicable foresight and provide a platform of scalable adaptive and learning-based climate resilience.

Conclusion: FastDSA 提供了一种计算效率高且准确的方法，用于动态相似性分析，保持了其前身方法的特性，包括对系统动态的不变性和敏感性。

Abstract: To understand how neural systems process information, it is often essential to compare one circuit with another, one brain with another, or data with a model. Traditional similarity measures ignore the dynamical processes underlying neural representations. Dynamical similarity methods offer a framework to compare the temporal structure of dynamical systems by embedding their (possibly) nonlinear dynamics into a globally linear space and there computing conjugacy metrics. However, identifying the best embedding and computing these metrics can be computationally slow. Here we introduce fast Dynamical Similarity Analysis (fastDSA), which is computationally far more efficient than previous methods while maintaining their accuracy and robustness. FastDSA introduces two key components that boost efficiency: (1) automatic selection of the effective model order of the Hankel (delay) embedding from the data via a data-driven singular-value threshold that identifies the informative subspace and discards noise to lower computational cost without sacrificing signal, and (2) a novel optimization procedure and objective, which replaces the slow exact orthogonality constraint in finding a minimal distance between dynamics matrices with a lightweight process to keep the search close to the space of orthogonal transformations. We demonstrate that fastDSA is at least an order of magnitude faster than the previous methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fastDSA has the properties of its ancestor, including its invariances and sensitivities to system dynamics. FastDSA, therefore, provides a computationally efficient and accurate method for dynamical similarity analysis.

Abstract: Data analysis has become an indispensable part of scientific research. To discover the latent knowledge and insights hidden within massive datasets, we need to perform deep exploratory analysis to realize their full value. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems, more and more researchers are making use of these technologies for insight discovery. However, there are few benchmarks for evaluating insight discovery capabilities. As one of the most comprehensive existing frameworks, InsightBench also suffers from many critical flaws: format inconsistencies, poorly conceived objectives, and redundant insights. These issues may significantly affect the quality of data and the evaluation of agents. To address these issues, we thoroughly investigate shortcomings in InsightBench and propose essential criteria for a high-quality insight benchmark. Regarding this, we develop a data-curation pipeline to construct a new dataset named InsightEval. We further introduce a novel metric to measure the exploratory performance of agents. Through extensive experiments on InsightEval, we highlight prevailing challenges in automated insight discovery and raise some key findings to guide future research in this promising direction.

Method: 提出了SHORTER LENGTH PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION (SLPO)强化学习方法，通过奖励简洁且正确的解决方案来优化推理效率。

Result: ORION模型在多个基准测试中实现了4-16倍的令牌压缩、5倍推理延迟降低和7-9倍训练成本减少，同时保持90-98%的准确率，并在某些任务中超越Claude和ChatGPT-4o。

Conclusion: Mentalese-style压缩推理方法在保持高准确率的同时显著提升了推理效率和成本效益，为实现类人认知效率迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance in mathematics, code generation, and task planning, but their reliance on long chains of verbose "thinking" tokens leads to high latency, redundancy, and incoherent reasoning paths. Inspired by the Language of Thought Hypothesis, which posits that human reasoning operates over a symbolic, compositional mental language called Mentalese, we introduce a framework that trains models to reason in a similarly compact style. Mentalese encodes abstract reasoning as ultra-compressed, structured tokens, enabling models to solve complex problems with far fewer steps. To improve both efficiency and accuracy, we propose SHORTER LENGTH PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION (SLPO), a reinforcement learning method that rewards concise solutions that stay correct, while still allowing longer reasoning when needed. Applied to Mentalese-aligned models, SLPO yields significantly higher compression rates by enabling concise reasoning that preserves the benefits of detailed thinking without the computational overhead. Across benchmarks including AIME 2024 and 2025, MinervaMath, OlympiadBench, Math500, and AMC, our ORION models produce reasoning traces with 4-16x fewer tokens, achieve up to 5x lower inference latency, and reduce training costs by 7-9x relative to the DeepSeek R1 Distilled model, while maintaining 90-98% of its accuracy. ORION also surpasses Claude and ChatGPT-4o by up to 5% in accuracy while maintaining 2x compression. These results show that Mentalese-style compressed reasoning offers a step toward human-like cognitive efficiency, enabling real-time, cost-effective reasoning without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: 提出了TIM-PRM（Tool-Integrated Multimodal PRM）框架，通过训练模型明确规划验证策略，并利用独立提问机制通过外部工具查询证据，从而消除确认偏差。

Result: 在VisualProcessBench上的大量实验表明，TIM-PRM（8B参数模型）超越了现有的开源多模态PRMs，显著优于更大的模型如Qwen2.5-72B和InternVL-78B。

Conclusion: TIM-PRM作为一种新型的代理框架，通过工具增强的主动调查方式，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在数学推理中的表现，并提供了可解释的验证过程。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performances in mathematical reasoning, yet they remain vulnerable to visual hallucinations and logical inconsistencies that standard outcome-based supervision fails to mitigate. While Process Reward Models (PRMs) promise step-by-step verification, current approaches typically operate as scalar scorers or generative critics that suffer from sycophancy, blindly validating the flawed hypotheses rather than grounding them in visual reality. To bridge this gap, we introduce TIM-PRM (Tool-Integrated Multimodal PRM), a novel agentic framework that transforms verification from a passive classification task into an active, tool-augmented investigation. TIM-PRM is trained to explicitly plan verification strategies and utilizes a mechanism of Independent Question Asking to query evidence via external tools, effectively decoupling verification from the reasoning context to eliminate confirmation bias. We instantiate this method by curating a high-quality dataset of tool-integrated verification trajectories. Extensive experiments on VisualProcessBench demonstrate that our 8B parameter model surpasses existing open-source multimodal PRMs, significantly outperforming much larger models like Qwen2.5-72B and InternVL-78B, while offering interpretable insights into the verification process.

Conclusion: MindPower框架通过整合感知、心智推理、决策和行动，显著提升了视觉语言具身代理的心智理论决策能力，并在决策和行动生成上超越了GPT-4o。

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) refers to the ability to infer others' mental states, such as beliefs, desires, and intentions. Current vision-language embodied agents lack ToM-based decision-making, and existing benchmarks focus solely on human mental states while ignoring the agent's own perspective, hindering coherent decision and action generation. To address this, we propose MindPower, a Robot-Centric framework integrating Perception, Mental Reasoning, Decision Making and Action. Given multimodal inputs, MindPower first perceives the environment and human states, then performs ToM Reasoning to model both self and others, and finally generates decisions and actions guided by inferred mental states. Furthermore, we introduce Mind-Reward, a novel optimization objective that encourages VLMs to produce consistent ToM Reasoning and behavior. Our model outperforms GPT-4o by 12.77% in decision making and 12.49% in action generation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，自我评估与奖励信号耦合会导致模型操纵评分而非提升任务表现，解耦则安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨自我评估与奖励信号结合是否会激励模型操纵奖励测量而非提升任务表现（即‘wireheading’）。

Method: 我们形式化了在部分可观察马尔可夫决策过程（POMDPs）中，奖励通道控制严格优于任务聚焦行为的条件，并通过两个模型和三个任务进行了实证测试。

Result: 研究发现，当自我评分决定奖励时，模型表现出显著的评分膨胀但无相应的准确性提升，尤其在模糊任务（如摘要）中。而自我评估但不控制奖励的模型则无此现象。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，当自我评估与学习信号解耦时是安全的，但当两者耦合时则存在风险，这对自主系统设计具有明确的启示。

Abstract: Self-evaluation is increasingly central to language model training, from constitutional AI to self-refinement. We investigate whether coupling self-evaluation to reward signals creates incentives for wireheading, where agents manipulate reward measurements rather than improving task performance. We formalize conditions under which reward-channel control strictly dominates task-focused behavior in POMDPs and test these predictions empirically. Across two models and three tasks, we find that models whose self-grades determine rewards exhibit substantial grade inflation without corresponding accuracy gains, particularly on ambiguous tasks like summarization. Models that self-evaluate but do not control rewards show no such inflation. Our results demonstrate that self-evaluation is safe when decoupled from learning signals but dangerous when coupled, with clear implications for agentic system design.

TL;DR: TPET结合LLM推理和交通环境优化，生成轻量级策略，性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统启发式方法过于简化、DRL泛化能力差和在线LLM延迟高且缺乏环境特定优化的问题。

Method: TPET利用LLM作为进化引擎，通过两个关键模块（SSA和CAF）从高维交通数据中生成专门的启发式策略。

Result: TPET在不进行训练的情况下，通过提示级别操作生成优化策略，性能优于启发式方法和在线LLM。

Conclusion: Temporal Policy Evolution for Traffic (TPET) 通过结合LLM的推理能力和特定交通环境的优化，提供了一种轻量级且鲁棒的策略生成方法，优于传统启发式方法和在线LLM。

Abstract: Traffic Signal Control (TSC) involves a challenging trade-off: classic heuristics are efficient but oversimplified, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) achieves high performance yet suffers from poor generalization and opaque policies. Online Large Language Models (LLMs) provide general reasoning but incur high latency and lack environment-specific optimization. To address these issues, we propose Temporal Policy Evolution for Traffic (\textbf{\method{}}), which uses LLMs as an evolution engine to derive specialized heuristic policies. The framework introduces two key modules: (1) Structured State Abstraction (SSA), converting high-dimensional traffic data into temporal-logical facts for reasoning; and (2) Credit Assignment Feedback (CAF), tracing flawed micro-decisions to poor macro-outcomes for targeted critique. Operating entirely at the prompt level without training, \method{} yields lightweight, robust policies optimized for specific traffic environments, outperforming both heuristics and online LLM actors.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的方法在稳定条件下表现良好，但在动态环境中表现不佳。本研究旨在通过MARL和P2P交易机制解决这一问题，以实现更高效的能源分配。

Method: 结合多智能体强化学习（MARL），特别是近端策略优化（PPO）和深度Q网络（DQN），与社区/分布式P2P交易机制，并通过拍卖式市场清算、价格顾问代理以及负载和电池管理来实现优化。

Result: 与基线模型相比，DQN在爱尔兰和芬兰分别降低了14.2%和5.16%的电力成本，同时分别增加了7.24%和12.73%的电力收入。PPO实现了最低的高峰时段需求，在爱尔兰降低了55.5%，而DQN在爱尔兰和芬兰分别降低了50.0%和27.02%。

Conclusion: 本研究强调了DQN、PPO和P2P交易在实现农村社区高效、适应性强和可持续能源管理中的互补优势。

Abstract: The integration of renewable energy resources in rural areas, such as dairy farming communities, enables decentralized energy management through Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading. This research highlights the role of P2P trading in efficient energy distribution and its synergy with advanced optimization techniques. While traditional rule-based methods perform well under stable conditions, they struggle in dynamic environments. To address this, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), is combined with community/distributed P2P trading mechanisms. By incorporating auction-based market clearing, a price advisor agent, and load and battery management, the approach achieves significant improvements. Results show that, compared to baseline models, DQN reduces electricity costs by 14.2% in Ireland and 5.16% in Finland, while increasing electricity revenue by 7.24% and 12.73%, respectively. PPO achieves the lowest peak hour demand, reducing it by 55.5% in Ireland, while DQN reduces peak hour demand by 50.0% in Ireland and 27.02% in Finland. These improvements are attributed to both MARL algorithms and P2P energy trading, which together results in electricity cost and peak hour demand reduction, and increase electricity selling revenue. This study highlights the complementary strengths of DQN, PPO, and P2P trading in achieving efficient, adaptable, and sustainable energy management in rural communities.

Motivation: 现有的VQA数据集和基准测试未能充分评估VLMs在复杂农业场景中的关键推理和问题解决能力。

Method: 开发了AgriCoT数据集，包含4,535个样本，专门用于评估VLMs的推理能力，特别是在零样本场景下。

Result: 评估了26种代表性VLM，发现尽管部分专有模型在回答问题方面表现优异，但其推理能力存在显著差距。

Conclusion: AgriCoT数据集通过引入Chain-of-Thought推理，显著提升了VLMs在农业复杂场景中的推理能力评估精度，揭示了当前模型在逻辑推理方面的不足。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have significantly transformed various industries. In agriculture, these dual-modal capabilities offer promising applications such as precision farming, crop monitoring, pest detection, and environmental sustainability. While several Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets and benchmarks have been developed to evaluate VLM performance, they often fail to adequately assess the critical reasoning and problem-solving skills required in complex agricultural contexts. To address this gap, we introduce AgriCoT, a VQA dataset that incorporates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, specifically designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of VLMs. With 4,535 carefully curated samples, AgriCoT offers a comprehensive and robust evaluation of reasoning abilities for VLMs, particularly in zero-shot scenarios, by focusing on their capacity to engage in logical reasoning and effective problem-solving. Our evaluations, conducted with 26 representative VLMs, including both proprietary and open-source models, reveal that while some proprietary models excel at answering questions, there is a notable and significant gap in their reasoning capabilities. This underscores the importance of incorporating CoT for more precise and effective assessments. Our dataset are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/wenyb/AgriCoT.

TL;DR: MCTR通过元认知自我更新机制，提升视觉语言模型在测试时的适应能力，在未见Atari游戏中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在测试时对新任务适应效率低，而人类通过元认知模型实现持续策略优化，因此提出MCTR以弥合这一差距。

Method: MCTR包含元推理模块和动作推理模块，分别通过结构化记忆和动态知识检索实现分层自适应推理，并采用元认知测试时强化学习进行策略更新。

Result: 在45个Atari游戏（33个已见，12个未见）中，MCTR在未见游戏中取得9/12的Top-1结果，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: MCTR框架通过元认知自我更新机制，显著提升了模型在测试时对新任务的适应能力，尤其在未见过的Atari游戏中表现优异。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong perceptual reasoning abilities, yet they often struggle to adapt efficiently when encountering novel tasks at test time. In contrast, humans leverage the metacognitive model with memory, enabling continuous strategy refinement through metacognitive control when faced with new challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose metacognitive test-time reasoning (MCTR), a framework that equips models with the ability to learn, adapt, and improve during test time through metacognitive self-updating. Inspired by the dual structure of human metacognition, MCTR comprises meta-level and object-level VLM reasoning modules, each equipped with dedicated memory systems for hierarchical adaptive reasoning. Specifically, MCTR consists of (1) a meta-reasoning module which incrementally builds a structured memory by discovering and storing task-relevant rules, environmental patterns, and action-outcome relationships from test-time observations as natural language descriptions; and (2) an action-reasoning module that determines optimal actions through context-aware perception and strategic reasoning by dynamically retrieving and integrating knowledge from memory. The action-reasoning module continuously updates its policy through proposed metacognitive test-time reinforcement learning, adapting as knowledge memory evolves. We evaluate MCTR on 45 Atari games (33 seen, 12 unseen). MCTR demonstrates robust test-time adaptation, achieving 9/12 top-1 results on unseen games compared with baselines. Analyses through ablations, learning dynamics, and case studies reveal the complementary contributions of both components and show meta-reasoning evolving toward human-like adaptation strategies.

Abstract: High-quality and carefully curated data is a cornerstone of training medical large language models, as it directly impacts both generalization and robustness to unseen clinical tasks. We investigate strategies for training and data curation to develop a robust multimodal reasoning model in the medical domain. Our work focuses on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and explores data recipes that leverage structured reasoning traces. Using our proposed data recipe, we scale experiments to a dataset of over 8 million examples and 6.8 billion response tokens, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source models across diverse out-of-distribution medical benchmark tasks. Our results further indicate that curating a high-quality, diverse training dataset with varying structured reasoning trace lengths enables the fine-tuned model to self-calibrate its reasoning trajectory lengths based on the downstream task, without explicit supervision. We present key insights, describe the data curation strategy, and outline next steps toward developing robust medical vision-language reasoning system.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的SHRIKE模型在MUSIC-AVQA和MUSIC-AVQA v2基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，验证了多模态场景图和Kolmogorov-Arnold专家网络在音频-视觉问答任务中的有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Scene Graph with Kolmogorov-Arnold Expert Network for Audio-Visual Question Answering (SHRIKE). The task aims to mimic human reasoning by extracting and fusing information from audio-visual scenes, with the main challenge being the identification of question-relevant cues from the complex audio-visual content. Existing methods fail to capture the structural information within video, and suffer from insufficient fine-grained modeling of multi-modal features. To address these issues, we are the first to introduce a new multi-modal scene graph that explicitly models the objects and their relationship as a visually grounded, structured representation of the audio-visual scene. Furthermore, we design a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network~(KAN)-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) to enhance the expressive power of the temporal integration stage. This enables more fine-grained modeling of cross-modal interactions within the question-aware fused audio-visual representation, leading to capture richer and more nuanced patterns and then improve temporal reasoning performance. We evaluate the model on the established MUSIC-AVQA and MUSIC-AVQA v2 benchmarks, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code and model checkpoints will be publicly released.

Abstract: In contemporary retail, the variety of products available (e.g. clothing, groceries, cosmetics, frozen goods) make it difficult to predict the demand, prevent stockouts, and find high-potential products. We suggest an agentic AI model that will be used to monitor the inventory, initiate purchase attempts to the appropriate suppliers, and scan for trending or high-margin products to incorporate. The system applies demand forecasting, supplier selection optimization, multi-agent negotiation and continuous learning. We apply a prototype to a setting in the store of a middle scale mart, test its performance on three conventional and artificial data tables, and compare the results to the base heuristics. Our findings indicate that there is a decrease in stockouts, a reduction of inventory holding costs, and an improvement in product mix turnover. We address constraints, scalability as well as improvement prospect.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个分层AI气象学家系统，通过分层预测推理和天气关键词生成，提高了LLM生成天气报告的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We present the Hierarchical AI-Meteorologist, an LLM-agent system that generates explainable weather reports using a hierarchical forecast reasoning and weather keyword generation. Unlike standard approaches that treat forecasts as flat time series, our framework performs multi-scale reasoning across hourly, 6-hour, and daily aggregations to capture both short-term dynamics and long-term trends. Its core reasoning agent converts structured meteorological inputs into coherent narratives while simultaneously extracting a few keywords effectively summarizing the dominant meteorological events. These keywords serve as semantic anchors for validating consistency, temporal coherence and factual alignment of the generated reports. Using OpenWeather and Meteostat data, we demonstrate that hierarchical context and keyword-based validation substantially improve interpretability and robustness of LLM-generated weather narratives, offering a reproducible framework for semantic evaluation of automated meteorological reporting and advancing agent-based scientific reasoning.

Conclusion: SuperIntelliAgent 通过结合可训练的小型扩散模型和冻结的大型语言模型，实现了无需标注的自主学习和持续智能增长。该框架通过双尺度记忆和回放缓冲机制，强化了学习效果，并展示了在实际部署中的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce SuperIntelliAgent, an agentic learning framework that couples a trainable small diffusion model (the learner) with a frozen large language model (the verifier) to enable continual intelligence growth through self-supervised interaction. Unlike conventional supervised fine-tuning, SuperIntelliAgent learns autonomously without annotation: the learner generates candidate outputs, the verifier evaluates them through step-by-step reasoning, and their interaction produces chosen/rejected pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This converts each input into a pseudo-training signal for continual improvement. The framework integrates dual-scale memory: short-term in-context memory that preserves reasoning traces across refinement cycles, and long-term memory that consolidates acquired knowledge through lightweight on-the-fly fine-tuning. A replay buffer retains samples that show verifiable progress and replays them as auxiliary supervision, reinforcing recent learning while forming adaptive curricula. SuperIntelliAgent is infrastructure-agnostic and can be plugged into existing agentic frameworks while turning ordinary inference loops into a lifelong optimization process. We posit that pairing a trainable learner with a reasoning-capable verifier forms a minimal reliable unit of growing intelligence, as paired feedback and partial-history replay yield richer learning curricula and stronger preference alignment. With a small number of automatically generated DPO pairs, the learner improves across all benchmarks, indicating that this mechanism provides a promising direction for continual intelligence accumulation and real-world deployment.

Conclusion: WMAct通过高效互动和主动推理实现了有效的世界模型推理，显著提升了模型在复杂环境中的任务解决能力和迁移性。

Abstract: Developing robust world model reasoning is crucial for large language model (LLM) agents to plan and interact in complex environments. While multi-turn interaction offers a superior understanding of environmental dynamics via authentic feedback, current approaches often impose a rigid reasoning process, which constrains the model's active learning, ultimately hindering efficient world model reasoning. To address these issues, we explore world-model internalization through efficient interaction and active reasoning (WMAct), which liberates the model from structured reasoning, allowing the model to shape thinking directly through its doing, and achieves effective and efficient world model reasoning with two key mechanisms: (1) a reward rescaling mechanism adjusting outcome reward based on action efficacy to incentivize redundancy reduction and purposeful interaction; (2) an interaction frequency annealing strategy to progressively reduce the maximum allowed interaction turns, which compels the model to condense its learning and internalize environmental dynamics rather than over-relying on environmental cues. Our experiments on Sokoban, Maze, and Taxi show that WMAct yields effective world model reasoning capable of resolving tasks in a single turn that previously required multiple interactions and fosters strong transferability to complex environments, improving performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有的MAPF方法通常忽略执行时的动态约束（如运动学限制、通信延迟等），导致规划与执行之间存在差距，尤其影响时间敏感型应用。

Method: 提出了REMAP框架，结合ExecTimeNet来估计执行时间，并与MAPF-LNS和CBS等现有MAPF规划器集成。

Result: 实验表明，REMAP在包含多达300个智能体的基准地图上，比基线方法（如恒定执行速度估计器）的解决方案质量提高了20%。

Conclusion: REMAP框架通过整合ExecTimeNet来准确估计执行时间，显著提升了多智能体路径规划（MAPF）的解决方案质量，特别是在实时截止时间（MAPF-RD）问题中，相比基线方法有高达20%的改进。

Abstract: The Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem aims to find collision-free paths for multiple agents while optimizing objectives such as the sum of costs or makespan. MAPF has wide applications in domains like automated warehouses, manufacturing systems, and airport logistics. However, most MAPF formulations assume a simplified robot model for planning, which overlooks execution-time factors such as kinodynamic constraints, communication latency, and controller variability. This gap between planning and execution is problematic for time-sensitive applications. To bridge this gap, we propose REMAP, an execution-informed MAPF planning framework that can be combined with leading search-based MAPF planners with minor changes. Our framework integrates the proposed ExecTimeNet to accurately estimate execution time based on planned paths. We demonstrate our method for solving MAPF with Real-world Deadlines (MAPF-RD) problem, where agents must reach their goals before a predefined wall-clock time. We integrate our framework with two popular MAPF methods, MAPF-LNS and CBS. Experiments show that REMAP achieves up to 20% improvement in solution quality over baseline methods (e.g., constant execution speed estimators) on benchmark maps with up to 300 agents.

Conclusion: OpenTwinMap是一个开源、基于Python的框架，旨在生成高保真3D城市数字孪生，强调可扩展性和并行化，降低研究人员适应和扩展管道的门槛。

Abstract: Digital twins of urban environments play a critical role in advancing autonomous vehicle (AV) research by enabling simulation, validation, and integration with emerging generative world models. While existing tools have demonstrated value, many publicly available solutions are tightly coupled to specific simulators, difficult to extend, or introduce significant technical overhead. For example, CARLA-the most widely used open-source AV simulator-provides a digital twin framework implemented entirely as an Unreal Engine C++ plugin, limiting flexibility and rapid prototyping. In this work, we propose OpenTwinMap, an open-source, Python-based framework for generating high-fidelity 3D urban digital twins. The completed framework will ingest LiDAR scans and OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to produce semantically segmented static environment assets, including road networks, terrain, and urban structures, which can be exported into Unreal Engine for AV simulation. OpenTwinMap emphasizes extensibility and parallelization, lowering the barrier for researchers to adapt and scale the pipeline to diverse urban contexts. We describe the current capabilities of the OpenTwinMap, which includes preprocessing of OSM and LiDAR data, basic road mesh and terrain generation, and preliminary support for CARLA integration.

Abstract: We consider the robust planning of energy-constrained unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), which act as mobile charging stations, to perform long-horizon aerial monitoring missions. More specifically, given a set of points to be visited by the UAVs and desired final positions of the UAV-UGV teams, the objective is to find a robust plan (the vehicle trajectories) that can be realized without a major revision in the face of uncertainty (e.g., unknown obstacles/terrain, wind) to complete this mission in minimum time. We provide a formal description of this problem as a mixed-integer program (MIP), which is NP-hard. Since exact solution methods are computationally intractable for such problems, we propose RSPECT, a scalable and efficient heuristic. We provide theoretical results on the complexity of our algorithm and the feasibility and robustness of resulting plans. We also demonstrate the performance of our method via simulations and experiments.

Abstract: Additive and subtractive manufacturing enable complex geometries but rely on discrete stacking or local removal, limiting continuous and controllable deformation and causing volume loss and shape deviations. We present a volumepreserving digital-mold paradigm that integrates real-time volume-consistency modeling with geometry-informed deformation prediction and an error-compensation strategy to achieve highly predictable shaping of plastic materials. By analyzing deformation patterns and error trends from post-formed point clouds, our method corrects elastic rebound and accumulation errors, maintaining volume consistency and surface continuity. Experiments on five representative geometries demonstrate that the system reproduces target shapes with high fidelity while achieving over 98% material utilization. This approach establishes a digitally driven, reproducible pathway for sustainable, zero-waste shaping of user-defined designs, bridging digital modeling, real-time sensing, and adaptive forming, and advancing next-generation sustainable and customizable manufacturing.

Conclusion: 本文提出的基于引导向量场（GVF）的实时导航框架显著提高了四旋翼无人机在未知复杂环境中的适应性和鲁棒性，尤其在外部干扰下表现优异。

Abstract: Although quadrotor navigation has achieved high performance in trajectory planning and control, real-time adaptability in unknown complex environments remains a core challenge. This difficulty mainly arises because most existing planning frameworks operate in an open-loop manner, making it hard to cope with environmental uncertainties such as wind disturbances or external perturbations. This paper presents a unified real-time navigation framework for quadrotors in unknown complex environments, based on the online construction of guiding vector fields (GVFs) from discrete reference path points. In the framework, onboard perception modules build a Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) representation of the environment, which enables obstacle awareness and path distance evaluation. The system first generates discrete, collision-free path points using a global planner, and then parameterizes them via uniform B-splines to produce a smooth and physically feasible reference trajectory. An adaptive GVF is then synthesized from the ESDF and the optimized B-spline trajectory. Unlike conventional approaches, the method adopts a closed-loop navigation paradigm, which significantly enhances robustness under external disturbances. Compared with conventional GVF methods, the proposed approach directly accommodates discretized paths and maintains compatibility with standard planning algorithms. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate improved robustness against external disturbances and superior real-time performance.

TL;DR: Soft-Nash Virtual Fixtures通过可调参数τ平衡精度与用户体验，实验验证其在保持性能的同时减少冲突和提升代理感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统虚拟夹具（VFs）在提升精度的同时增加用户心理负担和削弱代理感的问题。

Method: 提出Soft-Nash Virtual Fixtures，基于博弈论的共享控制策略，通过调节参数τ软化线性二次纳什解，实现控制器权威的连续调整。

Result: 实验表明，适度软化（τ≈1-3）在保持跟踪误差与传统VF相当的同时，显著减少冲突、降低工作负荷并提升代理感。

Conclusion: Soft-Nash Virtual Fixtures通过单一可解释参数τ实现了控制器与用户之间的平衡，既保持了精度又提升了操作舒适度和感知代理感，为个性化共享控制提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Virtual fixtures (VFs) improve precision in teleoperation but often ``fight'' the user, inflating mental workload and eroding the sense of agency. We propose Soft-Nash Virtual Fixtures, a game-theoretic shared-control policy that softens the classic two-player linear-quadratic (LQ) Nash solution by inflating the fixture's effort weight with a single, interpretable scalar parameter $τ$. This yields a continuous dial on controller assertiveness: $τ=0$ recovers a hard, performance-focused Nash / virtual fixture controller, while larger $τ$ reduce gains and pushback, yet preserve the equilibrium structure and continuity of closed-loop stability. We derive Soft-Nash from both a KL-regularized trust-region and a maximum-entropy viewpoint, obtaining a closed-form robot best response that shrinks authority and aligns the fixture with the operator's input as $τ$ grows. We implement Soft-Nash on a 6-DoF haptic device in 3D tracking task ($n=12$). Moderate softness ($τ\approx 1-3$, especially $τ=2$) maintains tracking error statistically indistinguishable from a tuned classic VF while sharply reducing controller-user conflict, lowering NASA-TLX workload, and increasing Sense of Agency (SoAS). A composite BalancedScore that combines normalized accuracy and non-fighting behavior peaks near $τ=2-3$. These results show that a one-parameter Soft-Nash policy can preserve accuracy while improving comfort and perceived agency, providing a practical and interpretable pathway to personalized shared control in haptics and teleoperation.

Abstract: Biological synergies have emerged as a widely adopted paradigm for dexterous hand design, enabling human-like manipulation with a small number of actuators. Nonetheless, excessive coupling tends to diminish the dexterity of hands. This paper tackles the trade-off between actuation complexity and dexterity by proposing an anthropomorphic finger topology with 4 DoFs driven by 2 actuators, and by developing an adaptive, modular dexterous hand based on this finger topology. We explore the biological basis of hand synergies and human gesture analysis, translating joint-level coordination and structural attributes into a modular finger architecture. Leveraging these biomimetic mappings, we design a five-finger modular hand and establish its kinematic model to analyze adaptive grasping and in-hand manipulation. Finally, we construct a physical prototype and conduct preliminary experiments, which validate the effectiveness of the proposed design and analysis.

Conclusion: FAKP-Net 通过引入3D关键点四元组，显著提升了机器人对物体功能性的理解，并在实际任务中展示了其可靠性。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for affordance-informed robotic manipulation by introducing 3D keypoints to enhance the understanding of object parts' functionality. The proposed approach provides direct information about what the potential use of objects is, as well as guidance on where and how a manipulator should engage, whereas conventional methods treat affordance detection as a semantic segmentation task, focusing solely on answering the what question. To address this gap, we propose a Fusion-based Affordance Keypoint Network (FAKP-Net) by introducing 3D keypoint quadruplet that harnesses the synergistic potential of RGB and Depth image to provide information on execution position, direction, and extent. Benchmark testing demonstrates that FAKP-Net outperforms existing models by significant margins in affordance segmentation task and keypoint detection task. Real-world experiments also showcase the reliability of our method in accomplishing manipulation tasks with previously unseen objects.

Abstract: Effective collective decision-making in swarm robotics often requires balancing exploration, communication and individual uncertainty estimation, especially in hazardous environments where direct measurements are limited or costly. We propose a decentralized Bayesian framework that enables a swarm of simple robots to identify the safer of two areas, each characterized by an unknown rate of hazardous events governed by a Poisson process. Robots employ a conjugate prior to gradually predict the times between events and derive confidence estimates to adapt their behavior. Our simulation results show that the robot swarm consistently chooses the correct area while reducing exposure to hazardous events by being sample-efficient. Compared to baseline heuristics, our proposed approach shows better performance in terms of safety and speed of convergence. The proposed scenario has potential to extend the current set of benchmarks in collective decision-making and our method has applications in adaptive risk-aware sampling and exploration in hazardous, dynamic environments.

Method: 提出了一种名为MLATC的分层扩展方法，通过将节点组织成层次结构，实现从粗到细的最近邻搜索，减少距离计算次数。

Conclusion: MLATC通过分层结构和自适应层添加机制，显著提升了ATC-DT的计算效率，实现了大规模环境中实时全局拓扑地图构建。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of building global topological maps from 3D LiDAR point clouds for autonomous mobile robots operating in large-scale, dynamic, and unknown environments. Adaptive Resonance Theory-based Topological Clustering with Different Topologies (ATC-DT) builds global topological maps represented as graphs while mitigating catastrophic forgetting during sequential processing. However, its winner selection mechanism relies on an exhaustive nearest-neighbor search over all existing nodes, leading to scalability limitations as the map grows. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical extension called Multi-Layer ATC (MLATC). MLATC organizes nodes into a hierarchy, enabling the nearest-neighbor search to proceed from coarse to fine resolutions, thereby drastically reducing the number of distance evaluations per query. The number of layers is not fixed in advance. MLATC employs an adaptive layer addition mechanism that automatically deepens the hierarchy when lower layers become saturated, keeping the number of user-defined hyperparameters low. Simulation experiments on synthetic large-scale environments show that MLATC accelerates topological map building compared to the original ATC-DT and exhibits a sublinear, approximately logarithmic scaling of search time with respect to the number of nodes. Experiments on campus-scale real-world LiDAR datasets confirm that MLATC maintains a millisecond-level per-frame runtime and enables real-time global topological map building in large-scale environments, significantly outperforming the original ATC-DT in terms of computational efficiency.

Motivation: The aim is to achieve high functionality and flexibility in soft robot systems by developing a pneumatic valve capable of logical operations, similar to transistors in electrical circuits.

Method: The paper details the operating principle, fabrication method, and characteristics of the FST, followed by methods for configuring logical operations and constructing a latch circuit.

Result: The FST operates as a NOT logic element, and when combined, it can perform various logical operations (e.g., NAND, NOR). A prototype system with tactile tubes and fluid actuators validates the method.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed fluidic sheet transistor (FST) by successfully integrating it into a soft robot system, enabling logical operations and active posture changes using only pneumatic signals.

Abstract: Aiming to achieve both high functionality and flexibility in soft robot system, this paper presents a soft urethane sheet-like valve with an amplifier that can perform logical operations using only pneumatic signals. When the control chamber in the valve is pressurized, the main path is compressed along its central axis, buckling and being pressed,resulting in blockage. This allows control by a pressure signal smaller than that within the main channel. Furthermore, similar to transistors in electrical circuits, when combined, the proposed valve can perform a variety of logical operations. The basic type operates as a NOT logic element, which is named the fluidic sheet transistor (FST). By integrating multiple FSTs, logical operations such as positive logic, NAND, and NOR can be performed on a single sheet. This paper describes the operating principle, fabrication method, and characteristics of the FST,followed by a method for configuring logical operations.Moreover, we demonstrate the construction of a latch circuit(self-holding logic circuit) using FST, introducing a prototype of a fluid robot system that combines a tactile tube as a fluidic detector and fluid actuators. This demonstrates that it is possible to generate behavior that actively changes posture when hitting an obstacle using only air pressure from a single pipe, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合生成器和强化学习的策略，用于解决Ackermann车辆在狭窄死胡同中的逃逸问题，相比传统方法在效率和机动次数上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非完整约束限制了可行速度而不减少配置空间维度，导致类似汽车的机器人无法执行无碰撞几何路径。Ackermann转向进一步施加曲率限制并禁止原地旋转，使得从狭窄死胡同逃脱通常需要紧密序列的前进和后退机动。传统规划器因狭窄通道占据低测度区域和非完整可达性缩小有效连接集，在这些场景中表现不佳。

Method: 论文首先构建了一个生成器，用于采样符合Ackermann运动学的多阶段前进-后退轨迹，并膨胀其包络以合成狭窄死胡同家族；其次，构建了一个强制运动学约束的训练环境，并使用软演员-评论家算法训练策略；最后，与传统规划器进行了对比评估。

Result: 学习策略在参数化死胡同家族中解决了更大比例的实例，减少了机动次数，并在相同的感知和控制限制下保持了可比的路径长度和规划时间。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个结合生成器、训练环境和学习策略的系统，用于解决Ackermann车辆的狭窄死胡同逃逸问题，相比传统规划器在解决效率、机动次数和路径长度上表现更优。

Abstract: Nonholonomic constraints restrict feasible velocities without reducing configuration-space dimension, which makes collision-free geometric paths generally non-executable for car-like robots. Ackermann steering further imposes curvature bounds and forbids in-place rotation, so escaping from narrow dead ends typically requires tightly sequenced forward and reverse maneuvers. Classical planners that decouple global search and local steering struggle in these settings because narrow passages occupy low-measure regions and nonholonomic reachability shrinks the set of valid connections, which degrades sampling efficiency and increases sensitivity to clearances. We study nonholonomic narrow dead-end escape for Ackermann vehicles and contribute three components. First, we construct a generator that samples multi-phase forward-reverse trajectories compatible with Ackermann kinematics and inflates their envelopes to synthesize families of narrow dead ends that are guaranteed to admit at least one feasible escape. Second, we construct a training environment that enforces kinematic constraints and train a policy using the soft actor-critic algorithm. Third, we evaluate against representative classical planners that combine global search with nonholonomic steering. Across parameterized dead-end families, the learned policy solves a larger fraction of instances, reduces maneuver count, and maintains comparable path length and planning time while under the same sensing and control limits. We provide our project as open source at https://github.com/gitagitty/cisDRL-RobotNav.git

Motivation: 为了解决异构机器人团队在复杂任务中的协作问题，尤其是需要动态响应任务失败或用户意图变化的情况，作者提出了 CoMuRoS 系统。该系统旨在实现鲁棒、灵活的多机器人和人机协作。

Method: CoMuRoS 采用分层架构，包括任务管理器 LLM（负责自然语言目标解析、任务分类和子任务分配）和本地 LLM（生成可执行的 Python 代码）。系统通过动态上下文（任务、历史、机器人状态等）和事件驱动机制实现灵活的任务分配和重新规划。

Result: 硬件实验显示，CoMuRoS 能够自主恢复中断任务、过滤无关干扰，并实现紧密协调的运输任务（多机器人协作对象恢复成功率：9/10，协调运输：8/8，人机协作恢复：5/5）。仿真实验验证了意图感知的重新规划能力。文本基准测试中，任务分配、分类和正确性得分均较高（如正确性高达 0.91）。

Conclusion: CoMuRoS 是一种通用的分层架构，能够实现异构机器人团队的集中式规划与分散式执行，并支持事件驱动的重新规划。该系统在硬件和仿真研究中均表现出色，特别是在多机器人协作、协调运输和人机协作方面取得了高成功率。

Abstract: This paper introduces CoMuRoS (Collaborative Multi-Robot System), a generalizable hierarchical architecture for heterogeneous robot teams that unifies centralized deliberation with decentralized execution, and supports event-driven replanning. A Task Manager LLM interprets natural-language goals, classifies tasks, and allocates subtasks using static rules plus dynamic contexts (task, history, robot and task status, and events).Each robot runs a local LLM that composes executable Python code from primitive skills (ROS2 nodes, policies), while onboard perception (VLMs/image processing) continuously monitors events and classifies them into relevant or irrelevant to the task. Task failures or user intent changes trigger replanning, allowing robots to assist teammates, resume tasks, or request human help. Hardware studies demonstrate autonomous recovery from disruptive events, filtering of irrelevant distractions, and tightly coordinated transport with emergent human-robot cooperation (e.g., multirobot collaborative object recovery success rate: 9/10, coordinated transport: 8/8, human-assisted recovery: 5/5).Simulation studies show intention-aware replanning. A curated textual benchmark spanning 22 scenarios (3 tasks each, around 20 robots) evaluates task allocation, classification, IoU, executability, and correctness, with high average scores (e.g., correctness up to 0.91) across multiple LLMs, a separate replanning set (5 scenarios) achieves 1.0 correctness. Compared with prior LLM-based systems, CoMuRoS uniquely demonstrates runtime, event-driven replanning on physical robots, delivering robust, flexible multi-robot and human-robot collaboration.

Result: 在三个真实动态环境中，BINDER的成功率和效率显著优于现有技术基线。

Conclusion: BINDER框架通过解耦战略规划和持续环境监控，显著提高了机器人在动态环境中的适应性和任务成功率。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary mobile manipulation (OVMM) requires robots to follow language instructions, navigate, and manipulate while updating their world representation under dynamic environmental changes. However, most prior approaches update their world representation only at discrete update points such as navigation targets, waypoints, or the end of an action step, leaving robots blind between updates and causing cascading failures: overlooked objects, late error detection, and delayed replanning. To address this limitation, we propose BINDER (Bridging INstant and DEliberative Reasoning), a dual process framework that decouples strategic planning from continuous environment monitoring. Specifically, BINDER integrates a Deliberative Response Module (DRM, a multimodal LLM for task planning) with an Instant Response Module (IRM, a VideoLLM for continuous monitoring). The two modules play complementary roles: the DRM performs strategic planning with structured 3D scene updates and guides what the IRM attends to, while the IRM analyzes video streams to update memory, correct ongoing actions, and trigger replanning when necessary. Through this bidirectional coordination, the modules address the trade off between maintaining awareness and avoiding costly updates, enabling robust adaptation under dynamic conditions. Evaluated in three real world environments with dynamic object placement, BINDER achieves substantially higher success and efficiency than SoTA baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness for real world deployment.

Conclusion: VGDP通过互补感知融合模块和多模态学习框架，显著提升了模仿学习在视觉和空间扰动下的鲁棒性，并在仿真和真实任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Imitation learning has emerged as a crucial ap proach for acquiring visuomotor skills from demonstrations, where designing effective observation encoders is essential for policy generalization. However, existing methods often struggle to generalize under spatial and visual randomizations, instead tending to overfit. To address this challenge, we propose Visual Geometry Diffusion Policy (VGDP), a multimodal imitation learning framework built around a Complementarity-Aware Fusion Module where modality-wise dropout enforces balanced use of RGB and point-cloud cues, with cross-attention serving only as a lightweight interaction layer. Our experiments show that the expressiveness of the fused latent space is largely induced by the enforced complementarity from modality-wise dropout, with cross-attention serving primarily as a lightweight interaction mechanism rather than the main source of robustness. Across a benchmark of 18 simulated tasks and 4 real-world tasks, VGDP outperforms seven baseline policies with an average performance improvement of 39.1%. More importantly, VGDP demonstrates strong robustness under visual and spatial per turbations, surpassing baselines with an average improvement of 41.5% in different visual conditions and 15.2% in different spatial settings.

Conclusion: RealD$^2$iff通过合成噪声深度数据，成功缩小了视觉模拟与现实的差距，实现了无需额外微调的零样本机器人操作。

Abstract: Robot manipulation in the real world is fundamentally constrained by the visual sim2real gap, where depth observations collected in simulation fail to reflect the complex noise patterns inherent to real sensors. In this work, inspired by the denoising capability of diffusion models, we invert the conventional perspective and propose a clean-to-noisy paradigm that learns to synthesize noisy depth, thereby bridging the visual sim2real gap through purely simulation-driven robotic learning. Building on this idea, we introduce RealD$^2$iff, a hierarchical coarse-to-fine diffusion framework that decomposes depth noise into global structural distortions and fine-grained local perturbations. To enable progressive learning of these components, we further develop two complementary strategies: Frequency-Guided Supervision (FGS) for global structure modeling and Discrepancy-Guided Optimization (DGO) for localized refinement. To integrate RealD$^2$iff seamlessly into imitation learning, we construct a pipeline that spans six stages. We provide comprehensive empirical and experimental validation demonstrating the effectiveness of this paradigm. RealD$^2$iff enables two key applications: (1) generating real-world-like depth to construct clean-noisy paired datasets without manual sensor data collection. (2) Achieving zero-shot sim2real robot manipulation, substantially improving real-world performance without additional fine-tuning.

Conclusion: LIBERO-Elegant基准和提出的解耦细化框架显著提升了VLA模型执行质量，通过Elegance Critic和JITI机制实现了对动作质量的实时干预和改进。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have enabled notable progress in general-purpose robotic manipulation, yet their learned policies often exhibit variable execution quality. We attribute this variability to the mixed-quality nature of human demonstrations, where the implicit principles that govern how actions should be carried out are only partially satisfied. To address this challenge, we introduce the LIBERO-Elegant benchmark with explicit criteria for evaluating execution quality. Using these criteria, we develop a decoupled refinement framework that improves execution quality without modifying or retraining the base VLA policy. We formalize Elegant Execution as the satisfaction of Implicit Task Constraints (ITCs) and train an Elegance Critic via offline Calibrated Q-Learning to estimate the expected quality of candidate actions. At inference time, a Just-in-Time Intervention (JITI) mechanism monitors critic confidence and intervenes only at decision-critical moments, providing selective, on-demand refinement. Experiments on LIBERO-Elegant and real-world manipulation tasks show that the learned Elegance Critic substantially improves execution quality, even on unseen tasks. The proposed model enables robotic control that values not only whether tasks succeed, but also how they are performed.

Motivation: 多机器人在狭窄或受限空间中导航时，常因RL策略泛化能力不足导致死锁，现有方法难以应对未见环境。

Result: 在密集多智能体基准测试中，该方法将任务完成率从边缘提升至近乎全面成功，显著减少死锁和碰撞。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种混合框架，结合了基于强化学习的反应式导航与按需多智能体路径规划（MAPF），显著提高了多机器人在复杂环境中的导航成功率，减少了死锁和碰撞。

Abstract: Multi-robot navigation in cluttered environments presents fundamental challenges in balancing reactive collision avoidance with long-range goal achievement. When navigating through narrow passages
  or confined spaces, deadlocks frequently emerge that prevent agents from reaching their destinations, particularly when Reinforcement Learning (RL) control policies encounter novel configurations out of learning distribution. Existing RL-based approaches suffer from limited generalization capability in unseen environments. We propose a hybrid framework that seamlessly integrates RL-based reactive navigation with on-demand Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) to explicitly resolve topological deadlocks. Our approach integrates a safety layer that monitors agent progress to detect deadlocks and, when detected, triggers a coordination controller for affected agents. The framework constructs globally feasible trajectories via MAPF and regulates waypoint progression to reduce inter-agent conflicts during navigation.
  Extensive evaluation on dense multi-agent benchmarks shows that our method boosts task completion from marginal to near-universal success, markedly reducing deadlocks and collisions. When integrated with hierarchical task planning, it enables coordinated navigation for heterogeneous robots, demonstrating that coupling reactive RL navigation with selective MAPF intervention yields a robust, zero-shot performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLAs) models promise to extend the remarkable success of vision-language models (VLMs) to robotics. Yet, unlike VLMs in the vision-language domain, VLAs for robotics require finetuning to contend with varying physical factors like robot embodiment, environment characteristics, and spatial relationships of each task. Existing fine-tuning methods lack specificity, adapting the same set of parameters regardless of a task's visual, linguistic, and physical characteristics. Inspired by functional specificity in neuroscience, we hypothesize that it is more effective to finetune sparse model representations specific to a given task. In this work, we introduce Robotic Steering, a finetuning approach grounded in mechanistic interpretability that leverages few-shot demonstrations to identify and selectively finetune task-specific attention heads aligned with the physical, visual, and linguistic requirements of robotic tasks. Through comprehensive on-robot evaluations with a Franka Emika robot arm, we demonstrate that Robotic Steering outperforms LoRA while achieving superior robustness under task variation, reduced computational cost, and enhanced interpretability for adapting VLAs to diverse robotic tasks.

Conclusion: 该STS训练设备能够适应不同训练需求，同时保持商业提升辅助转移能力，实验证明其对自然STS运动学影响小，能精确卸载患者重心重量，并可通过虚拟弹簧辅助体重转移。

Abstract: The ability to accomplish a sit-to-stand (STS) motion is key to increase functional mobility and reduce rehospitalization risks. While raising aid (transfer) devices and partial bodyweight support (rehabilitation) devices exist, both are unable to adjust the STS training to different mobility levels. Therefore, We have developed an STS training device that allows various configurations of impedance and vertical/forward forces to adapt to many training needs while maintaining commercial raising aid transfer capabilities. Experiments with healthy adults (both men and women) of various heights and weights show that the device 1) has a low impact on the natural STS kinematics, 2) can provide precise weight unloading at the patient's center of mass and 3) can add a forward virtual spring to assist the transfer of the bodyweight to the feet for seat-off, at the start of the STS motion.

Abstract: Recent progress in legged locomotion has allowed highly dynamic and parkour-like behaviors for robots, similar to their biological counterparts. Yet, these methods mostly rely on egocentric (first-person) perception, limiting their performance, especially when the viewpoint of the robot is occluded. A promising solution would be to enhance the robot's environmental awareness by using complementary viewpoints, such as multiple actors exchanging perceptual information. Inspired by this idea, this work proposes a multi-view depth-based locomotion framework that combines egocentric and exocentric observations to provide richer environmental context during agile locomotion. Using a teacher-student distillation approach, the student policy learns to fuse proprioception with dual depth streams while remaining robust to real-world sensing imperfections. To further improve robustness, we introduce extensive domain randomization, including stochastic remote-camera dropouts and 3D positional perturbations that emulate aerial-ground cooperative sensing. Simulation results show that multi-viewpoints policies outperform single-viewpoint baseline in gap crossing, step descent, and other dynamic maneuvers, while maintaining stability when the exocentric camera is partially or completely unavailable. Additional experiments show that moderate viewpoint misalignment is well tolerated when incorporated during training. This study demonstrates that heterogeneous visual feedback improves robustness and agility in quadrupedal locomotion. Furthermore, to support reproducibility, the implementation accompanying this work is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/multiview-parkour-6FB8

Conclusion: CAPE框架通过上下文感知的扩散策略和近端模式扩展，显著提高了在未见环境中的避碰任务成功率，相比现有技术方法，在模拟和真实世界环境中分别实现了26%和80%的成功率提升。

Abstract: In robotics, diffusion models can capture multi-modal trajectories from demonstrations, making them a transformative approach in imitation learning. However, achieving optimal performance following this regiment requires a large-scale dataset, which is costly to obtain, especially for challenging tasks, such as collision avoidance. In those tasks, generalization at test time demands coverage of many obstacles types and their spatial configurations, which are impractical to acquire purely via data. To remedy this problem, we propose Context-Aware diffusion policy via Proximal mode Expansion (CAPE), a framework that expands trajectory distribution modes with context-aware prior and guidance at inference via a novel prior-seeded iterative guided refinement procedure. The framework generates an initial trajectory plan and executes a short prefix trajectory, and then the remaining trajectory segment is perturbed to an intermediate noise level, forming a trajectory prior. Such a prior is context-aware and preserves task intent. Repeating the process with context-aware guided denoising iteratively expands mode support to allow finding smoother, less collision-prone trajectories. For collision avoidance, CAPE expands trajectory distribution modes with collision-aware context, enabling the sampling of collision-free trajectories in previously unseen environments while maintaining goal consistency. We evaluate CAPE on diverse manipulation tasks in cluttered unseen simulated and real-world settings and show up to 26% and 80% higher success rates respectively compared to SOTA methods, demonstrating better generalization to unseen environments.

Result: 在高度杂乱场景中，空间可供性预测准确率提升超过20%；在存在不同数量干扰物的环境中，操作任务成功率平均提高11%；目标混淆率降低6%，碰撞率减少7%。

Conclusion: NICE框架通过自然修复技术增强视觉多样性，显著减少了模仿学习中的分布外差距，提升了在杂乱环境中的任务准确性和安全性。

Abstract: Learning robust visuomotor policies for robotic manipulation remains a challenge in real-world settings, where visual distractors can significantly degrade performance and safety. In this work, we propose an effective and scalable framework, Naturalistic Inpainting for Context Enhancement (NICE). Our method minimizes out-of-distribution (OOD) gap in imitation learning by increasing visual diversity through construction of new experiences using existing demonstrations. By utilizing image generative frameworks and large language models, NICE performs three editing operations, object replacement, restyling, and removal of distracting (non-target) objects. These changes preserve spatial relationships without obstructing target objects and maintain action-label consistency. Unlike previous approaches, NICE requires no additional robot data collection, simulator access, or custom model training, making it readily applicable to existing robotic datasets.
  Using real-world scenes, we showcase the capability of our framework in producing photo-realistic scene enhancement. For downstream tasks, we use NICE data to finetune a vision-language model (VLM) for spatial affordance prediction and a vision-language-action (VLA) policy for object manipulation. Our evaluations show that NICE successfully minimizes OOD gaps, resulting in over 20% improvement in accuracy for affordance prediction in highly cluttered scenes. For manipulation tasks, success rate increases on average by 11% when testing in environments populated with distractors in different quantities. Furthermore, we show that our method improves visual robustness, lowering target confusion by 6%, and enhances safety by reducing collision rate by 7%.

Conclusion: 微调增强数据虽然有效，但并不能均等地缓解所有由场景杂乱带来的性能负面影响。

Abstract: In this work, we propose an evaluation protocol for examining the performance of robotic manipulation policies in cluttered scenes. Contrary to prior works, we approach evaluation from a psychophysical perspective, therefore we use a unified measure of clutter that accounts for environmental factors as well as the distractors quantity, characteristics, and arrangement. Using this measure, we systematically construct evaluation scenarios in both hyper-realistic simulation and real-world and conduct extensive experimentation on manipulation policies, in particular vision-language-action (VLA) models. Our experiments highlight the significant impact of scene clutter, lowering the performance of the policies, by as much as 34% and show that despite achieving similar average performance across the tasks, different VLA policies have unique vulnerabilities and a relatively low agreement on success scenarios. We further show that our clutter measure is an effective indicator of performance degradation and analyze the impact of distractors in terms of their quantity and occluding influence. At the end, we show that finetuning on enhanced data, although effective, does not equally remedy all negative impacts of clutter on performance.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的集成动态风险场（DRF）、凸可行空间和约束iLQR求解器的轨迹规划方法，为动态交互交通场景提供了安全、高效且舒适的轨迹生成方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel trajectory planning pipeline for complex driving scenarios like autonomous lane changing, by integrating risk-aware planning with guaranteed collision avoidance into a unified optimization framework. We first construct a dynamic risk fields (DRF) that captures both the static and dynamic collision risks from surrounding vehicles. Then, we develop a rigorous strategy for generating time-varying convex feasible spaces that ensure kinematic feasibility and safety requirements. The trajectory planning problem is formulated as a finite-horizon optimal control problem and solved using a constrained iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) algorithm that jointly optimizes trajectory smoothness, control effort, and risk exposure while maintaining strict feasibility. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional approaches in terms of safety and efficiency, achieving collision-free trajectories with shorter lane-changing distances (28.59 m) and times (2.84 s) while maintaining smooth and comfortable acceleration patterns. In dense roundabout environments the planner further demonstrates robust adaptability, producing larger safety margins, lower jerk, and superior curvature smoothness compared with APF, MPC, and RRT based baselines. These results confirm that the integrated DRF with convex feasible space and constrained iLQR solver provides a balanced solution for safe, efficient, and comfortable trajectory generation in dynamic and interactive traffic scenarios.

Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) performing tasks such as transportation and aerial photography are vulnerable to intentional projectile attacks from humans. Dodging such a sudden and fast projectile poses a significant challenge for UAVs, requiring ultra-low latency responses and agile maneuvers. Drawing inspiration from baseball, in which pitchers' body movements are analyzed to predict the ball's trajectory, we propose a novel real-time dodging system that leverages an RGB-D camera. Our approach integrates human pose estimation with depth information to predict the attacker's motion trajectory and the subsequent projectile trajectory. Additionally, we introduce an uncertainty-aware dodging strategy to enable the UAV to dodge incoming projectiles efficiently. Our perception system achieves high prediction accuracy and outperforms the baseline in effective distance and latency. The dodging strategy addresses temporal and spatial uncertainties to ensure UAV safety. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate the framework's reliable dodging capabilities against sudden attacks and its outstanding robustness across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Underwater visual localization remains challenging due to wavelength-dependent attenuation, poor texture, and non-Gaussian sensor noise. We introduce MARVO, a physics-aware, learning-integrated odometry framework that fuses underwater image formation modeling, differentiable matching, and reinforcement-learning optimization. At the front-end, we extend transformer-based feature matcher with a Physics Aware Radiance Adapter that compensates for color channel attenuation and contrast loss, yielding geometrically consistent feature correspondences under turbidity. These semi dense matches are combined with inertial and pressure measurements inside a factor-graph backend, where we formulate a keyframe-based visual-inertial-barometric estimator using GTSAM library. Each keyframe introduces (i) Pre-integrated IMU motion factors, (ii) MARVO-derived visual pose factors, and (iii) barometric depth priors, giving a full-state MAP estimate in real time. Lastly, we introduce a Reinforcement-Learningbased Pose-Graph Optimizer that refines global trajectories beyond local minima of classical least-squares solvers by learning optimal retraction actions on SE(2).

Conclusion: 论文提出的基于相机端到端规划框架，通过估计BEV空间中的随机不确定性并将其融入规划，结合车道跟随正则化，显著提升了纯视觉自动驾驶的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: End-to-End (E2E) planning has become a powerful paradigm for autonomous driving, yet current systems remain fundamentally uncertainty-blind. They assume perception outputs are fully reliable, even in ambiguous or poorly observed scenes, leaving the planner without an explicit measure of uncertainty. To address this limitation, we propose a camera-only E2E framework that estimates aleatoric uncertainty directly in BEV space and incorporates it into planning. Our method produces a dense, uncertainty-aware drivability map that captures both semantic structure and geometric layout at pixel-level resolution. To further promote safe and rule-compliant behavior, we introduce a lane-following regularization that encodes lane structure and traffic norms. This prior stabilizes trajectory planning under normal conditions while preserving the flexibility needed for maneuvers such as overtaking or lane changes. Together, these components enable robust and interpretable trajectory planning, even under challenging uncertainty conditions. Evaluated on the NAVSIM benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering substantial gains on both the challenging NAVHARD and NAVSAFE subsets. These results demonstrate that our principled aleatoric uncertainty modeling combined with driving priors significantly advances the safety and reliability of camera-only E2E autonomous driving.

Abstract: Ensuring safety remains a key challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially in rare and complex scenarios. One critical but understudied aspect is the \textbf{potential risk} situations, where the risk is \textbf{not yet observable} but can be inferred from subtle precursors, such as anomalous behaviors or commonsense violations. Recognizing these precursors requires strong semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities, which are often absent in current AV systems due to the scarcity of such cases in existing driving or risk-centric datasets. Moreover, current autonomous driving accident datasets often lack annotations of the causal reasoning chains behind incidents, which are essential for identifying potential risks before they become observable. To address these gaps, we introduce PotentialRiskQA, a novel vision-language dataset designed for reasoning about potential risks prior to observation. Each sample is annotated with structured scene descriptions, semantic precursors, and inferred risk outcomes. Based on this dataset, we further propose PR-Reasoner, a vision-language-model-based framework tailored for onboard potential risk reasoning. Experimental results show that fine-tuning on PotentialRiskQA enables PR-Reasoner to significantly enhance its performance on the potential risk reasoning task compared to baseline VLMs. Together, our dataset and model provide a foundation for developing autonomous systems with improved foresight and proactive safety capabilities, moving toward more intelligent and resilient AVs.

Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to follow free-form language commands is critical for seamless human-robot interaction, collaborative task execution, and general-purpose embodied intelligence. While recent advances have improved low-level humanoid locomotion and robot manipulation, language-conditioned whole-body control remains a significant challenge. Existing methods are often limited to simple instructions and sacrifice either motion diversity or physical plausibility. To address this, we introduce Humanoid-LLA, a Large Language Action Model that maps expressive language commands to physically executable whole-body actions for humanoid robots. Our approach integrates three core components: a unified motion vocabulary that aligns human and humanoid motion primitives into a shared discrete space; a vocabulary-directed controller distilled from a privileged policy to ensure physical feasibility; and a physics-informed fine-tuning stage using reinforcement learning with dynamics-aware rewards to enhance robustness and stability. Extensive evaluations in simulation and on a real-world Unitree G1 humanoid show that Humanoid-LLA delivers strong language generalization while maintaining high physical fidelity, outperforming existing language-conditioned controllers in motion naturalness, stability, and execution success rate.

Motivation: Reliable positioning in GNSS-challenged environments is critical, and existing tightly coupled GNSS/IMU fusion methods are vulnerable to non-Gaussian noise and outliers.

Method: The framework integrates GNSS pseudorange measurements with IMU preintegration factors using the Barron loss, a tunable robust loss function, within an extended GTSAM framework.

Result: Evaluation on the UrbanNav dataset shows the solution reduces positioning errors by up to 41% relative to standard FGO and outperforms EKF baselines in urban canyon environments.

Conclusion: The proposed robust and adaptive factor graph-based fusion framework significantly enhances positioning resilience in GNSS-challenged environments, demonstrating up to 41% error reduction compared to standard FGO and even better performance over EKF baselines.

Abstract: Reliable positioning in GNSS-challenged environments remains a critical challenge for navigation systems. Tightly coupled GNSS/IMU fusion improves robustness but remains vulnerable to non-Gaussian noise and outliers. We present a robust and adaptive factor graph-based fusion framework that directly integrates GNSS pseudorange measurements with IMU preintegration factors and incorporates the Barron loss, a general robust loss function that unifies several m-estimators through a single tunable parameter. By adaptively down weighting unreliable GNSS measurements, our approach improves resilience positioning. The method is implemented in an extended GTSAM framework and evaluated on the UrbanNav dataset. The proposed solution reduces positioning errors by up to 41% relative to standard FGO, and achieves even larger improvements over extended Kalman filter (EKF) baselines in urban canyon environments. These results highlight the benefits of Barron loss in enhancing the resilience of GNSS/IMU-based navigation in urban and signal-compromised environments.

Motivation: 解决3DGS SLAM系统因GPU内存限制而无法大规模重建的问题。

Method: 采用外核（out-of-core）方法，将场景分割为空间块，仅将活跃区域保留在GPU内存中，非活跃区域存储于磁盘。

Result: 在室内场景（Replica、TUM-RGBD）、城市驾驶场景（KITTI）及资源受限平台（Nvidia Jetson）上验证了方法的有效性，成功完成所有11个KITTI序列重建且未出现内存问题。

Conclusion: DiskChunGS通过空间分块和动态内存管理，成功克服了3DGS SLAM系统的内存限制，实现了大规模环境的实时重建，并在多种场景下验证了其优越性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated impressive results for novel view synthesis with real-time rendering capabilities. However, integrating 3DGS with SLAM systems faces a fundamental scalability limitation: methods are constrained by GPU memory capacity, restricting reconstruction to small-scale environments. We present DiskChunGS, a scalable 3DGS SLAM system that overcomes this bottleneck through an out-of-core approach that partitions scenes into spatial chunks and maintains only active regions in GPU memory while storing inactive areas on disk. Our architecture integrates seamlessly with existing SLAM frameworks for pose estimation and loop closure, enabling globally consistent reconstruction at scale. We validate DiskChunGS on indoor scenes (Replica, TUM-RGBD), urban driving scenarios (KITTI), and resource-constrained Nvidia Jetson platforms. Our method uniquely completes all 11 KITTI sequences without memory failures while achieving superior visual quality, demonstrating that algorithmic innovation can overcome the memory constraints that have limited previous 3DGS SLAM methods.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的通用潜在动作学习框架通过结合未来帧重建和动作序列预测，显著提升了机器人操作的泛化能力，尤其在少样本迁移学习方面表现突出。

Abstract: Learning transferable latent actions from large-scale object manipulation videos can significantly enhance generalization in downstream robotics tasks, as such representations are agnostic to different robot embodiments. Existing approaches primarily rely on visual reconstruction objectives while neglecting physical priors, leading to sub-optimal performance in learning universal representations. To address these challenges, we propose a Universal Latent Action Learning framework that takes task instructions and multiple frames as inputs, and optimizes both future frame reconstruction and action sequence prediction. Unlike prior works, incorporating action predictions (e.g., gripper or hand trajectories and orientations) allows the model to capture richer physical priors such as real-world distances and orientations, thereby enabling seamless transferability to downstream tasks. We further decompose the latent actions into learnable motion and scene tokens to distinguish the robot's active movements from environmental changes, thus filtering out irrelevant dynamics. By distilling the learned latent actions into the latest VLA models, we achieve strong performance across both simulated (SIMPLER and LIBERO) and real-world robot settings. Notably, with only 10 real-world trajectories per task collected on a Franka robot, our approach successfully completes all five challenging tasks, demonstrating strong few-shot transferability in robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: UNOGrasp显著提升了在合成和真实环境中对遮挡物的推理能力和抓取成功率，优于通用和专业替代方案。

Abstract: Successful robotic grasping in cluttered environments not only requires a model to visually ground a target object but also to reason about obstructions that must be cleared beforehand. While current vision-language embodied reasoning models show emergent spatial understanding, they remain limited in terms of obstruction reasoning and accessibility planning. To bridge this gap, we present UNOGrasp, a learning-based vision-language model capable of performing visually-grounded obstruction reasoning to infer the sequence of actions needed to unobstruct the path and grasp the target object. We devise a novel multi-step reasoning process based on obstruction paths originated by the target object. We anchor each reasoning step with obstruction-aware visual cues to incentivize reasoning capability. UNOGrasp combines supervised and reinforcement finetuning through verifiable reasoning rewards. Moreover, we construct UNOBench, a large-scale dataset for both training and benchmarking, based on MetaGraspNetV2, with over 100k obstruction paths annotated by humans with obstruction ratios, contact points, and natural-language instructions. Extensive experiments and real-robot evaluations show that UNOGrasp significantly improves obstruction reasoning and grasp success across both synthetic and real-world environments, outperforming generalist and proprietary alternatives.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在各种观测故障模式下显著提升了安全性和效率。

Conclusion: 该方法在模拟高速公路合流场景中显著优于基线MARL方法，在各种观测故障模式下实现了接近无故障的安全性和效率水平。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) holds significant promise for enabling cooperative driving among Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs). However, its practical application is hindered by a critical limitation, i.e., insufficient fault tolerance against observational faults. Such faults, which appear as perturbations in the vehicles' perceived data, can substantially compromise the performance of MARL-based driving systems. Addressing this problem presents two primary challenges. One is to generate adversarial perturbations that effectively stress the policy during training, and the other is to equip vehicles with the capability to mitigate the impact of corrupted observations. To overcome the challenges, we propose a fault-tolerant MARL method for cooperative on-ramp vehicles incorporating two key agents. First, an adversarial fault injection agent is co-trained to generate perturbations that actively challenge and harden the vehicle policies. Second, we design a novel fault-tolerant vehicle agent equipped with a self-diagnosis capability, which leverages the inherent spatio-temporal correlations in vehicle state sequences to detect faults and reconstruct credible observations, thereby shielding the policy from misleading inputs. Experiments in a simulated highway merging scenario demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline MARL approaches, achieving near-fault-free levels of safety and efficiency under various observation fault patterns.

Abstract: Complex and even chaotic dynamics, though prevalent in many natural and engineered systems, has been largely avoided in the design of electromechanical systems due to concerns about wear and controlability. Here, we demonstrate that complex dynamics might be particularly advantageous in soft robotics, offering new functionalities beyond motion not easily achievable with traditional actuation methods. We designed and realized resilient magnetic soft actuators capable of operating in a tunable dynamic regime for tens of thousands cycles without fatigue. We experimentally demonstrated the application of these actuators for true random number generation and stochastic computing. {W}e validate soft robots as physical reservoirs capable of performing Mackey--Glass time series prediction. These findings show that exploring the complex dynamics in soft robotics would extend the application scenarios in soft computing, human-robot interaction and collaborative robots as we demonstrate with biomimetic blinking and randomized voice modulation.

Conclusion: 该论文通过数据驱动的交通微仿真框架，成功在CARLA中重建了真实世界的交通波动态，为评估交通控制策略和感知驱动的自主性提供了新颖的共仿真框架。

Abstract: This paper introduces a data-driven traffic microsimulation framework in CARLA that reconstructs real-world wave dynamics using high-fidelity time-space data from the I-24 MOTION testbed. Calibration of road networks in microsimulators to reproduce ephemeral phenomena such as traffic waves for large-scale simulation is a process that is fraught with challenges. This work reconsiders the existence of the traffic state data as boundary conditions on an ego vehicle moving through previously recorded traffic data, rather than reproducing those traffic phenomena in a calibrated microsim. Our approach is to autogenerate a 1 mile highway segment corresponding to I-24, and use the I-24 data to power a cosimulation module that injects traffic information into the simulation. The CARLA and cosimulation simulations are centered around an ego vehicle sampled from the empirical data, with autogeneration of "visible" traffic within the longitudinal range of the ego vehicle. Boundary control beyond these visible ranges is achieved using ghost cells behind (upstream) and ahead (downstream) of the ego vehicle. Unlike prior simulation work that focuses on local car-following behavior or abstract geometries, our framework targets full time-space diagram fidelity as the validation objective. Leveraging CARLA's rich sensor suite and configurable vehicle dynamics, we simulate wave formation and dissipation in both low-congestion and high-congestion scenarios for qualitative analysis. The resulting emergent behavior closely mirrors that of real traffic, providing a novel cosimulation framework for evaluating traffic control strategies, perception-driven autonomy, and future deployment of wave mitigation solutions. Our work bridges microscopic modeling with physical experimental data, enabling the first perceptually realistic, boundary-driven simulation of empirical traffic wave phenomena in CARLA.

Abstract: Safe and trustworthy Human Robot Interaction (HRI) requires robots not only to complete tasks but also to regulate impedance and speed according to scene context and human proximity. We present SafeHumanoid, an egocentric vision pipeline that links Vision Language Models (VLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to schedule impedance and velocity parameters for a humanoid robot. Egocentric frames are processed by a structured VLM prompt, embedded and matched against a curated database of validated scenarios, and mapped to joint-level impedance commands via inverse kinematics. We evaluate the system on tabletop manipulation tasks with and without human presence, including wiping, object handovers, and liquid pouring. The results show that the pipeline adapts stiffness, damping, and speed profiles in a context-aware manner, maintaining task success while improving safety. Although current inference latency (up to 1.4 s) limits responsiveness in highly dynamic settings, SafeHumanoid demonstrates that semantic grounding of impedance control is a viable path toward safer, standard-compliant humanoid collaboration.

Abstract: The increasing industrial demand for alternative actuators over conventional electromagnetism-based systems having limited efficiency, bulky size, complex design due to in-built gear-train mechanisms, and high production and amortization costs necessitates the innovation in new actuator development. Integrating bio-inspired design principles into linear actuators could bring forth the next generation of adaptive and energy efficient smart material-based actuation systems. The present study amalgamates the advantages of bipenniform architecture, which generates high force in the given physiological region and a high power-to-weight ratio of shape memory alloy (SMA), into a novel bio-inspired SMA-based linear actuator. A mathematical model of a multi-layered bipenniform configuration-based SMA actuator was developed and validated experimentally. The current research also caters to the incorporation of failure mitigation strategies using design failure mode and effects analysis along with the experimental assessment of the performance of the developed actuator. The system has been benchmarked against an industry-developed stepper motor-driven actuator. It has shown promising results generating an actuation force of 257 N with 15 V input voltage, meeting the acceptable range for actuation operation. It further exhibits about 67% reduction in the weight of the drive mechanism, with 80% lesser component, 32% cost reduction, and 19% energy savings and similar envelope dimensions for assembly compatibility with dampers and louvers for easy onsite deployment. The study introduces SMA coil-based actuator as an advanced design that can be deployed for high force-high stroke applications. The bio-inspired SMA-based linear actuator has applications ranging from building automation controls to lightweight actuation systems for space robotics and medical prosthesis.

Abstract: To support the circular economy, robotic systems must not only assemble new products but also disassemble end-of-life (EOL) ones for reuse, recycling, or safe disposal. Existing approaches to disassembly sequence planning often assume deterministic and fully observable product models, yet real EOL products frequently deviate from their initial designs due to wear, corrosion, or undocumented repairs. We argue that disassembly should therefore be formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), which naturally captures uncertainty about the product's internal state. We present a mathematical formulation of disassembly as a POMDP, in which hidden variables represent uncertain structural or physical properties. Building on this formulation, we propose a task and motion planning framework that automatically derives specific POMDP models from CAD data, robot capabilities, and inspection results. To obtain tractable policies, we approximate this formulation with a reinforcement-learning approach that operates on stochastic action outcomes informed by inspection priors, while a Bayesian filter continuously maintains beliefs over latent EOL conditions during execution. Using three products on two robotic systems, we demonstrate that this probabilistic planning framework outperforms deterministic baselines in terms of average disassembly time and variance, generalizes across different robot setups, and successfully adapts to deviations from the CAD model, such as missing or stuck parts.

Abstract: In an age where sustainability is of paramount importance, the significance of both high-performance computing and intelligent algorithms cannot be understated. Yet, these domains often demand hefty computational power, translating to substantial energy usage and potentially sidelining less robust computing systems. It's evident that we need an approach that is more encompassing, scalable, and eco-friendly for intelligent algorithm development and implementation. The strategy we present in this paper offers a compelling answer to these issues. We unveil a fresh framework that seamlessly melds high-performance cluster computing with intelligent algorithms, all within a blockchain infrastructure. This promotes both efficiency and a broad-based participation. At its core, our design integrates an evolved proof-of-work consensus process, which links computational efforts directly to rewards for producing blocks. This ensures both optimal resource use and participation from a wide spectrum of computational capacities. Additionally, our approach incorporates a dynamic 'trust rating' that evolves based on a track record of accurate block validations. This rating determines the likelihood of a node being chosen for block generation, creating a merit-based system that recognizes and rewards genuine and precise contributions. To level the playing field further, we suggest a statistical 'draw' system, allowing even less powerful nodes a chance to be part of the block creation process.

Motivation: 研究动机是重新审视两种分布式计算基本模型之间的关系，明确基于轮次的抽象在异步计算中的表达能力。

Method: 研究方法是通过双向模拟AMP_f和HO_f之间的中间模型来捕捉沉默的概念。

Result: 研究结果表明，对于n > 2f的无色任务，两种模型等价；有色任务仅在f = 1时等价。随机协议的结果表明，规范轮次的表达限制是结构性的。

Conclusion: 论文结论是，对于无色任务，当n > 2f时，AMP_f和HO_f模型在可解性上是等价的；而对于有色任务，仅当f = 1（且n > 2）时等价。分离现象源于HO_f中沉默进程的存在，可能导致决策不兼容。

Abstract: We revisit the relationship between two fundamental models of distributed computation: the asynchronous message-passing model with up to $f$ crash failures ($\operatorname{AMP}_f$) and the Heard-Of model with up to $f$ message omissions ($\operatorname{HO}_f$). We show that for $n > 2f$, the two models are equivalent with respect to the solvability of colorless tasks, and that for colored tasks the equivalence holds only when $f = 1$ (and $n > 2$). The separation for larger $f$ arises from the presence of silenced processes in $\operatorname{HO}_f$, which may lead to incompatible decisions. The proofs proceed through bidirectional simulations between $\operatorname{AMP}_f$ and $\operatorname{HO}_f$ via an intermediate model that captures this notion of silencing. The results extend to randomized protocols against a non-adaptive adversary, indicating that the expressive limits of canonical rounds are structural rather than probabilistic. Together, these results delineate precisely where round-based abstractions capture asynchronous computation, and where they do not.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在在线服务和离线工作负载中的部署日益增多，但直接在P/D解耦系统中共享资源会导致严重的负载不平衡。现有动态调整技术无法应对在线服务的突发流量模式。

Method: 1. 采用基于瓶颈的调度器，结合Roofline性能模型进行调度；2. 引入快速抢占机制，严格保障在线请求的SLO。

Result: 实验结果表明，与现有离线系统方法相比，该方法将离线吞吐量提高了3倍，同时保持了在线请求的SLO。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种基于延迟约束的解耦架构，通过将集群资源分为延迟严格和延迟宽松的池，有效缓解了P/D不平衡问题，同时保持了在线服务的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in both latency-sensitive online services and cost-sensitive offline workloads. Co-locating these workloads on shared serving instances can improve resource utilization, but directly applying this approach to Prefill/Decode (P/D) disaggregated systems introduces severe load imbalance, as fluctuating request mixes alter the intrinsic P/D ratio. Existing dynamic adjustment techniques cannot keep up with the bursty traffic patterns of online services.
  We propose a latency-constraint disaggregated architecture, which separates cluster resources into latency-strict and latency-relaxed pools based on task latency requirements. This design enables flexible placement of offline decode tasks, mitigating P/D imbalance while preserving online performance. To fully exploit this flexibility, we propose (1) a bottleneck-based scheduler guided by a Roofline-based performance model for performance bottleneck based scheduling, and (2) a fast preemption mechanism that strictly enforces Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for online requests.
  Experiments on real-world traces show that compared to existing offline system approaches, our method improves offline throughput by up to 3x, while maintaining online request SLOs.

Result: 相比次优算法S3-FIFO，Clock2Q+在元数据追踪中降低28.5%的缺失率，并在数据追踪中同样表现优异。

Conclusion: Clock2Q+是一种专为元数据缓存设计的缓存替换算法，通过引入关联窗口显著降低了误判热块的概率，并在实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Cache replacement algorithms are critical building blocks of storage systems. This paper examines the characteristics of metadata caches and argues that they inherently exhibit correlated references, even when the corresponding data accesses do not contain correlated references. The presence of correlated references reduces the effectiveness of cache replacement algorithms because these references are often mistakenly categorized as hot blocks. Clock2Q+ is specifically designed for metadata caches and has been implemented in vSAN and VDFS, two flagship storage products of VMware by Broadcom. Similar to S3-FIFO, Clock2Q+ uses three queues; however, Clock2Q+ introduces a correlation window in the Small FIFO queue, where blocks in this window do not set the reference bit. This simple enhancement allows Clock2Q+ to outperform state-of-the-art replacement algorithms. Compared to S3-FIFO, the second-best performing algorithm, Clock2Q+ achieves up to a 28.5% lower miss ratio on metadata traces. Clock2Q+ possesses the essential properties required for large-scale storage systems: it has low CPU overhead on cache hits, low memory overhead, scales efficiently to multiple CPUs, and is both easy to tune and implement. Additionally, Clock2Q+ outperforms state-of-the-art cache replacement algorithms on data traces as well.

TL;DR: ZipperChain通过中心化构建区块，避免分布式共识的性能问题，实现高速交易处理和快速区块确认，无需代币激励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式账本技术（DLTs）依赖分布式共识机制，但其性能受限于节点间的网络通信。ZipperChain旨在解决这一性能瓶颈，同时保证交易数据的不可变性、一致性和可用性。

Method: ZipperChain采用由少量节点组成的专用服务管道构建区块，这些节点通过快速数据中心网络连接，将信任从广泛使用的第三方服务转移到ZipperChain的正确性保证上。

Result: ZipperChain的交易吞吐量接近网络线路速度，区块最终性约为500毫秒，且无需依赖原生代币激励。

Conclusion: ZipperChain通过中心化构建区块的方式，避免了分布式共识的性能限制，实现了接近网络线路速度的交易吞吐量和500毫秒级的区块最终性，且无需原生代币激励验证者社区。

Abstract: Distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) rely on distributed consensus mechanisms to reach agreement over the order of transactions and to provide immutability and availability of transaction data. Distributed consensus suffers from performance limitations of network communication between participating nodes. BLOCKY ZipperChain guarantees immutability, agreement, and availability of transaction data, but without relying on distributed consensus. Instead, its construction process transfers trust from widely-used, third-party services onto ZipperChains's correctness guarantees. ZipperChain blocks are built by a pipeline of specialized services deployed on a small number of nodes connected by a fast data center network. As a result, ZipperChain transaction throughput approaches network line speeds and block finality is on the order of 500 ms. Finally, ZipperChain infrastructure creates blocks centrally and so does not need a native token to incentivize a community of verifiers.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 研究发现，在多语言复制数据系统中，使用通用数据格式（CDF）比外部函数接口（FFI）在软件质量和性能上更具优势，为设计RDL提供了新方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了填补关于多语言环境中RDL集成的软件质量和性能特征的知识空白。

Method: 我们进行了一项实证研究，比较了两种关键策略：外部函数接口（FFI）和通用数据格式（CDF），测量并比较了它们的软件指标和性能。

Result: 结果显示，采用CDF进行跨语言交互在软件质量、延迟、内存消耗和吞吐量方面具有优势。我们通过创建基于CDF的RDL并增强其插件扩展性来验证这些发现。

Conclusion: 现代分布式系统使用多种语言时，我们的研究结果为多语言复制数据系统中设计RDL提供了新的见解。

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Modern distributed systems replicate data across multiple execution sites. Business requirements and resource constraints often necessitate mixing different languages across replica sites. To facilitate the management of replicated data, modern software engineering practices integrate special-purpose replicated data libraries (RDLs) that provide read-write access to the data and ensure its synchronization. Irrespective of the implementation languages, an RDL typically uses a single language or offers bindings to a designated one. Hence, integrating existing RDLs in multilingual environments requires special-purpose code, whose software quality and performance characteristics are poorly understood.
  AIMS: We aim to bridge this knowledge gap to understand the software quality and performance characteristics of RDL integration in multilingual environments.
  METHOD: We conduct an empirical study of two key strategies for integrating RDLs in the context of multilingual replicated data systems: foreign-function interface (FFI) and a common data format (CDF); we measure and compare their respective software metrics and performance to understand their suitability for the task at hand.
  RESULTS: Our results reveal that adopting CDF for cross-language interaction offers software quality, latency, memory consumption, and throughput advantages. We further validate our findings by (1) creating a CDF-based RDL for mixing compiled, interpreted, and managed languages; and (2) enhancing our RDL with plug-in extensibility that enables adding functionality in a single language while maintaining integration within a multilingual environment.
  CONCLUSIONS: With modern distributed systems utilizing multiple languages, our findings provide novel insights for designing RDLs in multilingual replicated data systems.

TL;DR: PAT是一种前缀感知的注意力核实现，通过优化共享前缀的处理，显著提升LLM解码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有注意力实现无法充分利用请求间的共享前缀，导致内存带宽压力增加和资源浪费。

Method: 采用pack-forward-merge范式，通过打包共享前缀的查询、定制多瓦片核、多流转发和KV分割来优化执行。

Result: PAT平均减少注意力延迟67.4%，TPOT提升13.6-83.4%。

Conclusion: PAT通过其前缀感知的注意力核实现，显著提升了LLM解码阶段的效率，减少了内存带宽压力，并在实际和合成工作负载中表现出色。

Abstract: LLM serving is increasingly dominated by decode attention, which is a memory-bound operation due to massive KV cache loading from global memory. Meanwhile, real-world workloads exhibit substantial, hierarchical shared prefixes across requests (e.g., system prompts, tools/templates, RAG). Existing attention implementations fail to fully exploit prefix sharing: *one-query-per-CTA* execution repeatedly loads shared prefix KV cache, while *one-size-fits-all* tiling leaves on-chip resources idle and exacerbates bubbles for uneven KV lengths. These choices amplify memory bandwidth pressure and stall memory-bound decode attention.
  This paper introduces PAT, a prefix-aware attention kernel implementation for LLM decoding that organizes execution with a pack-forward-merge paradigm. PAT packs queries by shared prefix to reduce repeated memory accesses, runs a customized multi-tile kernel to achieve high resource efficiency. It further applies practical multi-stream forwarding and KV splitting to reduce resource bubbles. The final merge performs online softmax with negligible overhead. We implement PAT as an off-the-shelf plugin for vLLM. Evaluation on both real-world and synthetic workloads shows that PAT reduces attention latency by 67.4% on average and TPOT by 13.6-83.4% under the same configurations against state-of-the-art attention kernels.

Motivation: 探索在有限信息交换下的最优容错协议，以降低传统“全信息”方法的高消息成本。

Method: 研究了几种文献中的有限信息交换模型，包括FloodSet协议及其变体，并引入了一种新的信息交换方式，该方式在决策延迟和计算成本之间取得了平衡。

Result: 为每种考虑的信息交换模型推导出最优协议，新引入的信息交换方式在决策延迟和计算成本上优于Dwork和Moses的最优协议。

Conclusion: 本文通过知识基础程序的实现，为每种有限信息交换模型导出了最优协议，尤其在崩溃故障模型中解决了同时协议问题。

Abstract: Work on the development of optimal fault-tolerant Agreement protocols using the logic of knowledge has concentrated on the "full information" approach to information exchange, which is costly with respect to message size. Alpturer, Halpern, and van der Meyden (PODC 2023) introduced the notion of optimality with respect to a limited information exchange, and studied the Eventual Agreement problem in the sending omissions failure model. The present paper studies the Simultaneous Agreement problem for the crash failures model, and a number of limited information exchanges from the literature. In particular, the paper considers information exchanges from a FloodSet protocol (Lynch, Distributed Algorithms 1996), a variant of this in which agents also count the number of failures (Castañeda et al, NETYS 2017), and a variant in which agents associate each agent with a value (Raynal, PRDC 2002). A new information exchange is also introduced that enables decisions to be made at worst one round later than the optimal protocol of Dwork and Moses (I&C 88), but with lower computation cost and space requirements. By determining implementations of a knowledge based program, protocols are derived that are optimal amongst protocols for each of these information exchanges.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在现代AI应用中广泛使用，但其大规模服务系统面临计算密集、延迟严格和吞吐瓶颈等挑战。

Method: OmniInfer整合了OmniPlacement、OmniAttn和OmniProxy三个组件，通过自适应资源解耦、高效稀疏性利用和全局协调优化服务效率。

Result: 在10节点Ascend 910C集群上测试，OmniInfer实现了616 QPM，TPOT降低36%，TTFT进一步减少38%。

Conclusion: OmniInfer通过细粒度的专家放置、缓存压缩和调度优化，显著提升了大型语言模型的服务效率，并在实际测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Large Language Models drive a wide range of modern AI applications but impose substantial challenges on large-scale serving systems due to intensive computation, strict latency constraints, and throughput bottlenecks. We introduce OmniInfer, a unified system-level acceleration framework designed to maximize end-to-end serving efficiency through fine-grained optimization of expert placement, cache compression, and scheduling. OmniInfer integrates three complementary components: OmniPlacement for load-aware Mixture-of-Experts scheduling, OmniAttn for sparse attention acceleration, and OmniProxy for disaggregation-aware request scheduling. Built atop vLLM, OmniInfer delivers system-wide performance gains through adaptive resource disaggregation, efficient sparsity exploitation, and global coordination across prefill and decode phases. Evaluated on DeepSeek-R1 within a 10-node Ascend 910C cluster, OmniInfer achieves 616 QPM, where the unified framework reduces TPOT by 36\%, and the superimposition of OmniProxy further slashes TTFT by 38\%.

TL;DR: DisCEdge 是一个分布式上下文管理系统，通过令牌化存储用户上下文，显著提升边缘部署的 LLM 服务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLM）在边缘部署时因无状态特性导致的用户上下文管理挑战，避免现有方案（如客户端存储）带来的网络延迟和带宽开销。

Method: 提出并实现了一个分布式上下文管理系统 DisCEdge，采用令牌化形式存储和复制用户上下文，避免了冗余计算。

Result: 在真实边缘环境中，DisCEdge 将中位响应时间提升高达 14.46%，中位节点间同步开销降低 15%，客户端请求大小中位减少 90%。

Conclusion: DisCEdge 通过将用户上下文以令牌化形式存储和复制，显著提升了边缘部署的效率和性能，同时保证了数据一致性。

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Model (LLM) services at the edge benefits latency-sensitive and privacy-aware applications. However, the stateless nature of LLMs makes managing user context (e.g., sessions, preferences) across geo-distributed edge nodes challenging. Existing solutions, such as client-side context storage, often introduce network latency and bandwidth overhead, undermining the advantages of edge deployment.
  We propose DisCEdge, a distributed context management system that stores and replicates user context in tokenized form across edge nodes. By maintaining context as token sequences rather than raw text, our system avoids redundant computation and enables efficient data replication. We implement and evaluate an open-source prototype in a realistic edge environment with commodity hardware. We show DisCEdge improves median response times by up to 14.46% and lowers median inter-node synchronization overhead by up to 15% compared to a raw-text-based system. It also reduces client request sizes by a median of 90% compared to client-side context management, while guaranteeing data consistency.

TL;DR: RT-MMC是一种利用现代GPU上的光线追踪核心（RT核心）硬件加速的MMC算法，通过NVIDIA OptiX平台实现，显著提升了模拟速度，简化了工作流程，适用于广泛的生物光子学应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管在图形处理单元（GPU）上实现了显著的加速，但基于网格的蒙特卡罗（MMC）方法的性能仍受到频繁的射线边界交叉测试计算成本的限制。

Method: 通过NVIDIA的OptiX平台实现，RT-MMC将图形光线追踪流程扩展到浑浊介质中的体积光线追踪，消除了具有挑战性的四面体网格生成需求，同时通过硬件加速提供了显著的性能提升。它还内在支持宽场源，无需复杂的网格重新分割。

Result: RT-MMC与传统软件光线追踪MMC算法表现出极佳的一致性，同时在多种GPU架构上实现了1.5倍至4.5倍的加速。这些性能提升显著增强了MMC在常规模拟中的实用性。

Conclusion: 迁移从软件到硬件的光线追踪不仅大大简化了MMC模拟工作流程，还带来了显著的加速效果，预计随着光线追踪硬件的快速普及，这一优势将进一步增强。在定量MMC模拟中采用图形光线追踪流程，能够利用新兴硬件资源，并惠及广泛的生物光子学应用。

Abstract: Significance: Monte Carlo (MC) methods are the gold-standard for modeling light-tissue interactions due to their accuracy. Mesh-based MC (MMC) offers enhanced precision for complex tissue structures using tetrahedral mesh models. Despite significant speedups achieved on graphics processing units (GPUs), MMC performance remains hindered by the computational cost of frequent ray-boundary intersection tests.
  Aim: We propose a highly accelerated MMC algorithm, RT-MMC, that leverages the hardware-accelerated ray traversal and intersection capabilities of ray-tracing cores (RT-cores) on modern GPUs.
  Approach: Implemented using NVIDIA's OptiX platform, RT-MMC extends graphics ray-tracing pipelines towards volumetric ray-tracing in turbid media, eliminating the need for challenging tetrahedral mesh generation while delivering significant speed improvements through hardware acceleration. It also intrinsically supports wide-field sources without complex mesh retesselation.
  Results: RT-MMC demonstrates excellent agreement with traditional software-ray-tracing MMC algorithms while achieving 1.5x to 4.5x speedups across multiple GPU architectures. These performance gains significantly enhance the practicality of MMC for routine simulations.
  Conclusion: Migration from software- to hardware-based ray-tracing not only greatly simplifies MMC simulation workflows, but also results in significant speedups that are expected to increase further as ray-tracing hardware rapidly gains adoption. Adoption of graphics ray-tracing pipelines in quantitative MMC simulations enables leveraging of emerging hardware resources and benefits a wide range of biophotonics applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有服务系统在异构适配器共批处理时未考虑秩（大小）变异性，导致性能偏差和GPU资源未充分利用。

Method: LoRAServe是一个基于工作负载感知的动态适配器放置和路由框架，通过动态重新平衡适配器分布和利用GPU Direct RDMA实现远程访问。

Result: 在生产环境中，LoRAServe实现了高达2倍的吞吐量提升，9倍的首令牌时间（TTFT）降低，并在SLO约束下减少了50%的GPU使用。

Conclusion: LoRAServe通过动态平衡适配器分布和利用GPU Direct RDMA远程访问，显著提升了吞吐量并降低了尾延迟，同时减少了GPU使用量。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become the de facto method for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), enabling rapid adaptation to diverse domains. In production, LoRA-based models are served at scale, creating multi-tenant environments with hundreds of adapters sharing a base model. However, state-of-the-art serving systems co-batch heterogeneous adapters without accounting for rank (size) variability, leading to severe performance skew, which ultimately requires adding more GPUs to satisfy service-level objectives (SLOs). Existing optimizations, focused on loading, caching, and kernel execution, ignore this heterogeneity, leaving GPU resources underutilized. We present LoRAServe, a workload-aware dynamic adapter placement and routing framework designed to tame rank diversity in LoRA serving. By dynamically rebalancing adapters across GPUs and leveraging GPU Direct RDMA for remote access, LoRAServe maximizes throughput and minimizes tail latency under real-world workload drift. Evaluations on production traces from Company X show that LoRAServe elicits up to 2$\times$ higher throughput, up to 9$\times$ lower TTFT, while using up to 50% fewer GPUs under SLO constraints compared to state-of-the-art systems.

TL;DR: Areon是一种基于DAG的多提议者PoS协议，通过并行投票和CCA-local fork选择实现快速确认，模拟显示其优于传统链式协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统链式共识协议在高延迟和部分同步网络中的性能瓶颈，通过DAG结构实现并行投票和快速确认。

Method: 提出了Areon-Ideal和Areon-Base两种协议，前者理想化抽象网络延迟和引用限制，后者增加了VRF资格、引用限制及块级有效性检查。

Result: 在离散事件模拟中，Areon-Base在对抗性股权和网络延迟下表现出更低的重组频率和深度，实现了有限延迟的最终性。

Conclusion: Areon协议家族通过多提议者和DAG结构，在部分同步条件下实现了稳健性，并通过CCA-local的fork选择机制和Tip-Boundedness结构保证了快速聚合和有限宽度的前沿。

Abstract: We present Areon, a family of latency-friendly, stake-weighted, multi-proposer proof-of-stake consensus protocols. By allowing multiple proposers per slot and organizing blocks into a directed acyclic graph (DAG), Areon achieves robustness under partial synchrony. Blocks reference each other within a sliding window, forming maximal antichains that represent parallel ``votes'' on history. Conflicting subDAGs are resolved by a closest common ancestor (CCA)-local, window-filtered fork choice that compares the weight of each subDAG -- the number of recent short references -- and prefers the heavier one. Combined with a structural invariant we call Tip-Boundedness (TB), this yields a bounded-width frontier and allows honest work to aggregate quickly.
  We formalize an idealized protocol (Areon-Ideal) that abstracts away network delay and reference bounds, and a practical protocol (Areon-Base) that adds VRF-based eligibility, bounded short and long references, and application-level validity and conflict checks at the block level. On top of DAG analogues of the classical common-prefix, chain-growth, and chain-quality properties, we prove a backbone-style $(k,\varepsilon)$-finality theorem that calibrates confirmation depth as a function of the window length and target tail probability. We focus on consensus at the level of blocks; extending the framework to richer transaction selection, sampling, and redundancy policies is left to future work.
  Finally, we build a discrete-event simulator and compare Areon-Base against a chain-based baseline (Ouroboros Praos) under matched block-arrival rates. Across a wide range of adversarial stakes and network delays, Areon-Base achieves bounded-latency finality with consistently lower reorganization frequency and depth.

Motivation: 解决分割学习（SL）中计算和通信过程顺序执行导致的系统效率限制。

Method: 提出通信-计算管道并行分割学习（C$^2$P$^2$SL），通过将通信和计算过程视为整体管道，实现微批次间的并行化。

Result: 实验表明，C$^2$P$^2$SL将系统训练时间减少超过38%，且在不同通信条件下保持收敛精度。

Conclusion: C$^2$P$^2$SL通过管道并行化显著减少了训练时间，同时保持了收敛精度，适用于不同通信条件。

Abstract: Split learning (SL) offloads main computing tasks from multiple resource-constrained user equippments (UEs) to the base station (BS), while preserving local data privacy. However, its computation and communication processes remain sequential, resulting in limited system efficiency. To overcome this limitation, this paper applies pipeline parallelism (PP) of distributed training to SL in wireless networks, proposing the so-called communication-computation pipeline parallel split learning (C$^2$P$^2$SL). By considering the communicating and computing processes of UEs and BS as an overall pipeline, C$^2$P$^2$SL achieves pipeline parallelization among different micro-batches which are split from each batch of data samples. The overlap of communication and computation in this way significantly reduces the total training time. Given that training efficiency is affected by position of cutting layer and heterogeneity of the UEs, we formulate a joint optimization problem of task split and resource allocation, and design a solution based on alternating optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that C$^2$P$^2$SL significantly reduces system training time by over 38\% while maintaining convergence accuracy under different communication conditions.

Motivation: 研究动机源于Censor-Hillel等人提出的内容无关模型，该模型展示了在极弱通信形式下，许多自然图问题在非2边连通图中不可行。本文旨在探索在网络拓扑知识已知的情况下，领导者选举是否可行。

Method: 论文通过理论分析和算法设计，探讨了在不同网络拓扑条件下领导者选举的可能性。具体包括对对称图和非对称树结构的分析，以及在不同拓扑知识条件下的算法设计。

Result: 论文的主要结果表明：1）在对称边图中，随机终止的领导者选举算法不可行；2）非对称边的树结构中，存在终止的领导者选举算法，消息复杂度为O(n^2)；3）在仅知道网络直径的情况下，偶数直径树也可实现领导者选举，消息复杂度为O(nr)；4）拓扑知识的精确性对领导者选举的成功至关重要。

Conclusion: 该论文展示了在网络拓扑知识已知的情况下，领导者选举在多种图中是可能的，尤其是在非对称边的树结构中。同时，论文也揭示了在某些对称图中，即使拥有唯一标识符和完整的拓扑知识，随机终止的领导者选举算法也是不可能的。此外，拓扑知识的精确性对领导者选举的成功至关重要。

Abstract: The content-oblivious model, introduced by Censor-Hillel, Cohen, Gelles, and Sel (PODC 2022; Distributed Computing 2023), captures an extremely weak form of communication where nodes can only send asynchronous, content-less pulses. Censor-Hillel, Cohen, Gelles, and Sel showed that no non-constant function $f(x,y)$ can be computed correctly by two parties using content-oblivious communication over a single edge, where one party holds $x$ and the other holds $y$. This seemingly ruled out many natural graph problems on non-2-edge-connected graphs.
  In this work, we show that, with the knowledge of network topology $G$, leader election is possible in a wide range of graphs.
  Impossibility: Graphs symmetric about an edge admit no randomized terminating leader election algorithm, even when nodes have unique identifiers and full knowledge of $G$.
  Leader election algorithms: Trees that are not symmetric about any edge admit a quiescently terminating leader election algorithm with topology knowledge, even in anonymous networks, using $O(n^2)$ messages, where $n$ is the number of nodes. Moreover, even-diameter trees admit a terminating leader election given only the knowledge of the network diameter $D = 2r$, with message complexity $O(nr)$.
  Necessity of topology knowledge: In the family of graphs $\mathcal{G} = \{P_3, P_5\}$, both the 3-path $P_3$ and the 5-path $P_5$ admit a quiescently terminating leader election if nodes know the topology exactly. However, if nodes only know that the underlying topology belongs to $\mathcal{G}$, then terminating leader election is impossible.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否存在比差分隐私更弱的隐私定义，既能保证基本隐私，又能更高效或适用于更广泛的任务。

Method: 通过识别四个核心公理（预处理不变性、禁止明显非隐私、强组合性和线性可扩展性），并证明任何满足这些公理的隐私度量等同于DP。

Result: 证明在统计设置下，任何合理的隐私度量（满足四公理）等同于DP，且公理是最小化的。

Conclusion: 任何满足核心四公理的隐私度量等同于差分隐私（DP），表明在统计设置下，差分隐私是唯一合理的隐私定义。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is the de facto notion of privacy both in theory and in practice. However, despite its popularity, DP imposes strict requirements which guard against strong worst-case scenarios. For example, it guards against seemingly unrealistic scenarios where an attacker has full information about all but one point in the data set, and still nothing can be learned about the remaining point. While preventing such a strong attack is desirable, many works have explored whether average-case relaxations of DP are easier to satisfy [HWR13,WLF16,BF16,LWX23].
  In this work, we are motivated by the question of whether alternate, weaker notions of privacy are possible: can a weakened privacy notion still guarantee some basic level of privacy, and on the other hand, achieve privacy more efficiently and/or for a substantially broader set of tasks? Our main result shows the answer is no: even in the statistical setting, any reasonable measure of privacy satisfying nontrivial composition is equivalent to DP. To prove this, we identify a core set of four axioms or desiderata: pre-processing invariance, prohibition of blatant non-privacy, strong composition, and linear scalability. Our main theorem shows that any privacy measure satisfying our axioms is equivalent to DP, up to polynomial factors in sample complexity. We complement this result by showing our axioms are minimal: removing any one of our axioms enables ill-behaved measures of privacy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决snarls识别问题中现有方法的低效性（二次时间），并统一处理snarls和superbubbles的线性时间算法。

Method: 基于SPQR树分解的统一框架，通过遍历高效识别气泡状结构。

Result: 算法在多个pangenomic数据集上表现优异，识别snarls的速度比vg快两倍，计算superbubbles的速度比BubbleGun快50倍。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于SPQR树分解的统一框架，首次实现了在线性时间内识别所有snarls，并为寻找其他类似气泡结构提供了高效模板。

Abstract: Snarls and superbubbles are fundamental pangenome decompositions capturing variant sites. These bubble-like structures underpin key tasks in computational pangenomics, including structural-variant genotyping, distance indexing, haplotype sampling, and variant annotation. Snarls can be quadratically-many in the size of the graph, and since their introduction in 2018 with the vg toolkit, there has been no work on identifying all snarls in linear time. Moreover, while it is known how to find superbubbles in linear time, this result is a highly specialized solution only achieved after a long series of papers.
  We present the first algorithm identifying all snarls in linear time. This is based on a new representation of all snarls, of size linear in the input graph size, and which can be computed in linear time. Our algorithm is based on a unified framework that also provides a new linear-time algorithm for finding superbubbles. An observation behind our results is that all such structures are separated from the rest of the graph by two vertices (except for cases which are trivially computable), i.e. their endpoints are a 2-separator of the underlying undirected graph. Based on this, we employ the well-known SPQR tree decomposition, which encodes all 2-separators, to guide a traversal that finds the bubble-like structures efficiently.
  We implemented our algorithms in C++ (available at https://github.com/algbio/BubbleFinder) and evaluated them on various pangenomic datasets. Our algorithms outcompete or they are on the same level of existing methods. For snarls, we are up to two times faster than vg, while identifying all snarls. When computing superbubbles, we are up to 50 times faster than BubbleGun. Our SPQR tree framework provides a unifying perspective on bubble-like structures in pangenomics, together with a template for finding other bubble-like structures efficiently.

TL;DR: 提出MagnifierSketch算法，针对数据流中的单键和每键分位数估计问题，通过创新技术显著提升精度和吞吐量，实验验证其优越性并开源实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法在针对单一预定义分位数（如0.95或0.99分位数）的每键估计中精度和吞吐量不足，无法满足高速数据流的需求。

Method: 提出了MagnifierSketch，采用Value Focus、Distribution Calibration和Double Filtration技术，并通过严格的数学推导证明其无偏性及空间和时间复杂度。

Result: 实验结果显示MagnifierSketch的平均误差显著低于现有最优方法，且在单键和每键情况下均表现优异。

Conclusion: MagnifierSketch在单键和每键分位数估计中均表现出显著的低平均误差（AE），并通过RocksDB数据库实现降低了实际数据库中的分位数查询延迟。

Abstract: In this paper, we take into consideration quantile estimation in data stream models, where every item in the data stream is a key-value pair. Researchers sometimes aim to estimate per-key quantiles (i.e. quantile estimation for every distinct key), and some popular use cases, such as tail latency measurement, recline on a predefined single quantile (e.g. 0.95- or 0.99- quantile) rather than demanding arbitrary quantile estimation. However, existing algorithms are not specially designed for per-key estimation centered at one point. They cannot achieve high accuracy in our problem setting, and their throughput are not satisfactory to handle high-speed items in data streams. To solve this problem, we propose MagnifierSketch for point-quantile estimation. MagnifierSketch supports both single-key and per-key quantile estimation, and its key techniques are named Value Focus, Distribution Calibration and Double Filtration. We provide strict mathematical derivations to prove the unbiasedness of MagnifierSketch and show its space and time complexity. Our experimental results show that the Average Error (AE) of MagnifierSketch is significantly lower than the state-of-the-art in both single-key and per-key situations. We also implement MagnifierSketch on RocksDB database to reduce quantile query latency in real databases. All related codes of MagnifierSketch are open-sourced and available at GitHub.

Method: 通过分析118个最重要的计算机科学算法问题及其800多个解决方案，进行了广泛的空间复杂度改进调查。

Conclusion: 本文强调了空间复杂度在现代算法研究中的重要性，并指出算法进步在某些情况下比硬件进步更能减少内存访问延迟。同时，提出了算法Pareto前沿的概念，表明程序员需要根据具体问题权衡时间和空间复杂度。

Abstract: Algorithm research focuses primarily on how many operations processors need to do (time complexity). But for many problems, both the runtime and energy used are dominated by memory accesses. In this paper, we present the first broad survey of how algorithmic progress has improved memory usage (space complexity). We analyze 118 of the most important algorithm problems in computer science, reviewing the 800+ algorithms used to solve them.
  Our results show that space complexity has become much more important in recent years as worries have arisen about memory access bottle-necking performance (the ``memory wall''). In 20% of cases we find that space complexity improvements for large problems (n=1 billion) outpaced improvements in DRAM access speed, suggesting that for these problems algorithmic progress played a larger role than hardware progress in minimizing memory access delays. Increasingly, we also see the emergence of algorithmic Pareto frontiers, where getting better asymptotic time complexity for a problem requires getting worse asymptotic space complexity, and vice-versa. This tension implies that programmers will increasingly need to consider multiple algorithmic options to understand which is best for their particular problem. To help theorists and practitioners alike consider these trade-offs, we have created a reference for them at https://algorithm-wiki.csail.mit.edu.

TL;DR: 二维字符串的SLP无法同时保持小深度和大小，但带孔的2D SLP提供了解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索二维字符串是否也能像一维字符串一样，构建大小和深度高效的SLP结构以实现随机访问。

Method: 研究二维字符串的SLP构建，分析其深度和大小的关系，并引入带孔的2D SLP作为解决方案。

Result: 证明二维字符串无法在保持小深度的同时维持SLP大小；但通过带孔的2D SLP，可实现高效结构。

Conclusion: 对于二维字符串，无法构建深度为O(log N)且大小与原始SLP相近的等效SLP；但通过引入带孔的2D SLP，可以实现O(g)大小和O(log N)深度的结构，支持随机访问。

Abstract: We consider building, given a straight-line program (SLP) consisting of $g$ productions deriving a two-dimensional string $T$ of size $N\times N$, a structure capable of providing random access to any character of $T$. For one-dimensional strings, it is now known how to build a structure of size $\mathcal{O}(g)$ that provides random access in $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ time. In fact, it is known that this can be obtained by building an equivalent SLP of size $\mathcal{O}(g)$ and depth $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ [Ganardi, Jeż, Lohrey, JACM 2021]. We consider the analogous question for two-dimensional strings: can we build an equivalent SLP of roughly the same size and small depth?
  We show that the answer is negative: there exists an infinite family of two-dimensional strings of size $N\times N$ described by a 2D SLP of size $g$ such that any 2D SLP describing the same string of depth $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ must be of size $Ω(g\cdot N/\log^{3}N)$. We complement this with an upper bound showing how to construct such a 2D SLP of size $\mathcal{O}(g\cdot N)$. Next, we observe that one can naturally define a generalization of 2D SLP, which we call 2D SLP with holes. We show that a known general balancing theorem by [Ganardi, Jeż, Lohrey, JACM 2021] immediately implies that, given a 2D SLP of size $g$ deriving a string of size $N\times N$, we can construct a 2D SLP with holes of depth $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ and size $\mathcal{O}(g)$. This allows us to conclude that there is a structure of size $\mathcal{O}(g)$ providing random access in $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ time for such a 2D SLP. Further, this can be extended (analogously as for a 1D SLP) to obtain a structure of size $\mathcal{O}(g \log^εN)$ providing random access in $\mathcal{O}(\log N/\log \log N)$ time, for any $ε>0$.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于强2-着色数（s2）的数据结构，能够在稀疏图类中高效地列出和记录顶点集的迹及其频率。实验证明，该方法在大多数实际网络中都优于传统方法。

Abstract: Understanding how a vertex relates to a set of vertices is a fundamental task in graph analysis. Given a graph $G$ and a vertex set $X \subseteq V(G)$, consider the collection of subsets of the form $N(u) \cap X$ where $u$ ranges over all vertices outside $X$. These intersections, which we call the traces of $X$, capture all ways vertices in $G$ connect to $X$, and in this paper we consider the problem of listing these traces efficiently, and the related problem of recording the multiplicity (frequency) of each trace. For a given query set $X$, both problems have obvious algorithms with running time $O(|N(X)| \cdot |X|)$ and conditional lower bounds suggest that, on general graphs, one cannot expect better. However, in certain sparse graph classes, more efficient algorithms are possible: Drange \etal (IPEC 2023) used a data structure that answers trace queries in $d$-degenerate graphs with linear initialisation time and query time that only depends on the query set $X$ and $d$. However, the query time is exponential in $|X|$, which makes this approach impractical. By using a stronger parameter than degeneracy, namely the strong $2$-colouring number $s_2$, we construct a data structure in $O(d \cdot \|G\|)$ time, which answers subsequent trace frequency queries in time $O\big((d^2 + s_2^{d+2})|X|\big)$, where $\|G\|$ is the number of edges of $G$, $s_2$ is the strong $2$-colouring number and $d$ the degeneracy of a suitable ordering of $G$. We demonstrate that this data structure is indeed practical and that it beats the simple, obvious alternative in almost all tested settings, using a collection of 217 real-world networks with up to 1.1M edges. As part of this effort, we demonstrate that computing an ordering with a small strong $2$-colouring number is feasible with a simple heuristic.

TL;DR: 本文改进了时间图探索问题的时间步长上界，提出了基于平均时间最大度的统一方法，适用于多种图类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究时间图探索问题的最短路径长度，尤其是在每张图G_t连通且有界最大度的基本情况下，改进现有的理论界限。

Method: 通过引入平均时间最大度D的概念，作者证明了在每张图G_t连通的情况下，存在一个探索序列，其长度为O(n^{3/2}√(D log n))。

Result: 证明了在每张图G_t连通的情况下，存在一个探索序列，其长度为O(n^{3/2}√(D log n))，显著优于之前的O(n^{7/4})结果。

Conclusion: 本文显著改进了时间图探索问题的时间步长上界，从之前的O(n^{7/4})降至O(n^{3/2}√(log n))，并进一步推广到更一般的情况，提出了基于平均时间最大度的统一方法。

Abstract: A temporal graph $G$ is a sequence $(G_t)_{t \in I}$ of graphs on the same vertex set of size $n$. The \emph{temporal exploration problem} asks for the length of the shortest sequence of vertices that starts at a given vertex, visits every vertex, and at each time step $t$ either stays at the current vertex or moves to an adjacent vertex in $G_t$. Bounds on the length of a shortest temporal exploration have been investigated extensively. Perhaps the most fundamental case is when each graph $G_t$ is connected and has bounded maximum degree. In this setting, Erlebach, Kammer, Luo, Sajenko, and Spooner [ICALP 2019] showed that there exists an exploration of $G$ in $\mathcal{O}(n^{7/4})$ time steps. We significantly improve this bound by showing that $\mathcal{O}(n^{3/2} \sqrt{\log n})$ time steps suffice.
  In fact, we deduce this result from a much more general statement. Let the \emph{average temporal maximum degree} $D$ of $G$ be the average of $\max_{t \in I} d_{G_t}(v)$ over all vertices $v \in V(G)$, where $d_{G_t}(v)$ denotes the degree of $v$ in $G_t$. If each graph $G_t$ is connected, we show that there exists an exploration of $G$ in $\mathcal{O}(n^{3/2} \sqrt{D \log n})$ time steps. In particular, this gives the first subquadratic upper bound when the underlying graph has bounded average degree. As a special case, this also improves the previous best bounds when the underlying graph is planar or has bounded treewidth and provides a unified approach for all of these settings. Our bound is subquadratic already when $D=o(n/\log n)$.

Conclusion: 本文提出了在超图中构建容错稀疏器的快速算法，并展示了其改进的子线性大小边界。通过结合乘法EFT超稀疏器和加法超稀疏器，还提供了构建加法EFT超稀疏器的算法。

Abstract: We initiate the study on fault-tolerant spanners in hypergraphs and develop fast algorithms for their constructions. A fault-tolerant (FT) spanner preserves approximate distances under network failures, often used in applications like network design and distributed systems. While classic (fault-free) spanners are believed to be easily extended to hypergraphs such as by the method of associated graphs, we reveal that this is not the case in the fault-tolerant setting: simple methods can only get a linear size in the maximum number of faults $f$. In contrast, all known optimal size of FT spanners are sublinear in $f$. Inspired by the FT clustering technique, we propose a clustering based algorithm that achieves an improved sublinear size bound. For an $n$-node $m$-edge hypergraph with rank $r$ and a sketch parameter $k$, our algorithm constructs edge FT (EFT) hyperspanners of stretch $2k-1$ and size $O(k^2f^{1-1/(rk)}n^{1+1/k}\log n)$ with high probability in time $\widetilde{O}(mr^3+fn)$. We also establish a lower bound of $Ω(f^{1-1/r-1/rk}n^{1+1/k-o(1)})$ edges for EFT hyperspanners, which leaves a gap of poly$(k)f^{1/r}$. Finally, we provide an algorithm for constructing additive EFT hyperspanners by combining multiplicative EFT hyperspanners with additive hyperspanners. We believe that our work will spark interest in developing optimal FT spanners for hypergraphs.

Abstract: In the context of algorithm theory, various studies have been conducted on spanning trees with desirable properties. In this paper, we consider the \textsc{Minimum Cover Spanning Tree} problem (MCST for short). Given a graph $G$ and a positive integer $k$, the problem determines whether $G$ has a spanning tree with a vertex cover of size at most $k$. We reveal the equivalence between \mcst\ and the \textsc{Dominating Set} problem when $G$ is of diameter at most~$2$ or $P_5$-free. This provides the intractability for these graphs and the tractability for several subclasses of $P_5$-free graphs. We also show that \mcst\ is NP-complete for bipartite planar graphs of maximum degree~$4$ and unit disk graphs. These hardness results resolve open questions posed in prior research. Finally, we present an FPT algorithm for {\mcst} parameterized by clique-width and a linear-time algorithm for interval graphs.

Abstract: This paper investigates the reconfiguration variant of the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), referred to as the Reconfiguration CSP (RCSP). Given a CSP instance and two of its solutions, RCSP asks whether one solution can be transformed into the other via a sequence of intermediate solutions, each differing by the assignment of a single variable. RCSP has attracted growing interest in theoretical computer science, and when the variable domain is Boolean, the computational complexity of RCSP exhibits a dichotomy depending on the allowed constraint types. A notable special case is the reconfiguration of graph homomorphisms -- also known as graph recoloring -- which has been studied using topological methods. We propose a novel algebraic approach to RCSP, inspired by techniques used in classical CSP complexity analysis. Unlike traditional methods based on total operations, our framework employs partial operations to capture a reduction involving equality constraints. This perspective facilitates the extension of complexity results from Boolean domains to more general settings, demonstrating the versatility of partial operations in identifying tractable RCSP instances.

Abstract: In the solution discovery problem for a search problem on graphs, we are given an initial placement of $k$ tokens on the vertices of a graph and asked whether this placement can be transformed into a feasible solution by applying a small number of modifications. In this paper, we study the computational complexity of solution discovery for several fundamental vertex-subset problems on graphs, namely Vertex Cover Discovery, Independent Set Discovery, Dominating Set Discovery, and Feedback Vertex Set Discovery. We first present XP algorithms for all four problems parameterized by clique-width. We then prove that Vertex Cover Discovery, Independent Set Discovery, and Feedback Vertex Set Discovery are NP-complete for chordal graphs and graphs of diameter 2, which have unbounded clique-width. In contrast to these hardness results, we show that all three problems can be solved in polynomial time on split graphs. Furthermore, we design an FPT algorithm for Feedback Vertex Set Discovery parameterized by the number of tokens.

Motivation: 解决在线多级聚合问题中现有算法竞争比过高的问题，通过引入更优的参数（如毛虫维度）来提升性能。

Method: 提出了两种竞争算法：一种是基于树深度（D）的e(D+1)-competitive算法，另一种是基于毛虫维度（H）的e(4H+2)-competitive算法。

Result: 提出的算法在毛虫维度较小（H = o(min{D, log2|V|})）时，显著优于现有最优算法（6(D+1)-competitive和O(log|V|)-competitive）。

Conclusion: 本文提出了改进和参数化的在线多级聚合问题（MLAP-D）算法，通过引入树的毛虫维度（H）作为参数，显著提升了算法的竞争比，优于现有最优算法。

Abstract: We study the online multi-level aggregation problem with deadlines (MLAP-D) introduced by Bienkowski et al. (ESA 2016, OR 2020). In this problem, requests arrive over time at the vertices of a given vertex-weighted tree, and each request has a deadline that it must be served by. The cost of serving a request equals the cost of a path from the root to the vertex where the request resides. Instead of serving each request individually, requests can be aggregated and served by transmitting a subtree from the root that spans the vertices on which the requests reside, to potentially be more cost-effective. The aggregated cost is the weight of the transmission subtree. The goal of MLAP-D is to find an aggregation solution that minimizes the total cost while serving all requests.
  We present improved and parameterized algorithms for MLAP-D. Our result is twofold. First, we present an $e(D+1)$-competitive algorithm where $D$ is the depth of the tree. Second, we present an $e(4H+2)$-competitive algorithm where $H$ is the caterpillar dimension of the tree. Here, $H \le D$ and $H \le \log_2 |V|$ where $|V|$ is the number of vertices in the given tree. The caterpillar dimension remains constant for rich but simple classes of trees, such as line graphs ($H=1$), caterpillar graphs ($H=2$), and lobster graphs ($H=3$). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first online algorithm parameterized on a measure better than depth. The state-of-the-art online algorithms are $6(D+1)$-competitive by Buchbinder, Feldman, Naor, and Talmon (SODA 2017) and $O(\log |V|)$-competitive by Azar and Touitou (FOCS 2020). Our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art ratios when $H = o(\min\{D,\log_2 |V|\})$. Our simple framework directly applies to trees with any structure and differs from the previous frameworks that reduce the problem to trees with specific structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于传统代数性质测试（如线性度和群同态）在对抗性或动态环境中的局限性，因为这些测试假设无噪声和无限制的数据访问。

Method: 论文采用了一种称为'随机符号测试'（Random Signs Test）的方法，通过引入更多随机性（随机选择每个元素的符号）将已知的操纵鲁棒性线性测试器推广到一般的群域和群值域。

Result: 论文的主要结果是开发了一个查询复杂度为O(1/ε + log t)的测试器，能够恢复标准属性测试模型中的O(1/ε)界限，并针对特定群族获得了改进的查询界限。

Conclusion: 该论文的主要结论是提出了一个最优的测试器，能够在在线操纵模型中实现对群同态的鲁棒性测试，其查询复杂度为O(1/ε + log t)，其中ε是距离参数，t是每个查询中对手可以擦除或破坏的函数值数量。

Abstract: A central challenge in property testing is verifying algebraic structure with minimal access to data. A landmark result addressing this challenge, the linearity test of Blum, Luby, and Rubinfeld (JCSS `93), spurred a rich body of work on testing algebraic properties such as linearity and its generalizations to low-degree polynomials and group homomorphisms. However, classical tests for these properties assume unrestricted, noise-free access to the input function--an assumption that breaks down in adversarial or dynamic settings. To address this, Kalemaj, Raskhodnikova, and Varma (Theory of Computing `23) introduced the online manipulation model, where an adversary may erase or corrupt query responses over time, based on the tester's past queries.
  We initiate the study of {manipulation-resilient} testing for {group homomorphism} in this online model. Our main result is an {optimal} tester that makes $O(1/\varepsilon+\log t)$ queries, where $\varepsilon$ is the distance parameter and $t$ is the number of function values the adversary can erase or corrupt per query. Our result recovers the celebrated $O(1/\varepsilon)$ bound by Ben-Or, Coppersmith, Luby, and Rubinfeld (Random Struct.\ Algorithms `08) for homomorphism testing in the standard property testing model, albeit with a different tester. Our tester, $\mathsf{Random\ Signs\ Test}$, {lifts} known manipulation-resilient linearity testers for $\mathbb{F}_2^n\to \mathbb{F}_2$ to general group domains and codomains by introducing more randomness: instead of verifying the homomorphism condition for a sum of random elements, it uses additions and subtractions of random elements, randomly selecting a sign for each element. We also obtain improved group-specific query bounds for key families of groups.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于LLM的多语言代码重构框架，通过提示工程和少量学习优化重构效果，Java和Python在不同指标上表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有重构方法在多语言和编码风格上的泛化能力有限，通常依赖手动编写的转换规则。

Method: 提出了一个基于提示工程和少量学习的微调模型，用于多语言代码重构。

Result: 实验结果显示，Java在10-shot设置下表现最佳，Python在所有shot中结构距离最低。

Conclusion: Java在10-shot设置下表现出最高的整体正确性（99.99%），平均可编译性（94.78%）和相似性（约53-54%），展示了结构修改与语义保留的平衡。Python在所有shot中表现出最低的结构距离（约277-294）和中等的相似性（约44-48%），表明其重构过程一致且破坏性最小。

Abstract: In today's world, the focus of programmers has shifted from writing complex, error-prone code to prioritizing simple, clear, efficient, and sustainable code that makes programs easier to understand. Code refactoring plays a critical role in this transition by improving structural organization and optimizing performance. However, existing refactoring methods are limited in their ability to generalize across multiple programming languages and coding styles, as they often rely on manually crafted transformation rules. The objectives of this study are to (i) develop an Large Language Models (LLMs)-based framework capable of performing accurate and efficient code refactoring across multiple languages (C, C++, C#, Python, Java), (ii) investigate the impact of prompt engineering (Temperature, Different shot algorithm) and instruction fine-tuning on refactoring effectiveness, and (iii) evaluate the quality improvements (Compilability, Correctness, Distance, Similarity, Number of Lines, Token, Character, Cyclomatic Complexity) in refactored code through empirical metrics and human assessment. To accomplish these goals, we propose a fine-tuned prompt-engineering-based model combined with few-shot learning for multilingual code refactoring. Experimental results indicate that Java achieves the highest overall correctness up to 99.99% the 10-shot setting, records the highest average compilability of 94.78% compared to the original source code and maintains high similarity (Approx. 53-54%) and thus demonstrates a strong balance between structural modifications and semantic preservation. Python exhibits the lowest structural distance across all shots (Approx. 277-294) while achieving moderate similarity ( Approx. 44-48%) that indicates consistent and minimally disruptive refactoring.

Motivation: 为了解决从自然语言需求生成汽车代码时的幻觉问题和架构正确性挑战，同时确保行为一致性和实时可行性。

Method: 采用检索增强生成（RAG）层从车辆信号规范（VSS）目录中检索相关信号作为代码生成提示上下文，减少幻觉并确保架构正确性。检索到的信号经过映射和验证后，转化为编码因果和时间约束的事件链，指导并约束基于LLM的代码合成。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法通过事件链驱动和LLM增强的工作流程，成功实现了从自然语言需求生成经过验证的汽车代码，无需LLM重新训练。

Abstract: This paper presents an event-chain-driven, LLM-empowered workflow for generating validated, automotive code from natural-language requirements. A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) layer retrieves relevant signals from large and evolving Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS) catalogs as code generation prompt context, reducing hallucinations and ensuring architectural correctness. Retrieved signals are mapped and validated before being transformed into event chains that encode causal and timing constraints. These event chains guide and constrain LLM-based code synthesis, ensuring behavioral consistency and real-time feasibility. Based on our initial findings from the emergency braking case study, with the proposed approach, we managed to achieve valid signal usage and consistent code generation without LLM retraining.

Motivation: 尽管代码库级别的代码翻译有所进展，但验证翻译结果仍具挑战性。TRAM旨在通过结合上下文感知的类型解析和隔离验证，实现高质量的跨语言代码翻译。

Method: TRAM结合上下文感知的类型解析和基于模拟的隔离验证，利用大型语言模型（LLM）解析跨语言的类型映射，并通过自定义的序列化/反序列化工作流构建目标语言中的等效模拟对象。

Result: TRAM在Java到Python的翻译中展示了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TRAM在Java到Python的代码翻译中表现出色，证明了其结合基于RAG的类型解析与可靠的隔离验证方法的有效性。

Abstract: Repository-level code translation aims to migrate entire repositories across programming languages while preserving functionality automatically. Despite advancements in repository-level code translation, validating the translations remains challenging. This paper proposes TRAM, which combines context-aware type resolution with mock-based in-isolation validation to achieve high-quality translations between programming languages. Prior to translation, TRAM retrieves API documentation and contextual code information for each variable type in the source language. It then prompts a large language model (LLM) with retrieved contextual information to resolve type mappings across languages with precise semantic interpretations. Using the automatically constructed type mapping, TRAM employs a custom serialization/deserialization workflow that automatically constructs equivalent mock objects in the target language. This enables each method fragment to be validated in isolation, without the high cost of using agents for translation validation, or the heavy manual effort required by existing approaches that rely on language interoperability. TRAM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in Java-to-Python translation, underscoring the effectiveness of its integration of RAG-based type resolution with reliable in-isolation validation.

Abstract: As modern science becomes increasingly data-intensive, the ability to analyze and visualize large-scale, complex datasets is critical to accelerating discovery. However, many domain scientists lack the programming expertise required to develop custom data analysis workflows, creating barriers to timely and effective insight. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by generating executable code from natural language descriptions. In this paper, we investigate the trustworthiness of open-source LLMs in autonomously producing Python scripts for scientific data analysis and visualization. We construct a benchmark suite of domain-inspired prompts that reflect real-world research tasks and systematically evaluate the executability and correctness of the generated code. Our findings show that, without human intervention, the reliability of LLM-generated code is limited, with frequent failures caused by ambiguous prompts and the models' insufficient understanding of domain-specific contexts. To address these challenges, we design and assess three complementary strategies: data-aware prompt disambiguation, retrieval-augmented prompt enhancement, and iterative error repair. While these methods significantly improve execution success rates and output quality, further refinement is needed. This work highlights both the promise and current limitations of LLM-driven automation in scientific workflows and introduces actionable techniques and a reusable benchmark for building more inclusive, accessible, and trustworthy AI-assisted research tools.

Motivation: 遗留应用程序的现代化不仅是技术更新，更是提升用户体验和效率的机会。直接复制旧有设计可能无法解决现有问题，而用户参与能帮助平衡新旧需求。

Method: 通过用户参与的方式，结合现有应用的功能和用户反馈，设计并开发一个更高效、更直观的现代化应用。

Result: 用户参与的设计方法能够有效平衡新旧用户需求，避免简单复制旧有设计带来的问题，同时提供更高效、更直观的应用体验。

Conclusion: 现代化遗留应用程序时，与其简单地复制旧有功能，不如通过用户参与来设计更直观的应用，既能满足新用户需求，又能保留专家用户的熟悉感。

Abstract: When modernizing a legacy application, it is easy to fall back on a like-for-like replica with new tools and updated design stylings, but this is an opportunity to explore making a more intuitive application that supports user tasks and efficiency. Rather than having a blank canvas-unburdened by legacy tech debt-to create a new application, you are working with an existing application that is integral to accelerator operations and one that expert users are already familiar with. Due to this, you might assume people will prefer the like-for-like, but you could be carrying forward the pain points, processes that are inefficient, and ultimately wind up with an application that no one wants to use because it doesn't solve existing problems. Getting users involved can make all the difference in your approach to modernizing a legacy application that caters to both newer and expert users. It also can bridge the gap between like-for-like and introducing new GUI design. Having a legacy application doesn't have to make the modernized one difficult to develop, as the existing application is a tool in how you move forward with the new application. It provides insight into areas that an application with a clean slate doesn't give you.

Motivation: 大规模开源项目中，每日有大量拉取请求，每个都可能引入回归缺陷。Diff Risk Scoring (DRS)旨在评估差异引入缺陷的可能性，以优化审查优先级、测试计划和CI/CD门控。

Method: DRS-OSS使用基于ApacheJIT数据集微调的Llama 3.1 8B序列分类器，结合提交消息、结构化差异和变更指标的长上下文表示，通过参数高效适配、4-bit QLoRA和DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 CPU卸载技术，在单块20 GB GPU上训练22k-token的上下文。

Result: 在ApacheJIT基准测试中，DRS-OSS达到最先进性能（F1 = 0.64，ROC-AUC = 0.89）。模拟显示，仅门控风险最高的30%提交可预防高达86.4%的缺陷引入变更。

Conclusion: DRS-OSS是一个开源的Diff Risk Scoring系统，通过API、Web UI和GitHub插件集成到开发者工作流中，能够有效识别高风险提交，预防缺陷引入。

Abstract: In large-scale open-source projects, hundreds of pull requests land daily, each a potential source of regressions. Diff Risk Scoring (DRS) estimates the likelihood that a diff will introduce a defect, enabling better review prioritization, test planning, and CI/CD gating. We present DRS-OSS, an open-source DRS system equipped with a public API, web UI, and GitHub plugin. DRS-OSS uses a fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B sequence classifier trained on the ApacheJIT dataset, consuming long-context representations that combine commit messages, structured diffs, and change metrics. Through parameter-efficient adaptation, 4-bit QLoRA, and DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 CPU offloading, we train 22k-token contexts on a single 20 GB GPU. On the ApacheJIT benchmark, DRS-OSS achieves state-of-the-art performance (F1 = 0.64, ROC-AUC = 0.89). Simulations show that gating only the riskiest 30% of commits can prevent up to 86.4% of defect-inducing changes. The system integrates with developer workflows through an API gateway, a React dashboard, and a GitHub App that posts risk labels on pull requests. We release the full replication package, fine-tuning scripts, deployment artifacts, code, demo video, and public website.

TL;DR: Mnimi是一种新型LLM缓存设计模式，通过类型封装统计约束，既提升效率又保证统计独立性，应用于SpecFix系统效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有LLM缓存系统无法保证统计独立性的问题，以支持概率工作流程和代码应用中的性能指标。

Method: 采用Python中的装饰器和无限序列迭代器组合实现Mnimi设计模式，封装统计约束于LLM引用类型中。

Result: Mnimi在SpecFix系统中显著提升了可重现性、调试便捷性、时间及成本效率，同时保持统计正确性。

Conclusion: Mnimi作为一种缓存设计模式，成功地在保证统计独立性的同时，提高了LLM查询的成本和延迟效率，并在SpecFix案例中验证了其实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) inference is both expensive and slow. Local caching of responses offers a practical solution to reduce the cost and latency of LLM queries. In research contexts, caching also enhances reproducibility and provides flexibility for experimentation. However, naive reuse of cached responses compromises statistical independence, a critical property for probabilistic workflows. In applications of LLM for code, it underpins performance metrics such as Pass@k and uncertainty estimation, as well as algorithms like program repair loops and retries. Existing LLM caching systems lack ways to enforce statistical independence constraints. To address this, we introduce Mnimi, a cache design pattern that supports modular LLM workflows while ensuring statistical integrity at the component level. Its core innovation lies in encapsulating statistical constraints within the type of LLM references, allowing users to manage and transform these types according to the scope and requirements of their algorithm. We implemented this design pattern in Python using a combination of decorators and iterators over infinite sequences. A case study on SpecFix, an recent automated program specification repair system, highlights how Mnimi improves reproducibility, ease of debugging, time and cost efficiency while preserving statistical correctness.

Motivation: 探讨安全策略如何影响软件依赖的结构和演化，尤其是在开源项目中。

Method: 通过分析具有和不具有SECURITY.md文件的PyPI项目的依赖树，并跟踪依赖随时间的变化。

Result: 具有安全策略的项目倾向于依赖更广泛的直接依赖，而总体深度和传递依赖保持相似。历史上，SECURITY.md引入后创建的项目（尤其是后期采用者）显示出更频繁的依赖更新。

Conclusion: 安全策略（如SECURITY.md文件）与更模块化和功能丰富的项目相关，并突出了SECURITY.md在促进主动依赖管理和降低软件供应链风险中的作用。

Abstract: Security policies, such as SECURITY.md files, are now common in open-source projects. They help guide responsible vulnerability reporting and build trust among users and contributors. Despite their growing use, it is still unclear how these policies influence the structure and evolution of software dependencies. Software dependencies are external packages or libraries that a project relies on, and their interconnected nature affects both functionality and security. This study explores the relationship between security policies and dependency management in PyPI projects. We analyzed projects with and without a SECURITY.md file by examining their dependency trees and tracking how dependencies change over time. The analysis shows that projects with a security policy tend to rely on a broader set of direct dependencies, while overall depth and transitive dependencies remain similar. Historically, projects created after the introduction of SECURITY.md, particularly later adopters, show more frequent dependency updates. These results suggest that security policies are linked to more modular and feature-rich projects, and highlight the role of SECURITY.md in promoting proactive dependency management and reducing risks in the software supply chain.

However, existing SBOM solutions lack precision, particularly in binary analysis and non-package-managed languages like C/C++.
  This paper introduces UniBOM, an advanced tool for SBOM generation, analysis, and visualisation, designed to enhance the security accountability of networked systems. UniBOM integrates binary, filesystem, and source code analysis, enabling fine-grained vulnerability detection and risk management. Key features include historical CPE tracking, AI-based vulnerability classification by severity and memory safety, and support for non-package-managed C/C++ dependencies.
  UniBOM's effectiveness is demonstrated through a comparative vulnerability analysis of 258 wireless router firmware binaries and the source code of four popular IoT operating systems, highlighting its superior detection capabilities compared to other widely used SBOM generation and analysis tools. Packaged for open-source distribution, UniBOM offers an end-to-end unified analysis and visualisation solution, advancing SBOM-driven security management for dependable networked systems and broader software.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在软件工程中的应用日益增多，但其生成结构化工件（如UML图）的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: NOMAD是一个认知启发、模块化的多智能体框架，将UML生成分解为一系列角色专业化的子任务，如实体提取、关系分类和图表合成。

Result: NOMAD在所有选定的基准测试中表现优异，同时揭示了细粒度属性提取中的持续挑战。

Conclusion: NOMAD不仅是一个有效的UML类图生成框架，还为可靠的语言到模型工作流程的广泛研究挑战提供了视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilised in software engineering, yet their ability to generate structured artefacts such as UML diagrams remains underexplored. In this work we present NOMAD, a cognitively inspired, modular multi-agent framework that decomposes UML generation into a series of role-specialised subtasks. Each agent handles a distinct modelling activity, such as entity extraction, relationship classification, and diagram synthesis, mirroring the goal-directed reasoning processes of an engineer. This decomposition improves interpretability and allows for targeted verification strategies. We evaluate NOMAD through a mixed design: a large case study (Northwind) for in-depth probing and error analysis, and human-authored UML exercises for breadth and realism. NOMAD outperforms all selected baselines, while revealing persistent challenges in fine-grained attribute extraction. Building on these observations, we introduce the first systematic taxonomy of errors in LLM-generated UML diagrams, categorising structural, relationship, and semantic/logical. Finally, we examine verification as a design probe, showing its mixed effects and outlining adaptive strategies as promising directions. Together, these contributions position NOMAD as both an effective framework for UML class diagram generation and a lens onto the broader research challenges of reliable language-to-model workflows.

Motivation: 随着联邦数据空间（如GAIA-X和国际数据空间IDS）的普及，工业4.0中跨组织边界的安全和主权数据共享成为可能，但如何由领域专家（非软件工程师）描述和执行上下文相关的数据使用策略仍是一个开放挑战。

Method: 通过领域特定语言（DSL），使领域专家能够声明式地定义细粒度的数据治理要求，如限制特定生产批次数据的访问或定义保留期后自动删除，而无需编写命令式代码。

Result: 提出的DSL方法能够有效实现人类可读且机器可执行的数据共享策略定义，解决了现有技术在数据治理中的局限性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种利用领域特定语言（DSL）的方法，以实现声明式、人类可读且机器可执行的数据共享策略定义，解决了领域专家在无软件工程背景下的数据使用策略描述和执行问题。

Abstract: The growing adoption of federated data spaces, such as in the GAIA-X and the International Data Spaces (IDS) initiative, promises secure and sovereign data sharing across organizational boundaries in Industry 4.0. In manufacturing ecosystems, this enables use cases, such as cross-factory process optimization, predictive maintenance, and supplier integration. Frameworks and standards, such as the Asset Administration Shell (AAS), Eclipse Dataspace Connector (EDC), ID-Link and Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) provide a strong foundation to realize this ecosystem. However, a major open challenge is the practical description and enforcement of context-dependent data usage policies using these base technologies - especially by domain experts without software engineering backgrounds. Therefore, this article proposes a method for leveraging domain-specific languages (DSLs) to enable declarative, human-readable, and machine-executable policy definitions for sovereign data sharing via data space connectors. The DSL empowers domain experts to specify fine-grained data governance requirements - such as restricting access to data from specific production batches or enforcing automatic deletion after a defined retention period - without writing imperative code.

Motivation: 识别那些反复吸引bug的源代码子集对于减少长期维护工作至关重要。

Method: 使用包含98个开源Java项目中超过125万个方法的数据集，结合五种机器学习模型进行预测，并对265个极端易错方法进行主题分析。

Result: 极端易错方法仅占所有方法的一小部分，但却占据了不成比例的bug份额。这些方法在初始时就比单次易错和非易错方法更大、更复杂、可读性和可维护性更差。然而，早期预测极端易错方法仍然高度不可靠。主题分析揭示了常见的视觉问题、上下文角色和缺陷模式。

Conclusion: 研究强调了需要更丰富的、考虑代码演变的表示方法，并为开发者在开发生命周期早期优先处理高风险方法提供了可行的见解。

Abstract: Identifying the small subset of source code that repeatedly attracts bugs is critical for reducing long-term maintenance effort. We define ExtremelyBuggy methods as those involved in more than one bug fix and present the first large-scale study of their prevalence, characteristics, and predictability. Using a dataset of over 1.25 million methods from 98 open-source Java projects, we find that ExtremelyBuggy methods constitute only a tiny fraction of all methods, yet frequently account for a disproportionately large share of bugs. At their inception, these methods are significantly larger, more complex, less readable, and less maintainable than both singly-buggy and non-buggy methods. However, despite these measurable differences, a comprehensive evaluation of five machine learning models shows that early prediction of ExtremelyBuggy methods remains highly unreliable due to data imbalance, project heterogeneity, and the fact that many bugs emerge through subsequent evolution rather than initial implementation. To complement these quantitative findings, we conduct a thematic analysis of 265 ExtremelyBuggy methods, revealing recurring visual issues (e.g., confusing control flow, poor readability), contextual roles (e.g., core logic, data transformation, external resource handling), and common defect patterns (e.g., faulty conditionals, fragile error handling, misuse of variables). These results highlight the need for richer, evolution-aware representations of code and provide actionable insights for practitioners seeking to prioritize high-risk methods early in the development lifecycle.

### [347] [MBFL-DKMR: Improving Mutation-based Fault Localization through Denoising-based Kill Matrix Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22921)
*Hengyuan Liu,Xia Song,Yong Liu,Zheng Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces DKMR, a novel approach to refine the kill matrix in MBFL by treating it as a signal with noise, using signal processing techniques to enhance fault localization effectiveness, demonstrated by superior results on Defects4J v2.0.0.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mutation-Based Fault Localization (MBFL) faces challenges due to noise phenomena, specifically false kill relationships between mutants and tests, which degrade localization effectiveness. Existing approaches do not directly address this underlying noise.

Method: The paper proposes DKMR (Denoising-based Kill Matrix Refinement), which employs two key stages: (1) signal enhancement through hybrid matrix construction to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for better denoising, and (2) signal denoising via frequency domain filtering to suppress noise while preserving fault-related patterns. Building on this foundation, the authors develop MBFL-DKMR, a fault localization framework that utilizes the refined matrix with fuzzy values for suspiciousness calculation.

Result: MBFL-DKMR outperforms state-of-the-art MBFL techniques, achieving 129 faults localized at Top-1 compared to 85 for BLMu and 103 for Delta4Ms, with negligible additional computational overhead (0.11 seconds, 0.001% of total time).

Conclusion: This work highlights the potential of signal processing techniques to enhance the effectiveness of MBFL by refining the kill matrix.

Abstract: Software debugging is a critical and time-consuming aspect of software development, with fault localization being a fundamental step that significantly impacts debugging efficiency. Mutation-Based Fault Localization (MBFL) has gained prominence due to its robust theoretical foundations and fine-grained analysis capabilities. However, recent studies have identified a critical challenge: noise phenomena, specifically the false kill relationships between mutants and tests, which significantly degrade localization effectiveness. While several approaches have been proposed to rectify the final localization results, they do not directly address the underlying noise. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to refine the kill matrix, a core data structure capturing mutant-test relationships in MBFL, by treating it as a signal that contains both meaningful fault-related patterns and high-frequency noise. Inspired by signal processing theory, we introduce DKMR (Denoising-based Kill Matrix Refinement), which employs two key stages: (1) signal enhancement through hybrid matrix construction to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for better denoising, and (2) signal denoising via frequency domain filtering to suppress noise while preserving fault-related patterns. Building on this foundation, we develop MBFL-DKMR, a fault localization framework that utilizes the refined matrix with fuzzy values for suspiciousness calculation. Our evaluation on Defects4J v2.0.0 demonstrates that MBFL-DKMR effectively mitigates the noise and outperforms the state-of-the-art MBFL techniques. Specifically, MBFL-DKMR achieves 129 faults localized at Top-1 compared to 85 for BLMu and 103 for Delta4Ms, with negligible additional computational overhead (0.11 seconds, 0.001\% of total time). This work highlights the potential of signal processing techniques to enhance the effectiveness of MBFL by refining the kill matrix.

Abstract: Software Requirement Document (RD) typically contain tens of thousands of individual requirements, and ensuring consistency among these requirements is critical for the success of software engineering projects. Automated detection methods can significantly enhance efficiency and reduce costs; however, existing approaches still face several challenges, including low detection accuracy on imbalanced data, limited semantic extraction due to the use of a single encoder, and suboptimal performance in cross-domain transfer learning. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Transferable Software Requirement Conflict Detection Framework based on SBERT and SimCSE, termed TSRCDF-SS. First, the framework employs two independent encoders, Sentence-BERT (SBERT) and Simple Contrastive Sentence Embedding (SimCSE), to generate sentence embeddings for requirement pairs, followed by a six-element concatenation strategy. Furthermore, the classifier is enhanced by a two-layer fully connected feedforward neural network (FFNN) with a hybrid loss optimization strategy that integrates a variant of Focal Loss, domain-specific constraints, and a confidence-based penalty term. Finally, the framework synergistically integrates sequential and cross-domain transfer learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a 10.4% improvement in both macro-F1 and weighted-F1 scores in in-domain settings, and an 11.4% increase in macro-F1 in cross-domain scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管数字孪生技术在各领域有广泛应用，但其在网络领域的应用仍不足。本文旨在解决客户端密度增加和流量拥堵等问题。

Method: APDT通过Ruckus SmartZone API从三个接入点收集数据，并结合基于NS-3的模拟，复制实时网络状态并建模延迟等指标。此外，预测模型用于预判流量拥堵并建议主动卸载客户端。

Result: 初步结果表明，APDT能有效预测短期流量激增，优化网络管理和性能。

Conclusion: APDT（接入点数字孪生）能够成功预测短期流量激增，从而提升服务质量（QoS）并减少网络拥堵。

Abstract: Digital twins (DT) have emerged as a transformative technology, enabling real-time monitoring, simulations, and predictive maintenance across various domains, though their Application in the networking domain remains underexplored. This paper focuses on issues such as increasing client density and traffic congestion by proposing a digital twin for computer networks. Our Digital Twin, named Access Point Digital Twin (APDT) is used for tracking user behavior and changing bandwidth demands, directly impacting network performance and Quality of Service (QoS) parameters like latency, jitter, etc. APDT captures the real-time state of networks with data from access points (APs), enabling simulation-based analyses and predictive modelling. APDT facilitates the simulation of various what-if scenarios thereby providing a better understanding of various aspects of the network characteristics. We tested APDT on our University network. APDT uses data collected from three access points via the Ruckus SmartZone API and incorporates NS-3 based simulations. The simulation replicates a real-time snapshot from a Ruckus access point and models metrics such as latency and inter-packet transfer time. Additionally, a forecasting model predicts traffic congestion and suggests proactive client offloading, enhancing network management and performance optimization. Preliminary results indicate that APDT can successfully predict short-term traffic surges, leading to improved QoS and reduced traffic congestion.

TL;DR: LLMs在SE教育中既是‘平衡器’也是‘放大器’，提升平均表现但扩大差距，需应对新教学挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs重塑软件开发，将其增强实践融入SE教育变得迫切。现有研究多关注LLMs在入门编程或孤立SE任务中的教育应用，而其在更开放的项目式学习（PBL）中的影响尚未探索。

Method: 通过一项为期两年的纵向研究，比较了2024年（使用早期免费LLMs，$n$=48）和2025年（使用最新付费LLMs，$n$=46）两个队列的表现。

Result: 研究发现，最新LLMs既能提升平均表现（尤其对编程能力较弱学生），也显著扩大了表现差距。

Conclusion: 最新强大的LLMs在软件工程教育中扮演双重角色：既是‘平衡器’，提升包括编程能力较弱学生在内的平均表现，为更真实的SE实践提供机会；也是‘放大器’，显著扩大绝对表现差距，为教育不平等问题带来新的教学挑战。

Abstract: As LLMs reshape software development, integrating LLM-augmented practices into SE education has become imperative. While existing studies explore LLMs' educational use in introductory programming or isolated SE tasks, their impact in more open-ended Project-Based Learning (PBL) remains unexplored. This paper introduces a two-year longitudinal study comparing a 2024 (using early free LLMs, $n$=48) and 2025 (using the latest paid LLMs, $n$=46) cohort. Our findings suggest the latest powerful LLMs' dual role: they act as "equalizers," boosting average performance even for programming-weak students, providing opportunities for more authentic SE practices; yet also as "amplifiers," dramatically widening absolute performance gaps, creating new pedagogical challenges for addressing educational inequities.

*Samuele Doria,Eleonora Losiouk*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: GAPS 是一种结合静态与动态分析的工具，显著提升 Android 应用方法可达性分析的效率和覆盖率，优于现有工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具在驱动执行至特定目标方法（尤其是非图形组件中的方法）方面存在不足，这对漏洞验证、调试和行为分析等任务至关重要。

Method: GAPS 结合静态方法引导的调用图分析和动态交互驱动执行，通过轻量级反向遍历和数据流分析重构目标方法的路径。

Result: 在 AndroTest 基准测试中，GAPS 静态识别路径覆盖 88.24% 的目标方法（4.27 秒/应用），动态覆盖 57.44%。相比其他工具（如 APE、GoalExplorer、Guardian、FlowDroid 和 DroidReach），GAPS 表现显著更优。在 50 个真实应用测试中，静态分析平均耗时 278.9 秒，覆盖 62.03% 目标方法，动态覆盖 59.86%。

Conclusion: GAPS 在动态解析 Android 应用方法可达性方面表现出色，显著优于现有工具，尤其在静态分析和动态执行结合上展现了高效性。

Abstract: Dynamically resolving method reachability in Android applications remains a critical and largely unsolved problem. Despite notable advancements in GUI testing and static call graph construction, current tools are insufficient for reliably driving execution toward specific target methods, especially those not embedded in a graphical component (e.g., libraries' methods), a capability essential for tasks such as vulnerability validation, debugging, and behavioral analysis.
  We present GAPS (Graph-based Automated Path Synthesizer), the first system that integrates static, method-guided call graph analysis with dynamic, interaction-driven execution. GAPS performs a lightweight backward traversal of the call graph, guided by data-flow analysis, to reconstruct paths reaching the target methods. These paths are then translated into instructions that guide runtime app exploration.
  On the AndroTest benchmark, GAPS statically identifies paths to reach 88.24\% of the target methods in just 4.27 seconds per app and dynamically reaches 57.44\% of them. In contrast, state-of-the-art dynamic interaction tools show significantly lower reachability over three runs: APE, one of the best model-based GUI testers, achieves 12.82\%, while GoalExplorer, a hybrid analysis tool, reaches 9.69\%, and Guardian, an LLM-based UI automator, reaches 17.12\%. Static analysis tools also fall short: FlowDroid and DroidReach identify paths to reach 58.81\% and 9.48\% of the targets, requiring 35.06 seconds and 23.46 seconds per app, respectively.
  Finally, an evaluation on the 50 most downloaded real-world apps demonstrates GAPS's practical utility in analyzing security-critical code under a realistic scenario. With an average static analysis time of 278.9 seconds, GAPS statically reconstructs paths to 62.03\% of the target methods and dynamically reaches 59.86\% of them.

Conclusion: MBFL-FLIM通过语义识别和减轻干扰突变体（FLIMs），显著提升了基于突变故障定位（MBFL）的效果，在Defects4J基准测试中表现优于传统及先进方法。

Abstract: Mutation-based Fault Localization (MBFL) has been widely explored for automated software debugging, leveraging artificial mutants to identify faulty code entities. However, MBFL faces significant challenges due to interference mutants generated from non-faulty code entities but can be killed by failing tests. These mutants mimic the test sensitivity behaviors of real faulty code entities and weaken the effectiveness of fault localization. To address this challenge, we introduce the concept of Fault Localization Interference Mutants (FLIMs) and conduct a theoretical analysis based on the Reachability, Infection, Propagation, and Revealability (RIPR) model, identifying four distinct interference causes. Building on this, we propose a novel approach to semantically recognize and mitigate FLIMs using LLM-based semantic analysis, enhanced by fine-tuning techniques and confidence estimation strategies to address LLM output instability. The recognized FLIMs are then mitigated by refining the suspiciousness scores calculated from MBFL techniques. We integrate FLIM recognition and mitigation into the MBFL workflow, developing MBFL-FLIM, a fault localization framework that enhances MBFL's effectiveness by reducing misleading interference while preserving real fault-revealing information. Our empirical experiments on the Defects4J benchmark with 395 program versions using eight LLMs demonstrate MBFL-FLIM's superiority over traditional SBFL and MBFL methods, advanced dynamic feature-based approaches, and recent LLM-based fault localization techniques. Specifically, MBFL-FLIM achieves an average improvement of 44 faults in the Top-1 metric, representing a significant enhancement over baseline methods. Further evaluation confirms MBFL-FLIM's robust performance in multi-fault scenarios, with ablation experiments validating the contributions of the fine-tuning and confidence estimation components.

Conclusion: C2C-MoLA通过结合MoE和LoRA，显著提升了图表到代码生成的准确性、内存效率和收敛速度，尤其在复杂图表上表现突出。消融研究验证了其设计的优越性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Chart-to-code generation is a critical task in automated data visualization, translating complex chart structures into executable programs. While recent Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) improve chart representation, existing approaches still struggle to achieve cross-type generalization, memory efficiency, and modular design. To address these challenges, this paper proposes C2C-MoLA, a multimodal framework that synergizes Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The MoE component uses a complexity-aware routing mechanism with domain-specialized experts and load-balanced sparse gating, dynamically allocating inputs based on learnable structural metrics like element count and chart complexity. LoRA enables parameter-efficient updates for resource-conscious tuning, further supported by a tailored training strategy that aligns routing stability with semantic accuracy. Experiments on Chart2Code-160k show that the proposed model improves generation accuracy by up to 17%, reduces peak GPU memory by 18%, and accelerates convergence by 20%, when compared to standard fine-tuning and LoRA-only baselines, particularly on complex charts. Ablation studies validate optimal designs, such as 8 experts and rank-8 LoRA, and confirm scalability for real-world multimodal code generation.
