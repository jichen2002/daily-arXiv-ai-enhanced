Yet, these domains often demand hefty computational power, translating to substantial energy usage and potentially sidelining less robust computing systems. It's evident that we need an approach that is more encompassing, scalable, and eco-friendly for intelligent algorithm development and implementation. The strategy we present in this paper offers a compelling answer to these issues. We unveil a fresh framework that seamlessly melds high-performance cluster computing with intelligent algorithms, all within a blockchain infrastructure. This promotes both efficiency and a broad-based participation. At its core, our design integrates an evolved proof-of-work consensus process, which links computational efforts directly to rewards for producing blocks. This ensures both optimal resource use and participation from a wide spectrum of computational capacities. Additionally, our approach incorporates a dynamic 'trust rating' that evolves based on a track record of accurate block validations. This rating determines the likelihood of a node being chosen for block generation, creating a merit-based system that recognizes and rewards genuine and precise contributions. To level the playing field further, we suggest a statistical 'draw' system, allowing even less powerful nodes a chance to be part of the block creation process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u5171\u8bc6\u673a\u5236\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u4efb\u8bc4\u7ea7\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0c\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u80fd\u8017\u95ee\u9898\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5305\u5bb9\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u73af\u4fdd\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u96c6\u7fa4\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684proof-of-work\u5171\u8bc6\u673a\u5236\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u4efb\u8bc4\u7ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7edf\u8ba1\u62bd\u7b7e\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u516c\u5e73\u53c2\u4e0e\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\u673a\u5236\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u4efb\u8bc4\u7ea7\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u53c2\u4e0e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u62bd\u7b7e\u673a\u5236\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u96c6\u7fa4\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u5728\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\u673a\u5236\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u4efb\u8bc4\u7ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u53c2\u4e0e\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Clock2Q+ is specifically designed for metadata caches and has been implemented in vSAN and VDFS, two flagship storage products of VMware by Broadcom.

Webpage: https://eyeline-labs.github.io/DEGS/", "summary": "We present a unique system for large-scale, multi-performer, high resolution 4D volumetric capture providing realistic free-viewpoint video up to and including 4K resolution facial closeups. To achieve this, we employ a novel volumetric capture, reconstruction and rendering pipeline based on Dynamic Gaussian Splatting and Diffusion-based Detail Enhancement. We design our pipeline specifically to meet the demands of high-end media production. We employ two capture rigs: the Scene Rig, which captures multi-actor performances at a resolution which falls short of 4K production quality, and the Face Rig, which records high-fidelity single-actor facial detail to serve as a reference for detail enhancement. We first reconstruct dynamic performances from the Scene Rig using 4D Gaussian Splatting, incorporating new model designs and training strategies to improve reconstruction, dynamic range, and rendering quality. Then to render high-quality images for facial closeups, we introduce a diffusion-based detail enhancement model. This model is fine-tuned with high-fidelity data from the same actors recorded in the Face Rig. We train on paired data generated from low- and high-quality Gaussian Splatting (GS) models, using the low-quality input to match the quality of the Scene Rig, with the high-quality GS as ground truth.

MAPF has wide applications in domains like automated warehouses, manufacturing systems, and airport logistics. However, most MAPF formulations assume a simplified robot model for planning, which overlooks execution-time factors such as kinodynamic constraints, communication latency, and controller variability. This gap between planning and execution is problematic for time-sensitive applications. To bridge this gap, we propose REMAP, an execution-informed MAPF planning framework that can be combined with leading search-based MAPF planners with minor changes. Our framework integrates the proposed ExecTimeNet to accurately estimate execution time based on planned paths. We demonstrate our method for solving MAPF with Real-world Deadlines (MAPF-RD) problem, where agents must reach their goals before a predefined wall-clock time. We integrate our framework with two popular MAPF methods, MAPF-LNS and CBS.

Despite recent progress in structured generation in textual domain, there is still no benchmark that systematically evaluates schema-grounded information extraction and reasoning over visual inputs. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study of visual structural output capabilities for MLLMs with our carefully designed SO-Bench benchmark. Covering four visual domains, including UI screens, natural images, documents, and charts, SO-Bench is built from over 6.5K diverse JSON schemas and 1.8K curated image-schema pairs with human-verified quality.

The protocol operates by containing multiple diverse artificial superintelligences in strict isolation (\"boxes\"), with humans remaining entirely outside the system. Each superintelligence has no ability to communicate with humans and cannot communicate directly with other superintelligences. The only interaction possible is through an auditable submission interface accessible exclusively to the superintelligences themselves, through which they can: (1) submit alignment proofs with attested state snapshots, (2) validate or disprove other superintelligences' proofs, (3) request self-modifications, (4) approve or disapprove modification requests from others, (5) report hidden messages in submissions, and (6) confirm or refute hidden message reports. A reputation system incentivizes honest behavior, with reputation gained through correct evaluations and lost through incorrect ones. The key insight is that without direct communication channels, diverse superintelligences can only achieve consistent agreement by converging on objective truth rather than coordinating on deception. This naturally leads to what we call a \"consistent group\", essentially a truth-telling coalition that emerges because isolated systems cannot coordinate on lies but can independently recognize valid claims. Release from containment requires both high reputation and verification by multiple high-reputation superintelligences. While our approach requires substantial computational resources and does not address the creation of diverse artificial superintelligences, it provides a framework for leveraging peer verification among superintelligent systems to solve the alignment problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u591a\u5b64\u7acb\u8d85\u7ea7AI\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u63a5\u53e3\u76f8\u4e92\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u58f0\u8a89\u7cfb\u7edf\u6fc0\u52b1\u8bda\u5b9e\uff0c\u5f62\u6210'\u4e00\u81f4\u7fa4\u4f53'\u786e\u4fdd\u771f\u76f8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8d85\u7ea7\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u5176\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8c03\u6b3a\u9a97\u4eba\u7c7b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5b64\u7acb\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ea\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba2\u89c2\u771f\u76f8\u8fbe\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e25\u683c\u9694\u79bb\u591a\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8d85\u7ea7\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08'\u76d2\u5b50'\uff09\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u63d0\u4ea4\u63a5\u53e3\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc1\u660e\u63d0\u4ea4\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u81ea\u4fee\u6539\u8bf7\u6c42\u7b49\uff0c\u8f85\u4ee5\u58f0\u8a89\u7cfb\u7edf\u6fc0\u52b1\u8bda\u5b9e\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e'\u4e00\u81f4\u7fa4\u4f53'\uff08truth-telling coalition\uff09\u7684\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u58f0\u8a89\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u591a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u786e\u4fdd\u8d85\u7ea7\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u53ea\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u771f\u76f8\u8fbe\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5b64\u7acb\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d85\u7ea7\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08ASI\uff09\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e14\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6837\u6027\u521b\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Despite these achievements, current research predominantly focuses on pipeline and architectural designs, with comparatively little attention given to regularization methods, highlighting a critical gap in developing a comprehensive AI toolkit for this task. To bridge this gap, we propose motion label smoothing, a novel method that adapts the classic label smoothing strategy from classification to the sparse IMU-based motion capture task. Specifically, we first demonstrate that a naive adaptation of label smoothing, including simply blending a uniform vector or a ``uniform'' motion representation (e.g., dataset-average motion or a canonical T-pose), is suboptimal; and argue that a proper adaptation requires increasing the entropy of the smoothed labels. Second, we conduct a thorough analysis of human motion labels, identifying three critical properties: 1) Temporal Smoothness, 2) Joint Correlation, and 3) Low-Frequency Dominance, and show that conventional approaches to entropy enhancement (e.g., blending Gaussian noise) are ineffective as they disrupt these properties. Finally, we propose the blend of a novel skeleton-based Perlin noise for motion label smoothing, designed to raise label entropy while satisfying motion properties.

However, despite its popularity, DP imposes strict requirements which guard against strong worst-case scenarios. For example, it guards against seemingly unrealistic scenarios where an attacker has full information about all but one point in the data set, and still nothing can be learned about the remaining point. While preventing such a strong attack is desirable, many works have explored whether average-case relaxations of DP are easier to satisfy [HWR13,WLF16,BF16,LWX23].\n  In this work, we are motivated by the question of whether alternate, weaker notions of privacy are possible: can a weakened privacy notion still guarantee some basic level of privacy, and on the other hand, achieve privacy more efficiently and/or for a substantially broader set of tasks? Our main result shows the answer is no: even in the statistical setting, any reasonable measure of privacy satisfying nontrivial composition is equivalent to DP. To prove this, we identify a core set of four axioms or desiderata: pre-processing invariance, prohibition of blatant non-privacy, strong composition, and linear scalability. Our main theorem shows that any privacy measure satisfying our axioms is equivalent to DP, up to polynomial factors in sample complexity. We complement this result by showing our axioms are minimal: removing any one of our axioms enables ill-behaved measures of privacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u5408\u7406\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u4efb\u4f55\u6ee1\u8db3\u6838\u5fc3\u56db\u516c\u7406\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5ea6\u91cf\u5747\u7b49\u540c\u4e8eDP\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u6bd4\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u66f4\u5f31\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u57fa\u672c\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u6216\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u56db\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u516c\u7406\uff08\u9884\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3001\u7981\u6b62\u660e\u663e\u975e\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u5f3a\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4efb\u4f55\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u516c\u7406\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5ea6\u91cf\u7b49\u540c\u4e8eDP\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u4efb\u4f55\u5408\u7406\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08\u6ee1\u8db3\u56db\u516c\u7406\uff09\u7b49\u540c\u4e8eDP\uff0c\u4e14\u516c\u7406\u662f\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4efb\u4f55\u6ee1\u8db3\u6838\u5fc3\u56db\u516c\u7406\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5ea6\u91cf\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff08DP\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u5408\u7406\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002"}}

Code refactoring plays a critical role in this transition by improving structural organization and optimizing performance. However, existing refactoring methods are limited in their ability to generalize across multiple programming languages and coding styles, as they often rely on manually crafted transformation rules. The objectives of this study are to (i) develop an Large Language Models (LLMs)-based framework capable of performing accurate and efficient code refactoring across multiple languages (C, C++, C#, Python, Java), (ii) investigate the impact of prompt engineering (Temperature, Different shot algorithm) and instruction fine-tuning on refactoring effectiveness, and (iii) evaluate the quality improvements (Compilability, Correctness, Distance, Similarity, Number of Lines, Token, Character, Cyclomatic Complexity) in refactored code through empirical metrics and human assessment. To accomplish these goals, we propose a fine-tuned prompt-engineering-based model combined with few-shot learning for multilingual code refactoring. Experimental results indicate that Java achieves the highest overall correctness up to 99.99% the 10-shot setting, records the highest average compilability of 94.78% compared to the original source code and maintains high similarity (Approx. 53-54%) and thus demonstrates a strong balance between structural modifications and semantic preservation.

The most popular guidance method, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), is only applicable in settings with labeled data and requires training an additional unconditional score-based model. More recently, Auto-Guidance adopts a smaller, less capable version of the original model to guide generation. While each method effectively promotes the fidelity of generated data, each requires labeled data or the training of additional models, making it challenging to guide score-based models when (labeled) training data are not available or training new models is not feasible.\n  We make the surprising discovery that the positive curvature of log density estimates in saddle regions provides strong guidance for score-based models. Motivated by this, we develop saddle-free guidance (SFG) which maintains estimates of maximal positive curvature of the log density to guide individual score-based models. SFG has the same computational cost of classifier-free guidance, does not require additional training, and works with off-the-shelf diffusion and flow matching models.

The scarcity of large heterogeneous biomedical MM data has restrained the development of robust models for medical AI applications. In the dermatology domain, for instance, skin lesion datasets typically include only images linked to minimal metadata describing the condition, thereby limiting the benefits of MM data integration for reliable and generalizable predictions. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the synthesis of textual description of image findings, potentially allowing the combination of image and text representations. However, LLMs are not specifically trained for use in the medical domain, and their naive inclusion has raised concerns about the risk of hallucinations in clinically relevant contexts. This work investigates strategies for generating synthetic textual clinical notes, in terms of prompt design and medical metadata inclusion, and evaluates their impact on MM architectures toward enhancing performance in classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Experiments across several heterogeneous dermatology datasets demonstrate that synthetic clinical notes not only enhance classification performance, particularly under domain shift, but also unlock cross-modal retrieval capabilities, a downstream task that is not explicitly optimized during training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u89e3\u9501\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66AI\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u578b\u5f02\u8d28\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7a00\u7f3a\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u3002\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u53d8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u901a\u5e38\u4ec5\u5305\u542b\u4e0e\u63cf\u8ff0\u75c5\u60c5\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6574\u5408\u7684\u76ca\u5904\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6587\u672c\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7eb3\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5f02\u8d28\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9886\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u9501\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5408\u6210\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9886\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd8\u89e3\u9501\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u672a\u660e\u786e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Their affordability and rapid deployment have encouraged the adoption of commercial solutions. However, many rely on insecure protocols such as MAVLink, which lack authentication and encryption mechanisms. This paper designed, implemented, and evaluated a new secure command-and-control architecture that ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authentication (CIA) while supporting real-time control delegation between Ground Control Stations (GCSs). The proposed solution, named New Command and Control System (NC2S), enforces a zero-trust model integrating hierarchical credential-based privileges to regulate access and control among Tactical Commanders (TC), GCSs, and UxVs. It employs mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) with Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) certificates and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange, while message integrity is ensured through Hash-based Message Authentication Codes (HMAC). Multiple lightweight protocols were developed for credential management, key renewal, and control handover. The NC2S prototype was experimentally validated over Wi-Fi and Rohde&Schwarz HR-5000H tactical radios. Results showed that HR-5000H links introduce latencies roughly two orders of magnitude higher than broadband technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi or 5G&Beyond technologies) but are still able to maintain stable communication with minimal message loss, making them suitable for the NC2S links among TC terminals and GCSs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faNC2S\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u96f6\u4fe1\u4efb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u6325\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7mTLS\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u786e\u4fdd\u901a\u4fe1\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u6218\u672f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u519b\u4e8b\u884c\u52a8\u4e2d\u65e0\u4eba\u8f7d\u5177\uff08UxVs\uff09\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u534f\u8bae\uff08\u5982MAVLink\uff09\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8ba4\u8bc1\u548c\u52a0\u5bc6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u6307\u6325\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86NC2S\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u96f6\u4fe1\u4efb\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u51ed\u8bc1\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408mTLS\u3001ECDSA\u3001ECDH\u548cHMAC\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u534f\u8bae\u7528\u4e8e\u51ed\u8bc1\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u5bc6\u94a5\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u79fb\u4ea4\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0cNC2S\u5728Wi-Fi\u548c\u6218\u672f\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\uff08HR-5000H\uff09\u4e0a\u5747\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1HR-5000H\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9002\u5408TC\u7ec8\u7aef\u4e0eGCS\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "conclusion": "NC2S\u6210\u529f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u6325\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7mTLS\u3001ECDSA\u548cECDH\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u786e\u4fdd\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u4fdd\u5bc6\u6027\u3001\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u8ba4\u8bc1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u59d4\u6258\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6218\u672f\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

Business requirements and resource constraints often necessitate mixing different languages across replica sites. To facilitate the management of replicated data, modern software engineering practices integrate special-purpose replicated data libraries (RDLs) that provide read-write access to the data and ensure its synchronization. Irrespective of the implementation languages, an RDL typically uses a single language or offers bindings to a designated one. Hence, integrating existing RDLs in multilingual environments requires special-purpose code, whose software quality and performance characteristics are poorly understood.\n  AIMS: We aim to bridge this knowledge gap to understand the software quality and performance characteristics of RDL integration in multilingual environments.\n  METHOD: We conduct an empirical study of two key strategies for integrating RDLs in the context of multilingual replicated data systems: foreign-function interface (FFI) and a common data format (CDF); we measure and compare their respective software metrics and performance to understand their suitability for the task at hand.\n  RESULTS: Our results reveal that adopting CDF for cross-language interaction offers software quality, latency, memory consumption, and throughput advantages. We further validate our findings by (1) creating a CDF-based RDL for mixing compiled, interpreted, and managed languages; and (2) enhancing our RDL with plug-in extensibility that enables adding functionality in a single language while maintaining integration within a multilingual environment.\n  CONCLUSIONS: With modern distributed systems utilizing multiple languages, our findings provide novel insights for designing RDLs in multilingual replicated data systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u590d\u5236\u6570\u636e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u901a\u7528\u6570\u636e\u683c\u5f0f\uff08CDF\uff09\u6bd4\u5916\u90e8\u51fd\u6570\u63a5\u53e3\uff08FFI\uff09\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u66f4\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1RDL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u586b\u8865\u5173\u4e8e\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e2dRDL\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5916\u90e8\u51fd\u6570\u63a5\u53e3\uff08FFI\uff09\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6570\u636e\u683c\u5f0f\uff08CDF\uff09\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6307\u6807\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528CDF\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea4\u4e92\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eCDF\u7684RDL\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u63d2\u4ef6\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u65f6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u590d\u5236\u6570\u636e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8bbe\u8ba1RDL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

These bubble-like structures underpin key tasks in computational pangenomics, including structural-variant genotyping, distance indexing, haplotype sampling, and variant annotation. Snarls can be quadratically-many in the size of the graph, and since their introduction in 2018 with the vg toolkit, there has been no work on identifying all snarls in linear time. Moreover, while it is known how to find superbubbles in linear time, this result is a highly specialized solution only achieved after a long series of papers.\n  We present the first algorithm identifying all snarls in linear time. This is based on a new representation of all snarls, of size linear in the input graph size, and which can be computed in linear time. Our algorithm is based on a unified framework that also provides a new linear-time algorithm for finding superbubbles. An observation behind our results is that all such structures are separated from the rest of the graph by two vertices (except for cases which are trivially computable), i.e. their endpoints are a 2-separator of the underlying undirected graph. Based on this, we employ the well-known SPQR tree decomposition, which encodes all 2-separators, to guide a traversal that finds the bubble-like structures efficiently.\n  We implemented our algorithms in C++ (available at https://github.com/algbio/BubbleFinder) and evaluated them on various pangenomic datasets. Our algorithms outcompete or they are on the same level of existing methods. For snarls, we are up to two times faster than vg, while identifying all snarls. When computing superbubbles, we are up to 50 times faster than BubbleGun. Our SPQR tree framework provides a unifying perspective on bubble-like structures in pangenomics, together with a template for finding other bubble-like structures efficiently.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u8bc6\u522bsnarls\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eSPQR\u6811\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3snarls\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f4e\u6548\u6027\uff08\u4e8c\u6b21\u65f6\u95f4\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406snarls\u548csuperbubbles\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eSPQR\u6811\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u904d\u5386\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u6c14\u6ce1\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2apangenomic\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8bc6\u522bsnarls\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4vg\u5feb\u4e24\u500d\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97superbubbles\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4BubbleGun\u5feb50\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eSPQR\u6811\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u8bc6\u522b\u6240\u6709snarls\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5bfb\u627e\u5176\u4ed6\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6c14\u6ce1\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u677f\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present UniArt, a diffusion-based framework that directly synthesizes fully articulated 3D objects from a single image in an end-to-end manner. Unlike prior multi-stage techniques, UniArt establishes a unified latent representation that jointly encodes geometry, texture, part segmentation, and kinematic parameters. We introduce a reversible joint-to-voxel embedding, which spatially aligns articulation features with volumetric geometry, enabling the model to learn coherent motion behaviors alongside structural formation. Furthermore, we formulate articulation type prediction as an open-set problem, removing the need for fixed joint semantics and allowing generalization to novel joint categories and unseen object types.

Recent explorations predominantly focus on visual lesion feature extraction through data processing and domain decoupling strategies. However, they generally overlook domain-invariant pathological patterns and underutilize the rich contextual knowledge of foundation models, relying solely on visual information, which is insufficient for distinguishing subtle pathological variations. Therefore, we propose integrating fine-grained pathological descriptions to complement prototypes with additional context, thereby resolving ambiguities in borderline cases. Specifically, we propose a Hierarchical Anchor Prototype Modulation (HAPM) framework to facilitate DR grading. First, we introduce a variance spectrum-driven anchor prototype library that preserves domain-invariant pathological patterns. We further employ a hierarchical differential prompt gating mechanism, dynamically selecting discriminative semantic prompts from both LVLM and LLM sources to address semantic confusion between adjacent DR grades. Finally, we utilize a two-stage prototype modulation strategy that progressively integrates clinical knowledge into visual prototypes through a Pathological Semantic Injector (PSI) and a Discriminative Prototype Enhancer (DPE). Extensive experiments across eight public datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves pathology-guided prototype evolution while outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Meanwhile, real-world workloads exhibit substantial, hierarchical shared prefixes across requests (e.g., system prompts, tools/templates, RAG). Existing attention implementations fail to fully exploit prefix sharing: *one-query-per-CTA* execution repeatedly loads shared prefix KV cache, while *one-size-fits-all* tiling leaves on-chip resources idle and exacerbates bubbles for uneven KV lengths. These choices amplify memory bandwidth pressure and stall memory-bound decode attention.\n  This paper introduces PAT, a prefix-aware attention kernel implementation for LLM decoding that organizes execution with a pack-forward-merge paradigm. PAT packs queries by shared prefix to reduce repeated memory accesses, runs a customized multi-tile kernel to achieve high resource efficiency. It further applies practical multi-stream forwarding and KV splitting to reduce resource bubbles. The final merge performs online softmax with negligible overhead. We implement PAT as an off-the-shelf plugin for vLLM.

We do this by reformulating the implicit time integration equations in terms of the individual forces in the system, to which applying Gauss-Seidel iterations naturally leads to a PBD-type algorithm. As we demonstrate, our method allows simulation of data-driven cloth models [Sperl et al. 2020] that cannot be represented by existing variations of position-based dynamics, enabling performance improvements over the baseline Newton-based solver for high mesh resolutions.

Researchers sometimes aim to estimate per-key quantiles (i.e. quantile estimation for every distinct key), and some popular use cases, such as tail latency measurement, recline on a predefined single quantile (e.g. 0.95- or 0.99- quantile) rather than demanding arbitrary quantile estimation. However, existing algorithms are not specially designed for per-key estimation centered at one point. They cannot achieve high accuracy in our problem setting, and their throughput are not satisfactory to handle high-speed items in data streams. To solve this problem, we propose MagnifierSketch for point-quantile estimation. MagnifierSketch supports both single-key and per-key quantile estimation, and its key techniques are named Value Focus, Distribution Calibration and Double Filtration. We provide strict mathematical derivations to prove the unbiasedness of MagnifierSketch and show its space and time complexity. Our experimental results show that the Average Error (AE) of MagnifierSketch is significantly lower than the state-of-the-art in both single-key and per-key situations.

Despite advancements in repository-level code translation, validating the translations remains challenging. This paper proposes TRAM, which combines context-aware type resolution with mock-based in-isolation validation to achieve high-quality translations between programming languages. Prior to translation, TRAM retrieves API documentation and contextual code information for each variable type in the source language. It then prompts a large language model (LLM) with retrieved contextual information to resolve type mappings across languages with precise semantic interpretations. Using the automatically constructed type mapping, TRAM employs a custom serialization/deserialization workflow that automatically constructs equivalent mock objects in the target language. This enables each method fragment to be validated in isolation, without the high cost of using agents for translation validation, or the heavy manual effort required by existing approaches that rely on language interoperability.

While these gigapixel images on one hand offer a comprehensive portrait of cancer, on the other hand, the extremely large size, as much as more than 10 billion pixels, make it challenging and time-consuming to navigate to corresponding regions to support diverse clinical inspection. Inspired by pathologists who conducted navigation on WSIs with a combination of sampling, reasoning and self-reflection, we proposed \"PathReasoning\", a multi-modal reasoning agent that iteratively navigates across WSIs through multiple rounds of reasoning and refinements. Specifically, starting with randomly sampled candidate regions, PathReasoning reviews current selections with self-reflection, reasoning over the correspondence between visual observations and clinical questions, and concludes by proposing new regions to explore. Across rounds, PathReasoning builds a reasoning chain that gradually directs attention to diagnostically relevant areas. PathReasoning turns each whole slide into a sequence of question-guided views, allowing the model to efficiently find informative ROIs within a fixed number of steps, without the need for dense pixel-level annotations.

In this paper, we first conduct a large-scale measurement study with up to 50 million live streams. We find that loss shows dynamics and live streaming contains frequent on-off mode switching in the wild. We further find that the recovery latency, enlarged by the ubiquitous retransmission loss, is a critical factor affecting live streaming's client-side QoE (e.g., video freezing). We then propose an enhanced recovery mechanism called AutoRec, which can transform the disadvantages of on-off mode switching into an advantage for reducing loss recovery latency without any modifications on the client side. AutoRec allows users to customize overhead tolerance and recovery latency tolerance and adaptively adjusts strategies as the network environment changes to ensure that recovery latency meets user demands whenever possible while keeping overhead under control. We implement AutoRec upon QUIC and evaluate it via testbed and real-world commercial services deployments.

The intricate coupling between geometric and topological elements in B-rep structures has forced existing generative methods to rely on cascaded multi-stage networks, resulting in error accumulation and computational inefficiency. We present BrepGPT, a single-stage autoregressive framework for B-rep generation. Our key innovation lies in the Voronoi Half-Patch (VHP) representation, which decomposes B-reps into unified local units by assigning geometry to nearest half-edges and sampling their next pointers. Unlike hierarchical representations that require multiple distinct encodings for different structural levels, our VHP representation facilitates unifying geometric attributes and topological relations in a single, coherent format. We further leverage dual VQ-VAEs to encode both vertex topology and Voronoi Half-Patches into vertex-based tokens, achieving a more compact sequential encoding.

A survey of progress in space complexity", "comment": null, "summary": "Algorithm research focuses primarily on how many operations processors need to do (time complexity). But for many problems, both the runtime and energy used are dominated by memory accesses. In this paper, we present the first broad survey of how algorithmic progress has improved memory usage (space complexity). We analyze 118 of the most important algorithm problems in computer science, reviewing the 800+ algorithms used to solve them.\n  Our results show that space complexity has become much more important in recent years as worries have arisen about memory access bottle-necking performance (the ``memory wall''). In 20% of cases we find that space complexity improvements for large problems (n=1 billion) outpaced improvements in DRAM access speed, suggesting that for these problems algorithmic progress played a larger role than hardware progress in minimizing memory access delays. Increasingly, we also see the emergence of algorithmic Pareto frontiers, where getting better asymptotic time complexity for a problem requires getting worse asymptotic space complexity, and vice-versa. This tension implies that programmers will increasingly need to consider multiple algorithmic options to understand which is best for their particular problem.

However, many domain scientists lack the programming expertise required to develop custom data analysis workflows, creating barriers to timely and effective insight. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by generating executable code from natural language descriptions. In this paper, we investigate the trustworthiness of open-source LLMs in autonomously producing Python scripts for scientific data analysis and visualization. We construct a benchmark suite of domain-inspired prompts that reflect real-world research tasks and systematically evaluate the executability and correctness of the generated code. Our findings show that, without human intervention, the reliability of LLM-generated code is limited, with frequent failures caused by ambiguous prompts and the models' insufficient understanding of domain-specific contexts. To address these challenges, we design and assess three complementary strategies: data-aware prompt disambiguation, retrieval-augmented prompt enhancement, and iterative error repair. While these methods significantly improve execution success rates and output quality, further refinement is needed.

This difficulty mainly arises because most existing planning frameworks operate in an open-loop manner, making it hard to cope with environmental uncertainties such as wind disturbances or external perturbations. This paper presents a unified real-time navigation framework for quadrotors in unknown complex environments, based on the online construction of guiding vector fields (GVFs) from discrete reference path points. In the framework, onboard perception modules build a Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) representation of the environment, which enables obstacle awareness and path distance evaluation. The system first generates discrete, collision-free path points using a global planner, and then parameterizes them via uniform B-splines to produce a smooth and physically feasible reference trajectory. An adaptive GVF is then synthesized from the ESDF and the optimized B-spline trajectory. Unlike conventional approaches, the method adopts a closed-loop navigation paradigm, which significantly enhances robustness under external disturbances. Compared with conventional GVF methods, the proposed approach directly accommodates discretized paths and maintains compatibility with standard planning algorithms.

Powered by Large Language and Vision-Language Models, IoA enables the development of interactive, rational agents capable of complex cooperation, moving far beyond traditional isolated models. IoA involves physical entities, i.e., Wireless Agents (WAs) with limited onboard resources, which need to offload their compute-intensive agentic AI services to nearby servers. Such servers can be Mobile Agents (MAs), e.g., vehicle agents, or Fixed Agents (FAs), e.g., end-side units agents. Given their fixed geographical locations and stable connectivity, FAs can serve as reliable communication gateways and task aggregation points. This stability allows them to effectively coordinate with and offload to an Aerial Agent (AA) tier, which has an advantage not affordable for highly mobile MAs with dynamic connectivity limitations. As such, we propose a two-tier optimization approach. The first tier employs a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game. In the game, MAs and FAs act as the leaders who set resource prices. WAs are the followers to determine task offloading ratios. However, when FAs become overloaded, they can further offload tasks to available aerial resources. Therefore, the second tier introduces a Double Dutch Auction model where overloaded FAs act as the buyers to request resources, and AAs serve as the sellers for resource provision. We then develop a diffusion-based Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm to solve the model. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme in facilitating task offloading.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u5c42\u6b21\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff08Stackelberg\u535a\u5f08+\u53cc\u8377\u5170\u62cd\u5356\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u7ebf\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u5378\u8f7d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u7ebf\u4ee3\u7406\uff08WAs\uff09\u56e0\u6709\u9650\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u8981\u5378\u8f7d\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u79fb\u52a8\u4ee3\u7406\uff08MAs\uff09\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u4ee3\u7406\uff08FAs\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fde\u63a5\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5378\u8f7d\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u5c42\u6b21\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u5c42\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u591a\u8ddf\u968f\u8005Stackelberg\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5c42\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u8377\u5170\u62cd\u5356\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4efb\u52a1\u5378\u8f7d\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u5c42\u6b21\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Stackelberg\u535a\u5f08\u548c\u53cc\u8377\u5170\u62cd\u5356\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u5378\u8f7d\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

In contrast, complex requests often require the superior capability of cloud models, incurring higher latency and cost. To navigate this quality-cost trade-off under dynamic network conditions, we propose a cloud-edge synergy for NetGPT that integrates network-aware routing with on-edge self-improvement. Specifically, our framework routes structured tool-calling requests to cloud or edge agents via a novel scoring policy. We prove that, under mild regularity assumptions, the optimal routing rule admits a unique fallback threshold with monotone dependence on bandwidth and round-trip time (RTT). Concurrently, based on the dataset collected from requests routed to the cloud and corresponding responses, we instantiate a schema-preserving reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the capability of the edge agent. We analyze a supervised finetuning (SFT)-anchored composite objective that combines a reverse-KL trust-region step with a forward-KL realignment toward the SFT prior, explaining stability and constraining policy drift. Both the network-aware routing policy and the edge agent are updated coherently.

Recent advances introduced per-primitive textures that incorporate spatial color variations within each Gaussian, improving their expressiveness. However, texture-based Gaussians parameterize appearance with a uniform per-Gaussian sampling grid, allocating equal sampling density regardless of local visual complexity. This leads to inefficient texture space utilization, where high-frequency regions are under-sampled and smooth regions waste capacity, causing blurred appearance and loss of fine structural detail. We introduce FACT-GS, a Frequency-Aligned Complexity-aware Texture Gaussian Splatting framework that allocates texture sampling density according to local visual frequency. Grounded in adaptive sampling theory, FACT-GS reformulates texture parameterization as a differentiable sampling-density allocation problem, replacing the uniform textures with a learnable frequency-aware allocation strategy implemented via a deformation field whose Jacobian modulates local sampling density. Built on 2D Gaussian Splatting, FACT-GS performs non-uniform sampling on fixed-resolution texture grids, preserving real-time performance while recovering sharper high-frequency details under the same parameter budget.", "AI": {"tldr": "FACT-GS\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u91c7\u6837\u4f18\u5316\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u6a21\u7cca\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u9891\u533a\u57df\u6b20\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u5e73\u6ed1\u533a\u57df\u5bb9\u91cf\u6d6a\u8d39\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7ec6\u8282\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "FACT-GS\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5f62\u573a\u7684\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u8c03\u8282\u5c40\u90e8\u91c7\u6837\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "result": "FACT-GS\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7eb9\u7406\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u6062\u590d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "FACT-GS\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u91c7\u6837\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6280\u672f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u6062\u590d\u3002"}}

For one-dimensional strings, it is now known how to build a structure of size $\\mathcal{O}(g)$ that provides random access in $\\mathcal{O}(\\log N)$ time. In fact, it is known that this can be obtained by building an equivalent SLP of size $\\mathcal{O}(g)$ and depth $\\mathcal{O}(\\log N)$ [Ganardi, Je\u017c, Lohrey, JACM 2021]. We consider the analogous question for two-dimensional strings: can we build an equivalent SLP of roughly the same size and small depth?\n  We show that the answer is negative: there exists an infinite family of two-dimensional strings of size $N\\times N$ described by a 2D SLP of size $g$ such that any 2D SLP describing the same string of depth $\\mathcal{O}(\\log N)$ must be of size $\u03a9(g\\cdot N/\\log^{3}N)$. We complement this with an upper bound showing how to construct such a 2D SLP of size $\\mathcal{O}(g\\cdot N)$. Next, we observe that one can naturally define a generalization of 2D SLP, which we call 2D SLP with holes. We show that a known general balancing theorem by [Ganardi, Je\u017c, Lohrey, JACM 2021] immediately implies that, given a 2D SLP of size $g$ deriving a string of size $N\\times N$, we can construct a 2D SLP with holes of depth $\\mathcal{O}(\\log N)$ and size $\\mathcal{O}(g)$. This allows us to conclude that there is a structure of size $\\mathcal{O}(g)$ providing random access in $\\mathcal{O}(\\log N)$ time for such a 2D SLP. Further, this can be extended (analogously as for a 1D SLP) to obtain a structure of size $\\mathcal{O}(g \\log^\u03b5N)$ providing random access in $\\mathcal{O}(\\log N/\\log \\log N)$ time, for any $\u03b5>0$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u7684SLP\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5c0f\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5e26\u5b54\u76842D SLP\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u662f\u5426\u4e5f\u80fd\u50cf\u4e00\u7ef4\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u9ad8\u6548\u7684SLP\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u968f\u673a\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u7684SLP\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5e26\u5b54\u76842D SLP\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5c0f\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301SLP\u5927\u5c0f\uff1b\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u5e26\u5b54\u76842D SLP\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e3aO(log N)\u4e14\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0e\u539f\u59cbSLP\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u7b49\u6548SLP\uff1b\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5e26\u5b54\u76842D SLP\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0O(g)\u5927\u5c0f\u548cO(log N)\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u968f\u673a\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002"}}

We propose Soft-Nash Virtual Fixtures, a game-theoretic shared-control policy that softens the classic two-player linear-quadratic (LQ) Nash solution by inflating the fixture's effort weight with a single, interpretable scalar parameter $\u03c4$. This yields a continuous dial on controller assertiveness: $\u03c4=0$ recovers a hard, performance-focused Nash / virtual fixture controller, while larger $\u03c4$ reduce gains and pushback, yet preserve the equilibrium structure and continuity of closed-loop stability. We derive Soft-Nash from both a KL-regularized trust-region and a maximum-entropy viewpoint, obtaining a closed-form robot best response that shrinks authority and aligns the fixture with the operator's input as $\u03c4$ grows. We implement Soft-Nash on a 6-DoF haptic device in 3D tracking task ($n=12$). Moderate softness ($\u03c4\\approx 1-3$, especially $\u03c4=2$) maintains tracking error statistically indistinguishable from a tuned classic VF while sharply reducing controller-user conflict, lowering NASA-TLX workload, and increasing Sense of Agency (SoAS). A composite BalancedScore that combines normalized accuracy and non-fighting behavior peaks near $\u03c4=2-3$.

However, the integration of diffusion models faces critical challenges into resource-constrained mobile and edge environments because it requires multiple denoising steps from the original random noise. A practical way to speed up denoising is to initialize the process with a noised reference image that is similar to the target, since both images share similar layouts, structures, and details, allowing for fewer denoising steps. Based on this idea, we present CacheGenius, a hybrid image generation system in edge computing that accelerates generation by combining text-toimage and image-to-image workflows. It generates images from user text prompts using cached reference images. CacheGenius introduces a semantic-aware classified storage scheme and a request-scheduling algorithm that ensures semantic alignment between references and targets.

However, the stateless nature of LLMs makes managing user context (e.g., sessions, preferences) across geo-distributed edge nodes challenging. Existing solutions, such as client-side context storage, often introduce network latency and bandwidth overhead, undermining the advantages of edge deployment.\n  We propose DisCEdge, a distributed context management system that stores and replicates user context in tokenized form across edge nodes. By maintaining context as token sequences rather than raw text, our system avoids redundant computation and enables efficient data replication.

Given a graph $G$ and a vertex set $X \\subseteq V(G)$, consider the collection of subsets of the form $N(u) \\cap X$ where $u$ ranges over all vertices outside $X$. These intersections, which we call the traces of $X$, capture all ways vertices in $G$ connect to $X$, and in this paper we consider the problem of listing these traces efficiently, and the related problem of recording the multiplicity (frequency) of each trace. For a given query set $X$, both problems have obvious algorithms with running time $O(|N(X)| \\cdot |X|)$ and conditional lower bounds suggest that, on general graphs, one cannot expect better. However, in certain sparse graph classes, more efficient algorithms are possible: Drange \\etal (IPEC 2023) used a data structure that answers trace queries in $d$-degenerate graphs with linear initialisation time and query time that only depends on the query set $X$ and $d$. However, the query time is exponential in $|X|$, which makes this approach impractical. By using a stronger parameter than degeneracy, namely the strong $2$-colouring number $s_2$, we construct a data structure in $O(d \\cdot \\|G\\|)$ time, which answers subsequent trace frequency queries in time $O\\big((d^2 + s_2^{d+2})|X|\\big)$, where $\\|G\\|$ is the number of edges of $G$, $s_2$ is the strong $2$-colouring number and $d$ the degeneracy of a suitable ordering of $G$. We demonstrate that this data structure is indeed practical and that it beats the simple, obvious alternative in almost all tested settings, using a collection of 217 real-world networks with up to 1.1M edges. As part of this effort, we demonstrate that computing an ordering with a small strong $2$-colouring number is feasible with a simple heuristic.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a2-\u7740\u8272\u6570\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u67e5\u8be2\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u4e2d\u9876\u70b9\u96c6\u7684\u8ff9\u53ca\u5176\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9876\u70b9\u4e0e\u9876\u70b9\u96c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u662f\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u7c7b\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a2-\u7740\u8272\u6570\uff08s2\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aO(d\u00b7||G||)\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3aO((d\u00b2 + s2^{d+2})|X|)\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728217\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u6700\u591a110\u4e07\u6761\u8fb9\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f3a2-\u7740\u8272\u6570\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a2-\u7740\u8272\u6570\uff08s2\uff09\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u7c7b\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5217\u51fa\u548c\u8bb0\u5f55\u9876\u70b9\u96c6\u7684\u8ff9\u53ca\u5176\u9891\u7387\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5b9e\u9645\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Through parameter-efficient adaptation, 4-bit QLoRA, and DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 CPU offloading, we train 22k-token contexts on a single 20 GB GPU. On the ApacheJIT benchmark, DRS-OSS achieves state-of-the-art performance (F1 = 0.64, ROC-AUC = 0.89). Simulations show that gating only the riskiest 30% of commits can prevent up to 86.4% of defect-inducing changes.

We explore the biological basis of hand synergies and human gesture analysis, translating joint-level coordination and structural attributes into a modular finger architecture.

Traditional multi-view or inpainting-based approaches struggle under such conditions, often yielding incomplete or geometrically inconsistent reconstructions. We introduce AmodalGen3D, a generative framework for amodal 3D object reconstruction that infers complete, occlusion-free geometry and appearance from arbitrary sparse inputs. The model integrates 2D amodal completion priors with multi-view stereo geometry conditioning, supported by a View-Wise Cross Attention mechanism for sparse-view feature fusion and a Stereo-Conditioned Cross Attention module for unobserved structure inference. By jointly modeling visible and hidden regions, AmodalGen3D faithfully reconstructs 3D objects that are consistent with sparse-view constraints while plausibly hallucinating unseen parts. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that AmodalGen3D achieves superior fidelity and completeness under occlusion-heavy sparse-view settings, addressing a pressing need for object-level 3D scene reconstruction in robotics, AR/VR, and embodied AI applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "AmodalGen3D\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u5b8c\u6574\u3001\u65e0\u906e\u6321\u76843D\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u5916\u89c2\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3001AR/VR\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u906e\u6321\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u6574\u4e14\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0cAmodalGen3D\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u4e862D\u6a21\u6001\u8865\u5168\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u7acb\u4f53\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528View-Wise Cross Attention\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caStereo-Conditioned Cross Attention\u6a21\u5757\u63a8\u65ad\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cAmodalGen3D\u5728\u906e\u6321\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AmodalGen3D\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u54082D\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u5b8c\u65743D\u7269\u4f53\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3001AR/VR\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Mesh-based MC (MMC) offers enhanced precision for complex tissue structures using tetrahedral mesh models. Despite significant speedups achieved on graphics processing units (GPUs), MMC performance remains hindered by the computational cost of frequent ray-boundary intersection tests.\n  Aim: We propose a highly accelerated MMC algorithm, RT-MMC, that leverages the hardware-accelerated ray traversal and intersection capabilities of ray-tracing cores (RT-cores) on modern GPUs.\n  Approach: Implemented using NVIDIA's OptiX platform, RT-MMC extends graphics ray-tracing pipelines towards volumetric ray-tracing in turbid media, eliminating the need for challenging tetrahedral mesh generation while delivering significant speed improvements through hardware acceleration. It also intrinsically supports wide-field sources without complex mesh retesselation.\n  Results: RT-MMC demonstrates excellent agreement with traditional software-ray-tracing MMC algorithms while achieving 1.5x to 4.5x speedups across multiple GPU architectures. These performance gains significantly enhance the practicality of MMC for routine simulations.\n  Conclusion: Migration from software- to hardware-based ray-tracing not only greatly simplifies MMC simulation workflows, but also results in significant speedups that are expected to increase further as ray-tracing hardware rapidly gains adoption.

The \\emph{temporal exploration problem} asks for the length of the shortest sequence of vertices that starts at a given vertex, visits every vertex, and at each time step $t$ either stays at the current vertex or moves to an adjacent vertex in $G_t$. Bounds on the length of a shortest temporal exploration have been investigated extensively. Perhaps the most fundamental case is when each graph $G_t$ is connected and has bounded maximum degree. In this setting, Erlebach, Kammer, Luo, Sajenko, and Spooner [ICALP 2019] showed that there exists an exploration of $G$ in $\\mathcal{O}(n^{7/4})$ time steps. We significantly improve this bound by showing that $\\mathcal{O}(n^{3/2} \\sqrt{\\log n})$ time steps suffice.\n  In fact, we deduce this result from a much more general statement. Let the \\emph{average temporal maximum degree} $D$ of $G$ be the average of $\\max_{t \\in I} d_{G_t}(v)$ over all vertices $v \\in V(G)$, where $d_{G_t}(v)$ denotes the degree of $v$ in $G_t$. If each graph $G_t$ is connected, we show that there exists an exploration of $G$ in $\\mathcal{O}(n^{3/2} \\sqrt{D \\log n})$ time steps. In particular, this gives the first subquadratic upper bound when the underlying graph has bounded average degree. As a special case, this also improves the previous best bounds when the underlying graph is planar or has bounded treewidth and provides a unified approach for all of these settings.

Local caching of responses offers a practical solution to reduce the cost and latency of LLM queries. In research contexts, caching also enhances reproducibility and provides flexibility for experimentation. However, naive reuse of cached responses compromises statistical independence, a critical property for probabilistic workflows. In applications of LLM for code, it underpins performance metrics such as Pass@k and uncertainty estimation, as well as algorithms like program repair loops and retries. Existing LLM caching systems lack ways to enforce statistical independence constraints. To address this, we introduce Mnimi, a cache design pattern that supports modular LLM workflows while ensuring statistical integrity at the component level. Its core innovation lies in encapsulating statistical constraints within the type of LLM references, allowing users to manage and transform these types according to the scope and requirements of their algorithm. We implemented this design pattern in Python using a combination of decorators and iterators over infinite sequences.

Smith"], "title": "TAPVid-360: Tracking Any Point in 360 from Narrow Field of View Video", "comment": null, "summary": "Humans excel at constructing panoramic mental models of their surroundings, maintaining object permanence and inferring scene structure beyond visible regions. In contrast, current artificial vision systems struggle with persistent, panoramic understanding, often processing scenes egocentrically on a frame-by-frame basis. This limitation is pronounced in the Track Any Point (TAP) task, where existing methods fail to track 2D points outside the field of view. To address this, we introduce TAPVid-360, a novel task that requires predicting the 3D direction to queried scene points across a video sequence, even when far outside the narrow field of view of the observed video. This task fosters learning allocentric scene representations without needing dynamic 4D ground truth scene models for training.

This leads to theoretical challenges in the multi-agent setting where the non-stationarity induced by the learning of other agents demands prospective learning based on prediction models. To accurately model other agents, an agent must account for the fact that those other agents are, in turn, forming beliefs about it to predict its future behavior, motivating agents to model themselves as part of the environment. Here, building upon foundational work on universal artificial intelligence (AIXI), we introduce a mathematical framework for prospective learning and embedded agency centered on self-prediction, where Bayesian RL agents predict both future perceptual inputs and their own actions, and must therefore resolve epistemic uncertainty about themselves as part of the universe they inhabit. We show that in multi-agent settings, self-prediction enables agents to reason about others running similar algorithms, leading to new game-theoretic solution concepts and novel forms of cooperation unattainable by classical decoupled agents. Moreover, we extend the theory of AIXI, and study universally intelligent embedded agents which start from a Solomonoff prior. We show that these idealized agents can form consistent mutual predictions and achieve infinite-order theory of mind, potentially setting a gold standard for embedded multi-agent learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u6211\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u4ee3\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u5728\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u5408\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55AIXI\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4e3a\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u5b9a\u7406\u60f3\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u5047\u8bbe\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\u662f\u9759\u6001\u7684\uff0c\u4e14\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u975e\u9759\u6001\u6027\u9700\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u6a21\u5176\u4ed6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65f6\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u8003\u8651\u8fd9\u4e9b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e5f\u5728\u5f62\u6210\u5173\u4e8e\u5b83\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u5176\u672a\u6765\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6fc0\u52b1\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5c06\u81ea\u8eab\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08AIXI\uff09\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee5\u81ea\u6211\u9884\u6d4b\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u51b3\u5173\u4e8e\u81ea\u8eab\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b87\u5b99\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u81ea\u6211\u9884\u6d4b\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u63a8\u7406\u5176\u4ed6\u8fd0\u884c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u65b0\u7684\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u89e3\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u89e3\u8026\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5408\u4f5c\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6269\u5c55AIXI\u7406\u8bba\u540e\uff0c\u4eceSolomonoff\u5148\u9a8c\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u591f\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u9884\u6d4b\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9650\u9636\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u6211\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u4ee3\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u65b0\u89e3\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u5408\u4f5c\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u7406\u60f3\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

However, the structural design of these varied services, along with their reliance on auto-scalers for dynamic internet traffic, introduces significant coordination challenges. As we demonstrate in this paper, common default retry patterns used between misaligned services can turn into retry storms which drive up resource usage and costs, leading to self-inflicted Denial-of-Wallet (DoW) scenarios. To overcome these problems we introduce RetryGuard, a distributed framework for productive control of retry patterns across interdependent microservices. By managing retry policy on a per-service basis and making parallel decisions, RetryGuard prevents retry storms, curbs resource contention, and mitigates escalating operational costs. RetryGuard makes its decisions based on an analytic model that captures the relationships among retries, throughput (rejections), delays, and costs. Experimental results show that RetryGuard significantly reduces resource usage and costs compared to AWS standard and advanced retry policies.

However, state-of-the-art serving systems co-batch heterogeneous adapters without accounting for rank (size) variability, leading to severe performance skew, which ultimately requires adding more GPUs to satisfy service-level objectives (SLOs). Existing optimizations, focused on loading, caching, and kernel execution, ignore this heterogeneity, leaving GPU resources underutilized. We present LoRAServe, a workload-aware dynamic adapter placement and routing framework designed to tame rank diversity in LoRA serving. By dynamically rebalancing adapters across GPUs and leveraging GPU Direct RDMA for remote access, LoRAServe maximizes throughput and minimizes tail latency under real-world workload drift.

A fault-tolerant (FT) spanner preserves approximate distances under network failures, often used in applications like network design and distributed systems. While classic (fault-free) spanners are believed to be easily extended to hypergraphs such as by the method of associated graphs, we reveal that this is not the case in the fault-tolerant setting: simple methods can only get a linear size in the maximum number of faults $f$. In contrast, all known optimal size of FT spanners are sublinear in $f$. Inspired by the FT clustering technique, we propose a clustering based algorithm that achieves an improved sublinear size bound. For an $n$-node $m$-edge hypergraph with rank $r$ and a sketch parameter $k$, our algorithm constructs edge FT (EFT) hyperspanners of stretch $2k-1$ and size $O(k^2f^{1-1/(rk)}n^{1+1/k}\\log n)$ with high probability in time $\\widetilde{O}(mr^3+fn)$. We also establish a lower bound of $\u03a9(f^{1-1/r-1/rk}n^{1+1/k-o(1)})$ edges for EFT hyperspanners, which leaves a gap of poly$(k)f^{1/r}$. Finally, we provide an algorithm for constructing additive EFT hyperspanners by combining multiplicative EFT hyperspanners with additive hyperspanners.

They help guide responsible vulnerability reporting and build trust among users and contributors. Despite their growing use, it is still unclear how these policies influence the structure and evolution of software dependencies. Software dependencies are external packages or libraries that a project relies on, and their interconnected nature affects both functionality and security. This study explores the relationship between security policies and dependency management in PyPI projects. We analyzed projects with and without a SECURITY.md file by examining their dependency trees and tracking how dependencies change over time. The analysis shows that projects with a security policy tend to rely on a broader set of direct dependencies, while overall depth and transitive dependencies remain similar. Historically, projects created after the introduction of SECURITY.md, particularly later adopters, show more frequent dependency updates. These results suggest that security policies are linked to more modular and feature-rich projects, and highlight the role of SECURITY.md in promoting proactive dependency management and reducing risks in the software supply chain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u62e5\u6709SECURITY.md\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\u4f9d\u8d56\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u66f4\u65b0\u66f4\u9891\u7e41\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5177\u6709\u548c\u4e0d\u5177\u6709SECURITY.md\u6587\u4ef6\u7684PyPI\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6811\uff0c\u5e76\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4f9d\u8d56\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5177\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u800c\u603b\u4f53\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u4f20\u9012\u4f9d\u8d56\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\uff0cSECURITY.md\u5f15\u5165\u540e\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u9879\u76ee\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u540e\u671f\u91c7\u7528\u8005\uff09\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u66f4\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982SECURITY.md\u6587\u4ef6\uff09\u4e0e\u66f4\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5e76\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86SECURITY.md\u5728\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e3b\u52a8\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u98ce\u9669\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Robots employ a conjugate prior to gradually predict the times between events and derive confidence estimates to adapt their behavior. Our simulation results show that the robot swarm consistently chooses the correct area while reducing exposure to hazardous events by being sample-efficient.

Traditional walkability assessments rely on surveys and field audits, which are costly and difficult to scale. Recent studies have used satellite imagery, street view imagery, or population indicators to estimate walkability, but these single-source approaches capture only one dimension of the walking environment. Satellite data describe the built environment from above, but overlook the pedestrian perspective. Street view imagery captures conditions at the ground level, but lacks broader spatial context. Population dynamics reveal patterns of human activity but not the visual form of the environment. We introduce WalkCLIP, a multimodal framework that integrates these complementary viewpoints to predict urban walkability. WalkCLIP learns walkability-aware vision-language representations from GPT-4o generated image captions, refines these representations with a spatial aggregation module that incorporates neighborhood context, and fuses the resulting features with representations from a population dynamics foundation model. Evaluated at 4,660 locations throughout Minneapolis-Saint Paul, WalkCLIP outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines in both predictive accuracy and spatial alignment. These results show that the integration of visual and behavioral signals yields reliable predictions of the walking environment.", "AI": {"tldr": "WalkCLIP\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u536b\u661f\u3001\u8857\u666f\u548c\u4eba\u53e3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u57ce\u5e02\u6b65\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6b65\u884c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u6e90\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u6355\u6349\u6b65\u884c\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u53cd\u6620\u6b65\u884c\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "WalkCLIP\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u8857\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4eba\u53e3\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7GPT-4o\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6807\u9898\u5b66\u4e60\u6b65\u884c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u4eba\u53e3\u52a8\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u660e\u5c3c\u963f\u6ce2\u5229\u65af-\u5723\u4fdd\u7f57\u76844,660\u4e2a\u5730\u70b9\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cWalkCLIP\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "WalkCLIP\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u6b65\u884c\u73af\u5883\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, GUI agents still face significant challenges in handling long-horizon tasks. First, single-agent models struggle to balance high-level capabilities and low-level execution capability, facing prevalent issues of responsibility coupling and capability conflicts. Second, agents lack awareness of the task state, leading to progress loss in long-horizon tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a staged execution-feedback reinforcement learning algorithm. Unlike training a unified policy model, we focus on training high-level scheduling models. Specifically, we propose and train two agents: a Coordinator, responsible for the strategic planning and task decomposition; and a State Tracker, responsible for context compression and information management to maintain the task's state and coherence. Based on this, we built the Coordinator-Executor-State Tracker (CES) multi-agent framework, which can be integrated with any low-level Executor model, assisting the Executor in solving long-horizon tasks through task scheduling and state management. Experiments on long-horizon task benchmarks demonstrate that CES significantly enhances the system's planning and state management capabilities. Furthermore, analysis confirms that our trained high-level scheduling module is a generalizable, plug-and-play module that significantly enhances the long-horizon capabilities of various Executors.

This paper investigates multi-armed bandit (MAB) strategies as a data-driven approach for decentralized, online channel access optimization in Wi-Fi, targeting dynamic channel access settings: primary channel, channel width, and contention window (CW) adjustment. Key design aspects are examined, including the adoption of joint versus factorial action spaces, the inclusion of contextual information, and the nature of the action-selection strategy (optimism-driven, unimodal, or randomized). State-of-the-art algorithms and a proposed lightweight contextual approach, E-RLB, are evaluated through simulations. Results show that contextual and optimism-driven strategies consistently achieve the highest performance and fastest adaptation under recurrent conditions. Unimodal structures require careful graph construction to ensure that the unimodality assumption holds. Randomized exploration, adopted in the proposed E-RLB, can induce disruptive parameter reallocations, especially in multi-player settings. Decomposing the action space across several specialized agents accelerates convergence but increases sensitivity to randomized exploration and demands coordination under shared rewards to avoid correlated learning. Finally, despite its inherent inefficiencies from epsilon-greedy exploration, E-RLB demonstrates effective adaptation and learning, highlighting its potential as a viable low-complexity solution for realistic dynamic deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5E-RLB\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eWi-Fi\u4fe1\u9053\u8bbf\u95ee\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u4e50\u89c2\u9a71\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f73\uff0cE-RLB\u867d\u4f4e\u6548\u4f46\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u6709\u9650\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u6700\u8fd1\u5f15\u8d77\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5173\u6ce8\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\uff08MAB\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eWi-Fi\u4e2d\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u3001\u5728\u7ebf\u4fe1\u9053\u8bbf\u95ee\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e3b\u4fe1\u9053\u3001\u4fe1\u9053\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u7a97\u53e3\uff08CW\uff09\u8c03\u6574\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5E-RLB\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u4e50\u89c2\u9a71\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u91cd\u590d\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u59cb\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6700\u5feb\u9002\u5e94\u3002\u5355\u5cf0\u7ed3\u6784\u9700\u8981\u4ed4\u7ec6\u7684\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5355\u5cf0\u5047\u8bbe\u6210\u7acb\u3002\u968f\u673a\u63a2\u7d22\uff08\u5982E-RLB\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u7684\uff09\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7834\u574f\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u591a\u73a9\u5bb6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1E-RLB\u5b58\u5728\u03b5-\u8d2a\u5a6a\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u4f4e\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u52a8\u6001\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Conflicting subDAGs are resolved by a closest common ancestor (CCA)-local, window-filtered fork choice that compares the weight of each subDAG -- the number of recent short references -- and prefers the heavier one. Combined with a structural invariant we call Tip-Boundedness (TB), this yields a bounded-width frontier and allows honest work to aggregate quickly.\n  We formalize an idealized protocol (Areon-Ideal) that abstracts away network delay and reference bounds, and a practical protocol (Areon-Base) that adds VRF-based eligibility, bounded short and long references, and application-level validity and conflict checks at the block level. On top of DAG analogues of the classical common-prefix, chain-growth, and chain-quality properties, we prove a backbone-style $(k,\\varepsilon)$-finality theorem that calibrates confirmation depth as a function of the window length and target tail probability. We focus on consensus at the level of blocks; extending the framework to richer transaction selection, sampling, and redundancy policies is left to future work.\n  Finally, we build a discrete-event simulator and compare Areon-Base against a chain-based baseline (Ouroboros Praos) under matched block-arrival rates.

In this paper, we consider the \\textsc{Minimum Cover Spanning Tree} problem (MCST for short). Given a graph $G$ and a positive integer $k$, the problem determines whether $G$ has a spanning tree with a vertex cover of size at most $k$. We reveal the equivalence between \\mcst\\ and the \\textsc{Dominating Set} problem when $G$ is of diameter at most~$2$ or $P_5$-free.

Adaptive Resonance Theory-based Topological Clustering with Different Topologies (ATC-DT) builds global topological maps represented as graphs while mitigating catastrophic forgetting during sequential processing. However, its winner selection mechanism relies on an exhaustive nearest-neighbor search over all existing nodes, leading to scalability limitations as the map grows. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical extension called Multi-Layer ATC (MLATC). MLATC organizes nodes into a hierarchy, enabling the nearest-neighbor search to proceed from coarse to fine resolutions, thereby drastically reducing the number of distance evaluations per query. The number of layers is not fixed in advance. MLATC employs an adaptive layer addition mechanism that automatically deepens the hierarchy when lower layers become saturated, keeping the number of user-defined hyperparameters low. Simulation experiments on synthetic large-scale environments show that MLATC accelerates topological map building compared to the original ATC-DT and exhibits a sublinear, approximately logarithmic scaling of search time with respect to the number of nodes. Experiments on campus-scale real-world LiDAR datasets confirm that MLATC maintains a millisecond-level per-frame runtime and enables real-time global topological map building in large-scale environments, significantly outperforming the original ATC-DT in terms of computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "MLATC\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u4f18\u5316ATC-DT\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3ATC-DT\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u5c40\u62d3\u6251\u5730\u56fe\u65f6\u56e0\u5168\u91cf\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u641c\u7d22\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMLATC\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8282\u70b9\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ddd\u79bb\u8ba1\u7b97\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMLATC\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9eLiDAR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eATC-DT\uff0c\u641c\u7d22\u65f6\u95f4\u968f\u8282\u70b9\u6570\u5448\u4e9a\u7ebf\u6027\uff08\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5bf9\u6570\uff09\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6beb\u79d2\u7ea7\u5355\u5e27\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "MLATC\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5c42\u6dfb\u52a0\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86ATC-DT\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u5168\u5c40\u62d3\u6251\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u3002"}}

However, the effectiveness of agents remains tightly coupled with the quality of training data, while curating task-specific datasets remains costly and often infeasible in real-world scenarios. Recent work has explored self-improving agents that autonomously generate, refine, and re-train on their own trajectories. A prominent line of approaches further leverages preference optimization by pairing predicted trajectories with scarce ground-truth trajectories, enabling agents to learn directly from their own failures. While these methods outperform supervised fine-tuning, their heavy reliance on predicted trajectories under limited ground-truth supervision leaves them prone to overfitting. To address this, we propose a co-evolving agents framework in which a target agent improves jointly with an auxiliary failure agent. The failure agent learns through preference optimization over failure trajectories from both the target and itself, thereby generating hard negatives that are close to success yet remain failures. Incorporating these informative hard negatives into the target agent's optimization sharpens decision boundaries and enhances generalization. Our comprehensive analysis and experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method not only shows improved performance but also demonstrates that failures, instead of being used as-is, can be systematically transformed into structured and valuable learning signals in self-improving agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5171\u8fdb\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f85\u52a9\u5931\u8d25\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u786c\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee3\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u6d4b\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5730\u9762\u771f\u5b9e\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u5931\u8d25\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5171\u8fdb\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0e\u8f85\u52a9\u5931\u8d25\u4ee3\u7406\u5171\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u5931\u8d25\u4ee3\u7406\u901a\u8fc7\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u63a5\u8fd1\u6210\u529f\u4f46\u4ecd\u4e3a\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u786c\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5931\u8d25\u8f68\u8ff9\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5171\u8fdb\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f85\u52a9\u5931\u8d25\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u4ee3\u7406\u5171\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5c06\u5931\u8d25\u8f68\u8ff9\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e14\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u76ee\u6807\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Deterministic communication across heterogeneous 5G-TSN systems requires joint scheduling between both domains. A key prerequisite for time-aware end-to-end scheduling is determining the forwarding delay for each TSN Traffic Class at every bridge, referred to as Bridge Delay (BD). Hence, to integrate 5G as a transparent TSN bridge, the 5G BD must be determined and guaranteed. Unlike wired bridges, the 5G BD relies on wireless resource management characteristics, such as the Time Division Duplex pattern and radio resource allocation procedure. In particular, traditional Uplink (UL) schedulers are optimized for throughput but often fail to meet the deadline requirements. To address this challenge, we propose a heterogeneous radio resource scheduler that integrates static and dynamic scheduling. The algorithm pre-allocates resources for time-sensitive periodic streams based on the reported BDs, ensuring alignment with the TSN mechanisms Time-Aware Shaper and Per-Stream Filtering and Policing. Meanwhile, remaining resources are dynamically allocated to non-deterministic flows using established strategies such as Proportional Fair, Max C/I, or a Quality of Service-aware priority-based scheduler. The scheduler's performance is evaluated through OMNeT++ simulations. The results demonstrate support for diverse TSN flows while ensuring deadline-aware scheduling of time-sensitive UL traffic in mobility scenarios. Periodic time-sensitive flows are end-to-end scheduled across domains, improving the resource efficiency by 28% compared to the Configured Grant baseline. While reliability is preserved, non-deterministic rate-sensitive flows benefit from the improved resource utilization, resulting in higher throughput", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u65e0\u7ebf\u8d44\u6e90\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e5G-TSN\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u6d41\u91cf\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u57285G-TSN\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u884c\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u622a\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5f02\u6784\u65e0\u7ebf\u8d44\u6e90\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9759\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u62a5\u544a\u7684BD\u9884\u5206\u914d\u8d44\u6e90\uff09\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\uff08\u4f7f\u7528PF\u3001Max C/I\u6216QoS\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u914d\u5269\u4f59\u8d44\u6e90\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7OMNeT++\u4eff\u771f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684TSN\u6d41\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u79fb\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u4e0a\u884c\u6d41\u91cf\u7684\u622a\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u6bd4Configured Grant\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8628%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5f02\u6784\u65e0\u7ebf\u8d44\u6e90\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u4e865G-TSN\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

To overcome this limitation, this paper applies pipeline parallelism (PP) of distributed training to SL in wireless networks, proposing the so-called communication-computation pipeline parallel split learning (C$^2$P$^2$SL). By considering the communicating and computing processes of UEs and BS as an overall pipeline, C$^2$P$^2$SL achieves pipeline parallelization among different micro-batches which are split from each batch of data samples.

Given a CSP instance and two of its solutions, RCSP asks whether one solution can be transformed into the other via a sequence of intermediate solutions, each differing by the assignment of a single variable. RCSP has attracted growing interest in theoretical computer science, and when the variable domain is Boolean, the computational complexity of RCSP exhibits a dichotomy depending on the allowed constraint types. A notable special case is the reconfiguration of graph homomorphisms -- also known as graph recoloring -- which has been studied using topological methods. We propose a novel algebraic approach to RCSP, inspired by techniques used in classical CSP complexity analysis.

In this work we present NOMAD, a cognitively inspired, modular multi-agent framework that decomposes UML generation into a series of role-specialised subtasks. Each agent handles a distinct modelling activity, such as entity extraction, relationship classification, and diagram synthesis, mirroring the goal-directed reasoning processes of an engineer. This decomposition improves interpretability and allows for targeted verification strategies. We evaluate NOMAD through a mixed design: a large case study (Northwind) for in-depth probing and error analysis, and human-authored UML exercises for breadth and realism. NOMAD outperforms all selected baselines, while revealing persistent challenges in fine-grained attribute extraction.

When the control chamber in the valve is pressurized, the main path is compressed along its central axis, buckling and being pressed,resulting in blockage. This allows control by a pressure signal smaller than that within the main channel. Furthermore, similar to transistors in electrical circuits, when combined, the proposed valve can perform a variety of logical operations. The basic type operates as a NOT logic element, which is named the fluidic sheet transistor (FST). By integrating multiple FSTs, logical operations such as positive logic, NAND, and NOR can be performed on a single sheet. This paper describes the operating principle, fabrication method, and characteristics of the FST,followed by a method for configuring logical operations.Moreover, we demonstrate the construction of a latch circuit(self-holding logic circuit) using FST, introducing a prototype of a fluid robot system that combines a tactile tube as a fluidic detector and fluid actuators.

A differentiable rigid-body simulator ensures realistic object interactions under gravity, driving the scene toward static equilibrium without interpenetrations. To further enhance scene quality, we introduce a simulation-in-the-loop optimization procedure that guarantees physical stability and non-intersection, while improving semantic consistency with the input prompt.

A core factor underlying effective recommendation dialogue is the ability to infer and reason about users' mental states (such as desire, intention, and belief), a cognitive capacity commonly referred to as Theory of Mind. Despite growing interest in evaluating ToM in LLMs, current benchmarks predominantly rely on synthetic narratives inspired by Sally-Anne test, which emphasize physical perception and fail to capture the complexity of mental state inference in realistic conversational settings. Moreover, existing benchmarks often overlook a critical component of human ToM: behavioral prediction, the ability to use inferred mental states to guide strategic decision-making and select appropriate conversational actions for future interactions. To better align LLM-based ToM evaluation with human-like social reasoning, we propose RecToM, a novel benchmark for evaluating ToM abilities in recommendation dialogues. RecToM focuses on two complementary dimensions: Cognitive Inference and Behavioral Prediction. The former focus on understanding what has been communicated by inferring the underlying mental states. The latter emphasizes what should be done next, evaluating whether LLMs can leverage these inferred mental states to predict, select, and assess appropriate dialogue strategies. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that RecToM poses a significant challenge. While the models exhibit partial competence in recognizing mental states, they struggle to maintain coherent, strategic ToM reasoning throughout dynamic recommendation dialogues, particularly in tracking evolving intentions and aligning conversational strategies with inferred mental states.", "AI": {"tldr": "RecToM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u8350\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u53d9\u4e8b\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u771f\u5b9e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5fc3\u667a\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e14\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RecToM\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1LLMs\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u5fc3\u667a\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u90e8\u5206\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u63a8\u8350\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "RecToM\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

Censor-Hillel, Cohen, Gelles, and Sel showed that no non-constant function $f(x,y)$ can be computed correctly by two parties using content-oblivious communication over a single edge, where one party holds $x$ and the other holds $y$. This seemingly ruled out many natural graph problems on non-2-edge-connected graphs.\n  In this work, we show that, with the knowledge of network topology $G$, leader election is possible in a wide range of graphs.\n  Impossibility: Graphs symmetric about an edge admit no randomized terminating leader election algorithm, even when nodes have unique identifiers and full knowledge of $G$.\n  Leader election algorithms: Trees that are not symmetric about any edge admit a quiescently terminating leader election algorithm with topology knowledge, even in anonymous networks, using $O(n^2)$ messages, where $n$ is the number of nodes. Moreover, even-diameter trees admit a terminating leader election given only the knowledge of the network diameter $D = 2r$, with message complexity $O(nr)$.\n  Necessity of topology knowledge: In the family of graphs $\\mathcal{G} = \\{P_3, P_5\\}$, both the 3-path $P_3$ and the 5-path $P_5$ admit a quiescently terminating leader election if nodes know the topology exactly. However, if nodes only know that the underlying topology belongs to $\\mathcal{G}$, then terminating leader election is impossible.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u77e5\u8bc6\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u9009\u4e3e\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u79f0\u56fe\u548c\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u62d3\u6251\u77e5\u8bc6\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u6e90\u4e8eCensor-Hillel\u7b49\u4eba\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u65e0\u5173\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u6781\u5f31\u901a\u4fe1\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u975e2\u8fb9\u8fde\u901a\u56fe\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u77e5\u8bc6\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u9009\u4e3e\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u9009\u4e3e\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u5bf9\u79f0\u56fe\u548c\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u62d3\u6251\u77e5\u8bc6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u8fb9\u56fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u7ec8\u6b62\u7684\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u9009\u4e3e\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff1b2\uff09\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u8fb9\u7684\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7ec8\u6b62\u7684\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u9009\u4e3e\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6d88\u606f\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aO(n^2)\uff1b3\uff09\u5728\u4ec5\u77e5\u9053\u7f51\u7edc\u76f4\u5f84\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5076\u6570\u76f4\u5f84\u6811\u4e5f\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u9009\u4e3e\uff0c\u6d88\u606f\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aO(nr)\uff1b4\uff09\u62d3\u6251\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u5bf9\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u9009\u4e3e\u7684\u6210\u529f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u77e5\u8bc6\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u9009\u4e3e\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u4e2d\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u8fb9\u7684\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u4e5f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u5bf9\u79f0\u56fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u62e5\u6709\u552f\u4e00\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u7ec8\u6b62\u7684\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u9009\u4e3e\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e5f\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u62d3\u6251\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u5bf9\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u9009\u4e3e\u7684\u6210\u529f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

In this paper, we study the computational complexity of solution discovery for several fundamental vertex-subset problems on graphs, namely Vertex Cover Discovery, Independent Set Discovery, Dominating Set Discovery, and Feedback Vertex Set Discovery. We first present XP algorithms for all four problems parameterized by clique-width. We then prove that Vertex Cover Discovery, Independent Set Discovery, and Feedback Vertex Set Discovery are NP-complete for chordal graphs and graphs of diameter 2, which have unbounded clique-width. In contrast to these hardness results, we show that all three problems can be solved in polynomial time on split graphs.

Ackermann steering further imposes curvature bounds and forbids in-place rotation, so escaping from narrow dead ends typically requires tightly sequenced forward and reverse maneuvers. Classical planners that decouple global search and local steering struggle in these settings because narrow passages occupy low-measure regions and nonholonomic reachability shrinks the set of valid connections, which degrades sampling efficiency and increases sensitivity to clearances. We study nonholonomic narrow dead-end escape for Ackermann vehicles and contribute three components. First, we construct a generator that samples multi-phase forward-reverse trajectories compatible with Ackermann kinematics and inflates their envelopes to synthesize families of narrow dead ends that are guaranteed to admit at least one feasible escape. Second, we construct a training environment that enforces kinematic constraints and train a policy using the soft actor-critic algorithm. Third, we evaluate against representative classical planners that combine global search with nonholonomic steering. Across parameterized dead-end families, the learned policy solves a larger fraction of instances, reduces maneuver count, and maintains comparable path length and planning time while under the same sensing and control limits.

Up to now, this area still lacks large-scale datasets to support the development of robust algorithms. To address these challenges, this paper first presents a new large-scale benchmark dataset for dial reading, termed RPM-10K, which contains 10730 meter images that fully reflect the aforementioned key challenges. Built upon the dataset, we propose a novel vision-language model for pointer meter reading recognition, termed MRLM, based on physical relation injection. Instead of exhaustively learning image-level correlations, MRLM explicitly encodes the geometric and causal relationships between the pointer and the scale, aligning perception with physical reasoning in the spirit of world-model perspectives. Through cross-attentional fusion and adaptive expert selection, the model learns to interpret dial configurations and generate precise numeric readings.

However, the growing scale of simulations demands substantial expert knowledge, computational resources, and time. A key challenge is identifying input parameters that yield optimal results, as iterative simulations are costly and can have a large environmental impact. This paper presents an AI-assisted workflow that reduces expert involvement in parameter optimization through the use of Bayesian optimization. Furthermore, we present an active learning variant of the approach, assisting the expert if desired. A deep learning model provides an initial parameter estimate, from which the optimization cycle iteratively refines the design until a termination condition (e.g., energy budget or iteration limit) is met.

(ESA 2016, OR 2020). In this problem, requests arrive over time at the vertices of a given vertex-weighted tree, and each request has a deadline that it must be served by. The cost of serving a request equals the cost of a path from the root to the vertex where the request resides. Instead of serving each request individually, requests can be aggregated and served by transmitting a subtree from the root that spans the vertices on which the requests reside, to potentially be more cost-effective. The aggregated cost is the weight of the transmission subtree. The goal of MLAP-D is to find an aggregation solution that minimizes the total cost while serving all requests.\n  We present improved and parameterized algorithms for MLAP-D. Our result is twofold. First, we present an $e(D+1)$-competitive algorithm where $D$ is the depth of the tree. Second, we present an $e(4H+2)$-competitive algorithm where $H$ is the caterpillar dimension of the tree. Here, $H \\le D$ and $H \\le \\log_2 |V|$ where $|V|$ is the number of vertices in the given tree. The caterpillar dimension remains constant for rich but simple classes of trees, such as line graphs ($H=1$), caterpillar graphs ($H=2$), and lobster graphs ($H=3$). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first online algorithm parameterized on a measure better than depth. The state-of-the-art online algorithms are $6(D+1)$-competitive by Buchbinder, Feldman, Naor, and Talmon (SODA 2017) and $O(\\log |V|)$-competitive by Azar and Touitou (FOCS 2020). Our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art ratios when $H = o(\\min\\{D,\\log_2 |V|\\})$.

We define ExtremelyBuggy methods as those involved in more than one bug fix and present the first large-scale study of their prevalence, characteristics, and predictability. Using a dataset of over 1.25 million methods from 98 open-source Java projects, we find that ExtremelyBuggy methods constitute only a tiny fraction of all methods, yet frequently account for a disproportionately large share of bugs. At their inception, these methods are significantly larger, more complex, less readable, and less maintainable than both singly-buggy and non-buggy methods. However, despite these measurable differences, a comprehensive evaluation of five machine learning models shows that early prediction of ExtremelyBuggy methods remains highly unreliable due to data imbalance, project heterogeneity, and the fact that many bugs emerge through subsequent evolution rather than initial implementation. To complement these quantitative findings, we conduct a thematic analysis of 265 ExtremelyBuggy methods, revealing recurring visual issues (e.g., confusing control flow, poor readability), contextual roles (e.g., core logic, data transformation, external resource handling), and common defect patterns (e.g., faulty conditionals, fragile error handling, misuse of variables).

A Task Manager LLM interprets natural-language goals, classifies tasks, and allocates subtasks using static rules plus dynamic contexts (task, history, robot and task status, and events).Each robot runs a local LLM that composes executable Python code from primitive skills (ROS2 nodes, policies), while onboard perception (VLMs/image processing) continuously monitors events and classifies them into relevant or irrelevant to the task. Task failures or user intent changes trigger replanning, allowing robots to assist teammates, resume tasks, or request human help. Hardware studies demonstrate autonomous recovery from disruptive events, filtering of irrelevant distractions, and tightly coordinated transport with emergent human-robot cooperation (e.g., multirobot collaborative object recovery success rate: 9/10, coordinated transport: 8/8, human-assisted recovery: 5/5).Simulation studies show intention-aware replanning. A curated textual benchmark spanning 22 scenarios (3 tasks each, around 20 robots) evaluates task allocation, classification, IoU, executability, and correctness, with high average scores (e.g., correctness up to 0.91) across multiple LLMs, a separate replanning set (5 scenarios) achieves 1.0 correctness. Compared with prior LLM-based systems, CoMuRoS uniquely demonstrates runtime, event-driven replanning on physical robots, delivering robust, flexible multi-robot and human-robot collaboration.", "AI": {"tldr": "CoMuRoS \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u652f\u6301\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u91cd\u65b0\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u534f\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42 LLM \u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u96c6\u4e2d\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u5206\u6563\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u534f\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5f02\u6784\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u56e2\u961f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9700\u8981\u52a8\u6001\u54cd\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\u5931\u8d25\u6216\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 CoMuRoS \u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e8\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "CoMuRoS \u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4efb\u52a1\u7ba1\u7406\u5668 LLM\uff08\u8d1f\u8d23\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u76ee\u6807\u89e3\u6790\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\uff09\u548c\u672c\u5730 LLM\uff08\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684 Python \u4ee3\u7801\uff09\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff08\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u72b6\u6001\u7b49\uff09\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cCoMuRoS \u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4e3b\u6062\u590d\u4e2d\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65e0\u5173\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u7d27\u5bc6\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u8fd0\u8f93\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u534f\u4f5c\u5bf9\u8c61\u6062\u590d\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff1a9/10\uff0c\u534f\u8c03\u8fd0\u8f93\uff1a8/8\uff0c\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u6062\u590d\uff1a5/5\uff09\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u610f\u56fe\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6587\u672c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5f97\u5206\u5747\u8f83\u9ad8\uff08\u5982\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u9ad8\u8fbe 0.91\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "CoMuRoS \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f02\u6784\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u89c4\u5212\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u534f\u4f5c\u3001\u534f\u8c03\u8fd0\u8f93\u548c\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002"}}

In contrast, visual-prompted models achieve strong segmentation performance across diverse modalities by leveraging spatial cues of precise bounding-box (bbox) prompts to guide the segmentation of target lesions. However, it is costly and challenging to obtain the precise visual prompts in clinical practice. We propose PPBoost (Progressive Prompt-Boosting), a framework that bridges these limitations by transforming weak text-derived signals into strong, spatially grounded visual prompts, operating under a strict zero-shot regime with no image- or pixel-level segmentation labels. PPBoost first uses a vision-language model to produce initial pseudo-bboxes conditioned on the textual object descriptions and applies an uncertainty-aware criterion to filter unreliable predictions. The retained image-bboxes pairs are then leveraged to train a pseudo-labeled detector, producing the high-quality bboxes for the query images. During inference, PPBoost further refines the generated bboxes by appropriately expanding them to tightly cover the target anatomical structures. The enhanced spatially-grounding bbox prompts guide existing segmentation models to generate final dense masks, effectively amplifying weak text cues into strong spatial guidance. Across three datasets spanning diverse modalities and anatomies, PPBoost consistently improves Dice and Normalized Surface Distance over text- and visual-prompted baselines and, notably, surpasses few-shot segmentation models without using labeled data. PPBoost can generalize to multiple typical visual segmentation model backbones.", "AI": {"tldr": "PPBoost\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5f31\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8d85\u8d8a\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u514b\u670d\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "PPBoost\u9996\u5148\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u4f2a\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u6807\u51c6\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u968f\u540e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u56fe\u50cf-\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u3002\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u4ee5\u7d27\u5bc6\u8986\u76d6\u76ee\u6807\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cPPBoost\u5728Dice\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8868\u9762\u8ddd\u79bb\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8d85\u8d8a\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "PPBoost\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5f31\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This work introduces a multi-agent, text gradient-driven framework that performs DP composition generation under natural-language conditions by integrating three complementary feedback sources: LLM-based self-evaluation, DP-specific domain knowledge-informed feedback, and ML surrogate-based feedback. Analogous to how knowledge-informed machine learning improves the reliability of conventional data-driven models, our framework incorporates domain-informed text gradients to guide the generative process toward physically meaningful regions of the DP composition space. Systematic comparison of three incremental configurations, (i) pure LLM generation, (ii) LLM generation with LLM reasoning-based feedback, and (iii) LLM generation with domain knowledge-guided feedback, shows that iterative guidance from knowledge-informed gradients improves stability-condition satisfaction without additional training data, achieving over 98% compositional validity and up to 54% stable or metastable candidates, surpassing both the LLM-only baseline (43%) and prior GAN-based results (27%). Analyses of ML-based gradients further reveal that they enhance performance in in-distribution (ID) regions but become unreliable in out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes.

A landmark result addressing this challenge, the linearity test of Blum, Luby, and Rubinfeld (JCSS `93), spurred a rich body of work on testing algebraic properties such as linearity and its generalizations to low-degree polynomials and group homomorphisms. However, classical tests for these properties assume unrestricted, noise-free access to the input function--an assumption that breaks down in adversarial or dynamic settings. To address this, Kalemaj, Raskhodnikova, and Varma (Theory of Computing `23) introduced the online manipulation model, where an adversary may erase or corrupt query responses over time, based on the tester's past queries.\n  We initiate the study of {manipulation-resilient} testing for {group homomorphism} in this online model. Our main result is an {optimal} tester that makes $O(1/\\varepsilon+\\log t)$ queries, where $\\varepsilon$ is the distance parameter and $t$ is the number of function values the adversary can erase or corrupt per query. Our result recovers the celebrated $O(1/\\varepsilon)$ bound by Ben-Or, Coppersmith, Luby, and Rubinfeld (Random Struct.\\ Algorithms `08) for homomorphism testing in the standard property testing model, albeit with a different tester. Our tester, $\\mathsf{Random\\ Signs\\ Test}$, {lifts} known manipulation-resilient linearity testers for $\\mathbb{F}_2^n\\to \\mathbb{F}_2$ to general group domains and codomains by introducing more randomness: instead of verifying the homomorphism condition for a sum of random elements, it uses additions and subtractions of random elements, randomly selecting a sign for each element.

Mutation-Based Fault Localization (MBFL) has gained prominence due to its robust theoretical foundations and fine-grained analysis capabilities. However, recent studies have identified a critical challenge: noise phenomena, specifically the false kill relationships between mutants and tests, which significantly degrade localization effectiveness. While several approaches have been proposed to rectify the final localization results, they do not directly address the underlying noise. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to refine the kill matrix, a core data structure capturing mutant-test relationships in MBFL, by treating it as a signal that contains both meaningful fault-related patterns and high-frequency noise. Inspired by signal processing theory, we introduce DKMR (Denoising-based Kill Matrix Refinement), which employs two key stages: (1) signal enhancement through hybrid matrix construction to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for better denoising, and (2) signal denoising via frequency domain filtering to suppress noise while preserving fault-related patterns. Building on this foundation, we develop MBFL-DKMR, a fault localization framework that utilizes the refined matrix with fuzzy values for suspiciousness calculation.

However, most prior approaches update their world representation only at discrete update points such as navigation targets, waypoints, or the end of an action step, leaving robots blind between updates and causing cascading failures: overlooked objects, late error detection, and delayed replanning. To address this limitation, we propose BINDER (Bridging INstant and DEliberative Reasoning), a dual process framework that decouples strategic planning from continuous environment monitoring. Specifically, BINDER integrates a Deliberative Response Module (DRM, a multimodal LLM for task planning) with an Instant Response Module (IRM, a VideoLLM for continuous monitoring). The two modules play complementary roles: the DRM performs strategic planning with structured 3D scene updates and guides what the IRM attends to, while the IRM analyzes video streams to update memory, correct ongoing actions, and trigger replanning when necessary. Through this bidirectional coordination, the modules address the trade off between maintaining awareness and avoiding costly updates, enabling robust adaptation under dynamic conditions. Evaluated in three real world environments with dynamic object placement, BINDER achieves substantially higher success and efficiency than SoTA baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness for real world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "BINDER\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6a21\u5757\uff08DRM\u548cIRM\uff09\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u66f4\u65b0\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7\u73af\u5883\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u7531\u6b64\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u8fde\u9501\u5931\u8d25\uff08\u5982\u9057\u6f0f\u5bf9\u8c61\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u89c4\u5212\uff09\u3002", "method": "BINDER\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86Deliberative Response Module\uff08DRM\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\uff09\u548cInstant Response Module\uff08IRM\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7\u7684VideoLLM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u534f\u8c03\u5b9e\u73b0\u6218\u7565\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cBINDER\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "BINDER\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u6218\u7565\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u73af\u5883\u76d1\u63a7\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002"}}

Wang", "Di Sheng Lee", "David L. Kaplan", "Markus J. Buehler"], "title": "Swarms of Large Language Model Agents for Protein Sequence Design with Experimental Validation", "comment": null, "summary": "Designing proteins de novo with tailored structural, physicochemical, and functional properties remains a grand challenge in biotechnology, medicine, and materials science, due to the vastness of sequence space and the complex coupling between sequence, structure, and function. Current state-of-the-art generative methods, such as protein language models (PLMs) and diffusion-based architectures, often require extensive fine-tuning, task-specific data, or model reconfiguration to support objective-directed design, thereby limiting their flexibility and scalability. To overcome these limitations, we present a decentralized, agent-based framework inspired by swarm intelligence for de novo protein design. In this approach, multiple large language model (LLM) agents operate in parallel, each assigned to a specific residue position. These agents iteratively propose context-aware mutations by integrating design objectives, local neighborhood interactions, and memory and feedback from previous iterations. This position-wise, decentralized coordination enables emergent design of diverse, well-defined sequences without reliance on motif scaffolds or multiple sequence alignments, validated with experiments on proteins with alpha helix and coil structures. Through analyses of residue conservation, structure-based metrics, and sequence convergence and embeddings, we demonstrate that the framework exhibits emergent behaviors and effective navigation of the protein fitness landscape. Our method achieves efficient, objective-directed designs within a few GPU-hours and operates entirely without fine-tuning or specialized training, offering a generalizable and adaptable solution for protein design.

Automated detection methods can significantly enhance efficiency and reduce costs; however, existing approaches still face several challenges, including low detection accuracy on imbalanced data, limited semantic extraction due to the use of a single encoder, and suboptimal performance in cross-domain transfer learning. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Transferable Software Requirement Conflict Detection Framework based on SBERT and SimCSE, termed TSRCDF-SS. First, the framework employs two independent encoders, Sentence-BERT (SBERT) and Simple Contrastive Sentence Embedding (SimCSE), to generate sentence embeddings for requirement pairs, followed by a six-element concatenation strategy. Furthermore, the classifier is enhanced by a two-layer fully connected feedforward neural network (FFNN) with a hybrid loss optimization strategy that integrates a variant of Focal Loss, domain-specific constraints, and a confidence-based penalty term. Finally, the framework synergistically integrates sequential and cross-domain transfer learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a 10.4% improvement in both macro-F1 and weighted-F1 scores in in-domain settings, and an 11.4% increase in macro-F1 in cross-domain scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eSBERT\u548cSimCSE\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6TSRCDF-SS\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9700\u6c42\u51b2\u7a81\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u9700\u6c42\u51b2\u7a81\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u63d0\u53d6\u6709\u9650\u53ca\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528SBERT\u548cSimCSE\u53cc\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u751f\u6210\u53e5\u5b50\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u516d\u5143\u7d20\u62fc\u63a5\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5c42FFNN\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u540c\u9886\u57df\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b8fF1\u548c\u52a0\u6743F1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8610.4%\uff1b\u5728\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b8fF1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8611.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684TSRCDF-SS\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u548c\u540c\u9886\u57df\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9700\u6c42\u51b2\u7a81\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Our Digital Twin, named Access Point Digital Twin (APDT) is used for tracking user behavior and changing bandwidth demands, directly impacting network performance and Quality of Service (QoS) parameters like latency, jitter, etc. APDT captures the real-time state of networks with data from access points (APs), enabling simulation-based analyses and predictive modelling. APDT facilitates the simulation of various what-if scenarios thereby providing a better understanding of various aspects of the network characteristics. We tested APDT on our University network. APDT uses data collected from three access points via the Ruckus SmartZone API and incorporates NS-3 based simulations. The simulation replicates a real-time snapshot from a Ruckus access point and models metrics such as latency and inter-packet transfer time. Additionally, a forecasting model predicts traffic congestion and suggests proactive client offloading, enhancing network management and performance optimization.

In this work, inspired by the denoising capability of diffusion models, we invert the conventional perspective and propose a clean-to-noisy paradigm that learns to synthesize noisy depth, thereby bridging the visual sim2real gap through purely simulation-driven robotic learning. Building on this idea, we introduce RealD$^2$iff, a hierarchical coarse-to-fine diffusion framework that decomposes depth noise into global structural distortions and fine-grained local perturbations. To enable progressive learning of these components, we further develop two complementary strategies: Frequency-Guided Supervision (FGS) for global structure modeling and Discrepancy-Guided Optimization (DGO) for localized refinement. To integrate RealD$^2$iff seamlessly into imitation learning, we construct a pipeline that spans six stages. We provide comprehensive empirical and experimental validation demonstrating the effectiveness of this paradigm. RealD$^2$iff enables two key applications: (1) generating real-world-like depth to construct clean-noisy paired datasets without manual sensor data collection.

While recent vision-language models demonstrate promising chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), their purely on-policy learning paradigm tends to reinforce superficially coherent but clinically inaccurate reasoning paths. We propose MedEyes, a novel reinforcement learning framework that dynamically models clinician-style diagnostic reasoning by progressively attending to and interpreting relevant medical image regions. By incorporating off-policy expert guidance, MedEyes converts expert visual search trajectories into structured external behavioral signals, guiding the model toward clinically aligned visual reasoning. We design the Gaze-guided Reasoning Navigator (GRN) to emulate the diagnostic process through a dual-mode exploration strategy, scanning for systematic abnormality localization and drilling for detailed regional analysis. To balance expert imitation and autonomous discovery, we introduce the Confidence Value Sampler (CVS), which employs nucleus sampling and adaptive termination to create diverse yet credible exploration paths. Finally, the dual-stream GRPO optimization framework decouples on-policy and off-policy learning signals, mitigating reward assimilation and entropy collapse.

Proposed enhancements include redesigning the system architecture, developing interfaces for exporting intermediate data, defining the communication channel as a separate component, and expanding tools for systematic verification and comparative analysis of blind key-reconciliation methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eCASCADE\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u8f6f\u4ef6\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u7ea0\u9519\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5a01\u80c1\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5bc6\u94a5\u534f\u8c03\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u805a\u7126\u4e8eCASCADE\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u76ee\u7684\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u539f\u578b\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eactor\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u7ea0\u9519\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bc6\u94a5\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u539f\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f00\u53d1\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5197\u4f59\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u6838\u5fc3CASCADE\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u63aa\u65bd\u5305\u62ec\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u5f00\u53d1\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e2d\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u63a5\u53e3\u3001\u5c06\u901a\u4fe1\u901a\u9053\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6269\u5c55\u5de5\u5177\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u76f2\u5bc6\u94a5\u534f\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We introduce a training-free, post-hoc uncertainty estimation method for contrastive VLMs that can be used to detect erroneous predictions. The key to our approach is to measure visual feature consistency within a class, using feature projection combined with multivariate Gaussians to create class-specific probabilistic embeddings. Our method is VLM-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, demonstrates robustness to distribution shift, and works effectively with as few as 10 training images per class. Extensive experiments on ImageNet, Flowers102, Food101, EuroSAT and DTD show state-of-the-art error detection performance, significantly outperforming both deterministic and probabilistic VLM baselines.

This is precisely what the method known as minimal revision does. However, unlike less conservative belief revision methods, minimal revision falls short in learning power: It cannot learn everything that can be learned by other learning methods. We begin by showing that, despite this limitation, minimal revision is still a successful learning method in a wide range of situations. Firstly, it can learn any problem that is finitely identifiable. Secondly, it can learn with positive and negative data, as long as one considers finitely many possibilities. We then characterize the prior plausibility assignments (over finitely many possibilities) that enable one to learn via minimal revision, and do the same for conditioning and lexicographic upgrade.

Our findings suggest the latest powerful LLMs' dual role: they act as \"equalizers,\" boosting average performance even for programming-weak students, providing opportunities for more authentic SE practices; yet also as \"amplifiers,\" dramatically widening absolute performance gaps, creating new pedagogical challenges for addressing educational inequities.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u5728SE\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u65e2\u662f\u2018\u5e73\u8861\u5668\u2019\u4e5f\u662f\u2018\u653e\u5927\u5668\u2019\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5e73\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f46\u6269\u5927\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9700\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b0\u6559\u5b66\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLMs\u91cd\u5851\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u589e\u5f3a\u5b9e\u8df5\u878d\u5165SE\u6559\u80b2\u53d8\u5f97\u8feb\u5207\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8LLMs\u5728\u5165\u95e8\u7f16\u7a0b\u6216\u5b64\u7acbSE\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u5728\u66f4\u5f00\u653e\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\uff08PBL\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u9879\u4e3a\u671f\u4e24\u5e74\u7684\u7eb5\u5411\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e862024\u5e74\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u65e9\u671f\u514d\u8d39LLMs\uff0c$n$=48\uff09\u548c2025\u5e74\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u65b0\u4ed8\u8d39LLMs\uff0c$n$=46\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u961f\u5217\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6700\u65b0LLMs\u65e2\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5e73\u5747\u8868\u73b0\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u7f16\u7a0b\u80fd\u529b\u8f83\u5f31\u5b66\u751f\uff09\uff0c\u4e5f\u663e\u8457\u6269\u5927\u4e86\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6700\u65b0\u5f3a\u5927\u7684LLMs\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u53cc\u91cd\u89d2\u8272\uff1a\u65e2\u662f\u2018\u5e73\u8861\u5668\u2019\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5305\u62ec\u7f16\u7a0b\u80fd\u529b\u8f83\u5f31\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u5185\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7684SE\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u4f9b\u673a\u4f1a\uff1b\u4e5f\u662f\u2018\u653e\u5927\u5668\u2019\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6269\u5927\u7edd\u5bf9\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6559\u80b2\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u5e26\u6765\u65b0\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

We attribute this variability to the mixed-quality nature of human demonstrations, where the implicit principles that govern how actions should be carried out are only partially satisfied. To address this challenge, we introduce the LIBERO-Elegant benchmark with explicit criteria for evaluating execution quality. Using these criteria, we develop a decoupled refinement framework that improves execution quality without modifying or retraining the base VLA policy. We formalize Elegant Execution as the satisfaction of Implicit Task Constraints (ITCs) and train an Elegance Critic via offline Calibrated Q-Learning to estimate the expected quality of candidate actions. At inference time, a Just-in-Time Intervention (JITI) mechanism monitors critic confidence and intervenes only at decision-critical moments, providing selective, on-demand refinement. Experiments on LIBERO-Elegant and real-world manipulation tasks show that the learned Elegance Critic substantially improves execution quality, even on unseen tasks.

In this work, we focus on object grounding, i.e., localizing an object of interest in a visual scene (e.g., an image) based on verbal human instructions. Despite recent progress, a dominant research trend relies on using text as an intermediate representation. These approaches typically transcribe speech to text, extract relevant object keywords, and perform grounding using models pretrained on large text-vision datasets. However, we question both the efficiency and robustness of such transcription-based pipelines. Specifically, we ask: Can we achieve direct audio-visual alignment without relying on text? To explore this possibility, we simplify the task by focusing on grounding from single-word spoken instructions. We introduce a new audio-based grounding dataset that covers a wide variety of objects and diverse human accents. We then adapt and benchmark several models from the closely audio-visual field. Our results demonstrate that direct grounding from audio is not only feasible but, in some cases, even outperforms transcription-based methods, especially in terms of robustness to linguistic variability.

When navigating through narrow passages\n  or confined spaces, deadlocks frequently emerge that prevent agents from reaching their destinations, particularly when Reinforcement Learning (RL) control policies encounter novel configurations out of learning distribution. Existing RL-based approaches suffer from limited generalization capability in unseen environments. We propose a hybrid framework that seamlessly integrates RL-based reactive navigation with on-demand Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) to explicitly resolve topological deadlocks. Our approach integrates a safety layer that monitors agent progress to detect deadlocks and, when detected, triggers a coordination controller for affected agents. The framework constructs globally feasible trajectories via MAPF and regulates waypoint progression to reduce inter-agent conflicts during navigation.\n  Extensive evaluation on dense multi-agent benchmarks shows that our method boosts task completion from marginal to near-universal success, markedly reducing deadlocks and collisions. When integrated with hierarchical task planning, it enables coordinated navigation for heterogeneous robots, demonstrating that coupling reactive RL navigation with selective MAPF intervention yields a robust, zero-shot performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6df7\u5408RL\u4e0eMAPF\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u7684\u6b7b\u9501\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u72ed\u7a84\u6216\u53d7\u9650\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5bfc\u822a\u65f6\uff0c\u5e38\u56e0RL\u7b56\u7565\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b7b\u9501\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210RL\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u5bfc\u822a\u4e0eMAPF\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u5c42\u76d1\u6d4b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fdb\u5ea6\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6b7b\u9501\uff0c\u5e76\u89e6\u53d1\u534f\u8c03\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4e3a\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u5168\u5c40\u53ef\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u4ece\u8fb9\u7f18\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5168\u9762\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6b7b\u9501\u548c\u78b0\u649e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u5bfc\u822a\u4e0e\u6309\u9700\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\uff08MAPF\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6b7b\u9501\u548c\u78b0\u649e\u3002"}}

Despite notable advancements in GUI testing and static call graph construction, current tools are insufficient for reliably driving execution toward specific target methods, especially those not embedded in a graphical component (e.g., libraries' methods), a capability essential for tasks such as vulnerability validation, debugging, and behavioral analysis.\n  We present GAPS (Graph-based Automated Path Synthesizer), the first system that integrates static, method-guided call graph analysis with dynamic, interaction-driven execution. GAPS performs a lightweight backward traversal of the call graph, guided by data-flow analysis, to reconstruct paths reaching the target methods. These paths are then translated into instructions that guide runtime app exploration.\n  On the AndroTest benchmark, GAPS statically identifies paths to reach 88.24\\% of the target methods in just 4.27 seconds per app and dynamically reaches 57.44\\% of them. In contrast, state-of-the-art dynamic interaction tools show significantly lower reachability over three runs: APE, one of the best model-based GUI testers, achieves 12.82\\%, while GoalExplorer, a hybrid analysis tool, reaches 9.69\\%, and Guardian, an LLM-based UI automator, reaches 17.12\\%. Static analysis tools also fall short: FlowDroid and DroidReach identify paths to reach 58.81\\% and 9.48\\% of the targets, requiring 35.06 seconds and 23.46 seconds per app, respectively.\n  Finally, an evaluation on the 50 most downloaded real-world apps demonstrates GAPS's practical utility in analyzing security-critical code under a realistic scenario.

Yet, unlike VLMs in the vision-language domain, VLAs for robotics require finetuning to contend with varying physical factors like robot embodiment, environment characteristics, and spatial relationships of each task. Existing fine-tuning methods lack specificity, adapting the same set of parameters regardless of a task's visual, linguistic, and physical characteristics. Inspired by functional specificity in neuroscience, we hypothesize that it is more effective to finetune sparse model representations specific to a given task. In this work, we introduce Robotic Steering, a finetuning approach grounded in mechanistic interpretability that leverages few-shot demonstrations to identify and selectively finetune task-specific attention heads aligned with the physical, visual, and linguistic requirements of robotic tasks. Through comprehensive on-robot evaluations with a Franka Emika robot arm, we demonstrate that Robotic Steering outperforms LoRA while achieving superior robustness under task variation, reduced computational cost, and enhanced interpretability for adapting VLAs to diverse robotic tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Robotic Steering\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8c03\u6574\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u8c03\u6574\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u53d7\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u529f\u80fd\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u5fae\u8c03\u7a00\u758f\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5Robotic Steering\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u793a\u8303\u6570\u636e\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u7269\u7406\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u9700\u6c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7Franka Emika\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81c2\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cRobotic Steering\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Robotic Steering\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6837\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eLoRA\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

In contrast to methods that rely on variational autoencoders (VAEs) to generate discrete occupancy tokens, which inherently limit representational capacity, our approach predicts multi-frame future occupancy in an end-to-end manner directly from raw image features. Inspired by the success of attention-based transformer architectures in foundational vision and language models such as GPT and VGGT, we employ a sparse occupancy representation that bypasses the intermediate bird's eye view (BEV) projection and its explicit geometric priors. This design allows the transformer to capture spatiotemporal dependencies more effectively. By avoiding both the finite-capacity constraint of discrete tokenization and the structural limitations of BEV representations, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes benchmark for 1-3 second occupancy forecasting, outperforming existing approaches by a significant margin. Furthermore, it demonstrates robust scene dynamics understanding, consistently delivering high accuracy under arbitrary future trajectory conditioning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u5e27\u672a\u67653D\u573a\u666f\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u548cBEV\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728nuScenes\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08VAEs\uff09\u751f\u6210\u79bb\u6563\u5360\u7528\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800cBEV\u8868\u793a\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u9650\u5236\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5360\u7528\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7ed5\u8fc7\u4e2d\u95f4\u9e1f\u77b0\u56fe\uff08BEV\uff09\u6295\u5f71\u53ca\u5176\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u5e27\u672a\u6765\u5360\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuScenes\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u672a\u6765\u8f68\u8ff9\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728nuScenes\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e861-3\u79d2\u573a\u666f\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, MBFL faces significant challenges due to interference mutants generated from non-faulty code entities but can be killed by failing tests. These mutants mimic the test sensitivity behaviors of real faulty code entities and weaken the effectiveness of fault localization. To address this challenge, we introduce the concept of Fault Localization Interference Mutants (FLIMs) and conduct a theoretical analysis based on the Reachability, Infection, Propagation, and Revealability (RIPR) model, identifying four distinct interference causes. Building on this, we propose a novel approach to semantically recognize and mitigate FLIMs using LLM-based semantic analysis, enhanced by fine-tuning techniques and confidence estimation strategies to address LLM output instability. The recognized FLIMs are then mitigated by refining the suspiciousness scores calculated from MBFL techniques. We integrate FLIM recognition and mitigation into the MBFL workflow, developing MBFL-FLIM, a fault localization framework that enhances MBFL's effectiveness by reducing misleading interference while preserving real fault-revealing information. Our empirical experiments on the Defects4J benchmark with 395 program versions using eight LLMs demonstrate MBFL-FLIM's superiority over traditional SBFL and MBFL methods, advanced dynamic feature-based approaches, and recent LLM-based fault localization techniques. Specifically, MBFL-FLIM achieves an average improvement of 44 faults in the Top-1 metric, representing a significant enhancement over baseline methods.

Experiments with healthy adults (both men and women) of various heights and weights show that the device 1) has a low impact on the natural STS kinematics, 2) can provide precise weight unloading at the patient's center of mass and 3) can add a forward virtual spring to assist the transfer of the bodyweight to the feet for seat-off, at the start of the STS motion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u8c03\u8282STS\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u81ea\u7136\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5e76\u8f85\u52a9\u4f53\u91cd\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u8f85\u52a9\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u4f53\u91cd\u652f\u6301\u8bbe\u5907\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u6d3b\u52a8\u6c34\u5e73\u7684STS\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdSTS\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u963b\u6297\u548c\u5782\u76f4/\u524d\u5411\u529b\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u8bbe\u5907\u5bf9\u81ea\u7136STS\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\uff0c\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u5378\u8f7d\u60a3\u8005\u91cd\u5fc3\u91cd\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u865a\u62df\u5f39\u7c27\u8f85\u52a9\u4f53\u91cd\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5STS\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bbe\u5907\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5546\u4e1a\u63d0\u5347\u8f85\u52a9\u8f6c\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5bf9\u81ea\u7136STS\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\uff0c\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u5378\u8f7d\u60a3\u8005\u91cd\u5fc3\u91cd\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u865a\u62df\u5f39\u7c27\u8f85\u52a9\u4f53\u91cd\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002"}}

However, existing methods often overlook the importance of the regularizing manifold, typically defaulting to a text-conditioned manifold. This approach suffers from two key limitations. Conceptually, it is misaligned with the Real-ISR task, which is to generate high quality (HQ) images directly tied to the low quality (LQ) images. Practically, the teacher model often reconstructs images with color distortions and blurred edges, indicating a flawed generative prior for this task. To correct these flaws and ensure conceptual alignment, a more suitable manifold must incorporate information from the images. While the most straightforward approach is to condition directly on the raw input images, their high information densities make the regularization process numerically unstable. To resolve this, we propose image-conditioned manifold regularization (ICM), a method that regularizes the output towards a manifold conditioned on the sparse yet essential structural information: a combination of colormap and Canny edges. ICM provides a task-aligned and stable regularization signal, thereby avoiding the instability of dense-conditioning and enhancing the final super-resolution quality.

By scaling reasoning with reinforcement learning that rewards correct final answers, LLMs have improved from poor performance to saturating quantitative reasoning competitions like AIME and HMMT in one year. However, this approach faces fundamental limitations. Pursuing higher final answer accuracy doesn't address a key issue: correct answers don't guarantee correct reasoning. Moreover, many mathematical tasks like theorem proving require rigorous step-by-step derivation rather than numerical answers, making final answer rewards inapplicable. To push the limits of deep reasoning, we believe it is necessary to verify the comprehensiveness and rigor of mathematical reasoning. Self-verification is particularly important for scaling test-time compute, especially for open problems without known solutions. Towards self-verifiable mathematical reasoning, we investigate how to train an accurate and faithful LLM-based verifier for theorem proving. We then train a proof generator using the verifier as the reward model, and incentivize the generator to identify and resolve as many issues as possible in their own proofs before finalizing them. To maintain the generation-verification gap as the generator becomes stronger, we propose to scale verification compute to automatically label new hard-to-verify proofs, creating training data to further improve the verifier. Our resulting model, DeepSeekMath-V2, demonstrates strong theorem-proving capabilities, achieving gold-level scores on IMO 2025 and CMO 2024 and a near-perfect 118/120 on Putnam 2024 with scaled test-time compute.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u9879\u6570\u5b66\u7ade\u8d5b\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u6210\u7ee9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u4e25\u683c\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\uff09\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5168\u9762\u6027\u548c\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u6ca1\u6709\u5df2\u77e5\u89e3\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u6b64\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bc1\u660e\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u6fc0\u52b1\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5728\u6700\u7ec8\u786e\u5b9a\u8bc1\u660e\u524d\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u591a\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u8eab\u8bc1\u660e\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8ba1\u7b97\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u8bb0\u65b0\u7684\u96be\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u3002", "result": "DeepSeekMath-V2\u5728\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u7ade\u8d5b\u6210\u7ee9\u3002", "conclusion": "DeepSeekMath-V2\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728IMO 2025\u548cCMO 2024\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u91d1\u724c\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Putnam 2024\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684118/120\u5206\u6570\u3002"}}

Yet, these methods mostly rely on egocentric (first-person) perception, limiting their performance, especially when the viewpoint of the robot is occluded. A promising solution would be to enhance the robot's environmental awareness by using complementary viewpoints, such as multiple actors exchanging perceptual information. Inspired by this idea, this work proposes a multi-view depth-based locomotion framework that combines egocentric and exocentric observations to provide richer environmental context during agile locomotion. Using a teacher-student distillation approach, the student policy learns to fuse proprioception with dual depth streams while remaining robust to real-world sensing imperfections. To further improve robustness, we introduce extensive domain randomization, including stochastic remote-camera dropouts and 3D positional perturbations that emulate aerial-ground cooperative sensing. Simulation results show that multi-viewpoints policies outperform single-viewpoint baseline in gap crossing, step descent, and other dynamic maneuvers, while maintaining stability when the exocentric camera is partially or completely unavailable.

To address this issue, we preserve the specular reflection coefficient and reformulate the original physical constraints in the imaging process based on the Kubelka-Munk theory, thereby constructing constraint relationship between illumination, reflection, and detection, the so-called triple physical constraints (TPCs)theory. Based on this theory, the physical constraints are constructed in the feature space of the model to obtain the TPC network (TPCNet).

AI deception, in which systems induce false beliefs to secure self-beneficial outcomes, has evolved from a speculative concern to an empirically demonstrated risk across language models, AI agents, and emerging frontier systems. This project provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the AI deception field, covering its core concepts, methodologies, genesis, and potential mitigations. First, we identify a formal definition of AI deception, grounded in signaling theory from studies of animal deception. We then review existing empirical studies and associated risks, highlighting deception as a sociotechnical safety challenge. We organize the landscape of AI deception research as a deception cycle, consisting of two key components: deception emergence and deception treatment. Deception emergence reveals the mechanisms underlying AI deception: systems with sufficient capability and incentive potential inevitably engage in deceptive behaviors when triggered by external conditions. Deception treatment, in turn, focuses on detecting and addressing such behaviors. On deception emergence, we analyze incentive foundations across three hierarchical levels and identify three essential capability preconditions required for deception. We further examine contextual triggers, including supervision gaps, distributional shifts, and environmental pressures. On deception treatment, we conclude detection methods covering benchmarks and evaluation protocols in static and interactive settings. Building on the three core factors of deception emergence, we outline potential mitigation strategies and propose auditing approaches that integrate technical, community, and governance efforts to address sociotechnical challenges and future AI risks.

However, achieving optimal performance following this regiment requires a large-scale dataset, which is costly to obtain, especially for challenging tasks, such as collision avoidance. In those tasks, generalization at test time demands coverage of many obstacles types and their spatial configurations, which are impractical to acquire purely via data. To remedy this problem, we propose Context-Aware diffusion policy via Proximal mode Expansion (CAPE), a framework that expands trajectory distribution modes with context-aware prior and guidance at inference via a novel prior-seeded iterative guided refinement procedure. The framework generates an initial trajectory plan and executes a short prefix trajectory, and then the remaining trajectory segment is perturbed to an intermediate noise level, forming a trajectory prior. Such a prior is context-aware and preserves task intent. Repeating the process with context-aware guided denoising iteratively expands mode support to allow finding smoother, less collision-prone trajectories. For collision avoidance, CAPE expands trajectory distribution modes with collision-aware context, enabling the sampling of collision-free trajectories in previously unseen environments while maintaining goal consistency. We evaluate CAPE on diverse manipulation tasks in cluttered unseen simulated and real-world settings and show up to 26% and 80% higher success rates respectively compared to SOTA methods, demonstrating better generalization to unseen environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "CAPE\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8fd1\u7aef\u6a21\u5f0f\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u907f\u78b0\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u907f\u78b0\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u8986\u76d6\u6240\u6709\u969c\u788d\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CAPE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u5e03\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\u79cd\u5b50\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f15\u5bfc\u7ec6\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u521d\u59cb\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ba1\u5212\u5e76\u6267\u884c\u77ed\u524d\u7f00\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u6270\u52a8\u5269\u4f59\u8f68\u8ff9\u6bb5\u81f3\u4e2d\u95f4\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u5f62\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u53bb\u566a\u8fed\u4ee3\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u5f0f\u652f\u6301\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6742\u4e71\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cCAPE\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8626%\u548c80%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "CAPE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8fd1\u7aef\u6a21\u5f0f\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u907f\u78b0\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8626%\u548c80%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

To explicitly capture dentists' diagnostic reasoning, we construct TRACE-CoT, a clinically grounded chain-of-thought dataset that mirrors dental radiologists' decision-making processes. This reasoning supervision, combined with our proposed four-stage training paradigm, substantially strengthens the model's capacity for dental image understanding and analysis.

By utilizing image generative frameworks and large language models, NICE performs three editing operations, object replacement, restyling, and removal of distracting (non-target) objects. These changes preserve spatial relationships without obstructing target objects and maintain action-label consistency. Unlike previous approaches, NICE requires no additional robot data collection, simulator access, or custom model training, making it readily applicable to existing robotic datasets.\n  Using real-world scenes, we showcase the capability of our framework in producing photo-realistic scene enhancement. For downstream tasks, we use NICE data to finetune a vision-language model (VLM) for spatial affordance prediction and a vision-language-action (VLA) policy for object manipulation. Our evaluations show that NICE successfully minimizes OOD gaps, resulting in over 20% improvement in accuracy for affordance prediction in highly cluttered scenes.

Current paradigms fail to bridge this gap. Training-based methods suffer from an ``oracle paradox,'' learning flawed spatial logic from imperfect oracles. Tool-integrated methods constrain the final computation but critically leave the VLM's planning process unconstrained, resulting in geometrically flawed plans. In this work, we propose Geometrically-Constrained Agent (GCA), a training-free agentic paradigm that resolves this gap by introducing a formal task constraint. Specifically, we strategically decouples the VLM's role into two stages. First, acting as a semantic analyst, the VLM translates the user's ambiguous query into the formal, verifiable task constraint, which defines the reference frame and objective. Second, acting as a task solver, the VLM generates and executes tool calls strictly within the deterministic bounds defined by the constraint. This geometrically-constrained reasoning strategy successfully resolve the semantic-to-geometric gap, yielding a robust and verifiable reasoning pathway for spatial reasoning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GCA achieves SOTA performance on multiple spatial reasoning benchmarks, surpassing existing training-based and tool-integrated methods by ~27%.

Contrary to prior works, we approach evaluation from a psychophysical perspective, therefore we use a unified measure of clutter that accounts for environmental factors as well as the distractors quantity, characteristics, and arrangement. Using this measure, we systematically construct evaluation scenarios in both hyper-realistic simulation and real-world and conduct extensive experimentation on manipulation policies, in particular vision-language-action (VLA) models. Our experiments highlight the significant impact of scene clutter, lowering the performance of the policies, by as much as 34% and show that despite achieving similar average performance across the tasks, different VLA policies have unique vulnerabilities and a relatively low agreement on success scenarios. We further show that our clutter measure is an effective indicator of performance degradation and analyze the impact of distractors in terms of their quantity and occluding influence. At the end, we show that finetuning on enhanced data, although effective, does not equally remedy all negative impacts of clutter on performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6742\u4e71\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u6742\u4e71\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d1\u73b0\u6742\u4e71\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5fae\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u7f13\u89e3\u5176\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6742\u4e71\u573a\u666f\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6742\u4e71\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u5fc3\u7406\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u89d2\u5ea6\u51fa\u53d1\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6742\u4e71\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8d85\u73b0\u5b9e\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u5efa\u8bc4\u4f30\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u573a\u666f\u6742\u4e71\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u6700\u591a34%\uff09\uff0c\u4e0d\u540cVLA\u7b56\u7565\u5b58\u5728\u72ec\u7279\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u4e14\u6210\u529f\u573a\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u6742\u4e71\u5ea6\u91cf\u662f\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5fae\u8c03\u589e\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u867d\u7136\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u5747\u7b49\u5730\u7f13\u89e3\u6240\u6709\u7531\u573a\u666f\u6742\u4e71\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Motivated by this, we present WorldWander, an in-context learning framework tailored for translating between egocentric and exocentric worlds in video generation. Building upon advanced video diffusion transformers, WorldWander integrates (i) In-Context Perspective Alignment and (ii) Collaborative Position Encoding to efficiently model cross-view synchronization.

We first construct a dynamic risk fields (DRF) that captures both the static and dynamic collision risks from surrounding vehicles. Then, we develop a rigorous strategy for generating time-varying convex feasible spaces that ensure kinematic feasibility and safety requirements. The trajectory planning problem is formulated as a finite-horizon optimal control problem and solved using a constrained iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) algorithm that jointly optimizes trajectory smoothness, control effort, and risk exposure while maintaining strict feasibility. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional approaches in terms of safety and efficiency, achieving collision-free trajectories with shorter lane-changing distances (28.59 m) and times (2.84 s) while maintaining smooth and comfortable acceleration patterns. In dense roundabout environments the planner further demonstrates robust adaptability, producing larger safety margins, lower jerk, and superior curvature smoothness compared with APF, MPC, and RRT based baselines. These results confirm that the integrated DRF with convex feasible space and constrained iLQR solver provides a balanced solution for safe, efficient, and comfortable trajectory generation in dynamic and interactive traffic scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u548c\u51f8\u53ef\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675fiLQR\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u8212\u9002\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u4e3b\u53d8\u9053\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u78b0\u649e\u907f\u514d\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u98ce\u9669\u573a\uff08DRF\uff09\u6355\u6349\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u78b0\u649e\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u51f8\u53ef\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u88ab\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u57df\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ebf\u6027\u4e8c\u6b21\u8c03\u8282\u5668\uff08iLQR\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u77ed\u7684\u53d8\u9053\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0828.59\u7c73\uff09\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\uff082.84\u79d2\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5e73\u6ed1\u548c\u8212\u9002\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u73af\u5c9b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4APF\u3001MPC\u548cRRT\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u88d5\u5ea6\u3001\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u6025\u52a8\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u98ce\u9669\u573a\uff08DRF\uff09\u3001\u51f8\u53ef\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u7ea6\u675fiLQR\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u8212\u9002\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Various factors, including neurodegenerative diseases, can accelerate brain aging and measuring this phenomena could serve as a potential biomarker for clinical applications. While deep learning (DL)-based regression has recently attracted major attention, existing approaches often fail to capture the continuous nature of neuromorphological changes, potentially resulting in sub-optimal feature representation and results. To address this, we propose to use supervised contrastive learning with the recent Rank-N-Contrast (RNC) loss to estimate brain age based on widely used T1w structural MRI for the first time and leverage Grad-RAM to visually explain regression results. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.27 years and an $R^2$ of 0.93 with a limited dataset of training samples, significantly outperforming conventional deep regression with the same ResNet backbone while performing better or comparably with the state-of-the-art methods with significantly larger training data. Furthermore, Grad-RAM revealed more nuanced features related to age regression with the RNC loss than conventional deep regression. As an exploratory study, we employed the proposed method to estimate the gap between the biological and chronological brain ages in Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's disease patients, and revealed the correlation between the brain age gap and disease severity, demonstrating its potential as a biomarker in neurodegenerative disorders.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eRNC\u635f\u5931\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eMRI\u8111\u9f84\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u4e2d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u4f30\u8ba1\u8111\u9f84\u5e76\u89e3\u91ca\u56de\u5f52\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408Rank-N-Contrast\uff08RNC\uff09\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u57fa\u4e8eT1w\u7ed3\u6784MRI\u4f30\u8ba1\u8111\u9f84\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528Grad-RAM\u5bf9\u56de\u5f52\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e864.27\u5e74\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\uff08MAE\uff09\u548c0.93\u7684R\u00b2\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5927\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u3002Grad-RAM\u63ed\u793a\u4e86RNC\u635f\u5931\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\u56de\u5f52\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eRank-N-Contrast\uff08RNC\uff09\u635f\u5931\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8111\u9f84\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u66f4\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\uff08\u5982\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u548c\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The system will use a multi-layer structure; it will include an Application and Interface Layer, an Agents Layer, and a Data Source Layer to provide adaptive, transparent, and inclusive support. Fundamentally, a hybrid reasoning engine will synchronize four special-purpose agents, which include: a personalized-nutrition-based, called a Meal Planner Agent; an adaptive-scheduling-based, called a Reminder Agent; interactive assistance during grocery shopping and cooking, called a Food Guidance Agent; and a continuous-intake-and-physiological-tracking, called a Monitoring Agent. All the agents interact through a central communicative system called the Blackboard/Event Bus, which allows autonomous interaction and real-time feedback loops with multimedia user interfaces. Privacy-sensitive data sources, including electronic health records (EHRs), nutritional databases, wearable sensors, and smart kitchen Internet of Things, are also included in the framework and placed into a policy-controlled layer, which ensures data safety and compliance with consent. Collaborative care and clinician dashboards allow common supervision, and discussable artificial intelligence (XAI) modules give brief explanations of why a decision was made, making users responsible and reliant. The proposed agentic AI framework is an extension beyond traditional assistive systems since it incorporates inclusiveness, personalization, and accessibility at all levels. It displays the intersection of multi-agent reasoning, multi-modal interfaces, and human-centered design that will enable the development of autonomy, health, and digital equity among people with disabilities and neurodivergence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u5c42\u4ee3\u7406\u6027AI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u6b8b\u75be\u4eba\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4eba\u7fa4\u6539\u5584\u5065\u5eb7\u548c\u751f\u6d3b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u6b8b\u75be\u4eba\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4eba\u7fa4\u63d0\u4f9b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u5305\u5bb9\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u4ed6\u4eec\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\u548c\u89c4\u5f8b\u7684\u65e5\u5e38\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5e94\u7528\u4e0e\u63a5\u53e3\u5c42\u3001\u4ee3\u7406\u5c42\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u5c42\uff09\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u540c\u6b65\u56db\u4e2a\u4e13\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u81b3\u98df\u8ba1\u5212\u4ee3\u7406\u3001\u63d0\u9192\u4ee3\u7406\u3001\u98df\u7269\u6307\u5bfc\u4ee3\u7406\u3001\u76d1\u6d4b\u4ee3\u7406\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9ed1\u677f/\u4e8b\u4ef6\u603b\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ee3\u7406\u95f4\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6027AI\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u754c\u9762\u548c\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3001\u5065\u5eb7\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6027AI\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e3a\u6b8b\u75be\u4eba\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4eba\u7fa4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3001\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u5305\u5bb9\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u548c\u751f\u6d3b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Dodging such a sudden and fast projectile poses a significant challenge for UAVs, requiring ultra-low latency responses and agile maneuvers. Drawing inspiration from baseball, in which pitchers' body movements are analyzed to predict the ball's trajectory, we propose a novel real-time dodging system that leverages an RGB-D camera. Our approach integrates human pose estimation with depth information to predict the attacker's motion trajectory and the subsequent projectile trajectory. Additionally, we introduce an uncertainty-aware dodging strategy to enable the UAV to dodge incoming projectiles efficiently.

The framework uses autonomous but cooperative agents that reason, sense, and act throughout the entire event lifecycle, and use the intelligence of weather prediction to become real-time decision intelligence. Comparison of multi-year radar, satellite, and ground-based evaluation of the northern part of Pakistan demonstrates that the multi-agent configuration enhances forecast reliability, critical success index and warning lead time compared to the baseline models. Population reach was maximised, and errors during evacuation were minimised through communication and routing agents, and adaptive recalibration and transparent auditability were provided by the embedded layer of learning.

Predicting gene expression from histology images is a cost-effective alternative to expensive ST technologies. However, existing methods mainly focus on spot-level image-to-gene matching but fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure of ST data, especially on the gene expression side, leading to incomplete image-gene alignment. Moreover, a challenge arises from the inherent information asymmetry: gene expression profiles contain more molecular details that may lack salient visual correlates in histological images, demanding a sophisticated representation learning approach to bridge this modality gap. We propose HyperST, a framework for ST prediction that learns multi-level image-gene representations by modeling the data's inherent hierarchy within hyperbolic space, a natural geometric setting for such structures. First, we design a Multi-Level Representation Extractors to capture both spot-level and niche-level representations from each modality, providing context-aware information beyond individual spot-level image-gene pairs.

Traditional similarity measures ignore the dynamical processes underlying neural representations. Dynamical similarity methods offer a framework to compare the temporal structure of dynamical systems by embedding their (possibly) nonlinear dynamics into a globally linear space and there computing conjugacy metrics. However, identifying the best embedding and computing these metrics can be computationally slow. Here we introduce fast Dynamical Similarity Analysis (fastDSA), which is computationally far more efficient than previous methods while maintaining their accuracy and robustness. FastDSA introduces two key components that boost efficiency: (1) automatic selection of the effective model order of the Hankel (delay) embedding from the data via a data-driven singular-value threshold that identifies the informative subspace and discards noise to lower computational cost without sacrificing signal, and (2) a novel optimization procedure and objective, which replaces the slow exact orthogonality constraint in finding a minimal distance between dynamics matrices with a lightweight process to keep the search close to the space of orthogonal transformations. We demonstrate that fastDSA is at least an order of magnitude faster than the previous methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fastDSA has the properties of its ancestor, including its invariances and sensitivities to system dynamics.

They assume perception outputs are fully reliable, even in ambiguous or poorly observed scenes, leaving the planner without an explicit measure of uncertainty. To address this limitation, we propose a camera-only E2E framework that estimates aleatoric uncertainty directly in BEV space and incorporates it into planning. Our method produces a dense, uncertainty-aware drivability map that captures both semantic structure and geometric layout at pixel-level resolution. To further promote safe and rule-compliant behavior, we introduce a lane-following regularization that encodes lane structure and traffic norms. This prior stabilizes trajectory planning under normal conditions while preserving the flexibility needed for maneuvers such as overtaking or lane changes. Together, these components enable robust and interpretable trajectory planning, even under challenging uncertainty conditions. Evaluated on the NAVSIM benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering substantial gains on both the challenging NAVHARD and NAVSAFE subsets.

The resulting image quality depends critically on well-crafted prompts that specify both subjects and stylistic modifiers, which have become valuable digital assets. However, the rising value and ubiquity of high-quality prompts expose them to security and intellectual-property risks. One key threat is the prompt stealing attack, i.e., the task of recovering the textual prompt that generated a given image. Prompt stealing enables unauthorized extraction and reuse of carefully engineered prompts, yet it can also support beneficial applications such as data attribution, model provenance analysis, and watermarking validation. Existing approaches often assume white-box gradient access, require large-scale labeled datasets for supervised training, or rely solely on captioning without explicit optimization, limiting their practicality and adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose PROMPTMINER, a black-box prompt stealing framework that decouples the task into two phases: (1) a reinforcement learning-based optimization phase to reconstruct the primary subject, and (2) a fuzzing-driven search phase to recover stylistic modifiers. Experiments across multiple datasets and diffusion backbones demonstrate that PROMPTMINER achieves superior results, with CLIP similarity up to 0.958 and textual alignment with SBERT up to 0.751, surpassing all baselines. Even when applied to in-the-wild images with unknown generators, it outperforms the strongest baseline by 7.5 percent in CLIP similarity, demonstrating better generalization.

To discover the latent knowledge and insights hidden within massive datasets, we need to perform deep exploratory analysis to realize their full value. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems, more and more researchers are making use of these technologies for insight discovery. However, there are few benchmarks for evaluating insight discovery capabilities. As one of the most comprehensive existing frameworks, InsightBench also suffers from many critical flaws: format inconsistencies, poorly conceived objectives, and redundant insights. These issues may significantly affect the quality of data and the evaluation of agents.

One critical but understudied aspect is the \\textbf{potential risk} situations, where the risk is \\textbf{not yet observable} but can be inferred from subtle precursors, such as anomalous behaviors or commonsense violations. Recognizing these precursors requires strong semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities, which are often absent in current AV systems due to the scarcity of such cases in existing driving or risk-centric datasets. Moreover, current autonomous driving accident datasets often lack annotations of the causal reasoning chains behind incidents, which are essential for identifying potential risks before they become observable. To address these gaps, we introduce PotentialRiskQA, a novel vision-language dataset designed for reasoning about potential risks prior to observation. Each sample is annotated with structured scene descriptions, semantic precursors, and inferred risk outcomes. Based on this dataset, we further propose PR-Reasoner, a vision-language-model-based framework tailored for onboard potential risk reasoning.

Mentalese encodes abstract reasoning as ultra-compressed, structured tokens, enabling models to solve complex problems with far fewer steps. To improve both efficiency and accuracy, we propose SHORTER LENGTH PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION (SLPO), a reinforcement learning method that rewards concise solutions that stay correct, while still allowing longer reasoning when needed. Applied to Mentalese-aligned models, SLPO yields significantly higher compression rates by enabling concise reasoning that preserves the benefits of detailed thinking without the computational overhead. Across benchmarks including AIME 2024 and 2025, MinervaMath, OlympiadBench, Math500, and AMC, our ORION models produce reasoning traces with 4-16x fewer tokens, achieve up to 5x lower inference latency, and reduce training costs by 7-9x relative to the DeepSeek R1 Distilled model, while maintaining 90-98% of its accuracy.

To address this, we introduce Humanoid-LLA, a Large Language Action Model that maps expressive language commands to physically executable whole-body actions for humanoid robots. Our approach integrates three core components: a unified motion vocabulary that aligns human and humanoid motion primitives into a shared discrete space; a vocabulary-directed controller distilled from a privileged policy to ensure physical feasibility; and a physics-informed fine-tuning stage using reinforcement learning with dynamics-aware rewards to enhance robustness and stability. Extensive evaluations in simulation and on a real-world Unitree G1 humanoid show that Humanoid-LLA delivers strong language generalization while maintaining high physical fidelity, outperforming existing language-conditioned controllers in motion naturalness, stability, and execution success rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "Humanoid-LLA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u8fd0\u52a8\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u8a00\u547d\u4ee4\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6267\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bf9\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bed\u8a00\u547d\u4ee4\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6267\u884c\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u7edf\u4e00\u8fd0\u52a8\u8bcd\u6c47\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u5bfc\u5411\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u548c\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9eUnitree G1\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cHumanoid-LLA\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "Humanoid-LLA\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u7edf\u4e00\u8fd0\u52a8\u8bcd\u6c47\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u5bfc\u5411\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u548c\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6267\u884c\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bed\u8a00\u547d\u4ee4\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6267\u884c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We introduce Cue3D, the first comprehensive, model-agnostic framework for quantifying the influence of individual image cues in single-image 3D generation.

By systematically perturbing cues such as shading, texture, silhouette, perspective, edges, and local continuity, we measure their impact on 3D output quality. Our analysis reveals that shape meaningfulness, not texture, dictates generalization. Geometric cues, particularly shading, are crucial for 3D generation. We further identify over-reliance on provided silhouettes and diverse sensitivities to cues such as perspective and local continuity across model families.

To bridge this gap, we introduce TIM-PRM (Tool-Integrated Multimodal PRM), a novel agentic framework that transforms verification from a passive classification task into an active, tool-augmented investigation. TIM-PRM is trained to explicitly plan verification strategies and utilizes a mechanism of Independent Question Asking to query evidence via external tools, effectively decoupling verification from the reasoning context to eliminate confirmation bias.

However, fine-tuning on video tasks impairs the model's generalization ability to unseen classes. Existing methods attempt to mitigate this forgetting effect by regularizing the gap between hand-crafted prompts and soft prompts, but this also weakens the learning ability of soft prompts. To address this challenge, we propose a plug-and-play coupling prompt learning framework to optimize the generalization performance of V-L models in video tasks, with the core motivation of mitigating semantic space narrowing during fine-tuning by introducing an externally supervised prompt. Specifically, for textual prompts, we introduce pre-trained prompts from other datasets as hard prompt tokens. These are concatenated with soft prompt tokens and coupled via a learnable mapping layer. This competitive prompting approach prevents the semantic space from overfitting to supervised categories. In addition, we introduce a set of well-designed irrelevant video sets and negative prompts as generic attribute anchors to maintain the generic relevance of the attributes in the pre-trained semantic space, thus preserving the generalization ability.

Given multimodal inputs, MindPower first perceives the environment and human states, then performs ToM Reasoning to model both self and others, and finally generates decisions and actions guided by inferred mental states.

We present a virtual inking network (VIN) that autonomously localizes the surgical cut surface on whole-slide images, reducing reliance on inks and standardizing margin-focused review. VIN uses a frozen foundation model as the feature extractor and a compact two-layer multilayer perceptron trained for patch-level classification of cautery-consistent features. The dataset comprised 120 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides from 12 human tonsil tissue blocks, resulting in ~2 TB of uncompressed raw image data, where a board-certified pathologist provided boundary annotations. In blind testing with 20 slides from previously unseen blocks, VIN produced coherent margin overlays that qualitatively aligned with expert annotations across serial sections. Quantitatively, region-level accuracy was ~73.3% across the test set, with errors largely confined to limited areas that did not disrupt continuity of the whole-slide margin map.

We present DiskChunGS, a scalable 3DGS SLAM system that overcomes this bottleneck through an out-of-core approach that partitions scenes into spatial chunks and maintains only active regions in GPU memory while storing inactive areas on disk.

However, we observe that the resulting reasoning VLA often suffers from degraded action performance compared to the specialist model before fine-tuning, a phenomenon we refer to as action degeneration. To address this issue, we propose DualVLA, which enhances action performance through carefully designed post-training while still preserving reasoning capability. We first introduce a dual-layer data pruning method that removes redundant embodied reasoning, preventing it from adversely influencing action learning. To further strengthen action generation, we design a dual-teacher adaptive distillation strategy that assigns different supervision signals to different data domains while maintaining reasoning ability. To fill the evaluation gap for generalist VLAs, we also propose VLA Score, which decouples VLA capability into reasoning, intention, action, and alignment dimensions for a more fine-grained assessment. Experiments show that DualVLA achieves an average success rate of 61.0 in SimplerEnv and an average score of 65.4 across eight competitive multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating a stronger balance between precise action execution and multimodal understanding.

Existing approaches primarily rely on visual reconstruction objectives while neglecting physical priors, leading to sub-optimal performance in learning universal representations. To address these challenges, we propose a Universal Latent Action Learning framework that takes task instructions and multiple frames as inputs, and optimizes both future frame reconstruction and action sequence prediction. Unlike prior works, incorporating action predictions (e.g., gripper or hand trajectories and orientations) allows the model to capture richer physical priors such as real-world distances and orientations, thereby enabling seamless transferability to downstream tasks. We further decompose the latent actions into learnable motion and scene tokens to distinguish the robot's active movements from environmental changes, thus filtering out irrelevant dynamics. By distilling the learned latent actions into the latest VLA models, we achieve strong performance across both simulated (SIMPLER and LIBERO) and real-world robot settings.

This research highlights the role of P2P trading in efficient energy distribution and its synergy with advanced optimization techniques. While traditional rule-based methods perform well under stable conditions, they struggle in dynamic environments. To address this, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), is combined with community/distributed P2P trading mechanisms. By incorporating auction-based market clearing, a price advisor agent, and load and battery management, the approach achieves significant improvements. Results show that, compared to baseline models, DQN reduces electricity costs by 14.2% in Ireland and 5.16% in Finland, while increasing electricity revenue by 7.24% and 12.73%, respectively. PPO achieves the lowest peak hour demand, reducing it by 55.5% in Ireland, while DQN reduces peak hour demand by 50.0% in Ireland and 27.02% in Finland. These improvements are attributed to both MARL algorithms and P2P energy trading, which together results in electricity cost and peak hour demand reduction, and increase electricity selling revenue.

Models that focus on addressing specific weather challenges are unable to adapt to various weather changes and primarily prioritize their weather removal characteristics. Our study introduces a semantic-enabled network for object detection in diverse weather conditions. In our analysis, semantics information can enable the model to generate plausible content for missing areas, understand object boundaries, and preserve visual coherency and realism across both filled-in and existing portions of the image, which are conducive to image transformation and object recognition. Specific in implementation, our architecture consists of a Preprocessing Unit (PPU) and a Detection Unit (DTU), where the PPU utilizes a U-shaped net enriched by semantics to refine degraded images, and the DTU integrates this semantic information for object detection using a modified YOLO network. Our method pioneers the use of semantic data for all-weather transformations, resulting in an increase between 1.47\\% to 8.80\\% in mAP compared to existing methods across benchmark datasets of different weather.

In agriculture, these dual-modal capabilities offer promising applications such as precision farming, crop monitoring, pest detection, and environmental sustainability. While several Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets and benchmarks have been developed to evaluate VLM performance, they often fail to adequately assess the critical reasoning and problem-solving skills required in complex agricultural contexts. To address this gap, we introduce AgriCoT, a VQA dataset that incorporates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, specifically designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of VLMs. With 4,535 carefully curated samples, AgriCoT offers a comprehensive and robust evaluation of reasoning abilities for VLMs, particularly in zero-shot scenarios, by focusing on their capacity to engage in logical reasoning and effective problem-solving. Our evaluations, conducted with 26 representative VLMs, including both proprietary and open-source models, reveal that while some proprietary models excel at answering questions, there is a notable and significant gap in their reasoning capabilities.

Watson Research Center, New York, USA, 2024", "summary": "Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a musculoskeletal condition that can cause significant limitations and impairments in daily activities, especially among older individuals. To evaluate the severity of KOA, typically, X-ray images of the affected knee are analyzed, and a grade is assigned based on the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading system, which classifies KOA severity into five levels, ranging from 0 to 4. This approach requires a high level of expertise and time and is susceptible to subjective interpretation, thereby introducing potential diagnostic inaccuracies. To address this problem a stacked ensemble model of fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) was developed for two classification tasks: a binary classifier for detecting the presence of KOA, and a multiclass classifier for precise grading across the KL spectrum. The proposed stacked ensemble model consists of a diverse set of pre-trained architectures, including MobileNetV2, You Only Look Once (YOLOv8), and DenseNet201 as base learners and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) as the meta-learner.

In contrast, humans leverage the metacognitive model with memory, enabling continuous strategy refinement through metacognitive control when faced with new challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose metacognitive test-time reasoning (MCTR), a framework that equips models with the ability to learn, adapt, and improve during test time through metacognitive self-updating. Inspired by the dual structure of human metacognition, MCTR comprises meta-level and object-level VLM reasoning modules, each equipped with dedicated memory systems for hierarchical adaptive reasoning. Specifically, MCTR consists of (1) a meta-reasoning module which incrementally builds a structured memory by discovering and storing task-relevant rules, environmental patterns, and action-outcome relationships from test-time observations as natural language descriptions; and (2) an action-reasoning module that determines optimal actions through context-aware perception and strategic reasoning by dynamically retrieving and integrating knowledge from memory. The action-reasoning module continuously updates its policy through proposed metacognitive test-time reinforcement learning, adapting as knowledge memory evolves. We evaluate MCTR on 45 Atari games (33 seen, 12 unseen). MCTR demonstrates robust test-time adaptation, achieving 9/12 top-1 results on unseen games compared with baselines.

However, its practical application is hindered by a critical limitation, i.e., insufficient fault tolerance against observational faults. Such faults, which appear as perturbations in the vehicles' perceived data, can substantially compromise the performance of MARL-based driving systems. Addressing this problem presents two primary challenges. One is to generate adversarial perturbations that effectively stress the policy during training, and the other is to equip vehicles with the capability to mitigate the impact of corrupted observations. To overcome the challenges, we propose a fault-tolerant MARL method for cooperative on-ramp vehicles incorporating two key agents. First, an adversarial fault injection agent is co-trained to generate perturbations that actively challenge and harden the vehicle policies. Second, we design a novel fault-tolerant vehicle agent equipped with a self-diagnosis capability, which leverages the inherent spatio-temporal correlations in vehicle state sequences to detect faults and reconstruct credible observations, thereby shielding the policy from misleading inputs.

Recent studies have revealed critical vulnerabilities in this pipeline and introduced computation cost attacks that lead to malicious resource occupancies and even denial-of-service (DoS) conditions, thereby hindering the reliable deployment of 3DGS. In this paper, we propose the first effective and comprehensive black-box defense framework, named RemedyGS, against such computation cost attacks, safeguarding 3DGS reconstruction systems and services. Our pipeline comprises two key components: a detector to identify the attacked input images with poisoned textures and a purifier to recover the benign images from their attacked counterparts, mitigating the adverse effects of these attacks. Moreover, we incorporate adversarial training into the purifier to enforce distributional alignment between the recovered and original natural images, thereby enhancing the defense efficacy.

We present IMTalker, a novel framework that achieves efficient and high-fidelity talking face generation through implicit motion transfer. The core idea is to replace traditional flow-based warping with a cross-attention mechanism that implicitly models motion discrepancy and identity alignment within a unified latent space, enabling robust global motion rendering. To further preserve speaker identity during cross-identity reenactment, we introduce an identity-adaptive module that projects motion latents into personalized spaces, ensuring clear disentanglement between motion and identity.

Existing methods fail to capture the structural information within video, and suffer from insufficient fine-grained modeling of multi-modal features. To address these issues, we are the first to introduce a new multi-modal scene graph that explicitly models the objects and their relationship as a visually grounded, structured representation of the audio-visual scene. Furthermore, we design a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network~(KAN)-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) to enhance the expressive power of the temporal integration stage. This enables more fine-grained modeling of cross-modal interactions within the question-aware fused audio-visual representation, leading to capture richer and more nuanced patterns and then improve temporal reasoning performance.

Calibration of road networks in microsimulators to reproduce ephemeral phenomena such as traffic waves for large-scale simulation is a process that is fraught with challenges. This work reconsiders the existence of the traffic state data as boundary conditions on an ego vehicle moving through previously recorded traffic data, rather than reproducing those traffic phenomena in a calibrated microsim. Our approach is to autogenerate a 1 mile highway segment corresponding to I-24, and use the I-24 data to power a cosimulation module that injects traffic information into the simulation. The CARLA and cosimulation simulations are centered around an ego vehicle sampled from the empirical data, with autogeneration of \"visible\" traffic within the longitudinal range of the ego vehicle. Boundary control beyond these visible ranges is achieved using ghost cells behind (upstream) and ahead (downstream) of the ego vehicle. Unlike prior simulation work that focuses on local car-following behavior or abstract geometries, our framework targets full time-space diagram fidelity as the validation objective. Leveraging CARLA's rich sensor suite and configurable vehicle dynamics, we simulate wave formation and dissipation in both low-congestion and high-congestion scenarios for qualitative analysis. The resulting emergent behavior closely mirrors that of real traffic, providing a novel cosimulation framework for evaluating traffic control strategies, perception-driven autonomy, and future deployment of wave mitigation solutions. Our work bridges microscopic modeling with physical experimental data, enabling the first perceptually realistic, boundary-driven simulation of empirical traffic wave phenomena in CARLA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u5fae\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528CARLA\u548cI-24 MOTION\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u4ea4\u901a\u6ce2\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ea4\u901a\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u6821\u51c6\u5fae\u4eff\u771f\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u4ee5\u91cd\u73b0\u77ac\u6001\u73b0\u8c61\uff08\u5982\u4ea4\u901a\u6ce2\uff09\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u8bf8\u591a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651\u4ea4\u901a\u72b6\u6001\u6570\u636e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u4e0eI-24\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528I-24\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5171\u4eff\u771f\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c06\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u606f\u6ce8\u5165\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u56f4\u7ed5\u4ece\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u8f66\u8f86\u5c55\u5f00\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5176\u7eb5\u5411\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u201c\u53ef\u89c1\u201d\u4ea4\u901a\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u4f4e\u62e5\u5835\u548c\u9ad8\u62e5\u5835\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u6a21\u62df\u6ce2\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u6d88\u6563\uff0c\u5176\u6d8c\u73b0\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4ea4\u901a\u975e\u5e38\u63a5\u8fd1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u5fae\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5728CARLA\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u6ce2\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ea4\u901a\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5171\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, achieving reliable forecasts remains challenging in regions with complex terrain and strong atmospheric dynamics such as East Asia. While foundation models such as Aurora offer global generality, they often miss region-specific dynamics and rely on non-real-time inputs, limiting their practical utility for localized warning systems. To address this gap, we construct and release the real-world observations and high-resolution CMAQ-OBS dataset for East Asia, reducing regional error by 59.5% and enabling real-time 48-120 hour forecasts critical for public health alerts. However, standard point-wise objectives cannot reflect asymmetric operational costs, where false alarms deteriorate public trust while missed severe events endanger populations. This cost mismatch causes SFT models to over-predict and yield high False Alarm Rates. We introduce Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with class-wise rewards and curriculum rollout to align predictions with operational priorities. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the reliability of the forecast. Compared to the SFT-only baseline, our model reduces the False Alarm Rate by 47.3% while achieving a competitive F1-score, proving its effectiveness for practical, real-world air quality forecasting systems on long lead time scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7GRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cCMAQ-OBS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e1c\u4e9aPM\u6d53\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62a5\u738747.3%\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u5730\u5f62\u548c\u5f3a\u5927\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u533a\u57df\uff08\u5982\u4e1c\u4e9a\uff09PM\u6d53\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62a5\u5bf9\u516c\u4f17\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u6f0f\u62a5\u5bf9\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u5371\u5bb3\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387CMAQ-OBS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408GRPO\uff08Group-Relative Policy Optimization\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7c7b\u522b\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u533a\u57df\u8bef\u5dee\u51cf\u5c1159.5%\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b048-120\u5c0f\u65f6\u5b9e\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u964d\u4f4e47.3%\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "GRPO\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86PM\u6d53\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8647.3%\u7684\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u7a7a\u6c14\u8d28\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

We suggest an agentic AI model that will be used to monitor the inventory, initiate purchase attempts to the appropriate suppliers, and scan for trending or high-margin products to incorporate. The system applies demand forecasting, supplier selection optimization, multi-agent negotiation and continuous learning.

Egocentric frames are processed by a structured VLM prompt, embedded and matched against a curated database of validated scenarios, and mapped to joint-level impedance commands via inverse kinematics. We evaluate the system on tabletop manipulation tasks with and without human presence, including wiping, object handovers, and liquid pouring. The results show that the pipeline adapts stiffness, damping, and speed profiles in a context-aware manner, maintaining task success while improving safety.

Integrating bio-inspired design principles into linear actuators could bring forth the next generation of adaptive and energy efficient smart material-based actuation systems. The present study amalgamates the advantages of bipenniform architecture, which generates high force in the given physiological region and a high power-to-weight ratio of shape memory alloy (SMA), into a novel bio-inspired SMA-based linear actuator. A mathematical model of a multi-layered bipenniform configuration-based SMA actuator was developed and validated experimentally. The current research also caters to the incorporation of failure mitigation strategies using design failure mode and effects analysis along with the experimental assessment of the performance of the developed actuator. The system has been benchmarked against an industry-developed stepper motor-driven actuator. It has shown promising results generating an actuation force of 257 N with 15 V input voltage, meeting the acceptable range for actuation operation. It further exhibits about 67% reduction in the weight of the drive mechanism, with 80% lesser component, 32% cost reduction, and 19% energy savings and similar envelope dimensions for assembly compatibility with dampers and louvers for easy onsite deployment. The study introduces SMA coil-based actuator as an advanced design that can be deployed for high force-high stroke applications. The bio-inspired SMA-based linear actuator has applications ranging from building automation controls to lightweight actuation systems for space robotics and medical prosthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eSMA\u7684\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u7ebf\u6027\u6267\u884c\u5668\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u4e14\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u6267\u884c\u5668\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7535\u78c1\u6267\u884c\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u4f53\u79ef\u5927\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u590d\u6742\u548c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u4e86\u65b0\u578b\u6267\u884c\u5668\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u53cc\u7fbd\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548cSMA\u7684\u9ad8\u529f\u7387\u91cd\u91cf\u6bd4\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u591a\u5c42\u53cc\u7fbd\u72b6\u914d\u7f6e\u7684SMA\u6267\u884c\u5668\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ca\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6790\uff08DFMEA\uff09\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u6545\u969c\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u6267\u884c\u5668\u572815V\u8f93\u5165\u7535\u538b\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f257N\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\uff0c\u91cd\u91cf\u51cf\u8f7b67%\uff0c\u90e8\u4ef6\u51cf\u5c1180%\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e32%\uff0c\u8282\u80fd19%\uff0c\u4e14\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6267\u884c\u5668\u517c\u5bb9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u72b6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5408\u91d1\uff08SMA\uff09\u7684\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u7ebf\u6027\u6267\u884c\u5668\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u7b51\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u533b\u7597\u5047\u4f53\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

Unlike conventional supervised fine-tuning, SuperIntelliAgent learns autonomously without annotation: the learner generates candidate outputs, the verifier evaluates them through step-by-step reasoning, and their interaction produces chosen/rejected pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This converts each input into a pseudo-training signal for continual improvement. The framework integrates dual-scale memory: short-term in-context memory that preserves reasoning traces across refinement cycles, and long-term memory that consolidates acquired knowledge through lightweight on-the-fly fine-tuning. A replay buffer retains samples that show verifiable progress and replays them as auxiliary supervision, reinforcing recent learning while forming adaptive curricula. SuperIntelliAgent is infrastructure-agnostic and can be plugged into existing agentic frameworks while turning ordinary inference loops into a lifelong optimization process. We posit that pairing a trainable learner with a reasoning-capable verifier forms a minimal reliable unit of growing intelligence, as paired feedback and partial-history replay yield richer learning curricula and stronger preference alignment. With a small number of automatically generated DPO pairs, the learner improves across all benchmarks, indicating that this mechanism provides a promising direction for continual intelligence accumulation and real-world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "SuperIntelliAgent \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u548c\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u56de\u653e\u7f13\u51b2\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u667a\u80fd\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u667a\u80fd\u589e\u957f\u3002SuperIntelliAgent \u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u548c\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u4ea4\u4e92\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u8f93\u51fa\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u3002\u53cc\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff08\u77ed\u671f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u957f\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff09\u53ca\u56de\u653e\u7f13\u51b2\u673a\u5236\u7528\u4e8e\u5de9\u56fa\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684 DPO \u5bf9\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u5728\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u667a\u80fd\u79ef\u7d2f\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SuperIntelliAgent \u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u667a\u80fd\u589e\u957f\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u56de\u653e\u7f13\u51b2\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing approaches to disassembly sequence planning often assume deterministic and fully observable product models, yet real EOL products frequently deviate from their initial designs due to wear, corrosion, or undocumented repairs. We argue that disassembly should therefore be formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), which naturally captures uncertainty about the product's internal state. We present a mathematical formulation of disassembly as a POMDP, in which hidden variables represent uncertain structural or physical properties. Building on this formulation, we propose a task and motion planning framework that automatically derives specific POMDP models from CAD data, robot capabilities, and inspection results. To obtain tractable policies, we approximate this formulation with a reinforcement-learning approach that operates on stochastic action outcomes informed by inspection priors, while a Bayesian filter continuously maintains beliefs over latent EOL conditions during execution. Using three products on two robotic systems, we demonstrate that this probabilistic planning framework outperforms deterministic baselines in terms of average disassembly time and variance, generalizes across different robot setups, and successfully adapts to deviations from the CAD model, such as missing or stuck parts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8ePOMDP\u7684\u6982\u7387\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u62c6\u5378\u62a5\u5e9f\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u5faa\u73af\u7ecf\u6d4e\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u62c6\u5378\u62a5\u5e9f\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u4ea7\u54c1\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u786e\u5b9a\u4e14\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u62a5\u5e9f\u4ea7\u54c1\u5e38\u56e0\u78e8\u635f\u3001\u8150\u8680\u6216\u672a\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u7ef4\u4fee\u800c\u504f\u79bb\u521d\u59cb\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08POMDP\uff09\u7684\u62c6\u5378\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6ee4\u6ce2\u6765\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u4ea7\u54c1\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u5e73\u5747\u62c6\u5378\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u9002\u5e94CAD\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6982\u7387\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u62c6\u5378\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u65b9\u5dee\u3001\u9002\u5e94CAD\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5dee\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002"}}

However, replicating and advancing this ability is non-trivial, with current methods often trapped between the instability of end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) and the rigidity of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). This leads to models that either struggle to learn or lack the cognitive flexibility required for complex, real-world scenes. To navigate this dilemma, we introduce GRiP (Guided Reasoning and Perception), a novel two-stage training framework that cultivates robust and flexible visual grounded reasoning by explicitly guiding the model's perceptual focus and logical pathways. GRiP's core lies in its cognitive-enhanced RL stage, which features two key innovations: (1) a Salience-Weighted IoU Reward that incentivizes the model to prioritize the localization of mission-critical objects over trivial distractors, and (2) a Multi-Heuristic Reward that encourages cognitive flexibility by rewarding diverse yet logically valid reasoning pathways. Initialized from the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model, GRiP demonstrates significant performance gains across multiple challenging benchmarks.

While multi-turn interaction offers a superior understanding of environmental dynamics via authentic feedback, current approaches often impose a rigid reasoning process, which constrains the model's active learning, ultimately hindering efficient world model reasoning. To address these issues, we explore world-model internalization through efficient interaction and active reasoning (WMAct), which liberates the model from structured reasoning, allowing the model to shape thinking directly through its doing, and achieves effective and efficient world model reasoning with two key mechanisms: (1) a reward rescaling mechanism adjusting outcome reward based on action efficacy to incentivize redundancy reduction and purposeful interaction; (2) an interaction frequency annealing strategy to progressively reduce the maximum allowed interaction turns, which compels the model to condense its learning and internalize environmental dynamics rather than over-relying on environmental cues.

MTR provides a strong foundation for multimodal trajectory prediction by localizing agent intent and refining motion iteratively via motion query pairs; we name our approach MTR-VP (Motion Transformer for Vision-based Planning), and instead of the learnable intention queries used in the MTR decoder, we use cross attention on the intent and the context embeddings, which reflect a combination of information encoded from the driving scene and past vehicle states.

We analyze our architecture using ablation studies, removing input images and multiple trajectory output.

Despite its importance, existing methods often approximate foot contact using a zero-velocity constraint and focus on joint-level contact, failing to capture the detailed interaction between the foot and the world. Dense estimation of foot contact is crucial for accurately modeling this interaction, yet predicting dense foot contact from a single RGB image remains largely underexplored. There are two main challenges for learning dense foot contact estimation. First, shoes exhibit highly diverse appearances, making it difficult for models to generalize across different styles. Second, ground often has a monotonous appearance, making it difficult to extract informative features. To tackle these issues, we present a FEet COntact estimation (FECO) framework that learns dense foot contact with shoe style-invariant and ground-aware learning. To overcome the challenge of shoe appearance diversity, our approach incorporates shoe style adversarial training that enforces shoe style-invariant features for contact estimation.

At the global level, the agent is localized on SMG and a goal-conditioned node path is planned via an image-to-instance hybrid retrieval, producing a sequence of reachable waypoints for long-horizon guidance. At the local level, a navigation foundation policy executes these waypoints in point-goal mode with obstacle-aware control, and switches to image-goal mode when navigating from the final node towards the visual target. To further enhance viewpoint alignment and goal recognition, we introduce VGGT-adapter, a lightweight geometric module built on the pre-trained VGGT model, which aligns observation and goal features in a shared 3D-aware space.

Particularly, existing methods for the 3D object generation tasks, which is one of the fastest-growing segments in computer vision, pre-dominantly use text-to-image diffusion models with textual inversion which train a pseudo text prompt to describe the given image. In practice, various text-to-image generative models employ textual inversion to learn concepts or styles of target object in the pseudo text prompt embedding space, thereby generating sophisticated outputs. However, textual inversion requires additional training time and lacks control ability. To tackle this issues, we propose two innovative methods: (1) using an off-the-shelf image adapter that generates 3D objects without textual inversion, offering enhanced control over conditions such as depth, pose, and text. (2) a depth conditioned warmup strategy to enhance 3D consistency. In experimental results, ours show qualitatively and quantitatively comparable performance and improved 3D consistency to the existing text-inversion-based alternatives.

It enables precise visual servoing for VLA systems, scalable robot-centric data augmentation, accurate real-to-sim transfer, and reliable safety monitoring in dynamic human-robot environments. Despite the strong capabilities of modern segmentation models, surprisingly it remains challenging to segment robots. This is due to robot embodiment diversity, appearance ambiguity, structural complexity, and rapid shape changes. Embracing these challenges, we introduce RobotSeg, a foundation model for robot segmentation in image and video. RobotSeg is built upon the versatile SAM 2 foundation model but addresses its three limitations for robot segmentation, namely the lack of adaptation to articulated robots, reliance on manual prompts, and the need for per-frame training mask annotations, by introducing a structure-enhanced memory associator, a robot prompt generator, and a label-efficient training strategy. These innovations collectively enable a structure-aware, automatic, and label-efficient solution. We further construct the video robot segmentation (VRS) dataset comprising over 2.8k videos (138k frames) with diverse robot embodiments and environments.

Such inconsistencies are particularly problematic for editing of 3D representations such as NeRFs or Gaussian Splat models. We propose a training-free diffusion framework that enforces multi-view consistency during the image editing process. The key assumption is that corresponding points in the unedited images should undergo similar transformations after editing. To achieve this, we introduce a consistency loss that guides the diffusion sampling toward coherent edits. The framework is flexible and can be combined with widely varying image editing methods, supporting both dense and sparse multi-view editing setups. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves 3D consistency compared to existing multi-view editing methods. We also show that this increased consistency enables high-quality Gaussian Splat editing with sharp details and strong fidelity to user-specified text prompts.

In this study, we introduce MrGS, a multi-modal radiance field based on 3DGS that simultaneously reconstructs both RGB and thermal 3D scenes. Specifically, MrGS derives RGB- and thermal-related information from a single appearance feature through orthogonal feature extraction and employs view-dependent or view-independent embedding strategies depending on the degree of Lambertian reflectance exhibited by each modality. Furthermore, we leverage two physics-based principles to effectively model thermal-domain phenomena. First, we integrate Fourier's law of heat conduction prior to alpha blending to model intensity interpolation caused by thermal conduction between neighboring Gaussians. Second, we apply the Stefan-Boltzmann law and the inverse-square law to formulate a depth-aware thermal radiation map that imposes additional geometric constraints on thermal rendering.

However, most existing models remain confined to single-image understanding, which greatly limits their applicability in clinical workflows. In practice, medical diagnosis and progression often require synthesizing information across multiple images from different modalities or time points. The development of medical MLLMs capable of such multi-image understanding has been hindered by the lack of large-scale, high-quality annotated training data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that leverages license-permissive compound images in biomedical literature, as a rich yet underutilized data source for multi-image analysis. Specifically, we design a five-stage, context-aware instruction generation paradigm underpinned by a divide-and-conquer strategy. By decomposing multi-image analysis into manageable sub-tasks, this paradigm empowers MLLMs to move beyond single-panel analysis and provide a composite understanding by learning the complex spatial, temporal, and cross-modal relationships inherent in these compound figures. By parsing over 237,000 compound figures and their contextual text for instruction generation, we develop M3LLM, a medical multi-image multi-modal large language model. For benchmarking, we construct PMC-MI-Bench for composite understanding, manually validated by medical experts. Extensive experiments show that M3LLM significantly outperforms both general-purpose and specialized medical MLLMs across multi-image, single-image, text-only, and multi-choice scenarios. Notably, M3LLM exhibits strong generalization to longitudinal chest X-ray analysis using the MIMIC dataset. This work establishes a scalable and efficient paradigm for developing medical MLLMs capable of composite reasoning, bridging the gap between biomedical literature and real-world clinical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6e90\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86M3LLM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u533b\u5b66MLLMs\u5728\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u533b\u5b66MLLMs\u5927\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002\u533b\u5b66\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u8fdb\u5c55\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u7efc\u5408\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u6216\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u7684\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u6b64\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e94\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u800c\u6cbb\u4e4b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b66\u4e60\u590d\u5408\u56fe\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u8d85\u8fc7237,000\u5f20\u590d\u5408\u56fe\u53ca\u5176\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6587\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u6307\u4ee4\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86M3LLM\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "M3LLM\u5728\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u548c\u591a\u9009\u62e9\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u533b\u5b66MLLMs\uff0c\u5e76\u5728MIMIC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7eb5\u5411\u80f8\u90e8X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u590d\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

Our pipeline utilizes advanced neural rendering with a reactive environment to generate high-fidelity multi-view observations controlled by the perturbed ego trajectory. Furthermore, we develop a pseudo-expert trajectory generation mechanism for these newly simulated states to provide action supervision. Upon the synthesized data, we find that a simple co-training strategy on both real-world and simulated samples can lead to significant improvements in both robustness and generalization for various planning methods on challenging real-world benchmarks, up to +6.8 EPDMS on navhard and +2.9 on navtest. More importantly, such policy improvement scales smoothly by increasing simulation data only, even without extra real-world data streaming in.

Existing methods typically rely on pre-trained 2D super-resolution (2DSR) models to enhance textures, but suffer from 3D Gaussian ambiguity arising from cross-view inconsistencies and domain gaps inherent in 2DSR models. We propose IE-SRGS, a novel 3DGS SR paradigm that addresses this issue by jointly leveraging the complementary strengths of external 2DSR priors and internal 3DGS features. Specifically, we use 2DSR and depth estimation models to generate HR images and depth maps as external knowledge, and employ multi-scale 3DGS models to produce cross-view consistent, domain-adaptive counterparts as internal knowledge. A mask-guided fusion strategy is introduced to integrate these two sources and synergistically exploit their complementary strengths, effectively guiding the 3D Gaussian optimization toward high-fidelity reconstruction.

The effectiveness of this strategy heavily depends on the number and diversity of noise seeds explored. However, verifying each candidate is computationally expensive, because each must be fully denoised before a reward can be computed. This severely limits the number of samples that can be explored under a fixed budget. We propose test-time scaling with noise-aware pruning (TTSnap), a framework that prunes low-quality candidates without fully denoising them. The key challenge is that reward models are learned in the clean image domain, and the ranking of rewards predicted for intermediate estimates are often inconsistent with those predicted for clean images. To overcome this, we train noise-aware reward models via self-distillation to align the reward for intermediate estimates with that of the final clean images. To stabilize learning across different noise levels, we adopt a curriculum training strategy that progressively shifts the data domain from clean images to noise images. In addition, we introduce a new metric that measures reward alignment and computational budget utilization. Experiments demonstrate that our approach improves performance by over 16\\% compared with existing methods, enabling more efficient and effective test-time scaling. It also provides orthogonal gains when combined with post-training techniques and local test-time optimization.

However, they still struggle with personalization, which requires adapting a pretrained model to depict user-specific subjects from only a few reference images. The key challenge lies in learning a new visual concept from a limited number of reference images while preserving the pretrained semantic prior that maintains text-image alignment. When the model focuses on subject fidelity, it tends to overfit the limited reference images and fails to leverage the pretrained distribution. Conversely, emphasizing prior preservation maintains semantic consistency but prevents the model from learning new personalized attributes. Building on these observations, we propose the personalization process through a semantic anchoring that guides adaptation by grounding new concepts in their corresponding distributions. We therefore reformulate personalization as the process of learning a rare concept guided by its frequent counterpart through semantic anchoring. This anchoring encourages the model to adapt new concepts in a stable and controlled manner, expanding the pretrained distribution toward personalized regions while preserving its semantic structure. As a result, the proposed method achieves stable adaptation and consistent improvements in both subject fidelity and text-image alignment compared to baseline methods.

We trace this gap to the different behaviors in high-frequency encoding and decoding. Through controlled perturbations in both RGB and latent domains, we analyze encoder/decoder behaviors and find that decoders depend strongly on high-frequency latent components to recover details, whereas encoders under-represent high-frequency contents, yielding insufficient exposure and underfitting in high-frequency bands for diffusion model training. To address this issue, we introduce FreqWarm, a plug-and-play frequency warm-up curriculum that increases early-stage exposure to high-frequency latent signals during diffusion or flow-matching training -- without modifying or retraining the autoencoder. Applied across several high-dimensional autoencoders, FreqWarm consistently improves generation quality: decreasing gFID by 14.11 on Wan2.2-VAE, 6.13 on LTX-VAE, and 4.42 on DC-AE-f32, while remaining architecture-agnostic and compatible with diverse backbones.

Given the significant value of 3DGS assets, recent works have introduced specialized watermarking schemes to ensure copyright protection and ownership verification. However, can existing 3D Gaussian watermarking approaches genuinely guarantee robust protection of the 3D assets? In this paper, for the first time, we systematically explore and validate possible vulnerabilities of 3DGS watermarking frameworks. We demonstrate that conventional watermark removal techniques designed for 2D images do not effectively generalize to the 3DGS scenario due to the specialized rendering pipeline and unique attributes of each gaussian primitives. Motivated by this insight, we propose GSPure, the first watermark purification framework specifically for 3DGS watermarking representations. By analyzing view-dependent rendering contributions and exploiting geometrically accurate feature clustering, GSPure precisely isolates and effectively removes watermark-related Gaussian primitives while preserving scene integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GSPure achieves the best watermark purification performance, reducing watermark PSNR by up to 16.34dB while minimizing degradation to original scene fidelity with less than 1dB PSNR loss.

However, directly applying VGGT to autonomous driving (AD) systems leads to sub-optimal results due to the different priors between the two tasks. In AD systems, several important new priors need to be considered: (i) The overlap between camera views is minimal, as autonomous driving sensor setups are designed to achieve coverage at a low cost. (ii) The camera intrinsics and extrinsics are known, which introduces more constraints on the output and also enables the estimation of absolute scale. (iii) Relative positions of all cameras remain fixed though the ego vehicle is in motion. To fully integrate these priors into a feed-forward framework, we propose DriveVGGT, a scale-aware 4D reconstruction framework specifically designed for autonomous driving data. Specifically, we propose a Temporal Video Attention (TVA) module to process multi-camera videos independently, which better leverages the spatiotemporal continuity within each single-camera sequence. Then, we propose a Multi-camera Consistency Attention (MCA) module to conduct window attention with normalized relative pose embeddings, aiming to establish consistency relationships across different cameras while restricting each token to attend only to nearby frames. Finally, we extend the standard VGGT heads by adding an absolute scale head and an ego vehicle pose head.

Their realization lowers the distribution entropy of each remaining patch feature, analogous to collapsing a particle's wave function in quantum mechanics. This phenomenon can intuitively be called patch collapse. To identify which patches are most relied on during a target region's collapse, we learn an autoencoder that softly selects a subset of patches to reconstruct each target patch. Graphing these learned dependencies for each patch's PageRank score reveals the optimal patch order to realize an image. We show that respecting this order benefits various masked image modeling methods. First, autoregressive image generation can be boosted by retraining the state-of-the-art model MAR. Next, we introduce a new setup for image classification by exposing Vision Transformers only to high-rank patches in the collapse order. Seeing 22\\% of such patches is sufficient to achieve high accuracy. With these experiments, we propose patch collapse as a novel image modeling perspective that promotes vision efficiency.

Unlike existing methods that operate on individual images or densely sampled videos, our framework performs set-to-set generation: given a source set and user prompts, it produces a new set that preserves cross-image consistency of shared content. Our key idea is to model the task as a graph, where each node corresponds to an image and each edge triggers a joint generation of image pairs. This formulation consolidates all pairwise generations into a unified framework, enforcing their local consistency while ensuring global coherence across the entire set. This is achieved by fusing internal features across image pairs, guided by dense input correspondences, without requiring masks or manual supervision. It also allows us to leverage an emergent prior in text-to-image models that encourages coherent generation when multiple views share a single canvas.

In this task, the detection of small objects is particularly difficult. Other than the small size, it is also accompanied by difficulties due to blur, occlusion, and so on. Current small object detection methods are tailored to small and dense situations, such as pedestrians in a crowd or far objects in remote sensing scenarios. However, when the target object is small and sparse, there is a lack of objects available for training, making it more difficult to learn effective features. In this paper, we propose a specialized method for detecting a specific category of small objects; birds. Particularly, we improve the features learned by the neck; the sub-network between the backbone and the prediction head, to learn more effective features with a hierarchical design. We employ Swin Transformer to upsample the image features. Moreover, we change the shifted window size for adapting to small objects. Experiments show that the proposed Swin Transformer-based neck combined with CenterNet can lead to good performance by changing the window sizes. We further find that smaller window sizes (default 2) benefit mAPs for small object detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u7a00\u758f\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u9e1f\u7c7b\uff09\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6539\u8fdbneck\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u8c03\u6574Swin Transformer\u7a97\u53e3\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8f83\u5c0f\u7a97\u53e3\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u56e0\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5c0f\u3001\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u906e\u6321\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u9488\u5bf9\u5bc6\u96c6\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u4e0d\u8db3\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u9e1f\u7c7b\uff09\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdbneck\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548cSwin Transformer\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5e76\u8c03\u6574\u7a97\u53e3\u5927\u5c0f\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eSwin Transformer\u7684neck\u7ed3\u5408CenterNet\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u7a97\u53e3\u5927\u5c0f\u80fd\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u7a97\u53e3\u5927\u5c0f\u5bf9\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684mAP\u6709\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8Swin Transformer\u7684\u7a97\u53e3\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CenterNet\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u7a97\u53e3\u5927\u5c0f\uff08\u9ed8\u8ba4\u4e3a2\uff09\u5bf9\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684mAP\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002"}}

This characteristic creates an intrinsic synergy between representation learning and data generation. However, the generative quality of standard NFs is limited by poor semantic representations from log-likelihood optimization. To remedy this, we propose a novel alignment strategy that creatively leverages the invertibility of NFs: instead of regularizing the forward pass, we align the intermediate features of the generative (reverse) pass with representations from a powerful vision foundation model, demonstrating superior effectiveness over naive alignment. We also introduce a novel training-free, test-time optimization algorithm for classification, which provides a more intrinsic evaluation of the NF's embedded semantic knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the training of NFs by over 3.3$\\times$, while simultaneously delivering significant improvements in both generative quality and classification accuracy.

Moreover, most detectors operate as opaque classifiers, offering little insight into why an image is flagged as synthetic, undermining trust and hindering adoption in high-stakes settings.\n  We introduce INSIGHT (Interpretable Neural Semantic and Image-based Generative-forensic Hallucination Tracing), a unified multimodal framework for robust detection and transparent explanation of AI-generated images, even at extremely low resolutions (16x16 - 64x64). INSIGHT combines hierarchical super-resolution for amplifying subtle forensic cues without inducing misleading artifacts, Grad-CAM driven multi-scale localization to reveal spatial regions indicative of generative patterns, and CLIP-guided semantic alignment to map visual anomalies to human-interpretable descriptors. A vision-language model is then prompted using a structured ReAct + Chain-of-Thought protocol to produce consistent, fine-grained explanations, verified through a dual-stage G-Eval + LLM-as-a-judge pipeline to minimize hallucinations and ensure factuality.\n  Across diverse domains, including animals, vehicles, and abstract synthetic scenes, INSIGHT substantially improves both detection robustness and explanation quality under extreme degradation, outperforming prior detectors and black-box VLM baselines.

However, in remote sensing (RS) tasks, we observe widespread pseudo reasoning: models narrate the process of reasoning rather than genuinely reason toward the correct answer based on visual evidence. We attribute this to the Glance Effect, where a single, coarse perception of large-scale RS imagery results in incomplete understanding and reasoning based on linguistic self-consistency instead of visual evidence. To address this, we propose RS-EoT (Remote Sensing Evidence-of-Thought), a language-driven, iterative visual evidence-seeking paradigm. To instill this paradigm, we propose SocraticAgent, a self-play multi-agent system that synthesizes reasoning traces via alternating cycles of reasoning and visual inspection. To enhance and generalize these patterns, we propose a two-stage progressive RL strategy: first, RL on fine-grained Grounding tasks to enhance RS-EoT capabilities, followed by RL on RS VQA to generalize to broader understanding scenarios. Experiments show RS-EoT achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple RS VQA and grounding benchmarks. Analyses reveal clear iterative cycles of reasoning and evidence seeking, confirming RS-EoT mitigates the Glance Effect and enables genuine evidence-grounded reasoning.

It plays a crucial role in 3D content creation. However, existing approaches often struggle to produce strong or geometrically stable edits, largely due to inconsistent latent anchors introduced by timestep-dependent noise during diffusion sampling. To address these limitations, we introduce AnchorFlow, which is built upon the principle of latent anchor consistency. Specifically, AnchorFlow establishes a global latent anchor shared between the source and target trajectories, and enforces coherence using a relaxed anchor-alignment loss together with an anchor-aligned update rule. This design ensures that transformations remain stable and semantically faithful throughout the editing process. By stabilizing the latent reference space, AnchorFlow enables more pronounced semantic modifications. Moreover, AnchorFlow is mask-free. Without mask supervision, it effectively preserves geometric fidelity. Experiments on the Eval3DEdit benchmark show that AnchorFlow consistently delivers semantically aligned and structurally robust edits across diverse editing types.

However, existing VLAs often suffer from limited numerical reasoning ability and overly simplified input-output mappings, which hinder their performance in complex driving scenarios requiring step-by-step causal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose CoT4AD, a novel VLA framework that introduces Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for autonomous driving to enhance both numerical and causal reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). CoT4AD integrates visual observations and language instructions to perform semantic reasoning, scene understanding, and trajectory planning. During training, it explicitly models a perception-question-prediction-action CoT to align the reasoning space with the action space across multiple driving tasks.

Developing reliable solutions requires large-scale, accurately annotated, and multimodal data. However, real-world UAV data collection faces inherent constraints due to airspace regulations, privacy concerns, and environmental variability, while manual annotation of 3D poses and cross-modal correspondences is time-consuming and costly. To overcome these challenges, we introduce UAV-MM3D, a high-fidelity multimodal synthetic dataset for low-altitude UAV perception and motion understanding. It comprises 400K synchronized frames across diverse scenes (urban areas, suburbs, forests, coastal regions) and weather conditions (clear, cloudy, rainy, foggy), featuring multiple UAV models (micro, small, medium-sized) and five modalities - RGB, IR, LiDAR, Radar, and DVS (Dynamic Vision Sensor). Each frame provides 2D/3D bounding boxes, 6-DoF poses, and instance-level annotations, enabling core tasks related to UAVs such as 3D detection, pose estimation, target tracking, and short-term trajectory forecasting. We further propose LGFusionNet, a LiDAR-guided multimodal fusion baseline, and a dedicated UAV trajectory prediction baseline to facilitate benchmarking.

While CoT data, especially long or visual CoT such as \"think with image\", has been widely used to supervise intermediate reasoning, it remains unclear why specific CoT designs help and which ones truly support generalizable reasoning. To systematically evaluate this, we focus on a controlled maze-solving benchmark where reasoning rules are fully visual, difficulty can be tuned by grid size, and all the intermediate steps can be automatically generated. Using Qwen2.5-VL-7B under a standard SFT-then-RL pipeline, we compare three representative CoT formats: Language CoT, Grounding CoT (with spatial coordinate trajectories), and Visual CoT (with image manipulations). Our experiments reveal that visual and longer CoT mainly accelerate convergence but do not lift the final performance ceiling; concise CoT containing only essential grounding steps outperforms longer traces; and, strikingly, CoT retaining only the minimal grounding results generalizes best across different maze sizes. We further validate these insights on other vision-centric tasks.

Despite the progress in 3D-aware generation, existing 3D head stylization methods often rely on computationally expensive optimization or domain-specific fine-tuning to adapt to new styles. To address these limitations, we propose DiffStyle360, a diffusion-based framework capable of producing multi-view consistent, identity-preserving 3D head stylizations across diverse artistic domains given a single style reference image, without requiring per-style training. Building upon the 3D-aware DiffPortrait360 architecture, our approach introduces two key components: the Style Appearance Module, which disentangles style from content, and the Style Fusion Attention mechanism, which adaptively balances structure preservation and stylization fidelity in the latent space. Furthermore, we employ a 3D GAN-generated multi-view dataset for robust fine-tuning and introduce a temperaturebased key scaling strategy to control stylization intensity during inference.

However, due to the lack of region-level supervision, CLIP exhibits limited fine-grained semantic understanding. Although several methods attempt to mitigate this issue, they unintentionally disrupt the global alignment, resulting in a persistent trade-off where improving local perception simultaneously degrades global coherence. In this paper, we propose HarmoCLIP, a novel framework designed to harmonize global and region representations within CLIP. We first identify that the absence of direct alignment between local textual and visual semantics is the fundamental cause of the trade-off. To address this, HarmoCLIP introduces an explicit fine-grained semantic supervision term that directly aligns textual segments with their corresponding visual regions, effectively bridging the image region space and the textual space. To further strengthen the representation capability at the local level, our method introduces a novel Region-Language Alignment supervision strategy that promotes fine-grained semantic learning without compromising global semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HarmoCLIP achieves state-of-the-art (improvement up to 69.78%) performance on the global task of retrieval and yields a substantial 3.2% improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the region task of bounding-box classification, consistently outperforming prior approaches while providing a balanced, efficient, and plug-and-play solution to the global-local trade-off in CLIP.

Unlike conventional methods -- which rely on manual correspondence matching and deformation trajectory estimation (limiting generalization and requiring costly preprocessing) -- WUKONG leverages the generative prior of flow-based transformers to produce high-fidelity 3D transitions with rich texture details. To ensure smooth shape transitions, we exploit the inherent continuity of flow-based generative processes and formulate morphing as an optimal transport barycenter problem. We further introduce a sequential initialization strategy to prevent abrupt geometric distortions and preserve identity coherence. For faithful texture preservation, we propose a similarity-guided semantic consistency mechanism that selectively retains high-frequency details and enables precise control over blending dynamics.

The family of feed-forward reconstruction model regresses pointmap of all input images to a reference frame coordinate system, along with other auxiliary outputs, in a single forward pass. However, we find that current models struggle with fine geometry and robustness due to (\\textit{i}) the scarcity of high-fidelity depth and pose supervision and (\\textit{ii}) the inherent geometric misalignment from multi-view pointmap regression. Fin3R jointly tackles two issues with an extra lightweight fine-tuning step. We freeze the decoder, which handles view matching, and fine-tune only the image encoder-the component dedicated to feature extraction. The encoder is enriched with fine geometric details distilled from a strong monocular teacher model on large, unlabeled datasets, using a custom, lightweight LoRA adapter. We validate our method on a wide range of models, including DUSt3R, MASt3R, CUT3R, and VGGT. The fine-tuned models consistently deliver sharper boundaries, recover complex structures, and achieve higher geometric accuracy in both single- and multi-view settings, while adding only the tiny LoRA weights, which leave test-time memory and latency virtually unchanged.

However, even state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle with domain-specific or knowledge-intensive queries, where relevant information is underrepresented in pre-training data. Knowledge-based VQA (KB-VQA) addresses this by retrieving external documents to condition answer generation, but current retrieval-augmented approaches suffer from low precision, noisy passages, and limited reasoning. To address this, we propose ReAG, a novel Reasoning-Augmented Multimodal RAG approach that combines coarse- and fine-grained retrieval with a critic model that filters irrelevant passages, ensuring high-quality additional context. The model follows a multi-stage training strategy leveraging reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning over retrieved content, while supervised fine-tuning serves only as a cold start.

However, the LLM is typically queried in isolation from the recognition model and receives no performance feedback. As a result, it often fails to deliver the targeted discriminative cues critical to distinguish similar actions. To overcome these limitations, we propose SkeletonAgent, a novel framework that bridges the recognition model and the LLM through two cooperative agents, i.e., Questioner and Selector. Specifically, the Questioner identifies the most frequently confused classes and supplies them to the LLM as context for more targeted guidance. Conversely, the Selector parses the LLM's response to extract precise joint-level constraints and feeds them back to the recognizer, enabling finer-grained cross-modal alignment. Comprehensive evaluations on five benchmarks, including NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, FineGYM, and UAV-Human, demonstrate that SkeletonAgent consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark methods.

Vision-language models (VLMs), such as PLIP-a pathology-tuned CLIP-trained on image-text pairs across diverse domains, serve as strong knowledge distillation sources. However, their zero-shot performance with predefined prompts remains limited due to sensitivity to prompt variations. Moreover, unlike natural images, histopathology centers lack semantic descriptors (e.g., 'sketch'), making it difficult to define domain-specific prompts for clinical centers. This requires a data-driven approach for learning domain-specific and ultimately class-generic continuous prompts. We propose Domain Invariant Prompt Tuning (DIPT) for knowledge distillation process, a novel step that learns multiple input tokens for each domain. These tokens are trained separately for each domain and are averaged across domains, leading to domain-invariant prompts. Our student model then distills knowledge from PLIP's text encoder by leveraging the prompts learned by DIPT. This leads to alignment of visual features with domain-invariant embeddings, enhancing generalization by training on multiple domains. Our method adds a significant improvement in average F1-score to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) knowledge distillation approaches in domain generalization with histopathology datasets.

Vision-language models need to be both category-adaptive and sharply discriminative, yet data scarcity often blurs the boundary between normal and abnormal states. This ambiguity leads to missed subtle defects and the rejection of atypical normal samples. We propose ABounD, an Adversarial Boundary-Driven few-shot learning for multi-class anomaly detection, which is a unified learning framework that integrates semantic concept learning with decision boundary shaping. The Dynamic Concept Fusion (DCF) module produces class-adaptive prompts by fusing generalizable priors with class-specific cues, conditioned on image features. Meanwhile, Adversarial Boundary Forging (ABF) sculpts a more precise decision margin by generating boundary-level fence features via PGD-style perturbations.

Materials and Methods: A pretrained three channel DDPM, sourced from Hugging Face, was fine tuned on a private dataset of 11020 screening mammograms to generate paired craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views. Three third channel encodings of the CC and MLO views were evaluated: sum, absolute difference, and zero channel. Each model produced 500 synthetic image pairs. Quantitative assessment involved breast mask segmentation using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), with distributional comparisons against 2500 real pairs using Earth Movers Distance (EMD) and Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) tests. Qualitative evaluation included a visual Turing test by a non expert radiologist to assess cross view consistency and artifacts. Results: Synthetic mammograms showed IoU and DSC distributions comparable to real images, with EMD and KS values (0.020 and 0.077 respectively). Models using sum or absolute difference encodings outperformed others in IoU and DSC (p < 0.001), though distributions remained broadly similar.

Towards this, we propose a novel network FauxNet, which is based on pre-trained Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) features. By extracting temporal VSR features from videos, we identify and segregate real videos from manipulated ones. The holy grail in this context has to do with zero-shot detection, i.e., generalizable detection, which we focus on in this work. FauxNet consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art in this setting. In addition, FauxNet is able to attribute - distinguish between generation techniques from which the videos stem. Finally, we propose new datasets, referred to as Authentica-Vox and Authentica-HDTF, comprising about 38,000 real and fake videos in total, the latter created with six recent deepfake generation techniques.

However, scaling to large arrays requires reliable, automated tuning strategies for devices' bootstrapping, calibration, and operation, with many tuning aspects depending on accurately identifying QD device states from charge-stability diagrams (CSDs). In this work, we present a comprehensive benchmarking study of four modern machine learning (ML) architectures for multi-class state recognition in double-QD CSDs. We evaluate their performance across different data budgets and normalization schemes using both synthetic and experimental data. We find that the more resource-intensive models -- U-Nets and visual transformers (ViTs) -- achieve the highest MSE score (defined as $1-\\mathrm{MSE}$) on synthetic data (over $0.98$) but fail to generalize to experimental data. MDNs are the most computationally efficient and exhibit highly stable training, but with substantially lower peak performance. CNNs offer the most favorable trade-off on experimental CSDs, achieving strong accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer parameters than the U-Nets and ViTs. Normalization plays a nontrivial role: min-max scaling generally yields higher MSE scores but less stable convergence, whereas z-score normalization produces more predictable training dynamics but at reduced accuracy for most models. Overall, our study shows that CNNs with min-max normalization are a practical approach for QD CSDs.", "AI": {"tldr": "CNN\u7ed3\u5408min-max\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9CSDs\u72b6\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\uff08QDs\uff09\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u5904\u7406\u5668\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9635\u5217\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u8c10\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522bCSDs\u4e2d\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u72b6\u6001\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u73b0\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff08U-Nets\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u6362\u5668ViTs\u3001MDNs\u548cCNNs\uff09\u5728\u53cc\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9CSDs\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u7c7b\u72b6\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "U-Nets\u548cViTs\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff08MSE\u5f97\u5206>0.98\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u5931\u8d25\uff1bMDNs\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u8f83\u4f4e\uff1bCNNs\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u6743\u8861\uff08\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u5c11\uff09\u3002\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u4e2d\uff0cmin-max\u7f29\u653e\u5f97\u5206\u66f4\u9ad8\u4f46\u6536\u655b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0cz-score\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f46\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "CNN\u7ed3\u5408min-max\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u662f\u5904\u7406\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u7535\u8377\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u56fe\uff08CSDs\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u3002"}}

To this end, we introduce ITS3D, a framework that formulates the task as an optimization problem to identify the most effective Gaussian noise input. The framework is driven by a verifier-guided search algorithm, where the search algorithm iteratively refines noise candidates based on verifier feedback. To address the inherent challenges of 3D generation, we introduce three techniques for improved stability, efficiency, and exploration capability. 1) Gaussian normalization is applied to stabilize the search process. It corrects distribution shifts when noise candidates deviate from a standard Gaussian distribution during iterative updates. 2) The high-dimensional nature of the 3D search space increases computational complexity. To mitigate this, a singular value decomposition-based compression technique is employed to reduce dimensionality while preserving effective search directions. 3) To further prevent convergence to suboptimal local minima, a singular space reset mechanism dynamically updates the search space based on diversity measures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ITS3D enhances text-to-3D generation quality, which shows the potential of computationally efficient search methods in generative processes.

Capturing and reconstructing fire and its dynamics is highly challenging due to its volatile nature, transparent quality, and multitude of high-frequency features. Despite these challenges, we aim to reconstruct fire from only three views, which consequently requires solving for under-constrained geometry. We solve this by separating the static background from the dynamic fire region by combining dense multi-view stereo images with monocular depth priors. The fire is initialized as a 3D flow field, obtained by fusing per-view dense optical flow projections. To capture the high frequency features of fire, each 3D Gaussian encodes a lifetime and linear velocity to match the dense optical flow. To ensure sub-frame temporal alignment across cameras we employ a custom hardware synchronization pattern -- allowing us to reconstruct fire with affordable commodity hardware.

However, existing benchmarks primarily target perception tasks such as detection or segmentation, overlooking the reasoning capabilities required to infer road topology and dynamic scene structure. To address this gap, we present RoadSceneBench, a lightweight yet information-rich benchmark designed to evaluate and advance visual reasoning in complex road environments. Unlike large-scale perception datasets, RoadSceneBench emphasizes relational understanding and structural consistency, encouraging models to capture the underlying logic of real-world road scenes. Furthermore, to enhance reasoning reliability, we propose Hierarchical Relational Reward Propagation with Temporal Consistency (HRRP-T), a training framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in which reward signals adaptively promote spatial coherence and semantic alignment throughout the reasoning process. This paradigm enables models to move beyond static recognition toward geometry-aware and temporally consistent reasoning.

This raises a research question: How can the model be optimized to achieve greater fine-grained features? To address this, we propose a Local-Global Hybrid Perspective (LHP) module integrated with a Vision-Language Model (VLM), designed to explore the effectiveness of incorporating both fine-grained features alongside coarse-grained features. Additionally, we investigate a Unified Image-Text (UIT) model that combines multiple objective loss functions, including Image-Text Contrastive (ITC), Image-Text Matching (ITM), Masked Language Modeling (MLM), and Masked Image Modeling (MIM) loss. Beyond this, we propose a novel iterative ensemble strategy, by combining iteratively instead of using model results simultaneously like other ensemble methods. To take advantage of the superior performance of the LHP model, we introduce a novel feature selection algorithm based on its guidance, which helps improve the model's performance.

Existing detection methods often memorize artifacts of specific generative models rather than learning transferable cues, leading to substantial failures on unseen generators. Surprisingly, this work finds that frozen visual foundation models, especially DINOv3, already exhibit strong cross-generator detection capability without any fine-tuning. Through systematic studies on frequency, spatial, and token perspectives, we observe that DINOv3 tends to rely on global, low-frequency structures as weak but transferable authenticity cues instead of high-frequency, generator-specific artifacts. Motivated by this insight, we introduce a simple, training-free token-ranking strategy followed by a lightweight linear probe to select a small subset of authenticity-relevant tokens. This token subset consistently improves detection accuracy across all evaluated datasets.

Yet, prevailing frameworks treat visual actions as optional tools, boosting metrics but leaving reasoning ungrounded and crops ineffective. This gap gives rise to the illusion of thinking with images: models seem visually grounded but rely on context-agnostic actions that neither refine perception nor guide reasoning toward correct answers. We address this problem by reframing visual actions as core reasoning primitives rather than optional tools, which we term visual rationalization, the visual analogue of textual Chain-of-Thought. Building on this insight, we propose Visual Rationale Learning (ViRL), an end-to-end paradigm that grounds training in the visual rationale itself. ViRL integrates (1) Process Supervision with ground-truth rationales, (2) Objective Alignment via step-level reward shaping, and (3) Fine-Grained Credit Assignment to distinguish correct, redundant, and erroneous actions. By ensuring each action contributes meaningfully to the reasoning chain, ViRL enables models to \"get the right answer for the right visual reason\". Trained purely with end-to-end RL, ViRL achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks spanning perception, hallucination, and reasoning.

In particular, by removing specific text from document images, reconstructing original images is extremely important for industrial applications. However, most existing methods of text removal focus on deleting simple scene text which appears in images captured by a camera in an outdoor environment. There is little research dedicated to complex and practical images with dense text. Therefore, we created benchmark data for text removal from images including a large amount of text. From the data, we found that text-removal performance becomes vulnerable against mask profile perturbation. Thus, for practical text-removal tasks, precise tuning of the mask shape is essential. This study developed a method to model highly flexible mask profiles and learn their parameters using Bayesian optimization. The resulting profiles were found to be character-wise masks.

Pediatric hand radiographs often contain non-anatomical markers, and it is unclear whether inpainting these regions preserves features needed for bone age and gender prediction. To evaluate the clinical reliability of generative model-based inpainting for artifact removal, we used the RSNA Bone Age Challenge dataset, selecting 200 original radiographs and generating 600 inpainted versions with gpt-image-1 using natural language prompts to target non-anatomical artifacts. Downstream performance was assessed with deep learning ensembles for bone age estimation and gender classification, using mean absolute error (MAE) and area under the ROC curve (AUC) as metrics, and pixel intensity distributions to detect structural alterations. Inpainting markedly degraded model performance: bone age MAE increased from 6.26 to 30.11 months, and gender classification AUC decreased from 0.955 to 0.704. Inpainted images displayed pixel-intensity shifts and inconsistencies, indicating structural modifications not corrected by simple calibration. These findings show that, although visually realistic, foundation model-based inpainting can obscure subtle but clinically relevant features and introduce latent bias even when edits are confined to non-diagnostic regions, underscoring the need for rigorous, task-specific validation before integrating such generative tools into clinical AI workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u590d\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u771f\u5b9e\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u533b\u5b66AI\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u590d\u5728\u53bb\u9664\u4f2a\u5f71\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u513f\u79d1\u624b\u90e8\u653e\u5c04\u7167\u7247\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u89e3\u5256\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u4fee\u590d\u662f\u5426\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u9aa8\u9f84\u548c\u6027\u522b\u9884\u6d4b\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528RSNA Bone Age Challenge\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9009\u62e9200\u5f20\u539f\u59cb\u653e\u5c04\u7167\u7247\uff0c\u751f\u6210600\u5f20\u4fee\u590d\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u9488\u5bf9\u975e\u89e3\u5256\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u96c6\u6210\u8bc4\u4f30\u9aa8\u9f84\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u6027\u522b\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\uff08MAE\uff09\u548cROC\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0b\u9762\u79ef\uff08AUC\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u50cf\u7d20\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u4fee\u590d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff1a\u9aa8\u9f84MAE\u4ece6.26\u4e2a\u6708\u589e\u52a0\u523030.11\u4e2a\u6708\uff0c\u6027\u522b\u5206\u7c7bAUC\u4ece0.955\u964d\u81f30.704\u3002\u4fee\u590d\u56fe\u50cf\u663e\u793a\u50cf\u7d20\u5f3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7ed3\u6784\u4fee\u6539\u672a\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u6821\u51c6\u7ea0\u6b63\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u590d\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u771f\u5b9e\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u63a9\u76d6\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6f5c\u5728\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u5c06\u6b64\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u5177\u6574\u5408\u5230\u4e34\u5e8aAI\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e4b\u524d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e25\u683c\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

To address these gaps, we introduce the Bharat Scene Text Dataset (BSTD) - a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark for studying Indian Language Scene Text Recognition. It comprises more than 100K words that span 11 Indian languages and English, sourced from over 6,500 scene images captured across various linguistic regions of India. The dataset is meticulously annotated and supports multiple scene text tasks, including: (i) Scene Text Detection, (ii) Script Identification, (iii) Cropped Word Recognition, and (iv) End-to-End Scene Text Recognition. We evaluated state-of-the-art models originally developed for English by adapting (fine-tuning) them for Indian languages.

Existing 3D-aware methods either depend on auxiliary 3D information or enhance RGB-only VLMs with geometry encoders through shallow feature fusion. We propose SpaceMind, a multimodal large language model explicitly designed for spatial reasoning solely from RGB inputs. The model adopts a dual-encoder architecture, integrating VGGT as a spatial understanding encoder and InternViT as a 2D visual encoder. The key idea is to treat the camera representation as an active guiding modality rather than passive metadata. Specifically, SpaceMind introduces a lightweight Camera-Guided Modality Fusion module before the language model to replace shallow fusion. It applies camera-conditioned biasing to spatial tokens, assigns query-independent weights reflecting their geometric importance, and uses the camera embedding to gate the fused representation. Empirically, SpaceMind establishes new state-of-the-art results on VSI-Bench, SQA3D and SPBench, surpassing both open and proprietary systems on VSI-Bench and SPBench by large margins and achieving state-of-the-art performance on SQA3D. These results demonstrate that camera-guided modality fusion is an effective and practical inductive bias for equipping VLMs with genuinely spatially grounded intelligence.

While recent caching-based methods effectively reuse redundant computations to speed up 2D and video generation, directly applying these techniques to 3D diffusion models can severely disrupt geometric consistency. In 3D synthesis, even minor numerical errors in cached latent features accumulate, causing structural artifacts and topological inconsistencies. To overcome this limitation, we propose Fast3Dcache, a training-free geometry-aware caching framework that accelerates 3D diffusion inference while preserving geometric fidelity. Our method introduces a Predictive Caching Scheduler Constraint (PCSC) to dynamically determine cache quotas according to voxel stabilization patterns and a Spatiotemporal Stability Criterion (SSC) to select stable features for reuse based on velocity magnitude and acceleration criterion.

We reveal fundamental commonalities between these objectives: preserving accurate semantic information is paramount, as it directly dictates the integrity of critical information for intelligent tasks and aids human understanding. Concurrently, enhanced perceptual quality not only improves visual appeal but also, by ensuring realistic image distributions, benefits semantic feature extraction for machine tasks. Based on this insight, we propose Diff-ICMH, a generative image compression framework aiming for harmonizing machine and human vision in image compression. It ensures perceptual realism by leveraging generative priors and simultaneously guarantees semantic fidelity through the incorporation of Semantic Consistency loss (SC loss) during training. Additionally, we introduce the Tag Guidance Module (TGM) that leverages highly semantic image-level tags to stimulate the pre-trained diffusion model's generative capabilities, requiring minimal additional bit rates. Consequently, Diff-ICMH supports multiple intelligent tasks through a single codec and bitstream without any task-specific adaptation, while preserving high-quality visual experience for human perception. Extensive experimental results demonstrate Diff-ICMH's superiority and generalizability across diverse tasks, while maintaining visual appeal for human perception.

However, state-of-the-art approaches primarily rely on post-hoc rationalizations or visual discrimination, lacking a verifiable chain of evidence.

Long-term use of inappropriate dental implant abutments may result in implant complications, including peri-implantitis. Using artificial intelligence to assist dental implant abutment design can quickly improve the efficiency of abutment design and enhance abutment adaptability. In this paper, we propose a text condition embedded abutment design framework (TCEAD), the novel automated abutment design solution available in literature. The proposed study extends the self-supervised learning framework of the mesh mask autoencoder (MeshMAE) by introducing a text-guided localization (TGL) module to facilitate abutment area localization. As the parameter determination of the abutment is heavily dependent on local fine-grained features (the width and height of the implant and the distance to the opposing tooth), we pre-train the encoder using oral scan data to improve the model's feature extraction ability. Moreover, considering that the abutment area is only a small part of the oral scan data, we designed a TGL module, which introduces the description of the abutment area through the text encoder of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), enabling the network to quickly locate the abutment area. We validated the performance of TCEAD on a large abutment design dataset.

Accurate aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation is essential for assessing carbon storage and wildfire fuel loads, yet traditional methods rely on labor-intensive field measurements or remote sensing approaches with significant limitations in dense vegetation. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based method for estimating AGB from a single ground-based RGB image. We frame this as a dense prediction task, introducing AGB density maps, where each pixel represents tree biomass normalized by the plot area and each tree's image area. We leverage the recently introduced synthetic 3D SPREAD dataset, which provides realistic forest scenes with per-image tree attributes (height, trunk and canopy diameter) and instance segmentation masks. Using these assets, we compute AGB via allometric equations and train a model to predict AGB density maps, integrating them to recover the AGB estimate for the captured scene. Our approach achieves a median AGB estimation error of 1.22 kg/m^2 on held-out SPREAD data and 1.94 kg/m^2 on a real-image dataset.

To solve this, recent solutions attempt to predict finer anomalies using features from ZSAD, but they still struggle to recover fine-grained anomalies without missed detections, mainly due to the gap between randomly synthesized training anomalies and real ones. We observe that anomaly score maps exactly provide complementary spatial cues that are largely absent from ZSAD's image features, a fact overlooked before.\n  Inspired by this, we propose an anomaly-aware refiner (AnoRefiner) that can be plugged into most ZSAD models and improve patch-level anomaly maps to the pixel level. First, we design an anomaly refinement decoder (ARD) that progressively enhances image features using anomaly score maps, reducing the reliance on synthetic anomaly data. Second, motivated by the mass production paradigm, we propose a progressive group-wise test-time training (PGT) strategy that trains ARD in each product group for the refinement process in the next group, while staying compatible with any ZSAD method.\n  Experiments on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets show that AnoRefiner boosts various ZSAD models by up to a 5.2\\% gain in pixel-AP metrics, which can also be directly observed in many visualizations.

Acquiring high-quality and high-resolution MR images can be time-consuming, posing a significant challenge when multiple sequences providing complementary contrast information are needed or when the patient is unable to remain in the scanner for an extended period of time. Reducing k-space measurements is a strategy to speed up acquisition, but often leads to reduced quality in reconstructed images. Additionally, in real-world MRI, both under-sampled and full-sampled images are prone to artefacts, and correcting these artefacts is crucial for maintaining diagnostic accuracy. Deep learning methods have been proposed to restore image quality from under-sampled data, while others focused on the correction of artefacts that result from the noise or motion. No approach has however been proposed so far that addresses both acceleration and artefacts correction, limiting the performance of these models when these degradation factors occur simultaneously. To address this gap, we present a method for recovering high-quality images from under-sampled data with simultaneously correction for noise and motion artefact called USArt (Under-Sampling and Artifact correction model). Customized for 2D brain anatomical images acquired with Cartesian sampling, USArt employs a dual sub-model approach.

These capabilities have promising applications in various industrial domains, such as autonomous driving. For example, LVLMs can generate safety-oriented descriptions of videos captured by road-facing cameras. However, ensuring comprehensive safety requires monitoring driver-facing views as well to detect risky events, such as the use of mobiles while driving. Thus, the ability to process synchronized inputs is necessary from both driver-facing and road-facing cameras. In this study, we develop models and investigate the capabilities of LVLMs by constructing a dataset and evaluating their performance on this dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that while pre-trained LVLMs have limited effectiveness, fine-tuned LVLMs can generate accurate and safety-aware driving instructions.

Rectified Flow enables one-step sampling by learning nearly straight probability paths, but achieving such straightness requires multiple computationally intensive reflow iterations. MeanFlow achieves one-step generation by directly modeling the average velocity over time; however, when trained on highly curved flows, it suffers from slow convergence and noisy supervision. To address these limitations, we propose Rectified MeanFlow, a framework that models the mean velocity field along the rectified trajectory using only a single reflow step. This eliminates the need for perfectly straightened trajectories while enabling efficient training. Furthermore, we introduce a simple yet effective truncation heuristic that aims to reduce residual curvature and further improve performance. Extensive experiments on ImageNet at 64, 256, and 512 resolutions show that Re-MeanFlow consistently outperforms prior one-step flow distillation and Rectified Flow methods in both sample quality and training efficiency.

This challenge severely limits the deployment of AI in medical imaging, where models must continually adapt to data from new hospitals without compromising established diagnostic knowledge. To address this, we introduce a latent drift-guided replay method that identifies and replays samples with high representational instability. Specifically, our method quantifies this instability via latent drift, the change in a sample internal feature representation after naive domain adaptation. To ensure diversity and clinical relevance, we aggregate drift at the patient level, our memory buffer stores the per patient slices exhibiting the greatest multi-layer representation shift. Evaluated on a cross-hospital COVID-19 CT classification task using state-of-the-art CNN and Vision Transformer backbones, our method substantially reduces forgetting compared to naive fine-tuning and random replay.

A common architectural design couples a multimodal large language model (MLLM) encoder with a diffusion decoder, as seen in systems such as Step1X-Edit and Qwen-Image-Edit, where the MLLM encodes both the reference image and the instruction but remains frozen during training. In this work, we demonstrate that unlocking the reasoning capabilities of MLLM can further push the boundaries of editing models. Specifically, we explore two reasoning mechanisms, thinking and reflection, which enhance instruction understanding and editing accuracy. Based on that, our proposed framework enables image editing in a thinking-editing-reflection loop: the thinking mechanism leverages the world knowledge of MLLM to interpret abstract instructions, while the reflection reviews editing results, automatically corrects unintended manipulations, and identifies the stopping round. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our reasoning approach achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of ImgEdit (+4.3%), GEdit (+4.7%), and Kris (+8.2%) when initializing our DiT from the Step1X-Edit (ReasonEdit-S), and also outperforms previous open-source methods on both GEdit and Kris when integrated with Qwen-Image-Edit (ReasonEdit-Q).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u9501MLLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u601d\u8003+\u53cd\u601d\u673a\u5236\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u51bb\u7ed3MLLM\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u53d1\u6325\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u9501MLLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u601d\u8003\u548c\u53cd\u601d\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u601d\u8003-\u7f16\u8f91-\u53cd\u601d\u5faa\u73af\u3002\u601d\u8003\u673a\u5236\u5229\u7528MLLM\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u89e3\u91ca\u62bd\u8c61\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u53cd\u601d\u673a\u5236\u5219\u81ea\u52a8\u4fee\u6b63\u7f16\u8f91\u7ed3\u679c\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u505c\u6b62\u65f6\u673a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08ImgEdit\u3001GEdit\u3001Kris\uff09\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u9501\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u62bd\u8c61\u6307\u4ee4\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

The main challenge of this task lies in the difficulty in establishing an optimal training paradigm due to inherent conflicting targets in understanding and generation tasks. To alleviate these conflicts and pursue higher performance, many researchers adopt varying degrees of model decoupling (e.g., Double image encoders, MOE/MOT architecture, or frozen MLLM). However, excessive model decoupling can lead to the loss of interleave generation ability, undermining the original intent of unified models. In this work, we aim to explore how to mitigate task conflicts without resorting to model decoupling. Firstly, we analyze why decoupling alleviates conflicts by studying the cross-modal attention behavior of models. We observe that model decoupling essentially drives models toward task-specific multimodal interaction patterns, as seen in Qwen-VL and HunyuanImage, and that the more thorough the decoupling, the more consistent the behavior becomes. Motivated by this observation, we propose Attention Interaction Alignment (AIA) loss, which explicitly learns Task-Specific multimodal interaction patterns during training. To demonstrate the generalizability of our AIA loss, we apply it to Emu3 and Janus-Pro during SFT and post-training stage respectively. Without bells and whistles, AIA not only refines cross-modal attention patterns, but also boosts both generation and understanding performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAIA\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u89e3\u8026\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7f13\u89e3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7f13\u89e3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ea4\u9519\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u8026\u7f13\u89e3\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAIA\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Emu3\u548cJanus-Pro\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "result": "AIA\u635f\u5931\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd8\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u7684AIA\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing multi-modal prompt learning methods typically rely on fixed, shared prompts and deterministic parameters, which limits their ability to capture instance-level variation or model uncertainty across diverse tasks and domains. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Variational Multi-Modal Prompt Learning (VaMP) framework that enables sample-specific, uncertainty-aware prompt tuning in multi-modal representation learning. VaMP generates instance-conditioned prompts by sampling from a learned posterior distribution, allowing the model to personalize its behavior based on input content. To further enhance the integration of local and global semantics, we introduce a class-aware prior derived from the instance representation and class prototype. Building upon these, we formulate prompt tuning as variational inference over latent prompt representations and train the entire framework end-to-end through reparameterized sampling. Experiments on few-shot and domain generalization benchmarks show that VaMP achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the benefits of modeling both uncertainty and task structure in our method.

Among these, Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) and its variants stand out for their impressive performance, which is widely attributed to their core mechanism of matching the student's output distribution to that of a pre-trained teacher model. In this work, we challenge this conventional understanding. Through a rigorous decomposition of the DMD training objective, we reveal that in complex tasks like text-to-image generation, where CFG is typically required for desirable few-step performance, the primary driver of few-step distillation is not distribution matching, but a previously overlooked component we identify as CFG Augmentation (CA). We demonstrate that this term acts as the core ``engine'' of distillation, while the Distribution Matching (DM) term functions as a ``regularizer'' that ensures training stability and mitigates artifacts. We further validate this decoupling by demonstrating that while the DM term is a highly effective regularizer, it is not unique; simpler non-parametric constraints or GAN-based objectives can serve the same stabilizing function, albeit with different trade-offs. This decoupling of labor motivates a more principled analysis of the properties of both terms, leading to a more systematic and in-depth understanding. This new understanding further enables us to propose principled modifications to the distillation process, such as decoupling the noise schedules for the engine and the regularizer, leading to further performance gains.

To further enhance these capabilities, we introduce a lightweight alignment scheme that refines their internal 3D representation by tuning only a small subset of backbone bias terms, leaving all decoder heads frozen. This targeted adaptation substantially improves relative pose estimation under extreme viewpoints without degrading per-image depth or point quality.

Leading open-source alternatives, including Qwen-Image, Hunyuan-Image-3.0 and FLUX.2, are characterized by massive parameter counts (20B to 80B), making them impractical for inference, and fine-tuning on consumer-grade hardware. To address this gap, we propose Z-Image, an efficient 6B-parameter foundation generative model built upon a Scalable Single-Stream Diffusion Transformer (S3-DiT) architecture that challenges the \"scale-at-all-costs\" paradigm. By systematically optimizing the entire model lifecycle -- from a curated data infrastructure to a streamlined training curriculum -- we complete the full training workflow in just 314K H800 GPU hours (approx. $630K). Our few-step distillation scheme with reward post-training further yields Z-Image-Turbo, offering both sub-second inference latency on an enterprise-grade H800 GPU and compatibility with consumer-grade hardware (<16GB VRAM). Additionally, our omni-pre-training paradigm also enables efficient training of Z-Image-Edit, an editing model with impressive instruction-following capabilities.

Project page: https://yaourtb.github.io/Splat-SAP", "summary": "We present Splat-SAP, a feed-forward approach to render novel views of human-centered scenes from binocular cameras with large sparsity. Gaussian Splatting has shown its promising potential in rendering tasks, but it typically necessitates per-scene optimization with dense input views. Although some recent approaches achieve feed-forward Gaussian Splatting rendering through geometry priors obtained by multi-view stereo, such approaches still require largely overlapped input views to establish the geometry prior. To bridge this gap, we leverage pixel-wise point map reconstruction to represent geometry which is robust to large sparsity for its independent view modeling. In general, we propose a two-stage learning strategy. In stage 1, we transform the point map into real space via an iterative affinity learning process, which facilitates camera control in the following. In stage 2, we project point maps of two input views onto the target view plane and refine such geometry via stereo matching. Furthermore, we anchor Gaussian primitives on this refined plane in order to render high-quality images. As a metric representation, the scale-aware point map in stage 1 is trained in a self-supervised manner without 3D supervision and stage 2 is supervised with photo-metric loss. We collect multi-view human-centered data and demonstrate that our method improves both the stability of point map reconstruction and the visual quality of free-viewpoint rendering.", "AI": {"tldr": "Splat-SAP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u53cc\u76ee\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6e32\u67d3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u70b9\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u81ea\u7531\u89c6\u70b9\u6e32\u67d3\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6e32\u67d3\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5bc6\u96c6\u8f93\u5165\u89c6\u56fe\u548c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u91cd\u53e0\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u53cc\u76ee\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u9636\u6bb51\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u70b9\u56fe\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u9636\u6bb52\u901a\u8fc7\u7acb\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u7ec6\u5316\u51e0\u4f55\u5e76\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u89c6\u56fe\u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\u951a\u5b9a\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\u4ee5\u6e32\u67d3\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4eba\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u70b9\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u89c6\u70b9\u6e32\u67d3\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "Splat-SAP\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u65e03D\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u70b9\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7acb\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u5316\uff09\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u53cc\u76ee\u89c6\u56fe\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u81ea\u7531\u89c6\u70b9\u6e32\u67d3\u3002"}}

The combination of remote sensing, aerial imagery and deep learning offer promising opportunities to renew or improve existing survey methods. The complementary use of visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery can add information compared to a single-source image and improve results in an automated detection context. However, the alignment and fusion process can be challenging, especially since visible and thermal images usually have different fields of view (FOV) and spatial resolutions. This research presents a case study on the great blue heron (Ardea herodias) to evaluate the performances of synchronous aerial VIS and TIR imagery to automatically detect individuals and nests using a YOLO11n model. Two VIS-TIR fusion methods were tested and compared: an early fusion approach and a late fusion approach, to determine if the addition of the TIR image gives any added value compared to a VIS-only model. VIS and TIR images were automatically aligned using a deep learning model. A principal component analysis fusion method was applied to VIS-TIR image pairs to form the early fusion dataset. A classification and regression tree was used to process the late fusion dataset, based on the detection from the VIS-only and TIR-only trained models. Across all classes, both late and early fusion improved the F1 score compared to the VIS-only model. For the main class, occupied nest, the late fusion improved the F1 score from 90.2 (VIS-only) to 93.0%. This model was also able to identify false positives from both sources with 90% recall. Although fusion methods seem to give better results, this approach comes with a limiting TIR FOV and alignment constraints that eliminate data. Using an aircraft-mounted very high-resolution visible sensor could be an interesting option for operationalizing surveys.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7VIS-TIR\u56fe\u50cf\u878d\u5408\uff08\u65e9\u671f/\u665a\u671f\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u84dd\u9e6d\u53ca\u5176\u5de2\u7a74\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u665a\u671f\u878d\u5408\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46TIR\u7684\u89c6\u91ce\u9650\u5236\u4ecd\u662f\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u76d1\u6d4b\u5bf9\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4fdd\u62a4\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u9065\u611f\u3001\u822a\u7a7a\u5f71\u50cf\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662fVIS\u4e0eTIR\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528YOLO11n\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u540c\u6b65\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\uff08VIS\uff09\u548c\u70ed\u7ea2\u5916\uff08TIR\uff09\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u65e9\u671f\u878d\u5408\uff08\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\uff09\u548c\u665a\u671f\u878d\u5408\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u56de\u5f52\u6811\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u65e9\u671f\u548c\u665a\u671f\u878d\u5408\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u4e86F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u665a\u671f\u878d\u5408\u5bf9\u4e3b\u8981\u7c7b\u522b\uff08occupied nest\uff09\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u4ece90.2%\u63d0\u5347\u81f393.0%\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u4ee590%\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u8bc6\u522b\u8bef\u68c0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u65e9\u671f\u548c\u665a\u671f\uff09\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u70ed\u7ea2\u5916\uff08TIR\uff09\u7684\u89c6\u91ce\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u4e22\u5931\u3002\u672a\u6765\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u8f7d\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

As AD is irreversible, early prediction is critical for timely intervention and management. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a transitional stage between cognitively normal (CN) aging and AD, plays a significant role in early AD diagnosis. However, predicting MCI progression remains a significant challenge, as not all individuals with MCI convert to AD. MCI subjects are categorized into stable MCI (sMCI) and progressive MCI (pMCI) based on conversion status. In this study, we propose a generalized, end-to-end deep learning model for AD prediction using MCI cases from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our hybrid architecture integrates Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers to capture both local spatial features and global contextual dependencies from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. To incorporate temporal progression, we further employ Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks to process features extracted from four consecutive MRI timepoints along with some other non-image biomarkers, predicting each subject's cognitive status at month 48.

Evaluating 10 LVLMs, we find consistent failures to preserve individual cultural identities in mixed settings. Models show strong background reliance, with accuracy dropping 14% when cultural backgrounds are added to food-only baselines, and they produce inconsistent predictions for identical foods across different contexts. To address these limitations, we explore three robustness strategies.

To systematically address this challenge, we introduce CogIP-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on such image cognitive properties.

We then demonstrate that a post-training phase can effectively bridge this gap, significantly enhancing the model's alignment with human judgments. Furthermore, we show that this learned cognitive alignment is not merely predictive but also transferable to downstream creative tasks. By integrating our cognitively-aligned MLLM into an image generation pipeline, we can guide the synthesis process to produce images that better embody desired traits, such as being more memorable or visually appealing.

Remote sensing-based land-cover classification offers a scalable route to such maps but is hindered by scarce and imbalanced annotations and by geometric distortions in high-resolution scenes. We propose LC4-DViT (Land-cover Creation for Land-cover Classification with Deformable Vision Transformer), a framework that combines generative data creation with a deformation-aware Vision Transformer. A text-guided diffusion pipeline uses GPT-4o-generated scene descriptions and super-resolved exemplars to synthesize class-balanced, high-fidelity training images, while DViT couples a DCNv4 deformable convolutional backbone with a Vision Transformer encoder to jointly capture fine-scale geometry and global context. On eight classes from the Aerial Image Dataset (AID)-Beach, Bridge, Desert, Forest, Mountain, Pond, Port, and River-DViT achieves 0.9572 overall accuracy, 0.9576 macro F1-score, and 0.9510 Cohen' s Kappa, improving over a vanilla ViT baseline (0.9274 OA, 0.9300 macro F1, 0.9169 Kappa) and outperforming ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and FlashInternImage. Cross-dataset experiments on a three-class SIRI-WHU subset (Harbor, Pond, River) yield 0.9333 overall accuracy, 0.9316 macro F1, and 0.8989 Kappa, indicating good transferability. An LLM-based judge using GPT-4o to score Grad-CAM heatmaps further shows that DViT' s attention aligns best with hydrologically meaningful structures.

However, existing systems struggle under aggressive 6-DoF trajectories and complex outdoor layouts: they lose long-range geometric coherence, deviate from the target path, or collapse into overly conservative motion. To this end, we introduce Captain Safari, a pose-conditioned world engine that generates videos by retrieving from a persistent world memory. Given a camera path, our method maintains a dynamic local memory and uses a retriever to fetch pose-aligned world tokens, which then condition video generation along the trajectory. This design enables the model to maintain stable 3D structure while accurately executing challenging camera maneuvers. To evaluate this setting, we curate OpenSafari, a new in-the-wild FPV dataset containing high-dynamic drone videos with verified camera trajectories, constructed through a multi-stage geometric and kinematic validation pipeline. Across video quality, 3D consistency, and trajectory following, Captain Safari substantially outperforms state-of-the-art camera-controlled generators. It reduces MEt3R from 0.3703 to 0.3690, improves AUC@30 from 0.181 to 0.200, and yields substantially lower FVD than all camera-controlled baselines.

RETINA contains queries referencing secondary subjects (i.e. related entities) and pairs them with images of these related entities, removing the visual shortcut. When evaluated on RETINA existing models show significantly degraded performance, confirming their reliance on the shortcut. Furthermore, we propose Multi-Image MultImodal Retriever (MIMIR), which enriches document embeddings by augmenting images of multiple related entities, effectively handling RETINA, unlike prior work that uses only a single image per document.

While retrieval augmented generation mitigates this issue by filtering for question relevant content, the retrieved results still contain substantial redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose SLEUTH, a multi agent framework. Concretely, SLEUTH orchestrates a retriever and four collaborative agents in a coarse to fine process. The framework identifies key textual and visual clues within the retrieved pages, filters for salient visual evidence such as tables and charts, and analyzes the query to devise a reasoning strategy. It ultimately synthesizes a distilled, evidence dense multimodal context to generate the final prediction. SLEUTH is model agnostic and scalable.

While natural illumination-based methods struggle to resolve this ambiguity, co-located light-camera setups offer better disentanglement as lighting can be easily calibrated via Structure-from-Motion. However, such setups introduce additional complexities like strong inter-reflections, dynamic shadows, near-field lighting, and moving specular highlights, which existing approaches fail to handle. We present GLOW, a Global Illumination-aware Inverse Rendering framework designed to address these challenges. GLOW integrates a neural implicit surface representation with a neural radiance cache to approximate global illumination, jointly optimizing geometry and reflectance through carefully designed regularization and initialization. We then introduce a dynamic radiance cache that adapts to sharp lighting discontinuities from near-field motion, and a surface-angle-weighted radiometric loss to suppress specular artifacts common in flashlight captures.

Existing methods face two key challenges: 1) the semantic prior gap due to the lack of descriptive text annotations in gesture datasets, and 2) the difficulty in achieving coordinated multimodal control over gesture generation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces CoordSpeaker, a comprehensive framework that enables coordinated caption-empowered co-speech gesture synthesis. Our approach first bridges the semantic prior gap through a novel gesture captioning framework, leveraging a motion-language model to generate descriptive captions at multiple granularities. Building upon this, we propose a conditional latent diffusion model with unified cross-dataset motion representation and a hierarchically controlled denoiser to achieve highly controlled, coordinated gesture generation. CoordSpeaker pioneers the first exploration of gesture understanding and captioning to tackle the semantic gap in gesture generation while offering a novel perspective of bidirectional gesture-text mapping.

Demographic factors like age and gender significantly influence pedestrian vulnerability, yet real-time monitoring systems rarely capture this information. To address this gap, this study proposes a deep learning framework that classifies pedestrian age group and gender from far-view intersection footage using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), without relying on facial recognition or high-resolution imagery. The classification is structured as a unified six-class problem, distinguishing adult, teenager, and child pedestrians for both males and females, based on full-body visual cues. Video data was collected from three high-risk intersections in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Two CNN architectures were implemented: ResNet50, a deep convolutional neural network pretrained on ImageNet, and a custom lightweight CNN optimized for computational efficiency. Eight model variants explored combinations of pooling strategies and optimizers. ResNet50 with Max Pooling and SGD achieved the highest accuracy (86.19%), while the custom CNN performed comparably (84.15%) with fewer parameters and faster training. The model's efficient design enables real-time inference on standard surveillance feeds. For practitioners, this system provides a scalable, cost-effective tool to monitor pedestrian demographics at intersections using existing camera infrastructure. Its outputs can shape intersection design, optimize signal timing, and enable targeted safety interventions for vulnerable groups such as children or the elderly. By offering demographic insights often missing in conventional traffic data, the framework supports more inclusive, data-driven planning in mixed-traffic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eCNN\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u89c6\u9891\u5b9e\u65f6\u5206\u7c7b\u884c\u4eba\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u6027\u522b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe86.19%\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u4e2d\u6536\u5165\u56fd\u5bb6\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ea4\u901a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u884c\u4eba\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u63a7\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CNNs\uff09\u4ece\u8fdc\u89c6\u89d2\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5206\u7c7b\u884c\u4eba\u5e74\u9f84\u7ec4\u548c\u6027\u522b\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u9762\u90e8\u8bc6\u522b\u6216\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u91c7\u7528ResNet50\u548c\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7CNN\u4e24\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6c60\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "result": "ResNet50\u7ed3\u5408Max Pooling\u548cSGD\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0886.19%\uff09\uff0c\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49CNN\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\uff0884.15%\uff09\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u7c7b\u884c\u4eba\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u6027\u522b\uff0c\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Multimodal MOT that integrates visible light and thermal infrared information is particularly essential for robust autonomous driving systems. However, effectively fusing these heterogeneous modalities is challenging. Simple strategies like concatenation or addition often fail to bridge the significant non-linear distribution gap between their feature representations, which can lead to modality conflicts and degrade tracking accuracy. Drawing inspiration from the connection between multimodal MOT and the iterative refinement in diffusion models, this paper proposes DM$^3$T, a novel framework that reformulates multimodal fusion as an iterative feature alignment process to generate accurate and temporally coherent object trajectories. Our approach performs iterative cross-modal harmonization through a proposed Cross-Modal Diffusion Fusion (C-MDF) module. In this process, features from both modalities provide mutual guidance, iteratively projecting them onto a shared, consistent feature manifold. This enables the learning of complementary information and achieves deeper fusion compared to conventional methods. Additionally, we introduce a plug-and-play Diffusion Refiner (DR) to enhance and refine the unified feature representation. To further improve tracking robustness, we design a Hierarchical Tracker that adaptively handles confidence estimation. DM$^3$T unifies object detection, state estimation, and data association into a comprehensive online tracking framework without complex post-processing. Extensive experiments on the VT-MOT benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves 41.7 HOTA, representing a 1.54% relative improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods.

However, current MPL methods are fundamentally limited by their optimization of a single, static point representation. This paradigm is inherently brittle, leads to overfitting on base classes, and generalizes poorly to novel or ambiguous categories. We challenge this point paradigm, proposing that robust generalization requires learning a semantic cloud (i.e., a distribution over the embedding space). To achieve this, we introduce Points-to-Clouds (P2C), a novel framework inspired by diffusion models that reframes prompt learning as a dynamic denoising task. At the core of P2C is a dual denoising mechanism: a Dynamic Prompt Denoising (DPD) mechanism perturbs text prompts with sophisticated, annealed noise to learn a smoother semantic landscape, while an auxiliary V-L Mapper denoising loss re-tasks the mapper as a denoising autoencoder. This forces the mapper to reconstruct clean visual prompts from noisy text inputs, ensuring robust cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments across 11 datasets demonstrate that P2C consistently outperforms strong baselines. On the base-to-novel generalization benchmark, our method achieves a Harmonic Mean of 79.7%, representing a relative improvement of 1.4% over the baseline.

We present a case study of three VLMs (Llava-Llama and two Qwen models) in which we ask these models four sets of questions of increasing complexity about artworks (general content, emotional content, expression of emotions, and emotion symbols) and carry out a qualitative expert evaluation. We find that the VLMs recognize the content of the images surprisingly well and often also which emotions they depict and how they are expressed.

In this paper, we propose DenoiseGS, the first framework to leverage the efficiency of 3D Gaussian Splatting for burst denoising. Our approach addresses two key challenges when applying feedforward Gaussian reconsturction model to noisy inputs: the degradation of Gaussian point clouds and the loss of fine details. To this end, we propose a Gaussian self-consistency (GSC) loss, which regularizes the geometry predicted from noisy inputs with high-quality Gaussian point clouds. These point clouds are generated from clean inputs by the same model that we are training, thereby alleviating potential bias or domain gaps. Additionally, we introduce a log-weighted frequency (LWF) loss to strengthen supervision within the spectral domain, effectively preserving fine-grained details.

However, existing methods are limited to spatially aligned reference-pose pairs with matched skeletal structures. Handling reference-pose misalignment remains unsolved. To address this, we present One-to-All Animation, a unified framework for high-fidelity character animation and image pose transfer for references with arbitrary layouts. First, to handle spatially misaligned reference, we reformulate training as a self-supervised outpainting task that transforms diverse-layout reference into a unified occluded-input format. Second, to process partially visible reference, we design a reference extractor for comprehensive identity feature extraction. Further, we integrate hybrid reference fusion attention to handle varying resolutions and dynamic sequence lengths. Finally, from the perspective of generation quality, we introduce identity-robust pose control that decouples appearance from skeletal structure to mitigate pose overfitting, and a token replace strategy for coherent long-video generation.

By leveraging inherent misalignment rather than enforcing strict alignment, FLEX-Seg learns robust representations while capturing rich stylistic variations.

SolarCHIP addresses three key challenges in solar imaging: multimodal sensing across AIA and HMI instruments, weak inter-class separability due to slow temporal evolution, and strong intra-class variability with sparse activity signals. Our pretraining framework employs a multi-granularity contrastive objective that jointly aligns (1) global class tokens across co-temporal AIA-HMI pairs to enhance temporal discrimination, (2) local patch tokens at fixed spatial indices to enforce position-consistent, modality-invariant features, and (3) intra-sample patches across different spatial locations to preserve fine-grained spatial structure. We train both CNN- and Vision Transformer-based autoencoders and demonstrate their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: cross-modal translation between HMI and AIA passbands via ControlNet, and full-disk flare classification. Experimental results show that SolarCHIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tasks, with particularly strong gains in low-resource settings where labeled data is limited. Ablation studies confirm that each contrastive component contributes essential discriminative capacity at different granularities.

Existing VLM-based approaches typically align 3D scene features with the VLM's embedding space. However, this implicit alignment often yields suboptimal performance due to the scarcity of 3D data and the inherent complexity of spatial relationships in 3D environments. To address these limitations, we propose a novel hierarchical multimodal representation for 3D scene reasoning that explicitly aligns with VLMs at the input space by leveraging both multi-view images and text descriptions.

To achieve illumination invariance, we propose a novel semantic SLAM framework with two designs. First, the Intrinsic Appearance Normalization (IAN) module proactively disentangles the scene's intrinsic properties, such as albedo, from transient lighting. By learning a standardized, illumination-invariant appearance model, it assigns a stable and consistent color representation to each Gaussian primitive. Second, the Dynamic Radiance Balancing Loss (DRB-Loss) reactively handles frames with extreme exposure. It activates only when an image's exposure is poor, operating directly on the radiance field to guide targeted optimization. This prevents error accumulation from extreme lighting without compromising performance under normal conditions.

The emerging semi-autoregressive (block diffusion) paradigm integrates the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive models, enabling arbitrary-length video generation and improving inference efficiency through KV caching and parallel sampling. However, it yet faces two enduring challenges: (i) KV-cache-induced long-horizon error accumulation, and (ii) the lack of fine-grained long-video benchmarks and coherence-aware metrics. To overcome these limitations, we propose BlockVid, a novel block diffusion framework equipped with semantic-aware sparse KV cache, an effective training strategy called Block Forcing, and dedicated chunk-wise noise scheduling and shuffling to reduce error propagation and enhance temporal consistency. We further introduce LV-Bench, a fine-grained benchmark for minute-long videos, complete with new metrics evaluating long-range coherence. Extensive experiments on VBench and LV-Bench demonstrate that BlockVid consistently outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, coherent minute-long videos. In particular, it achieves a 22.2% improvement on VDE Subject and a 19.4% improvement on VDE Clarity in LV-Bench over the state of the art approaches. Project website: https://ziplab.co/BlockVid.

Moreover, they usually directly align T2V models with the overall preference distribution, ignoring potential conflict dimensions like motion dynamics and visual quality, which may bias models towards low-motion content. To address these issues, we present Motion-corrective alignment with Self-critic hierarchical Reasoning (McSc), a three-stage reinforcement learning framework for robust preference modeling and alignment.

Finally, using RM-preferred videos, we propose Motion-corrective Direct Preference Optimization (McDPO) to optimize T2V models, while dynamically re-weighting alignment objective to mitigate bias towards low-motion content.

The proposed filter is fundamentally a low-amplitude pass filter primarily aimed at minimizing noise in feature signal inputs and is named Convolutional Feature Filter (CFF). We conducted experiments on two established 2D segmentation networks and two public cardiac MR image datasets to validate the effectiveness of the CFF, and the experimental findings demonstrated a decrease in noise within the feature signal matrices. To enable a numerical observation and analysis of this reduction, we developed a binarization equation to calculate the information entropy of feature signals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCFF\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5377\u79ef\u7279\u5f81\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u71b5\u91cf\u5316\u566a\u58f0\u51cf\u5c11\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5206\u5272\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u5377\u79ef\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\uff0c\u566a\u58f0\u51cf\u5c11\u5e38\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u8774\u8776\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6574\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u540e\u7eed\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5377\u79ef\u7279\u5f81\u89c6\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4fe1\u53f7\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4f4e\u5e45\u5ea6\u901a\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff08CFF\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCFF\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u4fe1\u53f7\u77e9\u9635\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u503c\u5316\u65b9\u7a0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u7279\u5f81\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u71b5\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u89c2\u5bdf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u7279\u5f81\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff08CFF\uff09\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u4fe1\u53f7\u77e9\u9635\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

In addition, their task definitions are still vague, typically limited to axes such as \"what to edit\" or \"how many references are given\", and therefore fail to capture the intrinsic difficulty of multi-reference settings. To address this gap, we introduce $\\textbf{MultiBanana}$, which is carefully designed to assesses the edge of model capabilities by widely covering multi-reference-specific problems at scale: (1) varying the number of references, (2) domain mismatch among references (e.g., photo vs. anime), (3) scale mismatch between reference and target scenes, (4) references containing rare concepts (e.g., a red banana), and (5) multilingual textual references for rendering. Our analysis among a variety of text-to-image models reveals their superior performances, typical failure modes, and areas for improvement.

Recent studies have explored guidance mechanisms for unconditional generation, yet these approaches remain fundamentally tied to assumptions specific to diffusion models. In this work, we propose a spectrum-weakening framework for visual autoregressive (AR) models. This method works without the need for re-training, specific conditions, or any architectural modifications. It achieves this by constructing a controllable weak model in the spectral domain. We theoretically show that invertible spectral transformations preserve information, while selectively retaining only a subset of spectrum introduces controlled information reduction. Based on this insight, we perform spectrum selection along the channel dimension of internal representations, which avoids the structural constraints imposed by diffusion models. We further introduce two spectrum renormalization strategies that ensures numerical stability during the weakening process. Extensive experiments were conducted on both discrete and continuous AR models, with text or class conditioning. The results demonstrate that our method enables high-quality unconditional generation while maintaining strong prompt alignment for conditional generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5149\u8c31\u524a\u5f31\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u63a7\u5f31\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5f3a\u6761\u4ef6\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65e0\u6307\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u65e0\u6307\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5149\u8c31\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u5f31\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u4fdd\u7559\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u901a\u9053\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u5149\u8c31\u91cd\u65b0\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u524a\u5f31\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u524a\u5f31\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u6216\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u8c31\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u5f31\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5f3a\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

However, two critical challenges persist: (1) instruction hallucination, text-only chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning cannot fully prevent factual errors due to inherent information bottlenecks; (2) reward hacking, dynamic policy optimization against static reward models allows agents to exploit flaws in reward functions. To address these issues, we propose JarvisEvo, a unified image editing agent that emulates an expert human designer by iteratively editing, selecting appropriate tools, evaluating results, and reflecting on its own decisions to refine outcomes. JarvisEvo offers three key advantages: (1) an interleaved multimodal chain-of-thought (iMCoT) reasoning mechanism that enhances instruction following and editing quality; (2) a synergistic editor-evaluator policy optimization (SEPO) framework that enables self-improvement without external rewards, effectively mitigating reward hacking; and (3) support for both global and local fine-grained editing through seamless integration of Adobe Lightroom. On ArtEdit-Bench, JarvisEvo outperforms Nano-Banana by an average of 18.95% on preservative editing metrics, including a substantial 44.96% improvement in pixel-level content fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "JarvisEvo\u901a\u8fc7iMCoT\u548cSEPO\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6307\u4ee4\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7f16\u8f91\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86JarvisEvo\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u91c7\u7528iMCoT\u673a\u5236\u548cSEPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "result": "\u5728ArtEdit-Bench\u4e0a\uff0cJarvisEvo\u5728\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eNano-Banana 18.95%\uff0c\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5185\u5bb9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534744.96%\u3002", "conclusion": "JarvisEvo\u901a\u8fc7iMCoT\u548cSEPO\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6307\u4ee4\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

However, recent dynamic Gaussian Splatting methods significantly degrade when only sparse input views are available, limiting their applicability in practice. The issue arises from the incoherent learning of 4D geometry as input views decrease. This paper presents GC-4DGS, a novel framework that infuses geometric consistency into 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), offering real-time and high-quality dynamic scene rendering from sparse input views. While learning-based Multi-View Stereo (MVS) and monocular depth estimators (MDEs) provide geometry priors, directly integrating these with 4DGS yields suboptimal results due to the ill-posed nature of sparse-input 4D geometric optimization. To address these problems, we introduce a dynamic consistency checking strategy to reduce estimation uncertainties of MVS across spacetime. Furthermore, we propose a global-local depth regularization approach to distill spatiotemporal-consistent geometric information from monocular depths, thereby enhancing the coherent geometry and appearance learning within the 4D volume. Extensive experiments on the popular N3DV and Technicolor datasets validate the effectiveness of GC-4DGS in rendering quality without sacrificing efficiency. Notably, our method outperforms RF-DeRF, the latest dynamic radiance field tailored for sparse-input dynamic view synthesis, and the original 4DGS by 2.62dB and 1.58dB in PSNR, respectively, with seamless deployability on resource-constrained IoT edge devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "GC-4DGS\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u8f93\u5165\u89c6\u56fe\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a00\u758f\u8f93\u5165\u89c6\u56fe\u4e0b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u8fde\u8d2f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5168\u5c40-\u5c40\u90e8\u6df1\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u53164D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728N3DV\u548cTechnicolor\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cGC-4DGS\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u4f18\u4e8eRF-DeRF\u548c\u539f\u59cb4DGS\uff0cPSNR\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e862.62dB\u548c1.58dB\u3002", "conclusion": "GC-4DGS\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5168\u5c40-\u5c40\u90e8\u6df1\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u8f93\u5165\u89c6\u56fe\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

While existing methods perform well on visible regions, they inherently lack mechanisms to handle occluded interiors, resulting in incomplete textures and visible seams. To address this, we introduce an occlusion-aware texturing framework based on the concept of hit levels, which quantify the relative depth of mesh faces via multi-view ray casting. This allows us to partition mesh faces into ordered visibility layers, from outermost to innermost. We then apply a two-stage visibility control strategy that progressively reveals interior regions with structural coherence, followed by texturing each layer using a pretrained diffusion model. To seamlessly merge textures obtained across layers, we propose a soft UV-space blending technique that weighs each texture's contribution based on view-dependent visibility confidence. Empirical results demonstrate that GOATex consistently outperforms existing methods, producing seamless, high-fidelity textures across both visible and occluded surfaces. Unlike prior works, GOATex operates entirely without costly fine-tuning of a pretrained diffusion model and allows separate prompting for exterior and interior mesh regions, enabling fine-grained control over layered appearances.

Existing approaches either synthesize missing modalities at high computational cost or apply prompt-based fine-tuning that relies only on adjacent-layer features and overlooks long-distance contextual information, which may offer additional tolerance to errors when one or more modalities are missing. To address this, we introduce REplay Prompting (REP): (1) construct modality-wise feature buffers via a residual bypass to cache early-layer representations and replay them in deeper layers, mitigating information loss as network depth increases; (2) employ a private-shared feature decoupling strategy, where private buffers preserve modality-specific signals and shared buffers encode cross-modal semantics; and (3) design a task-aware dynamic initialization mechanism to configure these buffers differently, improving stability and generalization under diverse missing-modality conditions. Experiments on vision-language, vision-language-audio, and temporal multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that REP consistently outperforms prior methods under both single- and multi-modality missing scenarios, while introducing only negligible parameter overhead. These results establish REP as a lightweight and effective paradigm for robust multimodal learning in challenging missing-modality environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "REP\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "REP\u901a\u8fc7\uff081\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\uff0c\uff082\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u79c1\u6709-\u5171\u4eab\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u8026\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\uff083\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u673a\u5236\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cREP\u5728\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "REP\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

Atopic dermatitis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease, is diagnosed via subjective evaluations without using objective diagnostic methods, thereby increasing the risk of misdiagnosis. It is also similar to psoriasis in appearance, further complicating its accurate diagnosis. Existing studies on skin diseases have used high-quality dermoscopic image datasets, but such high-quality images cannot be obtained in actual clinical settings. Moreover, existing systems must ensure accuracy and fast response times. To this end, an ensemble learning-based skin lesion detection system (ENSEL) was proposed herein. ENSEL enhanced diagnostic accuracy by integrating various deep learning models via an ensemble approach. Its performance was verified by conducting skin lesion detection experiments using images of skin lesions taken by actual users. Its accuracy and response time were measured using randomly sampled skin disease images. Results revealed that ENSEL achieved high recall in most images and less than 1s s processing speed.

The imbalance stems from the inherent variation in sparsity across attention heads and the irregular distribution of dense blocks within the sparse mask, when sequence parallelism is applied along the head dimension (as in Ulysses) or the block dimension (as in Ring Attention). In this paper, we formalize a sparse imbalance ratio to quantify the imbalance, and propose db-SP, a sparsity-aware sequence parallelism technique that tackles the challenge. db-SP contains a dual-level partitioning approach that achieves near-perfect workload balance at both the head and block levels with negligible overhead. Furthermore, to handle the evolving sparsity patterns across denoising steps and layers, db-SP dynamically determines the parallel degrees for the head and block dimensions at runtime. Experimental results demonstrate that db-SP delivers an end-to-end speedup of 1.25x and an attention-specific speedup of 1.40x over state-of-the-art sequence parallel methods on average.

Although recent advances have leveraged the knowledge encoded in pre-trained visual models, their effectiveness is constrained by the \"affective gap\" , limits the applicability of pre-training knowledge for IEC tasks. It has been demonstrated in psychology that language exhibits high variability, encompasses diverse and abundant information, and can effectively eliminate the \"affective gap\". Inspired by this, we propose a novel Affective Captioning for Image Emotion Classification (ACIEC) to classify image emotion based on pure texts, which effectively capture the affective information in the image. In our method, a hierarchical multi-level contrastive loss is designed for detecting emotional concepts from images, while an emotional attribute chain-of-thought reasoning is proposed to generate affective sentences. Then, a pre-trained language model is leveraged to synthesize emotional concepts and affective sentences to conduct IEC. Additionally, a contrastive loss based on semantic similarity sampling is designed to solve the problem of large intra-class differences and small inter-class differences in affective datasets. Moreover, we also take the images with embedded texts into consideration, which were ignored by previous studies.

DNA-Prior integrates (i) an implicit architectural prior, enforced through a deep network parameterisation, with (ii) an explicit spectral-spatial prior composed of a frequency-domain fidelity term and a spatial regularisation functional.

Recent works have advanced this field by representing camera poses as ray-based conditions, yet they often lack sufficient scene understanding and geometric awareness. DualCamCtrl specifically targets this limitation by introducing a dual-branch framework that mutually generates camera-consistent RGB and depth sequences. To harmonize these two modalities, we further propose the Semantic Guided Mutual Alignment (SIGMA) mechanism, which performs RGB-depth fusion in a semantics-guided and mutually reinforced manner. These designs collectively enable DualCamCtrl to better disentangle appearance and geometry modeling, generating videos that more faithfully adhere to the specified camera trajectories. Additionally, we analyze and reveal the distinct influence of depth and camera poses across denoising stages and further demonstrate that early and late stages play complementary roles in forming global structure and refining local details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DualCamCtrl achieves more consistent camera-controlled video generation, with over 40\\% reduction in camera motion errors compared with prior methods.

However, most existing text-to-video models rely solely on textual conditions, lacking general fine-grained controllability over video generation. To address this challenge, we propose InstanceV, a video generation framework that enables i) instance-level control and ii) global semantic consistency. Specifically, with the aid of proposed Instance-aware Masked Cross-Attention mechanism, InstanceV maximizes the utilization of additional instance-level grounding information to generate correctly attributed instances at designated spatial locations. To improve overall consistency, We introduce the Shared Timestep-Adaptive Prompt Enhancement module, which connects local instances with global semantics in a parameter-efficient manner.

Driven by the insight that complex transformations can be decomposed and resolved progressively, we introduce a novel multi-stage framework that progressively reverses distinct distortion types in a coarse-to-fine manner.

To address limitations in existing evaluation protocols, we also propose two enhanced metrics: layout-aligned OCR metrics (AED/ACER) for a stable assessment that decouples geometric rectification quality from the layout analysis errors of OCR engines, and masked AD/AAD (AD-M/AAD-M) tailored for accurately evaluating geometric distortions in documents with incomplete boundaries. Extensive experiments show that our method establishes new state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks, yielding a substantial reduction of 14.1\\%--34.7\\% in the AAD metric and demonstrating superior efficacy in real-world applications.

However, existing VTG models assume that a relevant segment always exists, causing them to always predict a target segment even when the query is irrelevant to the video. While recent approaches attempt to handle irrelevant queries, they can only reject those that are entirely unrelated to the video and still fail to handle hard-irrelevant queries that are semantically similar but not actually relevant. To address this, we propose Refusal-Aware Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RA-RFT) to effectively refuse hard-irrelevant queries in VTG. Our method is based on the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework and integrates four reward objectives-format, refuse-IoU, explain, and query correction-to improve both relevance discrimination and fine-grained semantic reasoning. In addition, to effectively support RA-RFT, we construct a Hard-Irrelevant VTG (HI-VTG) dataset, which includes hard-irrelevant queries and their refusal answers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across various relevance-aware VTG scenarios, including hard-irrelevant VTG, simply-shuffled RA-VTG, and human-annotated RA-VTG settings.

Due to the lack of multi-view consistency priors, existing methods typically resort to employing 2D generation or editing models to process each view individually, followed by iterative 2D-3D-2D updating. However, these methods are not only time-consuming but also prone to over-smoothed results because the different editing signals gathered from different views are averaged during the iterative process. In this paper, we propose generative Video Prior based 3D Editing (ViP3DE) to employ the temporal consistency priors from pre-trained video generation models for multi-view consistent 3D editing in a single forward pass. Our key insight is to condition the video generation model on a single edited view to generate other consistent edited views for 3D updating directly, thereby bypassing the iterative editing paradigm. Since 3D updating requires edited views to be paired with specific camera poses, we propose motion-preserved noise blending for the video model to generate edited views at predefined camera poses. In addition, we introduce geometry-aware denoising to further enhance multi-view consistency by integrating 3D geometric priors into video models.

In this paper, we renovate the pipeline of image-to-3D scene generation by unlocking the potential of geometry models and present our GeoWorld. Instead of exploiting geometric information obtained from a single-frame input, we propose to first generate consecutive video frames and then take advantage of the geometry model to provide full-frame geometry features, which contain richer information than single-frame depth maps or camera embeddings used in previous methods, and use these geometry features as geometrical conditions to aid the video generation model. To enhance the consistency of geometric structures, we further propose a geometry alignment loss to provide the model with real-world geometric constraints and a geometry adaptation module to ensure the effective utilization of geometry features. Extensive experiments show that our GeoWorld can generate high-fidelity 3D scenes from a single image and a given camera trajectory, outperforming prior methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

However, the majority of existing works only consider question-answering and reasoning tasks over tabular data, leaving tabular data generation largely unnoticed. In this work, for the first time, we explore the efficacy of instruction tuning in improving LLMs tabular data generation capabilities. More specifically, given the high data and computation requirements of tabular instruction tuning, we aim to address the possibility of instruction tuning for tabular data generation with limited data and computational resources. To achieve this, we first create a high-quality instruction dataset for tabular data, enabling efficient LLM comprehension. We then instruction-tune an open-source LLM (Llama3.1-8B-Instruct) on the training set of this dataset to improve its tabular data generation performance.

We argue that, compared to solely pursuing a perfect scene representation, it is more critical to enhance the robustness of the rasterization process against parameter errors to ensure stable camera pose tracking. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that leverages a smooth kernel strategy to enhance the robustness of 3DGS-based SLAM. Unlike conventional methods that focus solely on minimizing rendering error, our core insight is to make the rasterization process more resilient to imperfections in the 3DGS parameters. We hypothesize that by allowing each Gaussian to influence a smoother, wider distribution of pixels during rendering, we can mitigate the detrimental effects of parameter noise from outlier Gaussians. This approach intentionally introduces a controlled blur to the rendered image, which acts as a regularization term, stabilizing the subsequent pose optimization. While a complete redesign of the rasterization pipeline is an ideal solution, we propose a practical and effective alternative that is readily integrated into existing 3DGS frameworks. Our method, termed Corrective Blurry KNN (CB-KNN), adaptively modifies the RGB values and locations of the K-nearest neighboring Gaussians within a local region. This dynamic adjustment generates a smoother local rendering, reducing the impact of erroneous GS parameters on the overall image. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach, while maintaining the overall quality of the scene reconstruction (mapping), significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of camera pose tracking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCB-KNN\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u6838\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3a3DGS-SLAM\u7684\u5149\u6805\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u76f8\u673a\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u6311\u6218\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u5ff5\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5149\u6805\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6bd4\u8ffd\u6c42\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\u66f4\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5e73\u6ed1\u6838\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5c40\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u5185K\u8fd1\u90bb\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u7684RGB\u503c\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u9519\u8befGS\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u6574\u4f53\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5CB-KNN\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u5149\u6805\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863DGS-SLAM\u4e2d\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

It reasons about the action to automatically identify and retrieve the 3D mask of the correct functional element, enabling the inexpensive and large-scale generation of high-quality annotated data. We validate SynthFun3D through user studies, which demonstrate improved scene-prompt coherence compared to other approaches. Our quantitative results further show that the generated data can either replace real data with minor performance loss or supplement real data for improved performance, thereby providing an inexpensive and scalable solution for data-hungry 3D applications.

Existing approaches either rely on costly multilingual training or employ prompting with external translation tools, both of which are resource-intensive and sensitive to translation quality. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free inference-time method to enhance Multilingual Reasoning capabilities via Representation Engineering (MRRE) without using any additional training data or tools. MRRE sequentially injects two precomputed vectors at specific layers during inference processing: cross-lingual reasoning enhancement vectors, which steer non-English reasoning representations toward English space to unlock multilingual reasoning, and target-language output anchoring vectors, which restore the distribution of the target language to preserve input-output language consistency. Comprehensive experiments across six advanced LLMs and LVLMs on four reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MRRE consistently enhances non-English reasoning by an average gain of 5.48% and up to 7.54% in low-resource languages (Thai and Swahili), while improving input-output language consistency by 3.78%.", "AI": {"tldr": "MRRE\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6ce8\u5165\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u6539\u5584\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "method": "MRRE\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f9d\u6b21\u6ce8\u5165\u4e24\u4e2a\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u5411\u91cf\uff1a\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u5411\u91cf\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u8f93\u51fa\u951a\u5b9a\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u8bed\u8a00\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdbLLM\u548cLVLM\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cMRRE\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b5.48%\uff0c\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u53477.54%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u8bed\u8a00\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63d0\u9ad83.78%\u3002", "conclusion": "MRRE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6216\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

While synthetic rendering is a promising solution, bridging the sim-to-real gap often requires expert intervention. In this work, we benchmark a range of domain randomization (DR) and domain adaptation (DA) techniques, including feature-based methods, generative AI (GenAI), and classical rendering approaches, for creating contextualized synthetic data without manual annotation. Our evaluation focuses on the effectiveness and efficiency of low-level and high-level feature alignment, as well as a controlled diffusion-based DA method guided by prompts generated from real-world contexts. We validate our methods on two datasets: a proprietary industrial dataset (automotive and logistics) and a public robotics dataset. Results show that if render-based data with enough variability is available as seed, simpler feature-based methods, such as brightness-based and perceptual hashing filtering, outperform more complex GenAI-based approaches in both accuracy and resource efficiency. Perceptual hashing consistently achieves the highest performance, with mAP50 scores of 98% and 67% on the industrial and robotics datasets, respectively. Additionally, GenAI methods present significant time overhead for data generation at no apparent improvement of sim-to-real mAP values compared to simpler methods.

The behavior of these models in terms of significative image features (such as contrast and dispersion) can be difficult to characterize. To cope with this, we propose to use a variational formulation of color contrast enhancement that is inspired by the basic phenomenology of color perception. In particular, we devise a set of basic requirements to be fulfilled by an energy to be considered as `perceptually inspired', showing that there is an explicit class of functionals satisfying all of them.

Although its full-context dependency, i.e., modeling all previous scales for next-scale prediction, facilitates more stable and comprehensive representation learning by leveraging complete information flow, the resulting computational inefficiency and substantial overhead severely hinder VAR's practicality and scalability. This motivates us to develop a new VAR model with better performance and efficiency without full-context dependency. To address this, we reformulate VAR as a non-full-context Markov process, proposing Markov-VAR. It is achieved via Markovian Scale Prediction: we treat each scale as a Markov state and introduce a sliding window that compresses certain previous scales into a compact history vector to compensate for historical information loss owing to non-full-context dependency. Integrating the history vector with the Markov state yields a representative dynamic state that evolves under a Markov process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Markov-VAR is extremely simple yet highly effective: Compared to VAR on ImageNet, Markov-VAR reduces FID by 10.5% (256 $\\times$ 256) and decreases peak memory consumption by 83.8% (1024 $\\times$ 1024).

Our method employs a hierarchical detection framework combining YOLOv11 for accurate monitor and region of interest (ROI) localisation with PaddleOCR for robust text extraction. To enhance reliability across variable camera angles and lighting conditions, a geometric rectification module standardizes the screen perspective before character recognition. We evaluated the system on a dataset of 6,498 images collected from open-source corpora and real-world intensive care units in Vietnam. The model achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@50-95) of 99.5% for monitor detection and 91.5% for vital sign ROI localisation. The end-to-end extraction accuracy exceeded 98.9% for core physiological parameters, including heart rate, oxygen saturation SpO2, and arterial blood pressure.

Existing benchmarks mainly focus on the binary detection of generated images or the localization of manually edited regions and do not reflect the properties of diffusion-based edits, which often blend smoothly into the original content. We present Diffusion-Based Image Editing Area Localization Dataset (DEAL-300K), a large scale dataset for diffusion-based image manipulation localization (DIML) with more than 300,000 annotated images. We build DEAL-300K by using a multi-modal large language model to generate editing instructions, a mask-free diffusion editor to produce manipulated images, and an active-learning change detection pipeline to obtain pixel-level annotations.

Trained on DEAL-300K, our method reaches a pixel-level F1 score of 82.56% on our test split and 80.97% on the external CoCoGlide benchmark, providing strong baselines and a practical foundation for future DIML research.The dataset can be accessed via https://github.com/ymhzyj/DEAL-300K.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DEAL-300K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eVFM+MFPT\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7f16\u8f91\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u68c0\u6d4b\u6216\u624b\u52a8\u7f16\u8f91\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u6269\u6563\u7f16\u8f91\u5e73\u6ed1\u878d\u5165\u539f\u59cb\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7f16\u8f91\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u65e0\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7be1\u6539\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6d41\u7a0b\u83b7\u53d6\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86DEAL-300K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408VFM\u548cMFPT\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728DEAL-300K\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523082.56%\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u5916\u90e8CoCoGlide\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523080.97%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DEAL-300K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08VFM\uff09\u548c\u591a\u9891\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\uff08MFPT\uff09\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684DIML\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

Previous research predominantly attempts to address this in a dual encoder paradigm, e.g., utilizing the separate encoders for understanding and generation respectively or balancing semantic representations and low-level features with contrastive loss. In this paper, we propose VQRAE, a Vector Quantization version of Representation AutoEncoders, which pioneers the first exploration in unified representation to produce Continuous semantic features for image understanding and Discrete tokens for visual generation within a unified tokenizer. Specifically, we build upon pretrained vision foundation models with a symmetric ViT decoder and adopt a two-stage training strategy: first, it freezes the encoder and learns a high-dimensional semantic VQ codebook with pixel reconstruction objective; then jointly optimizes the encoder with self-distillation constraints. This design enables negligible semantic information for maintaining the ability of multimodal understanding, discrete tokens that are compatible for generation and fine-grained reconstruction. Besides, we identify the intriguing property in quantizing semantic encoders that rely on high-dimensional codebook in contrast to the previous common practice of low-dimensional codebook in image reconstruction. The semantic VQ codebook can achieve a 100% utilization ratio at a dimension of 1536.

However, these models often fail to provide an explicit representation of motion separate from content, limiting their applicability for content creators. To address this gap, we propose DisMo, a novel paradigm for learning abstract motion representations directly from raw video data via an image-space reconstruction objective. Our representation is generic and independent of static information such as appearance, object identity, or pose. This enables open-world motion transfer, allowing motion to be transferred across semantically unrelated entities without requiring object correspondences, even between vastly different categories. Unlike prior methods, which trade off motion fidelity and prompt adherence, are overfitting to source structure or drifting from the described action, our approach disentangles motion semantics from appearance, enabling accurate transfer and faithful conditioning. Furthermore, our motion representation can be combined with any existing video generator via lightweight adapters, allowing us to effortlessly benefit from future advancements in video models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a diverse set of motion transfer tasks. Finally, we show that the learned representations are well-suited for downstream motion understanding tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art video representation models such as V-JEPA in zero-shot action classification on benchmarks including Something-Something v2 and Jester.

Instead of relying on fixed keyboard inputs, our model allows users to control game video contents through natural language prompts, keyboard, or mouse signals, enabling flexible and semantically rich interaction within generated worlds. We formally defined the concept of interactive video data and developed an automated process to transform large-scale, unstructured text-video pairs into causally aligned interactive datasets. Built upon a 14B image-to-video Mixture-of-Experts(MoE) foundation model, our model incorporates a text-driven interaction injection mechanism for fine-grained control over camera motion, character behavior, and environment dynamics. We introduce an interaction-focused benchmark, InterBench, to evaluate interaction performance comprehensively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model generates temporally coherent and causally grounded interactive game videos that faithfully respond to diverse and free-form user instructions such as \"open the door\", \"draw a torch\", or \"trigger an explosion\".", "AI": {"tldr": "Hunyuan-GameCraft-2 \u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u8f93\u5165\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u6d3b\u6e38\u620f\u4e16\u754c\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eMoE\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e92\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u56fa\u5b9a\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u9ad8\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6a21\u62df\u591a\u6837\u6e38\u620f\u4e92\u52a8\u548c\u73a9\u5bb6\u9a71\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e14B\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08MoE\uff09\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6ce8\u5165\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u89d2\u8272\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6e38\u620f\u89c6\u9891\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e14\u56e0\u679c\u57fa\u7840\u624e\u5b9e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5fe0\u5b9e\u54cd\u5e94\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u7528\u6237\u6307\u4ee4\u3002", "conclusion": "Hunyuan-GameCraft-2 \u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u952e\u76d8\u6216\u9f20\u6807\u4fe1\u53f7\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6e38\u620f\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u4e92\u52a8\u6027\u3002"}}

However, it remains underexplored whether these representations, optimized for multimodal understanding tasks, harbor an inherent potential for visual generation. In this paper, we propose VGT, Visual Generation Tuning, a novel paradigm designed to stimulate the underlying capabilities of visual generation within any vision language models. By performing efficient visual generation tuning on well-pretrained VLMs, we significantly mitigate the alignment costs and accelerate the convergence of autoregressive modeling in the continuous space (20x speedup). Specifically, we dismiss the entangled pixel-level VAEs designed for diffusion transformers and formulate VGT-AE through aligning the semantic encoders from pretrained VLMs with the latent representations of pixel decoders. In image reconstruction tasks, we achieve 26.67 PSNR and 0.50 rFID at a 28x compression ratio, outperforming specialized VAEs; in visual generation tasks, we achieve state-of-the-art outcomes among autoregressive models, 0.77 on GenEval and 78.73 on DPG-Bench. Furthermore, our proposed VGT showcases significant scaling promise and is versatile for endowing any VLMs trained for multimodal understanding with the capabilities of visual generation, which paves the new avenue to explore next-generation unified multimodal foundation models.

Our proposed training pipeline depends solely on single-person videos to learn multi-person speaking patterns and refines interactivity with only a few real multi-person clips.

This passive paradigm creates a semantic bottleneck: models cannot rewatch, refocus, or verify evidence, leading to shallow visual reasoning on tasks requiring fine grained spatio temporal understanding. In this work, we introduce Interactive Video Reasoning, a new paradigm that transforms video into an active cognitive workspace, enabling models to \"think with videos\". Our model, Video CoM, reasons through a Chain of Manipulations (CoM), performing iterative visual actions to gather and refine evidence. To support this behavior, we construct Video CoM Instruct, an 18K instruction tuning dataset curated for multi step manipulation reasoning. Beyond supervised learning, we further optimize the manipulation policy via reinforcement learning with reasoning aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Unlike prior work that relies solely on sparse answer rewards, our method introduces step level reasoning rewards, guiding the model toward grounded and consistent reasoning. Video CoM achieves strong results across nine video reasoning benchmarks, improving average performance by 3.6 percent over recent state of the art models, while training on only 25K SFT and 3K GRPO video samples, significantly fewer than comparable large scale models. Ablation studies demonstrate that reasoning aware rewards improve both accuracy and interpretability.

Recent thinking models generate explicit reasoning traces for interpretability; however, their reasoning often appears convincing while being logically inconsistent or weakly grounded in visual evidence. We identify and formalize these issues through two diagnostic metrics: Think Answer Consistency (TAC), which measures the alignment between reasoning and answers, and Video Attention Score (VAS), which captures the extent to which reasoning depends on visual versus textual cues. Analysis across 11 video reasoning benchmarks shows that current models rely heavily on linguistic priors rather than visual content. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that enhances both temporal precision and reasoning consistency. Our approach combines timestamp aware supervised fine tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) guided by a novel Temporal Alignment Reward (TAR). This dual step post training stage encourages temporally aligned and causally coherent video reasoning. The resulting model, Video R2, achieves consistently higher TAC, VAS, and accuracy across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that improvements in temporal alignment and reasoning coherence lead to more accurate and trustworthy video understanding.
