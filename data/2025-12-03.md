TL;DR: 研究通过微调TerraMind模型，结合多模态数据（SAR和光学），提升了洪水测绘的实时性和准确性，首次在全球范围内评估了GFM的潜力与局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 洪水是最具破坏性的天气相关灾害之一，2024年极端洪水事件影响五大洲。尽管EO卫星提供了频繁的洪水测绘覆盖，但操作精度高度依赖标注数据集和模型泛化能力。GFM（如ESA-IBM的TerraMind）通过大规模自监督预训练提高了泛化性，但其在全球多样化洪水事件中的性能尚不明确。

Method: 研究使用FloodsNet数据集（包含全球85次洪水事件的Sentinel-1 SAR和Sentinel-2光学图像）对TerraMind模型进行微调，测试了四种配置（基础模型与大模型、冻结与非冻结骨干网络），并与Sen1Floods11训练的示例和U-Net模型进行对比。

Result: 基础-非冻结配置在准确性、精确度和召回率之间取得了最佳平衡，且计算成本显著低于大模型。大-非冻结模型实现了最高召回率。FloodsNet训练的模型在召回率上优于Sen1Floods11训练的示例，总体准确性相近。U-Net的召回率高于所有GFM配置，但准确性和精确度略低。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过整合多模态光学和SAR数据并微调GFM（Geospatial Foundation Models），可以增强近实时洪水测绘能力。该研究首次在全球范围内评估了GFM在洪水分割中的潜力与局限性，为气候适应和灾害韧性提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Floods are among the most damaging weather-related hazards, and in 2024, the warmest year on record, extreme flood events affected communities across five continents. Earth observation (EO) satellites provide critical, frequent coverage for mapping inundation, yet operational accuracy depends heavily on labeled datasets and model generalization. Recent Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs), such as ESA-IBM's TerraMind, offer improved generalizability through large-scale self-supervised pretraining, but their performance on diverse global flood events remains poorly understood.
  We fine-tune TerraMind for flood extent mapping using FloodsNet, a harmonized multimodal dataset containing co-located Sentinel-1 (Synthetic Aperture Radar, SAR data) and Sentinel-2 (optical) imagery for 85 flood events worldwide. We tested four configurations (base vs. large models; frozen vs. unfrozen backbones) and compared against the TerraMind Sen1Floods11 example and a U-Net trained on both FloodsNet and Sen1Floods11. The base-unfrozen configuration provided the best balance of accuracy, precision, and recall at substantially lower computational cost than the large model. The large unfrozen model achieved the highest recall. Models trained on FloodsNet outperformed the Sen1Floods11-trained example in recall with similar overall accuracy. U-Net achieved higher recall than all GFM configurations, though with slightly lower accuracy and precision.
  Our results demonstrate that integrating multimodal optical and SAR data and fine-tuning a GFM can enhance near-real-time flood mapping. This study provides one of the first global-scale evaluations of a GFM for flood segmentation, highlighting both its potential and current limitations for climate adaptation and disaster resilience.

*Haojin Deng,Yimin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种上下文丰富的对比损失函数，通过双目标设计解决信息失真问题，在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比学习中的对比损失函数可能导致信息失真，模型过度依赖相同标签样本而忽略来自同一初始图像的正对。

Method: 提出了一种包含两个收敛目标的上下文丰富对比损失函数，第一个组件增强标签对比的敏感性，第二个组件拉近来自同一源图像的增强样本。

Result: 在8个大规模基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在泛化性能和学习收敛速度上优于16种最先进的对比学习方法，尤其在BiasedMNIST数据集上表现出22.9%的改进。

Conclusion: 本文提出的上下文丰富的对比损失函数在提升学习效果的同时解决了信息失真问题，并在多个大规模基准数据集上验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has gained popularity and pushes state-of-the-art performance across numerous large-scale benchmarks. In contrastive learning, the contrastive loss function plays a pivotal role in discerning similarities between samples through techniques such as rotation or cropping. However, this learning mechanism can also introduce information distortion from the augmented samples. This is because the trained model may develop a significant overreliance on information from samples with identical labels, while concurrently neglecting positive pairs that originate from the same initial image, especially in expansive datasets. This paper proposes a context-enriched contrastive loss function that concurrently improves learning effectiveness and addresses the information distortion by encompassing two convergence targets. The first component, which is notably sensitive to label contrast, differentiates between features of identical and distinct classes which boosts the contrastive training efficiency. Meanwhile, the second component draws closer the augmented samples from the same source image and distances all other samples. We evaluate the proposed approach on image classification tasks, which are among the most widely accepted 8 recognition large-scale benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, ImageNet, BiasedMNIST, UTKFace, and CelebA datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improvements over 16 state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods in terms of both generalization performance and learning convergence speed. Interestingly, our technique stands out in addressing systematic distortion tasks. It demonstrates a 22.9% improvement compared to original contrastive loss functions in the downstream BiasedMNIST dataset, highlighting its promise for more efficient and equitable downstream training.

*Pranav Asthana,Alex Hanson,Allen Tu,Tom Goldstein,Matthias Zwicker,Amitabh Varshney*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SplatSuRe通过选择性超分辨率提升3D高斯溅射的渲染质量，尤其在局部前景区域效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法独立增强每张低分辨率图像会导致多视图不一致，产生模糊渲染，而均匀应用超分辨率无法充分利用场景信息。

Method: 提出SplatSuRe方法，利用相机姿态与场景几何的相对关系，选择性在欠采样区域添加超分辨率内容。

Result: 在Tanks & Temples、Deep Blending和Mip-NeRF 360数据集上，SplatSuRe在保真度和感知质量上均超越基线方法。

Conclusion: SplatSuRe方法通过选择性应用超分辨率内容，在缺乏高频监督的欠采样区域显著提升了渲染的锐度和一致性，尤其在局部前景区域表现突出。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-quality novel view synthesis, motivating interest in generating higher-resolution renders than those available during training. A natural strategy is to apply super-resolution (SR) to low-resolution (LR) input views, but independently enhancing each image introduces multi-view inconsistencies, leading to blurry renders. Prior methods attempt to mitigate these inconsistencies through learned neural components, temporally consistent video priors, or joint optimization on LR and SR views, but all uniformly apply SR across every image. In contrast, our key insight is that close-up LR views may contain high-frequency information for regions also captured in more distant views, and that we can use the camera pose relative to scene geometry to inform where to add SR content. Building from this insight, we propose SplatSuRe, a method that selectively applies SR content only in undersampled regions lacking high-frequency supervision, yielding sharper and more consistent results. Across Tanks & Temples, Deep Blending and Mip-NeRF 360, our approach surpasses baselines in both fidelity and perceptual quality. Notably, our gains are most significant in localized foreground regions where higher detail is desired.

*Kevin David Hayes,Micah Goldblum,Vikash Sehwag,Gowthami Somepalli,Ashwinee Panda,Tom Goldstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种联合评估T2I模型和VLMs的方法，通过VLMs识别T2I模型的27种失败模式，揭示了当前指标无法捕捉的细微错误，强调了针对性基准的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I模型生成的图像在用户提示的特定属性（如对象数量和颜色）上表现不佳，且VLMs的基准未能跟上其标注场景的复杂性。

Method: 提出了一种结构化方法，通过测试视觉语言模型（VLMs）是否能识别文本到图像（T2I）模型生成的图像中的27种特定失败模式，来联合评估T2I模型和VLMs。

Result: 通过分析一组精选提示的失败模式，揭示了属性保真度和对象表示中的系统性错误。

Conclusion: 当前指标不足以捕捉生成模型中的细微错误，强调了针对性基准对于提升生成模型可靠性和可解释性的重要性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are capable of generating visually impressive images, yet they often fail to accurately capture specific attributes in user prompts, such as the correct number of objects with the specified colors. The diversity of such errors underscores the need for a hierarchical evaluation framework that can compare prompt adherence abilities of different image generation models. Simultaneously, benchmarks of vision language models (VLMs) have not kept pace with the complexity of scenes that VLMs are used to annotate. In this work, we propose a structured methodology for jointly evaluating T2I models and VLMs by testing whether VLMs can identify 27 specific failure modes in the images generated by T2I models conditioned on challenging prompts. Our second contribution is a dataset of prompts and images generated by 5 T2I models (Flux, SD3-Medium, SD3-Large, SD3.5-Medium, SD3.5-Large) and the corresponding annotations from VLMs (Molmo, InternVL3, Pixtral) annotated by an LLM (Llama3) to test whether VLMs correctly identify the failure mode in a generated image. By analyzing failure modes on a curated set of prompts, we reveal systematic errors in attribute fidelity and object representation. Our findings suggest that current metrics are insufficient to capture these nuanced errors, highlighting the importance of targeted benchmarks for advancing generative model reliability and interpretability.

### [5] [Attention-guided reference point shifting for Gaussian-mixture-based partial point set registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02496)
*Mizuki Kikkawa,Tatsuya Yatagawa,Yutaka Ohtake,Hiromasa Suzuki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了部分到部分点集配准中特征不变性的问题，提出ARPS层改进DeepGMR和UGMMReg，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究部分到部分点集配准中特征向量在平移和旋转下的不变性影响，特别是针对基于深度学习和GMMs的方法（如DeepGMR）的局限性。

Method: 引入了注意力参考点偏移（ARPS）层，该层利用注意力模块识别两个部分点集的共同参考点，从而获得变换不变特征。

Result: ARPS层显著提升了DeepGMR和UGMMReg的性能，并优于之前使用注意力块和Transformer提取重叠区域或共同参考点的深度学习方法。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了基于深度学习和高斯混合模型（GMMs）的配准方法在理论和实践中的问题，并通过引入注意力参考点偏移（ARPS）层提出了一种可理解的解决方案，显著提升了DeepGMR及其变体UGMMReg的性能。

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of the invariance of feature vectors for partial-to-partial point set registration under translation and rotation of input point sets, particularly in the realm of techniques based on deep learning and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). We reveal both theoretical and practical problems associated with such deep-learning-based registration methods using GMMs, with a particular focus on the limitations of DeepGMR, a pioneering study in this line, to the partial-to-partial point set registration. Our primary goal is to uncover the causes behind such methods and propose a comprehensible solution for that. To address this, we introduce an attention-based reference point shifting (ARPS) layer, which robustly identifies a common reference point of two partial point sets, thereby acquiring transformation-invariant features. The ARPS layer employs a well-studied attention module to find a common reference point rather than the overlap region. Owing to this, it significantly enhances the performance of DeepGMR and its recent variant, UGMMReg. Furthermore, these extension models outperform even prior deep learning methods using attention blocks and Transformer to extract the overlap region or common reference points. We believe these findings provide deeper insights into registration methods using deep learning and GMMs.

### [6] [Mapping of Lesion Images to Somatic Mutations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02162)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 癌症治疗的疗效往往依赖于早期诊断和治疗，因此研究旨在通过医学影像预测患者的体细胞突变谱，以促进早期干预。

Method: 研究构建了一个深度潜在变量模型LLOST，该模型采用双变分自编码器，通过一个共享的潜在空间将病变点云和体细胞突变计数特征统一起来。模型包含三个潜在空间，每个空间通过学习条件归一化流先验来适应各领域的不同分布。

Conclusion: 文章提出了如何改进模型的可能性，并探讨了未来研究可以纳入其他遗传领域的途径。

Abstract: Medical imaging is a critical initial tool used by clinicians to determine a patient's cancer diagnosis, allowing for faster intervention and more reliable patient prognosis. At subsequent stages of patient diagnosis, genetic information is extracted to help select specific patient treatment options. As the efficacy of cancer treatment often relies on early diagnosis and treatment, we build a deep latent variable model to determine patients' somatic mutation profiles based on their corresponding medical images. We first introduce a point cloud representation of lesions images to allow for invariance to the imaging modality. We then propose, LLOST, a model with dual variational autoencoders coupled together by a separate shared latent space that unifies features from the lesion point clouds and counts of distinct somatic mutations. Therefore our model consists of three latent space, each of which is learned with a conditional normalizing flow prior to account for the diverse distributions of each domain. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on de-identified medical images from The Cancer Imaging Archive and the corresponding somatic mutations from the Pan Cancer dataset of The Cancer Genomic Archive. We show the model's predictive performance on the counts of specific mutations as well as it's ability to accurately predict the occurrence of mutations. In particular, shared patterns between the imaging and somatic mutation domain that reflect cancer type. We conclude with a remark on how to improve the model and possible future avenues of research to include other genetic domains.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种结合纹理映射的高斯泼溅优化方法，通过自适应调整纹理分辨率，有效减少了所需的高斯基元数量，同时保持了图像质量。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become the method of choice for 3D reconstruction and real-time rendering of captured real scenes. However, fine appearance details need to be represented as a large number of small Gaussian primitives, which can be wasteful when geometry and appearance exhibit different frequency characteristics.
  Inspired by the long tradition of texture mapping, we propose to use texture to represent detailed appearance where possible. Our main focus is to incorporate per-primitive texture maps that adapt to the scene in a principled manner during Gaussian Splatting optimization. We do this by proposing a new appearance representation for 2D Gaussian primitives with textures where the size of a texel is bounded by the image sampling frequency and adapted to the content of the input images. We achieve this by adaptively upscaling or downscaling the texture resolution during optimization. In addition, our approach enables control of the number of primitives during optimization based on texture resolution. We show that our approach performs favorably in image quality and total number of parameters used compared to alternative solutions for textured Gaussian primitives.

*Xu Han,Biao Zhang,Xiangjun Tang,Xianzhi Li,Peter Wonka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LumiX是一个结构化扩散框架，通过Query-Broadcast Attention和Tensor LoRA技术，实现了文本到内在属性的连贯生成，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决文本到内在属性生成中的结构一致性和物理合理性问题，LumiX旨在提供一个统一的框架，生成多种内在属性（如反照率、辐照度、法线、深度和最终颜色）。

Method: LumiX采用结构化扩散框架，结合Query-Broadcast Attention机制和Tensor LoRA技术，实现了多内在属性的联合生成和训练。

Result: 实验显示，LumiX在物理一致性和用户偏好上表现优异，比现有技术高出23%的对齐度，偏好得分也更高（0.19 vs. -0.41），并能实现图像条件的内在分解。

Conclusion: LumiX通过结构化扩散框架实现了文本到内在属性的连贯生成，通过Query-Broadcast Attention和Tensor LoRA两大创新，确保了结构一致性和高效联合训练，实验结果表明其在物理一致性和用户偏好上优于现有技术。

Abstract: We present LumiX, a structured diffusion framework for coherent text-to-intrinsic generation. Conditioned on text prompts, LumiX jointly generates a comprehensive set of intrinsic maps (e.g., albedo, irradiance, normal, depth, and final color), providing a structured and physically consistent description of an underlying scene. This is enabled by two key contributions: 1) Query-Broadcast Attention, a mechanism that ensures structural consistency by sharing queries across all maps in each self-attention block. 2) Tensor LoRA, a tensor-based adaptation that parameter-efficiently models cross-map relations for efficient joint training. Together, these designs enable stable joint diffusion training and unified generation of multiple intrinsic properties. Experiments show that LumiX produces coherent and physically meaningful results, achieving 23% higher alignment and a better preference score (0.19 vs. -0.41) compared to the state of the art, and it can also perform image-conditioned intrinsic decomposition within the same framework.

*Mansoor Ali,Maksim Richards,Gilberto Ochoa-Ruiz,Sharib Ali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RobustSurg通过风格和内容信息利用，提升手术场景分割的泛化能力，在跨中心和跨模态数据上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在手术场景分割中泛化能力不足，尤其是在跨中心和跨模态数据上表现不佳。

Method: 提出了一种结合实例归一化、特征协方差映射和恢复模块的ResNet骨干网络，用于学习鲁棒和可泛化的特征表示。

Result: 在HeiCholSeg和EndoUDA数据集上，RobustSurg分别比基线DeepLabv3+和SOTA方法提升了23%和11-32%的mIoU得分。

Conclusion: RobustSurg通过实例归一化和特征协方差映射技术，结合恢复模块，显著提高了手术场景分割的泛化能力，并在多中心和跨模态数据上表现出色。

Abstract: While recent advances in deep learning for surgical scene segmentation have demonstrated promising results on single-centre and single-imaging modality data, these methods usually do not generalise to unseen distribution (i.e., from other centres) and unseen modalities. Current literature for tackling generalisation on out-of-distribution data and domain gaps due to modality changes has been widely researched but mostly for natural scene data. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to the surgical scenes due to limited visual cues and often extremely diverse scenarios compared to the natural scene data. Inspired by these works in natural scenes to push generalisability on OOD data, we hypothesise that exploiting the style and content information in the surgical scenes could minimise the appearances, making it less variable to sudden changes such as blood or imaging artefacts. This can be achieved by performing instance normalisation and feature covariance mapping techniques for robust and generalisable feature representations. Further, to eliminate the risk of removing salient feature representation associated with the objects of interest, we introduce a restitution module within the feature learning ResNet backbone that can enable the retention of useful task-relevant features. To tackle the lack of multiclass and multicentre data for surgical scene segmentation, we also provide a newly curated dataset that can be vital for addressing generalisability in this domain. Our proposed RobustSurg obtained nearly 23% improvement on the baseline DeepLabv3+ and from 10-32% improvement on the SOTA in terms of mean IoU score on an unseen centre HeiCholSeg dataset when trained on CholecSeg8K. Similarly, RobustSurg also obtained nearly 22% improvement over the baseline and nearly 11% improvement on a recent SOTA method for the target set of the EndoUDA polyp dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurfFill结合LiDAR与相机优势，通过高斯面元补全点云，特别优化薄结构和边缘区域，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR在平坦区域精度高但易遗漏小几何结构和暗色材料细节，而摄影测量法能捕捉这些细节但在特征缺失区域精度不足。

Method: 分析LiDAR捕获中的光束发散问题，引入模糊启发式方法识别潜在遗漏区域，并利用高斯面元重建在这些区域进行优化和密集化。

Result: 在合成和真实场景的LiDAR点云补全任务中，SurfFill方法优于现有重建方法。

Conclusion: SurfFill方法通过结合LiDAR和相机捕获的优势，提出了一种高斯面元基础的LiDAR补全方案，有效提升了点云补全的精度，特别是在薄结构和边缘区域。

Abstract: LiDAR-captured point clouds are often considered the gold standard in active 3D reconstruction. While their accuracy is exceptional in flat regions, the capturing is susceptible to miss small geometric structures and may fail with dark, absorbent materials. Alternatively, capturing multiple photos of the scene and applying 3D photogrammetry can infer these details as they often represent feature-rich regions. However, the accuracy of LiDAR for featureless regions is rarely reached. Therefore, we suggest combining the strengths of LiDAR and camera-based capture by introducing SurfFill: a Gaussian surfel-based LiDAR completion scheme. We analyze LiDAR capturings and attribute LiDAR beam divergence as a main factor for artifacts, manifesting mostly at thin structures and edges. We use this insight to introduce an ambiguity heuristic for completed scans by evaluating the change in density in the point cloud. This allows us to identify points close to missed areas, which we can then use to grow additional points from to complete the scan. For this point growing, we constrain Gaussian surfel reconstruction [Huang et al. 2024] to focus optimization and densification on these ambiguous areas. Finally, Gaussian primitives of the reconstruction in ambiguous areas are extracted and sampled for points to complete the point cloud. To address the challenges of large-scale reconstruction, we extend this pipeline with a divide-and-conquer scheme for building-sized point cloud completion. We evaluate on the task of LiDAR point cloud completion of synthetic and real-world scenes and find that our method outperforms previous reconstruction methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种归纳先验方法，通过多重分形分析改进通道注意力机制，在医学影像任务中表现优异，并揭示了注意力层行为的特殊性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端多重分形方法依赖重池化或强特征空间抽取，限制了如语义分割等任务，因此提出新方法以克服这些限制。

Method: 引入了Monofractal和Multifractal Recalibration两个归纳先验，利用指数概率质量与多重分形谱的关系，形成卷积网络中通道注意力函数的统计描述。

Result: 在ISIC18、Kvasir-SEG和BUSI三个公共医学影像数据集上，Multifractal Recalibration相比其他使用高阶统计的通道注意力机制基线有显著提升。

Conclusion: Multifractal Recalibration方法在U-Net架构中表现出色，尤其在医学影像数据集上验证了其有效性，揭示了注意力层的特殊行为与实例变异的全局统计相关。

Abstract: Multifractal analysis has revealed regularities in many self-seeding phenomena, yet its use in modern deep learning remains limited. Existing end-to-end multifractal methods rely on heavy pooling or strong feature-space decimation, which constrain tasks such as semantic segmentation. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce two inductive priors: Monofractal and Multifractal Recalibration. These methods leverage relationships between the probability mass of the exponents and the multifractal spectrum to form statistical descriptions of encoder embeddings, implemented as channel-attention functions in convolutional networks.
  Using a U-Net-based framework, we show that multifractal recalibration yields substantial gains over a baseline equipped with other channel-attention mechanisms that also use higher-order statistics. Given the proven ability of multifractal analysis to capture pathological regularities, we validate our approach on three public medical-imaging datasets: ISIC18 (dermoscopy), Kvasir-SEG (endoscopy), and BUSI (ultrasound).
  Our empirical analysis also provides insights into the behavior of these attention layers. We find that excitation responses do not become increasingly specialized with encoder depth in U-Net architectures due to skip connections, and that their effectiveness may relate to global statistics of instance variability.

TL;DR: Sync-LoRA 通过图像到视频扩散模型和上下文 LoRA 训练，实现了高质量肖像视频编辑，同时保持帧级同步和身份一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决肖像视频编辑中保持原始时间行为和身份一致性的挑战。

Method: 使用图像到视频扩散模型，通过修改第一帧并将编辑传播到整个序列。训练一个上下文 LoRA，利用自动生成和筛选的同步视频对进行训练。

Result: Sync-LoRA 在未见过的身份和多样化编辑中表现出高视觉保真度和强时间一致性。

Conclusion: Sync-LoRA 是一种高效编辑肖像视频的方法，能够在保持高质量视觉修改的同时，确保帧级同步和身份一致性。

Abstract: Editing portrait videos is a challenging task that requires flexible yet precise control over a wide range of modifications, such as appearance changes, expression edits, or the addition of objects. The key difficulty lies in preserving the subject's original temporal behavior, demanding that every edited frame remains precisely synchronized with the corresponding source frame. We present Sync-LoRA, a method for editing portrait videos that achieves high-quality visual modifications while maintaining frame-accurate synchronization and identity consistency. Our approach uses an image-to-video diffusion model, where the edit is defined by modifying the first frame and then propagated to the entire sequence. To enable accurate synchronization, we train an in-context LoRA using paired videos that depict identical motion trajectories but differ in appearance. These pairs are automatically generated and curated through a synchronization-based filtering process that selects only the most temporally aligned examples for training. This training setup teaches the model to combine motion cues from the source video with the visual changes introduced in the edited first frame. Trained on a compact, highly curated set of synchronized human portraits, Sync-LoRA generalizes to unseen identities and diverse edits (e.g., modifying appearance, adding objects, or changing backgrounds), robustly handling variations in pose and expression. Our results demonstrate high visual fidelity and strong temporal coherence, achieving a robust balance between edit fidelity and precise motion preservation.

TL;DR: Unified-VQA通过诊断性混合专家框架，统一评估多种视频格式和失真类型的质量，并提供可解释的反馈，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频质量评估（VQA）方法缺乏诊断性和通用性，无法提供可解释的反馈。

Method: 提出Unified-VQA框架，采用多感知专家和新型多代理专家训练策略，结合诊断性多任务头生成全局质量分数和可解释的多维伪影向量。

Result: Unified-VQA在17个数据库中的表现优于18种基准方法，适用于HD、UHD、HDR和HFR格式。

Conclusion: Unified-VQA框架通过诊断性混合专家（MoE）方法，提供了一个适用于多种视频格式和失真类型的统一质量模型，显著提升了视频质量评估的实用性和可解释性。

Abstract: Recent works in video quality assessment (VQA) typically employ monolithic models that typically predict a single quality score for each test video. These approaches cannot provide diagnostic, interpretable feedback, offering little insight into why the video quality is degraded. Most of them are also specialized, format-specific metrics rather than truly ``generic" solutions, as they are designed to learn a compromised representation from disparate perceptual domains. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Unified-VQA, a framework that provides a single, unified quality model applicable to various distortion types within multiple video formats by recasting generic VQA as a Diagnostic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) problem. Unified-VQA employs multiple ``perceptual experts'' dedicated to distinct perceptual domains. A novel multi-proxy expert training strategy is designed to optimize each expert using a ranking-inspired loss, guided by the most suitable proxy metric for its domain. We also integrated a diagnostic multi-task head into this framework to generate a global quality score and an interpretable multi-dimensional artifact vector, which is optimized using a weakly-supervised learning strategy, leveraging the known properties of the large-scale training database generated for this work. With static model parameters (without retraining or fine-tuning), Unified-VQA demonstrates consistent and superior performance compared to over 18 benchmark methods for both generic VQA and diagnostic artifact detection tasks across 17 databases containing diverse streaming artifacts in HD, UHD, HDR and HFR formats. This work represents an important step towards practical, actionable, and interpretable video quality assessment.

TL;DR: AV-SpeakerBench是一个专注于说话者视听推理的基准，Gemini系列模型表现最佳，开源模型在视听融合方面仍有差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频基准很少评估对人类语音的细粒度推理，许多任务仍可通过视觉解决或仅粗略评估语音，限制了模型是否能够对齐说话者、内容和时间的能力。

Method: 引入AV-SpeakerBench，一个包含3,212个多选题的精选基准，专注于真实世界视频中以说话者为中心的视听推理。

Result: Gemini系列模型表现优于开源系统，其中Gemini 2.5 Pro表现最佳。开源模型Qwen3-Omni-30B接近Gemini 2.0 Flash，但仍远落后于Gemini 2.5 Pro，主要原因是视听融合能力较弱。

Conclusion: AV-SpeakerBench为未来多模态系统中细粒度的视听推理奠定了严格的基础。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are expected to jointly interpret vision, audio, and language, yet existing video benchmarks rarely assess fine-grained reasoning about human speech. Many tasks remain visually solvable or only coarsely evaluate speech, offering limited insight into whether models can align who speaks, what is said, and when it occurs. We introduce AV-SpeakerBench, a curated benchmark of 3,212 multiple-choice questions focused on speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in real-world videos. It features: (1) a speaker-centered formulation that treats speakers-not scenes-as the core reasoning unit; (2) fusion-grounded question design embedding audiovisual dependencies into question semantics; and (3) expert-curated annotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity. Comprehensive evaluations show that the Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the best results. Among open models, Qwen3-Omni-30B approaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weaker audiovisual fusion rather than visual perception. We believe AV-SpeakerBench establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing fine-grained audiovisual reasoning in future multimodal systems.

Motivation: 生物可解释且高能效的框架（如SNN）在低级视觉任务中尚未得到充分探索，本研究以图像去雨为例，探索脉冲神经元固有的高通特性表示。

Method: 提出了视觉LIF（VLIF）神经元，克服了传统脉冲神经元缺乏空间上下文理解的障碍，并利用VLIF引入了脉冲分解与增强模块和轻量级脉冲多尺度单元，进行层次化多尺度表示学习。

Conclusion: 本研究为在高性能、高能效的低级视觉任务中部署SNN奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Biologically plausible and energy-efficient frameworks such as Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have not been sufficiently explored in low-level vision tasks. Taking image deraining as an example, this study addresses the representation of the inherent high-pass characteristics of spiking neurons, specifically in image deraining and innovatively proposes the Visual LIF (VLIF) neuron, overcoming the obstacle of lacking spatial contextual understanding present in traditional spiking neurons. To tackle the limitation of frequency-domain saturation inherent in conventional spiking neurons, we leverage the proposed VLIF to introduce the Spiking Decomposition and Enhancement Module and the lightweight Spiking Multi-scale Unit for hierarchical multi-scale representation learning. Extensive experiments across five benchmark deraining datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SNN-based deraining methods, achieving this superior performance with only 13\% of their energy consumption. These findings establish a solid foundation for deploying SNNs in high-performance, energy-efficient low-level vision tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成方法依赖天气尺度的自回归，对长期气候模拟速度慢且稳定性不足，需要一种更高效稳定的气候模拟方法。

Method: 提出了时空金字塔流（SPF），一种新的流匹配方法，通过分层建模时空数据，逐步增加空间分辨率以减少计算量，并结合物理强迫条件实现多时间尺度的并行气候模拟。

Result: SPF在ClimateBench上优于基线方法，尤其在粗时间尺度上采样速度快，且能推广到未见的场景。

Conclusion: SPF和ClimateSuite为跨时间尺度和现实未来场景的准确、高效、概率性气候模拟提供了基础。

Abstract: Generative models have the potential to transform the way we emulate Earth's changing climate. Previous generative approaches rely on weather-scale autoregression for climate emulation, but this is inherently slow for long climate horizons and has yet to demonstrate stable rollouts under nonstationary forcings. Here, we introduce Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flows (SPF), a new class of flow matching approaches that model data hierarchically across spatial and temporal scales. Inspired by cascaded video models, SPF partitions the generative trajectory into a spatiotemporal pyramid, progressively increasing spatial resolution to reduce computation and coupling each stage with an associated timescale to enable direct sampling at any temporal level in the pyramid. This design, together with conditioning each stage on prescribed physical forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases or aerosols), enables efficient, parallel climate emulation at multiple timescales. On ClimateBench, SPF outperforms strong flow matching baselines and pre-trained models at yearly and monthly timescales while offering fast sampling, especially at coarser temporal levels. To scale SPF, we curate ClimateSuite, the largest collection of Earth system simulations to date, comprising over 33,000 simulation-years across ten climate models and the first dataset to include simulations of climate interventions. We find that the scaled SPF model demonstrates good generalization to held-out scenarios across climate models. Together, SPF and ClimateSuite provide a foundation for accurate, efficient, probabilistic climate emulation across temporal scales and realistic future scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现有文本到视频模型在时间生成方面表现强大，但其在图像修复领域的潜力尚未充分探索。本研究旨在利用CogVideo模型探索渐进式视觉修复任务。

Method: 通过构建超分辨率、去模糊和低光增强的合成数据集，并比较两种提示策略（统一文本提示和场景特定提示），微调CogVideo模型以生成修复轨迹而非自然视频运动。

Result: 实验表明，微调后的模型能够将时间进展与修复质量关联，生成的序列在PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS等感知指标上逐帧提升，同时保持时间一致性和空间细节。

Conclusion: CogVideo模型通过微调能够有效执行渐进式视觉修复任务，不仅在合成数据集上表现优异，还能在真实场景（如ReLoBlur数据集）中实现零样本泛化，展示了强大的时间修复能力和可解释性。

Abstract: Recent text-to-video models have demonstrated strong temporal generation capabilities, yet their potential for image restoration remains underexplored. In this work, we repurpose CogVideo for progressive visual restoration tasks by fine-tuning it to generate restoration trajectories rather than natural video motion. Specifically, we construct synthetic datasets for super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement, where each sample depicts a gradual transition from degraded to clean frames. Two prompting strategies are compared: a uniform text prompt shared across all samples, and a scene-specific prompting scheme generated via LLaVA multi-modal LLM and refined with ChatGPT. Our fine-tuned model learns to associate temporal progression with restoration quality, producing sequences that improve perceptual metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS across frames. Extensive experiments show that CogVideo effectively restores spatial detail and illumination consistency while maintaining temporal coherence. Moreover, the model generalizes to real-world scenarios on the ReLoBlur dataset without additional training, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness and interpretability through temporal restoration.

Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在不同区域（如地中海到秘鲁海岸）泛化能力差的问题，尤其是标记数据稀缺的地区。

Method: 提出了两阶段合成增强框架MORP--Synth：阶段A应用形态学区域扰动生成几何变化，阶段B使用条件生成模型渲染SAR纹理。

Result: 模型在秘鲁数据集上的mIoU提升至+6，少数类IoU显著提高（油污+10.8，类似物+14.6）。

Conclusion: MORP--Synth框架显著提升了SAR油污分割模型在秘鲁海岸的泛化能力，特别是在少数类别（油污和类似物）上表现突出。

Abstract: Deep learning models for SAR oil spill segmentation often fail to generalize across regions due to differences in sea-state, backscatter statistics, and slick morphology, a limitation that is particularly severe along the Peruvian coast where labeled Sentinel-1 data remain scarce. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{MORP--Synth}, a two-stage synthetic augmentation framework designed to improve transfer from Mediterranean to Peruvian conditions. Stage~A applies Morphological Region Perturbation, a curvature guided label space method that generates realistic geometric variations of oil and look-alike regions. Stage~B renders SAR-like textures from the edited masks using a conditional generative INADE model. We compile a Peruvian dataset of 2112 labeled 512$\times$512 patches from 40 Sentinel-1 scenes (2014--2024), harmonized with the Mediterranean CleanSeaNet benchmark, and evaluate seven segmentation architectures. Models pretrained on Mediterranean data degrade from 67.8\% to 51.8\% mIoU on the Peruvian domain; MORP--Synth improves performance up to +6 mIoU and boosts minority-class IoU (+10.8 oil, +14.6 look-alike).

Method: 利用预训练视频扩散模型在高噪声阶段自然学习到的运动表示，无需任务特定训练即可进行跟踪。

Result: 在现有基准和新测试中，性能提升高达6个百分点，能够稳健跟踪即使在视角变化和形变下的相同物体。

Conclusion: 基于预训练视频扩散模型的运动表示，我们的自监督跟踪器在视觉相似物体的区分上取得了显著进步，性能提升了6个百分点，并在新引入的测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Distinguishing visually similar objects by their motion remains a critical challenge in computer vision. Although supervised trackers show promise, contemporary self-supervised trackers struggle when visual cues become ambiguous, limiting their scalability and generalization without extensive labeled data. We find that pre-trained video diffusion models inherently learn motion representations suitable for tracking without task-specific training. This ability arises because their denoising process isolates motion in early, high-noise stages, distinct from later appearance refinement. Capitalizing on this discovery, our self-supervised tracker significantly improves performance in distinguishing visually similar objects, an underexplored failure point for existing methods. Our method achieves up to a 6-point improvement over recent self-supervised approaches on established benchmarks and our newly introduced tests focused on tracking visually similar items. Visualizations confirm that these diffusion-derived motion representations enable robust tracking of even identical objects across challenging viewpoint changes and deformations.

Conclusion: 提出的基于Thin Plate Spline的高自由度长期对齐框架在多种数据集、主干模型和相机设置下均表现出更一致的几何和更低的轨迹误差，展现了其鲁棒性和通用性。

Abstract: 3D vision foundation models have shown strong generalization in reconstructing key 3D attributes from uncalibrated images through a single feed-forward pass. However, when deployed in online settings such as driving scenarios, predictions are made over temporal windows, making it non-trivial to maintain consistency across time. Recent strategies align consecutive predictions by solving global transformation, yet our analysis reveals their fundamental limitations in assumption validity, local alignment scope, and robustness under noisy geometry. In this work, we propose a higher-DOF and long-term alignment framework based on Thin Plate Spline, leveraging globally propagated control points to correct spatially varying inconsistencies. In addition, we adopt a point-agnostic submap registration design that is inherently robust to noisy geometry predictions. The proposed framework is fully plug-and-play, compatible with diverse 3D foundation models and camera configurations (e.g., monocular or surround-view). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently yields more coherent geometry and lower trajectory errors across multiple datasets, backbone models, and camera setups, highlighting its robustness and generality.

Method: 提出了一种名为MS-CAM的可视化解释方法，通过匹配SAR图像与CNN提取的特征图和梯度，结合通道和元素级权重来可视化模型决策依据。

Result: 在自建的SAR目标分类数据集上的实验表明，MS-CAM能更准确地突出网络关注区域并捕捉细节特征信息，从而增强网络可解释性。

Conclusion: MS-CAM通过结合通道和元素级权重，显著提升了CNN在SAR图像中的可解释性，并验证了其在弱监督目标定位中的可行性。

Abstract: In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved significant success in various synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tasks. However, the complexity and opacity of their internal mechanisms hinder the fulfillment of high-reliability requirements, thereby limiting their application in SAR. Improving the interpretability of CNNs is thus of great importance for their development and deployment in SAR. In this paper, a visual explanation method termed multi-weight self-matching class activation mapping (MS-CAM) is proposed. MS-CAM matches SAR images with the feature maps and corresponding gradients extracted by the CNN, and combines both channel-wise and element-wise weights to visualize the decision basis learned by the model in SAR images. Extensive experiments conducted on a self-constructed SAR target classification dataset demonstrate that MS-CAM more accurately highlights the network's regions of interest and captures detailed target feature information, thereby enhancing network interpretability. Furthermore, the feasibility of applying MS-CAM to weakly-supervised obiect localization is validated. Key factors affecting localization accuracy, such as pixel thresholds, are analyzed in depth to inform future work.

Motivation: 统一多模态模型虽然整合了异构组件以支持理解和生成能力，但带来了推理效率低下的问题，某些任务或样本可能不需要模型的全部知识或能力。

Method: 采用训练无关的剪枝方法（深度剪枝和宽度缩减）系统分析统一多模态模型组件，并提出MoE Adaptation方法，将生成模块划分为多个专家并启用稀疏激活。

Result: 研究发现理解组件在理解和生成任务中均表现出显著的可压缩性，而生成组件对压缩高度敏感。MoE Adaptation方法通过稀疏激活有效恢复了生成质量。

Conclusion: 通过Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adaptation方法，BAGEL模型在仅激活约一半参数的情况下，实现了与完整模型相当的性能。

Abstract: Large multimodal models have achieved remarkable progress in both understanding and generation. Recent efforts pursue unified multimodal models that integrate heterogeneous components to support both capabilities within a single framework. However, such unification introduces inference inefficiencies, e.g., specific tasks or samples may not require the full knowledge or capacity of the unified model. Yet, a systematic understanding of how these inefficiencies manifest across different components remains limited. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of unified multimodal model components using training-free pruning as a probing methodology, considering both depth pruning and width reduction. Our study reveals that the understanding component exhibits notable compressibility in both understanding and generation tasks, which is more pronounced in the latter. In contrast, the generation components are highly sensitive to compression, with performance deteriorating sharply even under moderate compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adaptation, inspired by the dynamic activation patterns observed across different samples. This approach partitions the generation module into multiple experts and enables sparse activation to restore generation quality. We validate the effectiveness of sparse activation through expert-frozen tuning and further demonstrate that a fully trainable adaptation delivers additional gains. As a result, the adapted BAGEL model achieves performance comparable to the full model while activating only about half of its parameters.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AV) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) have been revolutionized by Deep Learning. As a data-driven approach, Deep Learning relies on vast amounts of driving data, typically labeled in great detail. As a result, datasets, alongside hardware and algorithms, are foundational building blocks for the development of AVs. In this work we revisit one of the most widely used autonomous driving datasets: the nuScenes dataset. nuScenes exemplifies key trends in AV development, being the first dataset to include radar data, to feature diverse urban driving scenes from two continents, and to be collected using a fully autonomous vehicle operating on public roads, while also promoting multi-modal sensor fusion, standardized benchmarks, and a broad range of tasks including perception, localization \& mapping, prediction and planning. We provide an unprecedented look into the creation of nuScenes, as well as its extensions nuImages and Panoptic nuScenes, summarizing many technical details that have hitherto not been revealed in academic publications. Furthermore, we trace how the influence of nuScenes impacted a large number of other datasets that were released later and how it defined numerous standards that are used by the community to this day. Finally, we present an overview of both official and unofficial tasks using the nuScenes dataset and review major methodological developments, thereby offering a comprehensive survey of the autonomous driving literature, with a particular focus on nuScenes.

Result: 在三个广泛使用的多视角计数数据集上，WSCF-MVCC在弱监督设置下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的WSCF-MVCC方法在弱监督设置下优于现有方法，更适合实际部署。

Abstract: Multi-view crowd counting can effectively mitigate occlusion issues that commonly arise in single-image crowd counting. Existing deep-learning multi-view crowd counting methods project different camera view images onto a common space to obtain ground-plane density maps, requiring abundant and costly crowd annotations and camera calibrations. Hence, calibration-free methods are proposed that do not require camera calibrations and scene-level crowd annotations. However, existing calibration-free methods still require expensive image-level crowd annotations for training the single-view counting module. Thus, in this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised calibration-free multi-view crowd counting method (WSCF-MVCC), directly using crowd count as supervision for the single-view counting module rather than density maps constructed from crowd annotations. Instead, a self-supervised ranking loss that leverages multi-scale priors is utilized to enhance the model's perceptual ability without additional annotation costs. What's more, the proposed model leverages semantic information to achieve a more accurate view matching and, consequently, a more precise scene-level crowd count estimation. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three widely used multi-view counting datasets under weakly supervised settings, indicating that it is more suitable for practical deployment compared with calibrated methods. Code is released in https://github.com/zqyq/Weakly-MVCC.

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation into how alternative LiDAR-to-image projections affect metric place recognition when coupled with a state-of-the-art vision foundation model. We introduce a modular retrieval pipeline that controls for backbone, aggregation, and evaluation protocol, thereby isolating the influence of the 2-D projection itself. Using consistent geometric and structural channels across multiple datasets and deployment scenarios, we identify the projection characteristics that most strongly determine discriminative power, robustness to environmental variation, and suitability for real-time autonomy. Experiments with different datasets, including integration into an operational place recognition policy, validate the practical relevance of these findings and demonstrate that carefully designed projections can serve as an effective surrogate for end-to-end 3-D learning in LiDAR place recognition.

Conclusion: VACoT框架通过动态调用图像增强技术，显著提升了视觉语言模型在对抗性和分布外输入上的鲁棒性，特别是在OCR相关任务中。

Abstract: While visual data augmentation remains a cornerstone for training robust vision models, it has received limited attention in visual language models (VLMs), which predominantly rely on large-scale real data acquisition or synthetic diversity. Consequently, they may struggle with basic perception tasks that conventional models handle reliably. Given the substantial cost of pre-training and fine-tuning VLMs, continue training on augmented data yields limited and diminishing returns. In this paper, we present Visual Augmentation Chain-of-Thought (VACoT), a framework that dynamically invokes image augmentations during model inference. By incorporating post-hoc transformations such as denoising, VACoT substantially improves robustness on challenging and out-of-distribution inputs, especially in OCR-related adversarial scenarios. Distinct from prior approaches limited to local cropping, VACoT integrates a structured collection of general visual augmentations, broadening the query image views while reducing training complexity and computational overhead with efficient agentic reinforcement learning. We propose a conditional reward scheme that encourages necessary augmentation while penalizing verbose responses, ensuring concise and effective reasoning in perception tasks. We demonstrate the superiority of VACoT with extensive experiments on 13 perception benchmarks and further introduce AdvOCR to highlight the generalization benefits of post-hoc visual augmentations in adversarial scenarios.

Conclusion: BEVDilation通过优先考虑LiDAR信息并结合图像BEV特征的隐式引导，有效解决了空间不对齐问题，提升了3D物体检测的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Integrating LiDAR and camera information in the bird's eye view (BEV) representation has demonstrated its effectiveness in 3D object detection. However, because of the fundamental disparity in geometric accuracy between these sensors, indiscriminate fusion in previous methods often leads to degraded performance. In this paper, we propose BEVDilation, a novel LiDAR-centric framework that prioritizes LiDAR information in the fusion. By formulating image BEV features as implicit guidance rather than naive concatenation, our strategy effectively alleviates the spatial misalignment caused by image depth estimation errors. Furthermore, the image guidance can effectively help the LiDAR-centric paradigm to address the sparsity and semantic limitations of point clouds. Specifically, we propose a Sparse Voxel Dilation Block that mitigates the inherent point sparsity by densifying foreground voxels through image priors. Moreover, we introduce a Semantic-Guided BEV Dilation Block to enhance the LiDAR feature diffusion processing with image semantic guidance and long-range context capture. On the challenging nuScenes benchmark, BEVDilation achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. Importantly, our LiDAR-centric strategy demonstrates greater robustness to depth noise compared to naive fusion. The source code is available at https://github.com/gwenzhang/BEVDilation.

Abstract: This study explores the application of machine learning models, specifically a pretrained ResNet-50 model and a general SqueezeNet model, in diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) using chest X-ray images. TB, a persistent infectious disease affecting humanity for millennia, poses challenges in diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings. Traditional methods, such as sputum smear microscopy and culture, are inefficient, prompting the exploration of advanced technologies like deep learning and computer vision. The study utilized a dataset from Kaggle, consisting of 4,200 chest X-rays, to develop and compare the performance of the two machine learning models. Preprocessing involved data splitting, augmentation, and resizing to enhance training efficiency. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, were employed to assess model performance. Results showcase that the SqueezeNet achieved a loss of 32%, accuracy of 89%, precision of 98%, recall of 80%, and an F1 score of 87%. In contrast, the ResNet-50 model exhibited a loss of 54%, accuracy of 73%, precision of 88%, recall of 52%, and an F1 score of 65%. This study emphasizes the potential of machine learning in TB detection and possible implications for early identification and treatment initiation. The possibility of integrating such models into mobile devices expands their utility in areas lacking TB detection resources. However, despite promising results, the need for continued development of faster, smaller, and more accurate TB detection models remains crucial in contributing to the global efforts in combating TB.

TL;DR: U4D是一种不确定性感知的4D LiDAR世界建模框架，通过两阶段生成和时空混合块，提升了复杂区域的几何保真度和时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成框架在处理LiDAR序列时，往往对所有空间区域采用统一处理方式，忽视了真实场景中不同区域的不确定性差异，导致复杂或模糊区域出现伪影，限制了真实性和时间稳定性。

Method: U4D首先通过预训练的语义分割模型估计空间不确定性图，定位语义挑战区域；随后采用“难到易”的两阶段生成策略：第一阶段重建高熵区域的精细几何，第二阶段在学习的结构先验下合成剩余区域；并通过时空混合（MoST）块自适应融合时空表示以确保时间一致性。

Result: 实验表明，U4D生成的LiDAR序列具有更高的几何保真度和时间一致性。

Conclusion: U4D框架通过不确定性感知的生成方法，显著提升了4D LiDAR世界建模的几何保真度和时间一致性，为自动驾驶感知和模拟提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling dynamic 3D environments from LiDAR sequences is central to building reliable 4D worlds for autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing generative frameworks, however, often treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the varying uncertainty across real-world scenes. This uniform generation leads to artifacts in complex or ambiguous regions, limiting realism and temporal stability. In this work, we present U4D, an uncertainty-aware framework for 4D LiDAR world modeling. Our approach first estimates spatial uncertainty maps from a pretrained segmentation model to localize semantically challenging regions. It then performs generation in a "hard-to-easy" manner through two sequential stages: (1) uncertainty-region modeling, which reconstructs high-entropy regions with fine geometric fidelity, and (2) uncertainty-conditioned completion, which synthesizes the remaining areas under learned structural priors. To further ensure temporal coherence, U4D incorporates a mixture of spatio-temporal (MoST) block that adaptively fuses spatial and temporal representations during diffusion. Extensive experiments show that U4D produces geometrically faithful and temporally consistent LiDAR sequences, advancing the reliability of 4D world modeling for autonomous perception and simulation.

Conclusion: 提出的无地图轨迹预测算法在复杂交互场景中表现出色，验证了其在处理时空和频域信息方面的有效性。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is crucial for the reliability and safety of autonomous driving systems, yet it remains a challenging task in complex interactive scenarios. Existing methods often struggle to efficiently extract valuable scene information from redundant data, thereby reducing computational efficiency and prediction accuracy, especially when dealing with intricate agent interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel map-free trajectory prediction algorithm that achieves trajectory prediction across the temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. Specifically, in temporal information processing, We utilize a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to adaptively select critical frequency components. Concurrently, we extract these components and integrate multi-scale temporal features. Subsequently, a selective attention module is proposed to filter out redundant information in both temporal sequences and spatial interactions. Finally, we design a multimodal decoder. Under the supervision of patch-level and point-level losses, we obtain reasonable trajectory results. Experiments on Nuscences datasets demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm, validating its effectiveness in handling complex interactive scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在隐私和安全约束下无法访问模型参数和架构细节时，传统微调或适应方法受限的问题。

Method: SAGE通过风格转移构建多样化的源域风格表示，并自适应地融合这些风格线索，形成动态提示，无需修改模型内部。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，SAGE在隐私约束下表现优异。

Conclusion: SAGE框架在隐私约束条件下表现出色，不仅与现有最先进方法竞争，还在所有设置中优于全微调基线。

Abstract: Domain generalization for semantic segmentation aims to mitigate the degradation in model performance caused by domain shifts. However, in many real-world scenarios, we are unable to access the model parameters and architectural details due to privacy concerns and security constraints. Traditional fine-tuning or adaptation is hindered, leading to the demand for input-level strategies that can enhance generalization without modifying model weights. To this end, we propose a \textbf{S}tyle-\textbf{A}daptive \textbf{GE}neralization framework (\textbf{SAGE}), which improves the generalization of frozen models under privacy constraints. SAGE learns to synthesize visual prompts that implicitly align feature distributions across styles instead of directly fine-tuning the backbone. Specifically, we first utilize style transfer to construct a diverse style representation of the source domain, thereby learning a set of style characteristics that can cover a wide range of visual features. Then, the model adaptively fuses these style cues according to the visual context of each input, forming a dynamic prompt that harmonizes the image appearance without touching the interior of the model. Through this closed-loop design, SAGE effectively bridges the gap between frozen model invariance and the diversity of unseen domains. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAGE achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods under privacy constraints and outperforms full fine-tuning baselines in all settings.

Motivation: 实时无人机摄影测量对于灾害响应和动态数字孪生维护等时间关键型地理空间应用至关重要，但现有方法缺乏对实时3D重建质量的明确评估或提供指导性反馈以增强目标区域的图像采集。

Method: 该方法基于SfM on-the-fly，集成了三个模块：在线增量粗网格生成、在线网格质量评估与可操作指标、预测性路径规划以实现实时轨迹优化。

Result: 综合实验表明，该方法实现了近实时的现场重建与评估，同时提供了显著减少覆盖缺口和重复飞行成本的可操作反馈。

Conclusion: On-the-fly Feedback SfM 提供了一种从传统被动工作模式向更智能、自适应探索工作流程转变的替代方案，通过集成数据收集、处理、3D重建与评估以及在线反馈，显著减少了覆盖缺口和重复飞行成本。

Abstract: Compared with conventional offline UAV photogrammetry, real-time UAV photogrammetry is essential for time-critical geospatial applications such as disaster response and active digital-twin maintenance. However, most existing methods focus on processing captured images or sequential frames in real time, without explicitly evaluating the quality of the on-the-go 3D reconstruction or providing guided feedback to enhance image acquisition in the target area. This work presents On-the-fly Feedback SfM, an explore-and-exploit framework for real-time UAV photogrammetry, enabling iterative exploration of unseen regions and exploitation of already observed and reconstructed areas in near real time. Built upon SfM on-the-fly , the proposed method integrates three modules: (1) online incremental coarse-mesh generation for dynamically expanding sparse 3D point cloud; (2) online mesh quality assessment with actionable indicators; and (3) predictive path planning for on-the-fly trajectory refinement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves in-situ reconstruction and evaluation in near real time while providing actionable feedback that markedly reduces coverage gaps and re-flight costs. Via the integration of data collection, processing, 3D reconstruction and assessment, and online feedback, our on the-fly feedback SfM could be an alternative for the transition from traditional passive working mode to a more intelligent and adaptive exploration workflow. Code is now available at https://github.com/IRIS-LAB-whu/OntheflySfMFeedback.

TL;DR: FDTA通过空间、时间和身份三个适配器增强对象嵌入的区分性，显著提升多目标跟踪的关联准确性，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端多目标跟踪方法在检测性能上表现优异，但在关联准确性上不足，主要因为共享DETR架构生成的对象嵌入在帧间相似度过高，缺乏实例级区分和时空连续性优化。

Method: FDTA框架包含三个适配器：空间适配器（SA）集成深度感知线索以实现空间连续性，时间适配器（TA）聚合历史信息以建立时间依赖，身份适配器（IA）利用质量感知对比学习实现实例级区分。

Result: FDTA在DanceTrack、SportsMOT和BFT等多个挑战性MOT基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FDTA通过引入空间适配器（SA）、时间适配器（TA）和身份适配器（IA）三个互补视角的特征细化框架，显著提升了多目标跟踪（MOT）中的关联准确性，并在多个基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: End-to-end multi-object tracking (MOT) methods have recently achieved remarkable progress by unifying detection and association within a single framework. Despite their strong detection performance, these methods suffer from relatively low association accuracy. Through detailed analysis, we observe that object embeddings produced by the shared DETR architecture display excessively high inter-object similarity, as it emphasizes only category-level discrimination within single frames. In contrast, tracking requires instance-level distinction across frames with spatial and temporal continuity, for which current end-to-end approaches insufficiently optimize object embeddings. To address this, we introduce FDTA (From Detection to Association), an explicit feature refinement framework that enhances object discriminativeness across three complementary perspectives. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial Adapter (SA) to integrate depth-aware cues for spatial continuity, a Temporal Adapter (TA) to aggregate historical information for temporal dependencies, and an Identity Adapter (IA) to leverage quality-aware contrastive learning for instance-level separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FDTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging MOT benchmarks, including DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BFT, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed discriminative embedding enhancement strategy.

Motivation: 4D雷达在恶劣条件下的环境感知潜力显著，但雷达语义分割的进展受限于开源数据集和标签的稀缺性。RaDelft数据集仅提供LiDAR标注且无公开代码生成雷达标签，限制了可重复性和下游研究。

Method: 通过将雷达点云投影到基于摄像头的语义分割中并应用空间聚类，生成准确的雷达点云标签，无需依赖人工标注。

Result: 提出的摄像头引导雷达标记流程生成的标签显著提高了雷达标签的准确性，并建立了可重复的框架。

Conclusion: 本研究建立了一个可重复的框架，使研究社区能够训练和评估标记的4D雷达数据，并量化了不同雾度对雷达标记性能的影响。

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D radar highlight its potential for robust environment perception under adverse conditions, yet progress in radar semantic segmentation remains constrained by the scarcity of open source datasets and labels. The RaDelft data set, although seminal, provides only LiDAR annotations and no public code to generate radar labels, limiting reproducibility and downstream research. In this work, we reproduce the numerical results of the RaDelft group and demonstrate that a camera-guided radar labeling pipeline can generate accurate labels for radar point clouds without relying on human annotations. By projecting radar point clouds into camera-based semantic segmentation and applying spatial clustering, we create labels that significantly enhance the accuracy of radar labels. These results establish a reproducible framework that allows the research community to train and evaluate the labeled 4D radar data. In addition, we study and quantify how different fog levels affect the radar labeling performance.

Method: Skywork-R1V4是一个30B参数的多模态代理模型，通过监督微调在少于30,000条高质量、规划-执行一致的轨迹上进行训练，并通过逐步一致性过滤验证。

Result: Skywork-R1V4在感知和多模态搜索基准测试中达到最先进水平，在MMSearch和FVQA上分别得分66.1和67.2，超过Gemini 2.5 Flash的所有11项指标。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，通过精心设计的监督学习，无需依赖强化学习，即可实现复杂的多模态智能代理系统。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in multimodal agentic systems, existing approaches often treat image manipulation and web search as disjoint capabilities, rely heavily on costly reinforcement learning, and lack planning grounded in real tool-execution traces. To address these limitations, we present Skywork-R1V4, a 30B (A3B) parameter multimodal agentic model that unifies multimodal planning, active image manipulation ("thinking with images"), deep multimodal search, and, most critically, interleaved reasoning that dynamically alternates between visual operations and external knowledge retrieval. Trained solely via supervised fine-tuning on fewer than 30,000 high-quality, planning-execution-consistent trajectories and validated through stepwise consistency filtering, Skywork-R1V4 achieves state-of-the-art results across perception and multimodal search benchmarks: it scores 66.1 on MMSearch and 67.2 on FVQA, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash on all 11 metrics. Skywork-R1V4 exhibits emergent long-horizon reasoning at inference time, successfully orchestrating more than 10 tool calls to solve complex, multi-step tasks. Our results demonstrate that sophisticated agentic multimodal intelligence can be achieved through carefully curated supervised learning alone, without any reliance on reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Nav-R^2框架通过结构化的Chain-of-Thought推理和Similarity-Aware Memory，显著提升了开放词汇设置下的目标导航性能，实现了对未见物体的高效定位。

Abstract: Object-goal navigation in open-vocabulary settings requires agents to locate novel objects in unseen environments, yet existing approaches suffer from opaque decision-making processes and low success rate on locating unseen objects. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-$R^2$, a framework that explicitly models two critical types of relationships, target-environment modeling and environment-action planning, through structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning coupled with a Similarity-Aware Memory. We construct a Nav$R^2$-CoT dataset that teaches the model to perceive the environment, focus on target-related objects in the surrounding context and finally make future action plans. Our SA-Mem preserves the most target-relevant and current observation-relevant features from both temporal and semantic perspectives by compressing video frames and fusing historical observations, while introducing no additional parameters. Compared to previous methods, Nav-R^2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in localizing unseen objects through a streamlined and efficient pipeline, avoiding overfitting to seen object categories while maintaining real-time inference at 2Hz.

Conclusion: WISE框架通过多智能体辩论（MAD）显著提升了多模态任务的准确率，比现有MAD设置和方法高出2-7%。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) are trained on diverse corpora and tasks, leading them to develop complementary strengths. Multi-agent debate (MAD) has emerged as a popular way to leverage these strengths for robust reasoning, though it has mostly been applied to language-only tasks, leaving its efficacy on multimodal problems underexplored. In this paper, we study MAD for solving vision-and-language reasoning problems. Our setup enables generalizing the debate protocol with heterogeneous experts that possess single- and multi-modal capabilities. To this end, we present Weighted Iterative Society-of-Experts (WISE), a generalized and modular MAD framework that partitions the agents into Solvers, that generate solutions, and Reflectors, that verify correctness, assign weights, and provide natural language feedback. To aggregate the agents' solutions across debate rounds, while accounting for variance in their responses and the feedback weights, we present a modified Dawid-Skene algorithm for post-processing that integrates our two-stage debate model. We evaluate WISE on SMART-840, VisualPuzzles, EvoChart-QA, and a new SMART-840++ dataset with programmatically generated problem instances of controlled difficulty. Our results show that WISE consistently improves accuracy by 2-7% over the state-of-the-art MAD setups and aggregation methods across diverse multimodal tasks and LLM configurations.

Conclusion: MitUNet 提供了一种在自动化3D重建流程中数据准备的强大工具，能够生成具有高边界精度的结构正确掩码。

Abstract: Automatic 3D reconstruction of indoor spaces from 2D floor plans requires high-precision semantic segmentation of structural elements, particularly walls. However, existing methods optimized for standard metrics often struggle to detect thin structural components and yield masks with irregular boundaries, lacking the geometric precision required for subsequent vectorization. To address this issue, we introduce MitUNet, a hybrid neural network architecture specifically designed for wall segmentation tasks in the context of 3D modeling. In MitUNet, we utilize a hierarchical Mix-Transformer encoder to capture global context and a U-Net decoder enhanced with scSE attention blocks for precise boundary recovery. Furthermore, we propose an optimization strategy based on the Tversky loss function to effectively balance precision and recall. By fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the loss function, we prioritize the suppression of false positive noise along wall boundaries while maintaining high sensitivity to thin structures. Our experiments on the public CubiCasa5k dataset and a proprietary regional dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures the generation of structurally correct masks with high boundary accuracy, outperforming standard single-task models. MitUNet provides a robust tool for data preparation in automated 3D reconstruction pipelines.

Conclusion: GuiDG框架通过分步训练领域专家模型并引入跨模态注意力模块，显著提升了视觉语言模型在下游任务中的领域泛化能力，同时保持了高效性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) has emerged as a prevalent paradigm for downstream adaptation, yet it faces a critical trade-off between domain specificity and domain generalization (DG) ability. Current methods typically fine-tune a universal model on the entire dataset, which potentially compromises the ability to generalize to unseen domains. To fill this gap, we provide a theoretical understanding of the generalization ability for VLM fine-tuning, which reveals that training multiple parameter-efficient expert models on partitioned source domains leads to better generalization than fine-tuning a universal model. Inspired by this finding, we propose a two-step domain-expert-Guided DG (GuiDG) framework. GuiDG first employs prompt tuning to obtain source domain experts, then introduces a Cross-Modal Attention module to guide the fine-tuning of the vision encoder via adaptive expert integration. To better evaluate few-shot DG, we construct ImageNet-DG from ImageNet and its variants. Extensive experiments on standard DG benchmarks and ImageNet-DG demonstrate that GuiDG improves upon state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: 强化学习方法在GUI导航中展现出优势，并为构建更强大、更具泛化能力的GUI代理提供了实用指导。

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Vision Language Models, the focus of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent tasks shifts from single-screen tasks to complex screen navigation challenges. However, real-world GUI environments, such as PC software and mobile Apps, are often complex and proprietary, making it difficult to obtain the comprehensive environment information needed for agent training and evaluation. This limitation hinders systematic investigation and benchmarking of agent navigation capabilities. To address this limitation, we introduce GUI Exploration Lab, a simulation environment engine for GUI agent navigation research that enables flexible definition and composition of screens, icons, and navigation graphs, while providing full access to environment information for comprehensive agent training and evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we find that supervised fine-tuning enables effective memorization of fundamental knowledge, serving as a crucial foundation for subsequent training. Building on this, single-turn reinforcement learning further enhances generalization to unseen scenarios. Finally, multi-turn reinforcement learning encourages the development of exploration strategies through interactive trial and error, leading to further improvements in screen navigation performance. We validate our methods on both static and interactive benchmarks, demonstrating that our findings generalize effectively to real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate the advantages of reinforcement learning approaches in GUI navigation and offer practical guidance for building more capable and generalizable GUI agents.

Method: WorldMM是一种新型多模态记忆代理，构建并检索三种互补记忆：跨多时间尺度的事件索引（情景记忆）、持续更新的高层概念知识（语义记忆）和保留场景细节信息的视觉记忆。推理时，自适应检索代理基于查询迭代选择最相关的记忆源和多时间粒度。

Conclusion: WorldMM显著优于现有基线方法，在五个长视频问答基准测试中平均性能提升8.4%，证明了其在长视频推理中的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in video large language models have demonstrated strong capabilities in understanding short clips. However, scaling them to hours- or days-long videos remains highly challenging due to limited context capacity and the loss of critical visual details during abstraction. Existing memory-augmented methods mitigate this by leveraging textual summaries of video segments, yet they heavily rely on text and fail to utilize visual evidence when reasoning over complex scenes. Moreover, retrieving from fixed temporal scales further limits their flexibility in capturing events that span variable durations. To address this, we introduce WorldMM, a novel multimodal memory agent that constructs and retrieves from multiple complementary memories, encompassing both textual and visual representations. WorldMM comprises three types of memory: episodic memory indexes factual events across multiple temporal scales, semantic memory continuously updates high-level conceptual knowledge, and visual memory preserves detailed information about scenes. During inference, an adaptive retrieval agent iteratively selects the most relevant memory source and leverages multiple temporal granularities based on the query, continuing until it determines that sufficient information has been gathered.

Abstract: As a representative optic degenerative condition, glaucoma has been a threat to millions due to its irreversibility and severe impact on human vision fields. Mainly characterized by dimmed and blurred visions, or peripheral vision loss, glaucoma is well known to occur due to damages in the optic nerve from increased intraocular pressure (IOP) or neovascularization within the retina. Traditionally, most glaucoma related works and clinical diagnosis focused on detecting these damages in the optic nerve by using patient data from perimetry tests, optic papilla inspections and tonometer-based IOP measurements. Recently, with advancements in computer vision AI models, such as VGG16 or Vision Transformers (ViT), AI-automatized glaucoma detection and optic cup segmentation based on retinal fundus images or OCT recently exhibited significant performance in aiding conventional diagnosis with high performance. However, current AI-driven glaucoma detection approaches still have significant room for improvement in terms of reliability, excessive parameter usage, possibility of spurious correlation within detection, and limitations in applications to intervention analysis or clinical simulations. Thus, this research introduced a novel causal representation driven glaucoma detection model: LightHCG, an extremely lightweight Convolutional VAE-based latent glaucoma representation model that can consider the true causality among glaucoma-related physical factors within the optic nerve region. Using HSIC-based latent space disentanglement and Graph Autoencoder based unsupervised causal representation learning, LightHCG not only exhibits higher performance in classifying glaucoma with 93~99% less weights, but also enhances the possibility of AI-driven intervention analysis, compared to existing advanced vision models such as InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 or VGG16.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出结合动量与蒸馏的方法，提升医疗VLMs的训练效率和性能，在少样本适应中AUC-ROC超90%，检索任务提升2-3%，仅需单GPU。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗健康领域获取详细标注具有挑战性，因此需要稳健的视觉-语言模型（VLMs）。对比学习（CL）是训练VLMs的关键范式，但需要大批量才能有效学习，计算成本高且通常仅限于资源充足的机构。此外，医疗数据有限，需在训练中优先从数据和模型中提取知识以提高性能。

Abstract: In medical healthcare, obtaining detailed annotations is challenging, highlighting the need for robust Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Pretrained VLMs enable fine-tuning on small datasets or zero-shot inference, achieving performance comparable to task-specific models. Contrastive learning (CL) is a key paradigm for training VLMs but inherently requires large batch sizes for effective learning, making it computationally demanding and often limited to well-resourced institutions. Moreover, with limited data in healthcare, it is important to prioritize knowledge extraction from both data and models during training to improve performance. Therefore, we focus on leveraging the momentum method combined with distillation to simultaneously address computational efficiency and knowledge exploitation. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) leveraging momentum self-distillation to enhance multimodal learning, and (2) integrating momentum mechanisms with gradient accumulation to enlarge the effective batch size without increasing resource consumption. Our method attains competitive performance with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in zero-shot classification, while providing a substantial boost in the few-shot adaption, achieving over 90% AUC-ROC and improving retrieval tasks by 2-3%. Importantly, our method achieves high training efficiency with a single GPU while maintaining reasonable training time. Our approach aims to advance efficient multimodal learning by reducing resource requirements while improving performance over SOTA methods. The implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/phphuc612/MSD .

Method: BOLT框架通过提取正交、任务导向的光谱基并在该子空间内进行适应，重用现有微调模型。离线阶段收集多个任务向量的主要奇异方向并按层正交化形成可重用基；在线阶段冻结这些基并仅训练每层一小部分对角系数，实现参数高效的微调。

Result: BOLT在实验中相比常见参数高效微调基线和代表性元学习初始化，实现了稳健性能。

Conclusion: 约束适应于任务导向的正交子空间为未见任务转移提供了有效替代方案。

Abstract: Adapting large pre-trained models to unseen tasks under tight data and compute budgets remains challenging. Meta-learning approaches explicitly learn good initializations, but they require an additional meta-training phase over many tasks, incur high training cost, and can be unstable. At the same time, the number of task-specific pre-trained models continues to grow, yet the question of how to transfer them to new tasks with minimal additional training remains relatively underexplored. We propose BOLT (Basis-Oriented Low-rank Transfer), a framework that reuses existing fine-tuned models not by merging weights, but instead by extracting an orthogonal, task-informed spectral basis and adapting within that subspace. In the offline phase, BOLT collects dominant singular directions from multiple task vectors and orthogonalizes them per layer to form reusable bases. In the online phase, we freeze these bases and train only a small set of diagonal coefficients per layer for the new task, yielding a rank-controlled update with very few trainable parameters. This design provides (i) a strong, training-free initialization for unseen tasks, obtained by pooling source-task coefficients, along with a lightweight rescaling step while leveraging the shared orthogonal bases, and (ii) a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) path that, in our experiments, achieves robust performance compared to common PEFT baselines as well as a representative meta-learned initialization. Our results show that constraining adaptation to a task-informed orthogonal subspace provides an effective alternative for unseen-task transfer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SNN在时序信息建模上表现不足，限制了其在复杂任务中的表达能力。

Method: 提出TDE（Temporal Dynamics Enhancer），包含Spiking Encoder（SE）和Attention Gating Module（AGM），并进一步提出Spike-Driven Attention（SDA）以减少能耗。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC和EvDET200K数据集上分别达到57.7%和47.6%的mAP50-95分数，SDA能耗仅为传统注意力模块的0.240倍。

Conclusion: TDE通过增强SNN的时序信息建模能力，显著提升了其在复杂任务（如目标检测）中的表现，并在能耗方面实现了优化。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their brain-inspired spatiotemporal dynamics and spike-driven computation, have emerged as promising energy-efficient alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, existing SNNs typically replicate inputs directly or aggregate them into frames at fixed intervals. Such strategies lead to neurons receiving nearly identical stimuli across time steps, severely limiting the model's expressive power, particularly in complex tasks like object detection. In this work, we propose the Temporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE) to strengthen SNNs' capacity for temporal information modeling. TDE consists of two modules: a Spiking Encoder (SE) that generates diverse input stimuli across time steps, and an Attention Gating Module (AGM) that guides the SE generation based on inter-temporal dependencies. Moreover, to eliminate the high-energy multiplication operations introduced by the AGM, we propose a Spike-Driven Attention (SDA) to reduce attention-related energy consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TDE can be seamlessly integrated into existing SNN-based detectors and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving mAP50-95 scores of 57.7% on the static PASCAL VOC dataset and 47.6% on the neuromorphic EvDET200K dataset. In terms of energy consumption, the SDA consumes only 0.240 times the energy of conventional attention modules.

Motivation: 现有的3D布局估计模型主要基于简单的单房间或单楼层合成数据集训练，无法处理大型多层建筑，且需分割场景，丢失全局空间上下文。

Method: 提出了MultiFloor3D，一种无需训练的基线方法，利用最新的场景理解技术。

Conclusion: HouseLayout3D和MultiFloor3D的提出为全建筑尺度布局估计提供了新的基准和基线方法，突显了该领域进一步研究的必要性。

Abstract: Current 3D layout estimation models are primarily trained on synthetic datasets containing simple single room or single floor environments. As a consequence, they cannot natively handle large multi floor buildings and require scenes to be split into individual floors before processing, which removes global spatial context that is essential for reasoning about structures such as staircases that connect multiple levels. In this work, we introduce HouseLayout3D, a real world benchmark designed to support progress toward full building scale layout estimation, including multiple floors and architecturally intricate spaces. We also present MultiFloor3D, a simple training free baseline that leverages recent scene understanding methods and already outperforms existing 3D layout estimation models on both our benchmark and prior datasets, highlighting the need for further research in this direction.

Conclusion: ClusterStyle框架通过聚类原型有效建模了风格多样性，结合SMA适配器增强了文本到动作生成的风格特征整合，实验证明其在风格化动作生成和风格迁移任务中优于现有模型。

Abstract: Existing stylized motion generation models have shown their remarkable ability to understand specific style information from the style motion, and insert it into the content motion. However, capturing intra-style diversity, where a single style should correspond to diverse motion variations, remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based framework, ClusterStyle, to address this limitation. Instead of learning an unstructured embedding from each style motion, we leverage a set of prototypes to effectively model diverse style patterns across motions belonging to the same style category. We consider two types of style diversity: global-level diversity among style motions of the same category, and local-level diversity within the temporal dynamics of motion sequences. These components jointly shape two structured style embedding spaces, i.e., global and local, optimized via alignment with non-learnable prototype anchors. Furthermore, we augment the pretrained text-to-motion generation model with the Stylistic Modulation Adapter (SMA) to integrate the style features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in stylized motion generation and motion style transfer.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖高质量的人工标注或昂贵专有模型，且忽视了感知与推理的联合优化，因此需要一种更高效的自训练框架。

Method: 提出了一个名为See-Think-Learn (STL)的自训练框架，通过结构化推理模板（先提取视觉属性再引导推理）和负理性（解释错误答案的原因）来联合提升感知和推理能力。

Result: 实验表明STL在多个领域均优于仅基于答案或自生成推理的基线模型，且定性分析证实其理性质量高。

Conclusion: STL框架为提升视觉语言模型的多模态推理能力提供了一种成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in integrating visual perception with language understanding. However, effective multimodal reasoning requires both accurate perception and robust reasoning, and weakness in either limits the performance of VLMs. Prior efforts to enhance reasoning often depend on high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data, obtained via labor-intensive human annotations, costly proprietary models, or self-training methods that overlook perception. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective self-training framework called See-Think-Learn (STL). At its core, STL introduces a structured reasoning template that encourages the model to see before thinking, first extracting visual attributes in textual form, then using them to guide reasoning. The framework jointly improves perception and reasoning by having the model generate and learn from its own structured rationales in a self-training loop. Furthermore, we augment the training data with negative rationales, i.e. explanations that justify why certain answer choices are incorrect, to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between correct and misleading responses. This fosters more discriminative and robust learning. Experiments across diverse domains show that STL consistently outperforms baselines trained directly only on answers or self-generated reasoning, while qualitative analysis confirms the high quality of its rationales. STL thus provides a cost-effective solution to enhance multimodal reasoning ability of VLMs.

Conclusion: 跨模态联合训练（音频-视频）不仅能提升同步性，还能显著提高视频生成质量，尤其是在复杂运动场景中。这表明音频作为特权信号有助于模型学习视觉事件与声学后果之间的因果关系，从而规范化视频动态。

Abstract: Recent audio-video generative systems suggest that coupling modalities benefits not only audio-video synchrony but also the video modality itself. We pose a fundamental question: Does audio-video joint denoising training improve video generation, even when we only care about video quality? To study this, we introduce a parameter-efficient Audio-Video Full DiT (AVFullDiT) architecture that leverages pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) and text-to-audio (T2A) modules for joint denoising. We train (i) a T2AV model with AVFullDiT and (ii) a T2V-only counterpart under identical settings. Our results provide the first systematic evidence that audio-video joint denoising can deliver more than synchrony. We observe consistent improvements on challenging subsets featuring large and object contact motions. We hypothesize that predicting audio acts as a privileged signal, encouraging the model to internalize causal relationships between visual events and their acoustic consequences (e.g., collision $\times$ impact sound), which in turn regularizes video dynamics. Our findings suggest that cross-modal co-training is a promising approach to developing stronger, more physically grounded world models. Code and dataset will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 3DSPMR方法在顺序EQA和EMN任务上实现了显著的性能提升，验证了将几何信息融入MLLM的有效性。

Abstract: Existing research on indoor embodied tasks typically requires agents to actively explore unknown environments and reason about the scene to achieve a specific goal. However, when deployed in real life, agents often face sequential tasks, where each new sub-task follows the completion of the previous one, and certain sub-tasks may be infeasible, such as searching for a non-existent object. Compared with the single-task setting, the core challenge lies in reusing spatial knowledge accumulated from previous explorations to support subsequent reasoning and exploration. In this work, we investigate this underexplored yet practically significant embodied AI challenge. To evaluate this challenge, we introduce SEER-Bench, a new Sequential Embodied Exploration and Reasoning Benchmark encompassing encompassing two classic embodied tasks: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) and Embodied Multi-modal Navigation (EMN). Building on SEER-Bench, we propose 3DSPMR, a 3D SPatial Memory Reasoning approach that exploits relational, visual, and geometric cues from explored regions to augment Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for reasoning and exploration in sequential embodied tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly incorporate geometric information into MLLM-based spatial understanding and reasoning. Extensive experiments verify that 3DSPMR achieves substantial performance gains on both sequential EQA and EMN tasks.

Conclusion: TGDD通过动态对齐模型训练轨迹中的特征分布，显著提升了合成数据的表达能力和下游任务性能，且在效率和性能之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses large datasets into compact synthetic ones to reduce storage and computational costs. Among various approaches, distribution matching (DM)-based methods have attracted attention for their high efficiency. However, they often overlook the evolution of feature representations during training, which limits the expressiveness of synthetic data and weakens downstream performance. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory Guided Dataset Distillation (TGDD), which reformulates distribution matching as a dynamic alignment process along the model's training trajectory. At each training stage, TGDD captures evolving semantics by aligning the feature distribution between the synthetic and original dataset. Meanwhile, it introduces a distribution constraint regularization to reduce class overlap. This design helps synthetic data preserve both semantic diversity and representativeness, improving performance in downstream tasks. Without additional optimization overhead, TGDD achieves a favorable balance between performance and efficiency. Experiments on ten datasets demonstrate that TGDD achieves state-of-the-art performance, notably a 5.0% accuracy gain on high-resolution benchmarks.

Abstract: Video world models have attracted significant attention for their ability to produce high-fidelity future visual observations conditioned on past observations and navigation actions. Temporally- and spatially-consistent, long-term world modeling has been a long-standing problem, unresolved with even recent state-of-the-art models, due to the prohibitively expensive computational costs for long-context inputs. In this paper, we propose WorldPack, a video world model with efficient compressed memory, which significantly improves spatial consistency, fidelity, and quality in long-term generation despite much shorter context length. Our compressed memory consists of trajectory packing and memory retrieval; trajectory packing realizes high context efficiency, and memory retrieval maintains the consistency in rollouts and helps long-term generations that require spatial reasoning. Our performance is evaluated with LoopNav, a benchmark on Minecraft, specialized for the evaluation of long-term consistency, and we verify that WorldPack notably outperforms strong state-of-the-art models.

While recent Gaussian splatting approaches have advanced real-time endoscopic reconstruction, existing implementations often depend on non-commercial derivatives, limiting deployability.

Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality with strong speed-accuracy trade-offs suitable for intra-operative use.

Conclusion: UCAgents框架通过结构化证据审核和单向收敛机制，有效平衡了视觉证据提取与文本干扰，显著提升了医学视觉问答的准确性和计算效率，适合实际临床部署。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical diagnosis, yet suffer from reasoning detachment, where linguistically fluent explanations drift from verifiable image evidence, undermining clinical trust. Recent multi-agent frameworks simulate Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) debates to mitigate single-model bias, but open-ended discussions amplify textual noise and computational cost while failing to anchor reasoning to visual evidence, the cornerstone of medical decision-making. We propose UCAgents, a hierarchical multi-agent framework enforcing unidirectional convergence through structured evidence auditing. Inspired by clinical workflows, UCAgents forbids position changes and limits agent interactions to targeted evidence verification, suppressing rhetorical drift while amplifying visual signal extraction. In UCAgents, a one-round inquiry discussion is introduced to uncover potential risks of visual-textual misalignment. This design jointly constrains visual ambiguity and textual noise, a dual-noise bottleneck that we formalize via information theory. Extensive experiments on four medical VQA benchmarks show UCAgents achieves superior accuracy (71.3% on PathVQA, +6.0% over state-of-the-art) with 87.7% lower token cost, the evaluation results further confirm that UCAgents strikes a balance between uncovering more visual evidence and avoiding confusing textual interference. These results demonstrate that UCAgents exhibits both diagnostic reliability and computational efficiency critical for real-world clinical deployment.

Conclusion: 3D-SLIM通过自适应注意力掩码策略显著提升了3D场景-语言任务中的性能，且无需额外参数或架构修改。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene-language understanding have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D reasoning by transferring their general reasoning ability to 3D multi-modal contexts. However, existing methods typically adopt standard decoders from language modeling, which rely on a causal attention mask. This design introduces two fundamental conflicts in 3D scene understanding: sequential bias among order-agnostic 3D objects and restricted object-instruction attention, hindering task-specific reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Spatial Language Instruction Mask (3D-SLIM), an effective masking strategy that replaces the causal mask with an adaptive attention mask tailored to the spatial structure of 3D scenes. Our 3D-SLIM introduces two key components: a Geometry-adaptive Mask that constrains attention based on spatial density rather than token order, and an Instruction-aware Mask that enables object tokens to directly access instruction context. This design allows the model to process objects based on their spatial relationships while being guided by the user's task. 3D-SLIM is simple, requires no architectural modifications, and adds no extra parameters, yet it yields substantial performance improvements across diverse 3D scene-language tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLM baselines validate its effectiveness and underscore the critical role of decoder design in 3D multi-modal reasoning.

Abstract: While diffusion model for audio-driven avatar video generation have achieved notable process in synthesizing long sequences with natural audio-visual synchronization and identity consistency, the generation of music-performance videos with camera motions remains largely unexplored. We present YingVideo-MV, the first cascaded framework for music-driven long-video generation. Our approach integrates audio semantic analysis, an interpretable shot planning module (MV-Director), temporal-aware diffusion Transformer architectures, and long-sequence consistency modeling to enable automatic synthesis of high-quality music performance videos from audio signals. We construct a large-scale Music-in-the-Wild Dataset by collecting web data to support the achievement of diverse, high-quality results. Observing that existing long-video generation methods lack explicit camera motion control, we introduce a camera adapter module that embeds camera poses into latent noise. To enhance continulity between clips during long-sequence inference, we further propose a time-aware dynamic window range strategy that adaptively adjust denoising ranges based on audio embedding. Comprehensive benchmark tests demonstrate that YingVideo-MV achieves outstanding performance in generating coherent and expressive music videos, and enables precise music-motion-camera synchronization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学图像分割中的测试时间适应评估在模态覆盖、任务多样性和方法一致性方面存在局限，需要更全面的基准。

Method: MedSeg-TTA 评估了20种代表性适应方法，涵盖7种成像模态，采用统一的数据预处理、骨干网络配置和测试时间协议。

Conclusion: MedSeg-TTA 提供了一个标准化基准，用于评估医学图像分割中的测试时间适应方法，强调了在临床部署中方法选择的重要性。

Abstract: Test time Adaptation is a promising approach for mitigating domain shift in medical image segmentation; however, current evaluations remain limited in terms of modality coverage, task diversity, and methodological consistency. We present MedSeg-TTA, a comprehensive benchmark that examines twenty representative adaptation methods across seven imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, ultrasound, pathology, dermoscopy, OCT, and chest X-ray, under fully unified data preprocessing, backbone configuration, and test time protocols. The benchmark encompasses four significant adaptation paradigms: Input-level Transformation, Feature-level Alignment, Output-level Regularization, and Prior Estimation, enabling the first systematic cross-modality comparison of their reliability and applicability. The results show that no single paradigm performs best in all conditions. Input-level methods are more stable under mild appearance shifts. Feature-level and Output-level methods offer greater advantages in boundary-related metrics, whereas prior-based methods exhibit strong modality dependence. Several methods degrade significantly under large inter-center and inter-device shifts, which highlights the importance of principled method selection for clinical deployment. MedSeg-TTA provides standardized datasets, validated implementations, and a public leaderboard, establishing a rigorous foundation for future research on robust, clinically reliable test-time adaptation.

Result: 在OmniDocBench上达到最先进性能，在XDocParse基准上领先竞争对手7.4分。

Conclusion: dots.ocr在统一框架内联合学习三个核心任务，展现了卓越的性能，尤其在多语言能力上表现突出。

Abstract: Document Layout Parsing serves as a critical gateway for Artificial Intelligence (AI) to access and interpret the world's vast stores of structured knowledge. This process,which encompasses layout detection, text recognition, and relational understanding, is particularly crucial for empowering next-generation Vision-Language Models. Current methods, however, rely on fragmented, multi-stage pipelines that suffer from error propagation and fail to leverage the synergies of joint training. In this paper, we introduce dots.ocr, a single Vision-Language Model that, for the first time, demonstrates the advantages of jointly learning three core tasks within a unified, end-to-end framework. This is made possible by a highly scalable data engine that synthesizes a vast multilingual corpus, empowering the model to deliver robust performance across a wide array of tasks, encompassing diverse languages, layouts, and domains. The efficacy of our unified paradigm is validated by state-of-the-art performance on the comprehensive OmniDocBench. Furthermore, to catalyze research in global document intelligence, we introduce XDocParse, a challenging new benchmark spanning 126 languages. On this testbed, dots.ocr establishes a powerful new baseline, outperforming the next-best competitor by a remarkable +7.4 point margin and proving its unparalleled multilingual capabilities.

Motivation: 自回归模型与地理空间理解的并行性质结构上不匹配，限制了结构化且连贯输出的生成，因此需要挑战这一范式。

Method: 引入了GeoDiT，这是首个为地理空间领域量身定制的基于扩散的视觉语言模型，通过并行细化过程实现整体、从粗到细的合成。

Result: GeoDiT在需要结构化、以对象为中心输出的基准测试中建立了新的最先进水平，显著提升了图像描述、视觉定位和多对象检测任务的性能。

Conclusion: GeoDiT通过将生成过程与地理空间数据的固有结构对齐，验证了在复杂地理空间分析中实现卓越性能的关键。

Abstract: Autoregressive models are structurally misaligned with the inherently parallel nature of geospatial understanding, forcing a rigid sequential narrative onto scenes and fundamentally hindering the generation of structured and coherent outputs. We challenge this paradigm by reframing geospatial generation as a parallel refinement process, enabling a holistic, coarse-to-fine synthesis that resolves all semantic elements simultaneously. To operationalize this, we introduce GeoDiT, the first diffusion-based vision-language model tailored for the geospatial domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoDiT establishes a new state-of-the-art on benchmarks requiring structured, object-centric outputs. It achieves significant gains in image captioning, visual grounding, and multi-object detection, precisely the tasks where autoregressive models falter. Our work validates that aligning the generative process with the data's intrinsic structure is key to unlocking superior performance in complex geospatial analysis.

Motivation: 单图像超分辨率（SISR）在计算机视觉中仍具挑战性，探索如何利用Vision Transformer（ViT）和自监督学习提升性能。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：首先通过着色任务进行自监督预训练，学习通用视觉表示；随后调整模型进行4倍超分辨率，通过预测高频残差图像简化残差学习。

Result: 在DIV2K基准数据集上，ViT-SR取得了SSIM 0.712和PSNR 22.90 dB的优异结果。

Conclusion: ViT-SR通过两阶段训练策略和自监督预训练展示了在单图像超分辨率任务中的有效性，未来可能通过更大的ViT架构或其他预训练任务进一步提升性能。

Abstract: In computer vision, Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) is still a difficult problem. We present ViT-SR, a new technique to improve the performance of a Vision Transformer (ViT) employing a two-stage training strategy. In our method, the model learns rich, generalizable visual representations from the data itself through a self-supervised pretraining phase on a colourization task. The pre-trained model is then adjusted for 4x super-resolution. By predicting the addition of a high-frequency residual image to an initial bicubic interpolation, this design simplifies residual learning. ViT-SR, trained and evaluated on the DIV2K benchmark dataset, achieves an impressive SSIM of 0.712 and PSNR of 22.90 dB. These results demonstrate the efficacy of our two-stage approach and highlight the potential of self-supervised pre-training for complex image restoration tasks. Further improvements may be possible with larger ViT architectures or alternative pretext tasks.

Abstract: The emergence of large vision-language models (VLMs) has significantly enhanced the efficiency and flexibility of geospatial interpretation. However, general-purpose VLMs remain suboptimal for remote sensing (RS) tasks. Existing geospatial VLMs typically adopt a unified modeling strategy and struggle to differentiate between task types and interpretation granularities, limiting their ability to balance local detail perception and global contextual understanding. In this paper, we present SkyMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model tailored for multimodal, multi-task RS interpretation. SkyMoE employs an adaptive router that generates task- and granularity-aware routing instructions, enabling specialized large language model experts to handle diverse sub-tasks. To further promote expert decoupling and granularity sensitivity, we introduce a context-disentangled augmentation strategy that creates contrastive pairs between local and global features, guiding experts toward level-specific representation learning. We also construct MGRS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple RS interpretation tasks and granularity levels, to evaluate generalization in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments on 21 public datasets demonstrate that SkyMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance across tasks, validating its adaptability, scalability, and superior multi-granularity understanding in remote sensing.

Motivation: 零样本AC/AS在工业检测和医学影像中日益重要，但现有方法存在一致异常导致的偏差问题。

Method: 通过分析预训练Vision Transformers的统计和几何行为，提出了相似性缩放和邻居烧毁现象，并基于此设计了CoDeGraph框架。此外，还提出了无训练的3D医学影像标记化策略。

Result: CoDeGraph有效抑制了一致异常的影响，并在3D医学影像中实现了真正的零样本异常检测。

Conclusion: 本论文为零样本异常分类和分割（AC/AS）问题提供了理论理解和实用解决方案，包括CoDeGraph框架和3D医学影像的零样本检测流程。

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly classification and segmentation (AC/AS) aim to detect anomalous samples and regions without any training data, a capability increasingly crucial in industrial inspection and medical imaging. This dissertation aims to investigate the core challenges of zero-shot AC/AS and presents principled solutions rooted in theory and algorithmic design.
  We first formalize the problem of consistent anomalies, a failure mode in which recurring similar anomalies systematically bias distance-based methods. By analyzing the statistical and geometric behavior of patch representations from pre-trained Vision Transformers, we identify two key phenomena - similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout - that describe how relationships among normal patches change with and without consistent anomalies in settings characterized by highly similar objects.
  We then introduce CoDeGraph, a graph-based framework for filtering consistent anomalies built on the similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout phenomena. Through multi-stage graph construction, community detection, and structured refinement, CoDeGraph effectively suppresses the influence of consistent anomalies.
  Next, we extend this framework to 3D medical imaging by proposing a training-free, computationally efficient volumetric tokenization strategy for MRI data. This enables a genuinely zero-shot 3D anomaly detection pipeline and shows that volumetric anomaly segmentation is achievable without any 3D training samples.
  Finally, we bridge batch-based and text-based zero-shot methods by demonstrating that CoDeGraph-derived pseudo-masks can supervise prompt-driven vision-language models. Together, this dissertation provides theoretical understanding and practical solutions for the zero-shot AC/AS problem.

Conclusion: Noisy Query Tokens和VAE分支的引入有效解决了任务泛化崩溃问题，实现了跨任务的稳定持续学习。

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has highlighted the challenge of efficiently bridging pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Diffusion Models. While methods using a fixed number of learnable query tokens offer computational efficiency, they suffer from task generalization collapse, failing to adapt to new tasks that are distant from their pre-training tasks. To overcome this, we propose Noisy Query Tokens, which learn a distributed representation space between the VLM and Diffusion Model via end-to-end optimization, enhancing continual learning. Additionally, we introduce a VAE branch with linear projection to recover fine-grained image details. Experimental results confirm our approach mitigates generalization collapse and enables stable continual learning across diverse tasks.

Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力变体虽提供部分加速，但缺乏对全局注意力在多视图推理中作用的系统分析。本文旨在深入理解全局注意力模块的作用，并基于此提出更高效的加速方案。

Method: 通过将早期全局层转换为帧注意力，并对全局注意力进行子采样（包括对角线保留和均值填充组件），提出了一种训练免费的两步加速方案。

Result: 该方法在标准姿态和点图基准测试中实现了显著的推理时间加速（8-10倍），同时保持或略微提高了准确性，且在极端密集多视图设置中表现鲁棒。

Conclusion: 本文提出的训练免费两步加速方案在VGGT和$π^3$上实现了8-10倍的推理时间加速，同时保持或略微提高了原始模型的准确性，并在极端密集多视图设置中表现出鲁棒性。

Abstract: Since DUSt3R, models such as VGGT and $π^3$ have shown strong multi-view 3D performance, but their heavy reliance on global self-attention results in high computational cost. Existing sparse-attention variants offer partial speedups, yet lack a systematic analysis of how global attention contributes to multi-view reasoning. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth investigation of the global attention modules in VGGT and $π^3$ to better understand their roles. Our analysis reveals a clear division of roles in the alternating global-frame architecture: early global layers do not form meaningful correspondences, middle layers perform cross-view alignment, and last layers provide only minor refinements. Guided by these findings, we propose a training-free two-step acceleration scheme: (1) converting early global layers into frame attention, and (2) subsampling global attention by subsampling K/V over patch tokens with diagonal preservation and a mean-fill component. We instantiate this strategy on VGGT and $π^3$ and evaluate across standard pose and point-map benchmarks. Our method achieves up to $8$-$10\times$ speedup in inference time while matching or slightly improving the accuracy of the original models, and remains robust even in extremely dense multi-view settings where prior sparse-attention baselines fail.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) suffers from a lack of large-scale high-quality training data due to challenges in data privacy and annotation costs. While previous approaches have explored pedestrian generation for data augmentation, they often fail to ensure identity consistency and suffer from insufficient controllability, thereby limiting their effectiveness in dataset augmentation. To address this, We introduce OmniPerson, the first unified identity-preserving pedestrian generation pipeline for visible/infrared image/video ReID tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1) We proposed OmniPerson, a unified generation model, offering holistic and fine-grained control over all key pedestrian attributes. Supporting RGB/IR modality image/video generation with any number of reference images, two kinds of person poses, and text. Also including RGB-to-IR transfer and image super-resolution abilities.2) We designed Multi-Refer Fuser for robust identity preservation with any number of reference images as input, making OmniPerson could distill a unified identity from a set of multi-view reference images, ensuring our generated pedestrians achieve high-fidelity pedestrian generation.3) We introduce PersonSyn, the first large-scale dataset for multi-reference, controllable pedestrian generation, and present its automated curation pipeline which transforms public, ID-only ReID benchmarks into a richly annotated resource with the dense, multi-modal supervision required for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniPerson achieves SoTA in pedestrian generation, excelling in both visual fidelity and identity consistency. Furthermore, augmenting existing datasets with our generated data consistently improves the performance of ReID models. We will open-source the full codebase, pretrained model, and the PersonSyn dataset.

Abstract: There is a growing interest in developing strong biomedical vision-language models. A popular approach to achieve robust representations is to use web-scale scientific data. However, current biomedical vision-language pretraining typically compresses rich scientific figures and text into coarse figure-level pairs, discarding the fine-grained correspondences that clinicians actually rely on when zooming into local structures. To tackle this issue, we introduce Panel2Patch, a novel data pipeline that mines hierarchical structure from existing biomedical scientific literature, i.e., multi-panel, marker-heavy figures and their surrounding text, and converts them into multi-granular supervision. Given scientific figures and captions, Panel2Patch parses layouts, panels, and visual markers, then constructs hierarchical aligned vision-language pairs at the figure, panel, and patch levels, preserving local semantics instead of treating each figure as a single data sample. Built on this hierarchical corpus, we develop a granularity-aware pretraining strategy that unifies heterogeneous objectives from coarse didactic descriptions to fine region-focused phrases. By applying Panel2Patch to only a small set of the literature figures, we extract far more effective supervision than prior pipelines, enabling substantially better performance with less pretraining data.

Abstract: Synthesizing synchronized and natural co-speech gesture videos remains a formidable challenge. Recent approaches have leveraged motion graphs to harness the potential of existing video data. To retrieve an appropriate trajectory from the graph, previous methods either utilize the distance between features extracted from the input audio and those associated with the motions in the graph or embed both the input audio and motion into a shared feature space. However, these techniques may not be optimal due to the many-to-many mapping nature between audio and gestures, which cannot be adequately addressed by one-to-one mapping. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel framework that initially employs a diffusion model to generate gesture motions. The diffusion model implicitly learns the joint distribution of audio and motion, enabling the generation of contextually appropriate gestures from input audio sequences. Furthermore, our method extracts both low-level and high-level features from the input audio to enrich the training process of the diffusion model. Subsequently, a meticulously designed motion-based retrieval algorithm is applied to identify the most suitable path within the graph by assessing both global and local similarities in motion. Given that not all nodes in the retrieved path are sequentially continuous, the final step involves seamlessly stitching together these segments to produce a coherent video output. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of our proposed method, demonstrating a significant improvement over prior approaches in terms of synchronization accuracy and naturalness of generated gestures.

Conclusion: RULER-Bench的提出为视频生成模型的推理能力评估提供了新视角，揭示了当前模型在规则推理方面的不足（仅48.87%的规则一致性得分），并推动下一代模型向视觉基础智能发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled the synthesis of videos with strong temporal consistency and impressive visual quality, marking a crucial step toward vision foundation models. To evaluate these video generation models, existing benchmarks primarily focus on factors related to visual perception and understanding, like visual aesthetics, instruction adherence, and temporal coherence. However, the rule-based reasoning capabilities of video generation models remain largely unexplored. Although recent studies have carried out preliminary explorations into whether video models can serve as zero-shot learners, they still lack a fine-grained decomposition of reasoning capabilities and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. To address this gap, we introduce RULER-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of video generation models from the perspective of cognitive rules. Built upon two fundamental paradigms: text-to-video and image-to-video, RULER-Bench covers 40 representative tasks spanning six rule categories with 622 high-quality annotated instances. For the evaluation of each generated video, we construct a checklist covering four metrics and leverage GPT-o3 to assign scores to each question, achieving 85% alignment with human judgements. Extensive experiments show that the state-of-the-art model achieves only 48.87% on the rule coherence metric, highlighting significant room for improvement in the reasoning capability of next-level video models. We expect that the insight obtained from RULER-Bench will facilitate further development of reasoning-aware video generation, advancing video generation models toward vision foundation intelligence.

Abstract: Modeling daily hand interactions often struggles with severe occlusions, such as when two hands overlap, which highlights the need for robust feature learning in 3D hand pose estimation (HPE). To handle such occluded hand images, it is vital to effectively learn the relationship between local image features (e.g., for occluded joints) and global context (e.g., cues from inter-joints, inter-hands, or the scene). However, most current 3D HPE methods still rely on ResNet for feature extraction, and such CNN's inductive bias may not be optimal for 3D HPE due to its limited capability to model the global context. To address this limitation, we propose an effective and efficient framework for visual feature extraction in 3D HPE using recent state space modeling (i.e., Mamba), dubbed Deformable Mamba (DF-Mamba). DF-Mamba is designed to capture global context cues beyond standard convolution through Mamba's selective state modeling and the proposed deformable state scanning. Specifically, for local features after convolution, our deformable scanning aggregates these features within an image while selectively preserving useful cues that represent the global context. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of structured 3D HPE, with comparable inference speed to ResNet-50. Our experiments involve extensive evaluations on five divergent datasets including single-hand and two-hand scenarios, hand-only and hand-object interactions, as well as RGB and depth-based estimation. DF-Mamba outperforms the latest image backbones, including VMamba and Spatial-Mamba, on all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Zheng Huang,Xukai Liu,Tianyu Hu,Kai Zhang,Ye Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PPTBench是一个评估多模态大语言模型在PowerPoint任务中表现的综合基准，揭示了模型在视觉布局推理上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试忽视了以布局为中心的挑战，而PPTBench旨在填补这一空白，全面评估LLMs在PowerPoint相关任务中的表现。

Method: 利用958个PPTX文件构建了PPTBench，包含4,439个样本，覆盖检测、理解、修改和生成四个任务类别。

Result: 实验显示当前MLLMs在语义理解和视觉布局推理之间存在显著差距，模型能解释幻灯片内容但无法生成连贯的空间排列。

Conclusion: PPTBench揭示了当前多模态大语言模型在视觉布局推理方面的不足，尤其是在结合视觉线索与JSON布局结构时存在困难，为未来视觉结构推理和幻灯片生成研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: PowerPoint presentations combine rich textual content with structured visual layouts, making them a natural testbed for evaluating the multimodal reasoning and layout understanding abilities of modern MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks focus solely on narrow subtasks while overlooking layout-centric challenges, which are central to real-world slide creation and editing. To bridge this gap, we introduce PPTBench, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs on PowerPoint-related tasks. Leveraging a diverse source of 958 PPTX files, PPTBench evaluates models across four categories with 4,439 samples, including Detection, Understanding, Modification, and Generation. Our experiments reveal a substantial gap between semantic understanding and visual-layout reasoning in current MLLMs: models can interpret slide content but fail to produce coherent spatial arrangements. Ablation and further analysis show that current MLLMs struggle to combine visual cues with JSON-based layout structures and fail to integrate visual information into their API planning ability. And case studies visually expose systematic layout errors such as misalignment and element overlap. These findings provides a new perspective on evaluating VLLMs in PPT scenarios, highlighting challenges and directions for future research on visual-structural reasoning and coherent slide generation. All datasets and code are fully released to support reproducibility and future research.

Motivation: 在线视频中的仇恨言论日益严重，现有方法在多模态融合和细微仇恨内容理解上存在不足。

Method: 提出了RAMF框架，包括局部-全局上下文融合（LGCF）和语义交叉注意力（SCA）来处理多模态语义关系，以及对抗推理的三阶段过程来增强对仇恨意图的理解。

Result: 在两个真实仇恨视频数据集上，RAMF在Macro-F1和仇恨类召回率上分别比现有最佳方法提高了3%和7%。

Conclusion: RAMF框架通过创新的多模态融合和对抗推理方法，显著提升了在线视频中仇恨言论的检测性能，并在真实数据集上验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Hate speech in online videos is posing an increasingly serious threat to digital platforms, especially as video content becomes increasingly multimodal and context-dependent. Existing methods often struggle to effectively fuse the complex semantic relationships between modalities and lack the ability to understand nuanced hateful content. To address these issues, we propose an innovative Reasoning-Aware Multimodal Fusion (RAMF) framework. To tackle the first challenge, we design Local-Global Context Fusion (LGCF) to capture both local salient cues and global temporal structures, and propose Semantic Cross Attention (SCA) to enable fine-grained multimodal semantic interaction. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce adversarial reasoning-a structured three-stage process where a vision-language model generates (i) objective descriptions, (ii) hate-assumed inferences, and (iii) non-hate-assumed inferences-providing complementary semantic perspectives that enrich the model's contextual understanding of nuanced hateful intent. Evaluations on two real-world hateful video datasets demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalisation performance, improving upon state-of-the-art methods by 3% and 7% in Macro-F1 and hate class recall, respectively. We will release the code after the anonymity period ends.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法的泛化能力较差，尤其是在未见过的数据集上，主要原因是真实训练数据的有限性以及不同卫星传感器之间的域差距。

Method: 通过构建多样化的模拟数据集（包括模糊、噪声、下采样等退化操作以及波段生成、通道混洗、高通滤波、颜色抖动等增强操作），并在这些数据上预训练融合模型，学习通用的空间-光谱表示。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种新颖的预训练策略，通过利用大规模模拟数据集学习稳健的空间-光谱先验，显著提升了不同卫星传感器和成像条件下各种融合模型的泛化性能。

Abstract: Existing deep learning methods for remote sensing image fusion often suffer from poor generalization when applied to unseen datasets due to the limited availability of real training data and the domain gap between different satellite sensors. To address this challenge, we explore the potential of foundation models by proposing a novel pretraining strategy that leverages large-scale simulated datasets to learn robust spatial-spectral priors. Specifically, our approach first constructs diverse simulated datasets by applying various degradation operations (blur, noise, downsampling) and augmentations (bands generation, channel shuffling, high-pass filtering, color jittering, etc.) to natural images from ImageNet and remote sensing images from SkyScript. We then pretrain fusion models on these simulated data to learn generalizable spatial-spectral representations. The pretrained models are subsequently evaluated on six datasets (WorldView-2/3/4, IKONOS, QuickBird, GaoFen-2) using zero-shot and one-shot paradigms, with both full- and freeze-tuning approaches for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on different network architectures including convolutional neural networks, Transformer, and Mamba demonstrate that our pretraining strategy significantly improves generalization performance across different satellite sensors and imaging conditions for various fusion models. The pretrained models achieve superior results in zero-shot scenarios and show remarkable adaptation capability with minimal real data in one-shot settings. Our work provides a practical solution for cross-domain pansharpening, establishes a new benchmark for generalization in remote sensing image fusion tasks, and paves the way for leveraging foundation models through advanced training strategies.

Overall, the pipeline developed for this benchmark dataset's creation establishes a new framework for high-fidelity facial motion capture and dynamic 3D reconstruction.

*Mohamed Awad,Mahmoud Akrm,Walid Gomaa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 对抗训练虽提高模型鲁棒性，却意外增加了对抗样本的可迁移性，揭示了新的生态系统风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管对抗训练是提高模型鲁棒性的主要防御方法，但其对对抗样本可迁移性的影响尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在探究对抗训练是否会无意中增加对抗样本的可迁移性。

Method: 本研究训练了36种不同的模型（包括CNN和ViT），并进行了全面的可迁移性实验。

Result: 研究发现，对抗训练模型生成的扰动比标准模型生成的扰动更具可迁移性，揭示了一个明显的悖论。

Conclusion: 对抗训练（AT）模型生成的对抗样本比标准模型生成的对抗样本具有更高的可迁移性，这引入了一种新的生态系统风险。因此，在评估模型鲁棒性时，不仅要考虑模型对迁移攻击的抵抗能力，还应评估其生成可迁移对抗样本的倾向。

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved great success in computer vision, but remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is the leading defense designed to improve model robustness. However, its effect on the transferability of attacks is underexplored. In this work, we ask whether adversarial training unintentionally increases the transferability of adversarial examples. To answer this, we trained a diverse zoo of 36 models, including CNNs and ViTs, and conducted comprehensive transferability experiments. Our results reveal a clear paradox: adversarially trained (AT) models produce perturbations that transfer more effectively than those from standard models, which introduce a new ecosystem risk. To enable reproducibility and further study, we release all models, code, and experimental scripts. Furthermore, we argue that robustness evaluations should assess not only the resistance of a model to transferred attacks but also its propensity to produce transferable adversarial examples.

TL;DR: SelVA是一种文本条件选择性视频到音频生成模型，通过文本提示明确选择目标声源，解决了多对象视频中用户意图声音生成的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多媒体制作中需要对每个声源单独处理音频轨道以实现精确编辑和创意控制，但现有方法生成的是混合声音，视觉特征纠缠且区域提示无法明确指定声源。

Method: 提出了SelVA模型，利用文本提示调制视频编码器，提取与提示相关的视频特征，并通过补充令牌抑制文本无关的激活，实现语义和时间定位。采用自增强方案解决单声道音频监督不足的问题。

Result: 在VGG-MONOAUDIO基准测试中，SelVA在音频质量、语义对齐和时间同步方面表现优异。

Conclusion: SelVA模型通过文本提示作为明确的目标源选择器，有效解决了多对象视频中用户意图声音的生成问题，在音频质量、语义对齐和时间同步方面表现出色。

Abstract: This work introduces a new task, text-conditioned selective video-to-audio (V2A) generation, which produces only the user-intended sound from a multi-object video. This capability is especially crucial in multimedia production, where audio tracks are handled individually for each sound source for precise editing, mixing, and creative control. However, current approaches generate single source-mixed sounds at once, largely because visual features are entangled, and region cues or prompts often fail to specify the source. We propose SelVA, a novel text-conditioned V2A model that treats the text prompt as an explicit selector of target source and modulates video encoder to distinctly extract prompt-relevant video features. The proposed supplementary tokens promote cross-attention by suppressing text-irrelevant activations with efficient parameter tuning, yielding robust semantic and temporal grounding. SelVA further employs a self-augmentation scheme to overcome the lack of mono audio track supervision. We evaluate SelVA on VGG-MONOAUDIO, a curated benchmark of clean single-source videos for such a task. Extensive experiments and ablations consistently verify its effectiveness across audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization.

TL;DR: 结合VLM和OCR的混合架构提升文档检索精确性，适用于RAG场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM模型返回整页而非特定区域，限制了RAG的实用性；OCR系统虽能提取结构化文本但缺乏语义相关性评估。

Method: 利用ColPali的补丁级相似性分数作为OCR提取区域的空间相关性过滤器，并建立了视觉变换器补丁网格与OCR边界框的坐标映射。

Result: 提出了无需额外训练的推理时方法Snappy，并正在进行实证评估。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种结合视觉语言模型（VLM）和OCR技术的混合架构，通过空间相关性过滤提升文档检索的精确性，适用于检索增强生成（RAG）场景。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like ColPali achieve state-of-the-art document retrieval by embedding pages as images and computing fine-grained similarity between query tokens and visual patches. However, they return entire pages rather than specific regions, limiting utility for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where precise context is paramount. Conversely, OCR-based systems extract structured text with bounding box coordinates but lack semantic grounding for relevance assessment. We propose a hybrid architecture that unifies these paradigms: using ColPali's patch-level similarity scores as spatial relevance filters over OCR-extracted regions. We formalize the coordinate mapping between vision transformer patch grids and OCR bounding boxes, introduce intersection metrics for relevance propagation, and establish theoretical bounds on retrieval precision. Our approach operates at inference time without additional training. We release Snappy, an open-source implementation demonstrating practical applicability, with empirical evaluation ongoing.

Motivation: 现有方法将复杂推理简化为潜在嵌入，导致推理链不透明且难以追踪，因此需要一种显式分解的方法。

Conclusion: ReVSeg通过显式分解和多步推理链优化，在视频对象分割任务中实现了最先进的性能，并提供了可解释的推理轨迹。

Abstract: Reasoning-centric video object segmentation is an inherently complex task: the query often refers to dynamics, causality, and temporal interactions, rather than static appearances. Yet existing solutions generally collapse these factors into simplified reasoning with latent embeddings, rendering the reasoning chain opaque and essentially intractable. We therefore adopt an explicit decomposition perspective and introduce ReVSeg, which executes reasoning as sequential decisions in the native interface of pretrained vision language models (VLMs). Rather than folding all reasoning into a single-step prediction, ReVSeg executes three explicit operations -- semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding -- aligning pretrained capabilities. We further employ reinforcement learning to optimize the multi-step reasoning chain, enabling the model to self-refine its decision quality from outcome-driven signals. Experimental results demonstrate that ReVSeg attains state-of-the-art performances on standard video object segmentation benchmarks and yields interpretable reasoning trajectories.

Method: 提出PolarGuide-GSDR，建立偏振与3DGS的双向耦合机制：先利用3DGS的几何先验解决偏振歧义，再用精炼的偏振信息指导3DGS的法线和球谐表示。

Result: 在公开和自采集数据集上，PolarGuide-GSDR在镜面重建、法线估计和新视角合成中达到最先进性能，并保持实时渲染能力。

Conclusion: PolarGuide-GSDR通过将偏振先验直接嵌入3DGS优化，实现了高保真反射分离和全场景重建，无需环境映射或限制性材质假设，且在实时渲染性能上表现优异。

Abstract: Polarization-aware Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) enable novel view synthesis of specular-reflection scenes but face challenges in slow training, inefficient rendering, and strong dependencies on material/viewpoint assumptions. However, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering yet struggles with accurate reflection reconstruction from reflection-geometry entanglement, adding a deferred reflection module introduces environment map dependence. We address these limitations by proposing PolarGuide-GSDR, a polarization-forward-guided paradigm establishing a bidirectional coupling mechanism between polarization and 3DGS: first 3DGS's geometric priors are leveraged to resolve polarization ambiguity, and then the refined polarization information cues are used to guide 3DGS's normal and spherical harmonic representation. This process achieves high-fidelity reflection separation and full-scene reconstruction without requiring environment maps or restrictive material assumptions. We demonstrate on public and self-collected datasets that PolarGuide-GSDR achieves state-of-the-art performance in specular reconstruction, normal estimation, and novel view synthesis, all while maintaining real-time rendering capabilities. To our knowledge, this is the first framework embedding polarization priors directly into 3DGS optimization, yielding superior interpretability and real-time performance for modeling complex reflective scenes.

Conclusion: UAUTrack提出了一种统一的单目标跟踪框架，通过单流、单阶段、端到端的架构有效整合多模态数据，并在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Research in Anti-UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) tracking has explored various modalities, including RGB, TIR, and RGB-T fusion. However, a unified framework for cross-modal collaboration is still lacking. Existing approaches have primarily focused on independent models for individual tasks, often overlooking the potential for cross-modal information sharing. Furthermore, Anti-UAV tracking techniques are still in their infancy, with current solutions struggling to achieve effective multimodal data fusion. To address these challenges, we propose UAUTrack, a unified single-target tracking framework built upon a single-stream, single-stage, end-to-end architecture that effectively integrates multiple modalities. UAUTrack introduces a key component: a text prior prompt strategy that directs the model to focus on UAVs across various scenarios. Experimental results show that UAUTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Anti-UAV and DUT Anti-UAV datasets, and maintains a favourable trade-off between accuracy and speed on the Anti-UAV410 dataset, demonstrating both high accuracy and practical efficiency across diverse Anti-UAV scenarios.

Conclusion: PGP-DiffSR通过渐进式剪枝和相位交换适配器模块，显著降低了计算和内存开销，同时保持了竞争性的图像超分辨率恢复质量。

Abstract: Although diffusion-based models have achieved impressive results in image super-resolution, they often rely on large-scale backbones such as Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) and Diffusion Transformers (DiT), which lead to excessive computational and memory costs during training and inference. To address this issue, we develop a lightweight diffusion method, PGP-DiffSR, by removing redundant information from diffusion models under the guidance of the phase information of inputs for efficient image super-resolution. We first identify the intra-block redundancy within the diffusion backbone and propose a progressive pruning approach that removes redundant blocks while reserving restoration capability. We note that the phase information of the restored images produced by the pruned diffusion model is not well estimated. To solve this problem, we propose a phase-exchange adapter module that explores the phase information of the inputs to guide the pruned diffusion model for better restoration performance. We formulate the progressive pruning approach and the phase-exchange adapter module into a unified model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive restoration quality while significantly reducing computational load and memory consumption.

Abstract: Understanding high-resolution images remains a significant challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Recent study address this issue by dividing the image into smaller crops and computing the semantic similarity between each crop and a query using a pretrained retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model. The most relevant crops are then selected to localize the target object and suppress irrelevant information. However, such crop-based processing can fragment complete objects across multiple crops, thereby disrupting the computation of semantic similarity. In our experiments, we find that image crops of objects with different sizes are better handled at different resolutions. Based on this observation, we propose Multi-resolution Retrieval-Detection (MRD), a training-free framework for high-resolution image understanding. To address the issue of semantic similarity bias caused by objects being split across different image crops, we propose a multi-resolution semantic fusion method, which integrates semantic similarity maps obtained at different resolutions to produce more accurate semantic information and preserve the integrity of target objects. Furthermore, to achieve direct localization of target objects at a global scale, we introduce an open-vocalbulary object detection (OVD) model that identifies object regions using a sliding-window approach.Experiments on high-resolution image understanding benchmarks using different MLLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Recent advances in object-centric representation learning have shown that slot attention-based methods can effectively decompose visual scenes into object slot representations without supervision. However, existing approaches typically process foreground and background regions indiscriminately, often resulting in background interference and suboptimal instance discovery performance on real-world data. To address this limitation, we propose Foreground-Aware Slot Attention (FASA), a two-stage framework that explicitly separates foreground from background to enable precise object discovery. In the first stage, FASA performs a coarse scene decomposition to distinguish foreground from background regions through a dual-slot competition mechanism. These slots are initialized via a clustering-based strategy, yielding well-structured representations of salient regions. In the second stage, we introduce a masked slot attention mechanism where the first slot captures the background while the remaining slots compete to represent individual foreground objects. To further address over-segmentation of foreground objects, we incorporate pseudo-mask guidance derived from a patch affinity graph constructed with self-supervised image features to guide the learning of foreground slots. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FASA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of explicit foreground modeling and pseudo-mask guidance for robust scene decomposition and object-coherent representation. Code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: EGGS通过结合2D和3D高斯表示，在渲染质量、几何精度和效率上优于现有方法，为高质量新视角合成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) is crucial in computer vision and graphics, with wide applications in AR, VR, and autonomous driving. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering with high appearance fidelity, it suffers from multi-view inconsistencies, limiting geometric accuracy. In contrast, 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) enforces multi-view consistency but compromises texture details. To address these limitations, we propose Exchangeable Gaussian Splatting (EGGS), a hybrid representation that integrates 2D and 3D Gaussians to balance appearance and geometry. To achieve this, we introduce Hybrid Gaussian Rasterization for unified rendering, Adaptive Type Exchange for dynamic adaptation between 2D and 3D Gaussians, and Frequency-Decoupled Optimization that effectively exploits the strengths of each type of Gaussian representation. Our CUDA-accelerated implementation ensures efficient training and inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EGGS outperforms existing methods in rendering quality, geometric accuracy, and efficiency, providing a practical solution for high-quality NVS.

Conclusion: ClimaOoD enhances model robustness, offering valuable training data for better generalization in open-world anomaly detection.

Abstract: Anomaly segmentation seeks to detect and localize unknown or out-of-distribution (OoD) objects that fall outside predefined semantic classes a capability essential for safe autonomous driving. However, the scarcity and limited diversity of anomaly data severely constrain model generalization in open-world environments. Existing approaches mitigate this issue through synthetic data generation, either by copy-pasting external objects into driving scenes or by leveraging text-to-image diffusion models to inpaint anomalous regions. While these methods improve anomaly diversity, they often lack contextual coherence and physical realism, resulting in domain gaps between synthetic and real data. In this paper, we present ClimaDrive, a semantics-guided image-to-image framework for synthesizing semantically coherent, weather-diverse, and physically plausible OoD driving data. ClimaDrive unifies structure-guided multi-weather generation with prompt-driven anomaly inpainting, enabling the creation of visually realistic training data. Based on this framework, we construct ClimaOoD, a large-scale benchmark spanning six representative driving scenarios under both clear and adverse weather conditions. Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art methods show that training with ClimaOoD leads to robust improvements in anomaly segmentation. Across all methods, AUROC, AP, and FPR95 show notable gains, with FPR95 dropping from 3.97 to 3.52 for RbA on Fishyscapes LAF. These results demonstrate that ClimaOoD enhances model robustness, offering valuable training data for better generalization in open-world anomaly detection.

Abstract: The next frontier for video generation lies in developing models capable of zero-shot reasoning, where understanding real-world scientific laws is crucial for accurate physical outcome modeling under diverse conditions. However, existing video benchmarks are physical commonsense-based, offering limited insight into video models' scientific reasoning capability. We introduce VideoScience-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate undergraduate-level scientific understanding in video models. Each prompt encodes a composite scientific scenario that requires understanding and reasoning across multiple scientific concepts to generate the correct phenomenon. The benchmark comprises 200 carefully curated prompts spanning 14 topics and 103 concepts in physics and chemistry. We conduct expert-annotated evaluations across seven state-of-the-art video models in T2V and I2V settings along five dimensions: Prompt Consistency, Phenomenon Congruency, Correct Dynamism, Immutability, and Spatio-Temporal Continuity. Using a VLM-as-a-Judge to assess video generations, we observe strong correlation with human assessments. To the best of our knowledge, VideoScience-Bench is the first benchmark to evaluate video models not only as generators but also as reasoners, requiring their generations to demonstrate scientific understanding consistent with expected physical and chemical phenomena.

Abstract: Domain adaptation in object detection is critical for real-world applications where distribution shifts degrade model performance. Security X-ray imaging presents a unique challenge due to variations in scanning devices and environmental conditions, leading to significant domain discrepancies. To address this, we apply ALDI++, a domain adaptation framework that integrates self-distillation, feature alignment, and enhanced training strategies to mitigate domain shift effectively in this area. We conduct extensive experiments on the EDS dataset, demonstrating that ALDI++ surpasses the state-of-the-art (SOTA) domain adaptation methods across multiple adaptation scenarios. In particular, ALDI++ with a Vision Transformer for Detection (ViTDet) backbone achieves the highest mean average precision (mAP), confirming the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures for cross-domain object detection. Additionally, our category-wise analysis highlights consistent improvements in detection accuracy, reinforcing the robustness of the model across diverse object classes. Our findings establish ALDI++ as an efficient solution for domain-adaptive object detection, setting a new benchmark for performance stability and cross-domain generalization in security X-ray imagery.

Result: 实验证实GeoLoc预训练显著提高了GeoBridge的地理定位准确性，同时促进了跨领域泛化和跨模态知识迁移。

Conclusion: GeoBridge通过新颖的语义锚机制和多视图特征桥接，显著提升了跨视图和跨模态的地理定位性能，并展示了跨领域泛化和跨模态知识迁移的能力。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization infers a location by retrieving geo-tagged reference images that visually correspond to a query image. However, the traditional satellite-centric paradigm limits robustness when high-resolution or up-to-date satellite imagery is unavailable. It further underexploits complementary cues across views (e.g., drone, satellite, and street) and modalities (e.g., language and image). To address these challenges, we propose GeoBridge, a foundation model that performs bidirectional matching across views and supports language-to-image retrieval. Going beyond traditional satellite-centric formulations, GeoBridge builds on a novel semantic-anchor mechanism that bridges multi-view features through textual descriptions for robust, flexible localization. In support of this task, we construct GeoLoc, the first large-scale, cross-modal, and multi-view aligned dataset comprising over 50,000 pairs of drone, street-view panorama, and satellite images as well as their textual descriptions, collected from 36 countries, ensuring both geographic and semantic alignment. We performed broad evaluations across multiple tasks. Experiments confirm that GeoLoc pre-training markedly improves geo-location accuracy for GeoBridge while promoting cross-domain generalization and cross-modal knowledge transfer. The dataset, source code, and pretrained models were released at https://github.com/MiliLab/GeoBridge.

Conclusion: VLM-Pruner 是一种无需训练的令牌剪枝算法，通过平衡冗余和空间稀疏性，显著提升了视觉语言模型的效率，同时保持了细粒度对象细节。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image understanding tasks, but the large number of visual tokens imposes significant computational costs, hindering deployment on mobile devices. Many pruning methods rely solely on token importance and thus overlook inter-token redundancy, retaining numerous duplicated tokens and wasting capacity. Although some redundancy-aware approaches have been proposed, they often ignore the spatial relationships among visual tokens. This can lead to overly sparse selections of retained tokens that fail to adequately cover the regions of target objects. To address these limitations, we propose VLM-Pruner, a training-free token pruning algorithm that explicitly balances redundancy and spatial sparsity. We introduce a centrifugal token pruning paradigm that enables near-to-far selection while prioritizing the preservation of fine-grained object details. Moreover, we design a Buffering for Spatial Sparsity (BSS) criterion that defers the selection of spatially distant tokens. We further adopt a parallel greedy strategy to conduct token selection efficiently. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we selectively fuse salient information from the discarded tokens into the retained ones. Comprehensive comparisons demonstrate that VLM-Pruner consistently outperforms strong baselines across five VLMs with an 88.9\% pruning rate, while delivering an end-to-end inference speedup.

Conclusion: ViSAudio框架通过端到端的方式直接从无声视频生成双耳空间音频，显著提升了空间沉浸感和时空一致性，超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Despite progress in video-to-audio generation, the field focuses predominantly on mono output, lacking spatial immersion. Existing binaural approaches remain constrained by a two-stage pipeline that first generates mono audio and then performs spatialization, often resulting in error accumulation and spatio-temporal inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of end-to-end binaural spatial audio generation directly from silent video. To support this task, we present the BiAudio dataset, comprising approximately 97K video-binaural audio pairs spanning diverse real-world scenes and camera rotation trajectories, constructed through a semi-automated pipeline. Furthermore, we propose ViSAudio, an end-to-end framework that employs conditional flow matching with a dual-branch audio generation architecture, where two dedicated branches model the audio latent flows. Integrated with a conditional spacetime module, it balances consistency between channels while preserving distinctive spatial characteristics, ensuring precise spatio-temporal alignment between audio and the input video. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ViSAudio outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, generating high-quality binaural audio with spatial immersion that adapts effectively to viewpoint changes, sound-source motion, and diverse acoustic environments.

Method: 研究提出了一种基于性别分层的全身体MR图像配准方法，利用VIBESegmentator方法生成的皮下脂肪组织和肌肉掩模来增强基于强度的图割配准。

Result: 提出的方法在4000名受试者子集上评估，平均Dice分数为男性0.77/女性0.75，相比仅基于强度的配准提高了6个百分点，且在大多数组织区域降低了标签错误频率。与uniGradICON和MIRTK相比，差异分别为9/8和12/13个百分点。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的使用两种组织掩模的图像配准方法改善了UK Biobank图像的全身体配准效果。

Abstract: The UK Biobank is a large-scale study collecting whole-body MR imaging and non-imaging health data. Robust and accurate inter-subject image registration of these whole-body MR images would enable their body-wide spatial standardization, and region-/voxel-wise correlation analysis of non-imaging data with image-derived parameters (e.g., tissue volume or fat content). We propose a sex-stratified inter-subject whole-body MR image registration approach that uses subcutaneous adipose tissue- and muscle-masks from the state-of-the-art VIBESegmentator method to augment intensity-based graph-cut registration. The proposed method was evaluated on a subset of 4000 subjects by comparing it to an intensity-only method as well as two previously published registration methods, uniGradICON and MIRTK. The evaluation comprised overlap measures applied to the 71 VIBESegmentator masks: 1) Dice scores, and 2) voxel-wise label error frequency. Additionally, voxel-wise correlation between age and each of fat content and tissue volume was studied to exemplify the usefulness for medical research. The proposed method exhibited a mean dice score of 0.77 / 0.75 across the cohort and the 71 masks for males/females, respectively. When compared to the intensity-only registration, the mean values were 6 percentage points (pp) higher for both sexes, and the label error frequency was decreased in most tissue regions. These differences were 9pp / 8pp against uniGradICON and 12pp / 13pp against MIRTK. Using the proposed method, the age-correlation maps were less noisy and showed higher anatomical alignment. In conclusion, the image registration method using two tissue masks improves whole-body registration of UK Biobank images.

Conclusion: Video4Spatial框架通过视频生成模型展示了强大的视觉空间理解能力，推动了视频生成模型在通用视觉空间推理方面的发展。

Abstract: We investigate whether video generative models can exhibit visuospatial intelligence, a capability central to human cognition, using only visual data. To this end, we present Video4Spatial, a framework showing that video diffusion models conditioned solely on video-based scene context can perform complex spatial tasks. We validate on two tasks: scene navigation - following camera-pose instructions while remaining consistent with 3D geometry of the scene, and object grounding - which requires semantic localization, instruction following, and planning. Both tasks use video-only inputs, without auxiliary modalities such as depth or poses. With simple yet effective design choices in the framework and data curation, Video4Spatial demonstrates strong spatial understanding from video context: it plans navigation and grounds target objects end-to-end, follows camera-pose instructions while maintaining spatial consistency, and generalizes to long contexts and out-of-domain environments. Taken together, these results advance video generative models toward general visuospatial reasoning.

Conclusion: GeoViS框架通过逐步搜索和推理过程，显著提升了遥感图像中细粒度视觉定位的能力，并在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，展示了其强大的跨领域泛化能力和可解释性。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models(MLLMs) have led to remarkable progress in visual grounding, enabling fine-grained cross-modal alignment between textual queries and image regions. However, transferring such capabilities to remote sensing imagery remains challenging, as targets are often extremely small within kilometer-scale scenes, and queries typically involve intricate geospatial relations such as relative positions, spatial hierarchies, or contextual dependencies across distant objects. To address these challenges, we propose GeoViS, a Geospatially Rewarded Visual Search framework that reformulates remote sensing visual grounding as a progressive search-and-reasoning process. Rather than directly predicting the target location in a single step, GeoViS actively explores the global image through a tree-structured sequence of visual cues, integrating multimodal perception, spatial reasoning, and reward-guided exploration to refine geospatial hypotheses iteratively. This design enables the model to detect subtle small-scale targets while maintaining holistic scene awareness. Extensive experiments on five remote sensing grounding benchmarks demonstrate that GeoViS achieves precise geospatial understanding and consistently surpasses existing methods across key visual grounding metrics, highlighting its strong cross-domain generalization and interpretability.

Abstract: We introduce PPTArena, a benchmark for PowerPoint editing that measures reliable modifications to real slides under natural-language instructions. In contrast to image-PDF renderings or text-to-slide generation, PPTArena focuses on in-place editing across 100 decks, 2125 slides, and over 800 targeted edits covering text, charts, tables, animations, and master-level styles. Each case includes a ground-truth deck, a fully specified target outcome, and a dual VLM-as-judge pipeline that separately scores instruction following and visual quality using both structural diffs and slide images. Building on this setting, we propose PPTPilot, a structure-aware slide-editing agent that plans semantic edit sequences, routes between high-level programmatic tools and deterministic XML operations for precise control, and verifies outputs through an iterative plan-edit-check loop against task-specific constraints. In our experiments, PPTPilot outperforms strong proprietary agents and frontier VLM systems by over 10 percentage points on compound, layout-sensitive, and cross-slide edits, with particularly large gains in visual fidelity and deck-wide consistency. Despite these improvements, existing agents still underperform on long-horizon, document-scale tasks in PPTArena, highlighting the remaining challenges in reliable PPT editing.

Abstract: Image-based localization in GNSS-denied environments is critical for UAV autonomy. Existing state-of-the-art approaches rely on matching UAV images to geo-referenced satellite images; however, they typically require large-scale, paired UAV-satellite datasets for training. Such data are costly to acquire and often unavailable, limiting their applicability. To address this challenge, we adopt a training paradigm that removes the need for UAV imagery during training by learning directly from satellite-view reference images. This is achieved through a dedicated augmentation strategy that simulates the visual domain shift between satellite and real-world UAV views. We introduce CAEVL, an efficient model designed to exploit this paradigm, and validate it on ViLD, a new and challenging dataset of real-world UAV images that we release to the community. Our method achieves competitive performance compared to approaches trained with paired data, demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes significantly to global warming. Accurate detection of methane emissions is the key to taking timely action and minimizing their impact on climate change. We present AttMetNet, a novel attention-enhanced deep learning framework for methane plume detection with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The major challenge in developing a methane detection model is to accurately identify methane plumes from Sentinel-2's B11 and B12 bands while suppressing false positives caused by background variability and diverse land cover types. Traditional detection methods typically depend on the differences or ratios between these bands when comparing the scenes with and without plumes. However, these methods often require verification by a domain expert because they generate numerous false positives. Recent deep learning methods make some improvements using CNN-based architectures, but lack mechanisms to prioritize methane-specific features. AttMetNet introduces a methane-aware architecture that fuses the Normalized Difference Methane Index (NDMI) with an attention-enhanced U-Net. By jointly exploiting NDMI's plume-sensitive cues and attention-driven feature selection, AttMetNet selectively amplifies methane absorption features while suppressing background noise. This integration establishes a first-of-its-kind architecture tailored for robust methane plume detection in real satellite imagery. Additionally, we employ focal loss to address the severe class imbalance arising from both limited positive plume samples and sparse plume pixels within imagery. Furthermore, AttMetNet is trained on the real methane plume dataset, making it more robust to practical scenarios. Extensive experiments show that AttMetNet surpasses recent methods in methane plume detection with a lower false positive rate, better precision recall balance, and higher IoU.

Conclusion: 本文提出的STANet方法在质量评估中优于现有技术，并在多个下游手术任务中表现出卓越的泛化能力。

Abstract: Electrocautery or lasers will inevitably generate surgical smoke, which hinders the visual guidance of laparoscopic videos for surgical procedures. The surgical smoke can be classified into different types based on its motion patterns, leading to distinctive spatio-temporal characteristics across smoky laparoscopic videos. However, existing desmoking methods fail to account for such smoke-type-specific distinctions. Therefore, we propose the first Smoke-Type-Aware Laparoscopic Video Desmoking Network (STANet) by introducing two smoke types: Diffusion Smoke and Ambient Smoke. Specifically, a smoke mask segmentation sub-network is designed to jointly conduct smoke mask and smoke type predictions based on the attention-weighted mask aggregation, while a smokeless video reconstruction sub-network is proposed to perform specially desmoking on smoky features guided by two types of smoke mask. To address the entanglement challenges of two smoke types, we further embed a coarse-to-fine disentanglement module into the mask segmentation sub-network, which yields more accurate disentangled masks through the smoke-type-aware cross attention between non-entangled and entangled regions. In addition, we also construct the first large-scale synthetic video desmoking dataset with smoke type annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in quality evaluations, but also exhibits superior generalization across multiple downstream surgical tasks.

TL;DR: TrackNetV5通过MDD和R-STR模块解决了遮挡和方向模糊问题，性能显著提升且保持实时性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TrackNet系列（V1-V4）在遮挡处理和方向识别上存在局限性，V4虽然引入了运动输入但忽略了运动极性，导致方向模糊。

Method: 提出了Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD)模块和Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR)头部，前者通过分解时间动态为有符号极性场来编码运动方向和轨迹，后者利用Transformer架构在粗到细的范式中估计校正残差以恢复遮挡目标。

Result: 在TrackNetV2数据集上，TrackNetV5实现了0.9859的F1分数和0.9733的准确率，显著优于之前版本，且FLOPs仅增加3.7%。

Conclusion: TrackNetV5通过引入MDD模块和R-STR头部，显著提升了在遮挡和方向模糊情况下的跟踪性能，同时保持了实时推理能力。

Abstract: The TrackNet series has established a strong baseline for fast-moving small object tracking in sports. However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision.

Conclusion: 该论文通过引入UnicEdit-10M数据集和UnicBench基准，揭示了主流模型在多模态图像编辑中的局限性，并为未来研究提供了明确方向。

Abstract: With the rapid advances of powerful multimodal models such as GPT-4o, Nano Banana, and Seedream 4.0 in Image Editing, the performance gap between closed-source and open-source models is widening, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data and comprehensive benchmarks capable of diagnosing model weaknesses across diverse editing behaviors. Existing data construction methods face a scale-quality trade-off: human annotations are high-quality but not scalable, while automated pipelines suffer from error propagation and noise. To address this, we introduce a lightweight data pipeline that replaces multi-toolchains with an end-to-end model and a unified post-verification stage. For scalable quality control, we train a 7B dual-task expert model, \textbf{Qwen-Verify}, for efficient failure detection and instruction recaptioning. This pipeline yields \textbf{UnicEdit-10M}, a 10M-scale dataset spanning diverse basic and complex editing tasks. We also propose \textbf{UnicBench}, a general benchmark that extends beyond basic edits to explicitly assess spatial and knowledge-driven reasoning. To enable fine-grained diagnosis, we introduce novel metrics, including \textit{Non-edit Consistency} and \textit{Reasoning Accuracy}. Our analysis of mainstream models on UnicBench reveals their limitations and provides clear directions for future research.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视了视频和文本模态之间的信息密度差异，导致修改主题指代模糊和细节语义关注不足，限制了CVR模型的性能。

Method: HUD框架包含三个关键组件：整体代词消歧、原子不确定性建模和整体到原子的对齐，通过跨模态交互实现精确的组合特征学习。

Result: HUD在三个基准数据集上对CVR和CIR任务均实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HUD框架通过利用视频和文本模态之间的信息密度差异，解决了组合视频检索中的修改主题指代模糊和细节语义关注不足的问题，并在CVR和CIR任务上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CVR) is a challenging video retrieval task that utilizes multi-modal queries, consisting of a reference video and modification text, to retrieve the desired target video. The core of this task lies in understanding the multi-modal composed query and achieving accurate composed feature learning. Within multi-modal queries, the video modality typically carries richer semantic content compared to the textual modality. However, previous works have largely overlooked the disparity in information density between these two modalities. This limitation can lead to two critical issues: 1) modification subject referring ambiguity and 2) limited detailed semantic focus, both of which degrade the performance of CVR models. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel CVR framework, namely the Hierarchical Uncertainty-aware Disambiguation network (HUD). HUD is the first framework that leverages the disparity in information density between video and text to enhance multi-modal query understanding. It comprises three key components: (a) Holistic Pronoun Disambiguation, (b) Atomistic Uncertainty Modeling, and (c) Holistic-to-Atomistic Alignment. By exploiting overlapping semantics through holistic cross-modal interaction and fine-grained semantic alignment via atomistic-level cross-modal interaction, HUD enables effective object disambiguation and enhances the focus on detailed semantics, thereby achieving precise composed feature learning. Moreover, our proposed HUD is also applicable to the Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) task and achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets for both CVR and CIR tasks. The codes are available on https://zivchen-ty.github.io/HUD.github.io/.

Conclusion: IC-World 是一种创新的生成框架，通过激活大型视频模型的上下文生成能力，实现了共享世界建模中的并行视频生成，并在几何和运动一致性方面显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Video-based world models have recently garnered increasing attention for their ability to synthesize diverse and dynamic visual environments. In this paper, we focus on shared world modeling, where a model generates multiple videos from a set of input images, each representing the same underlying world in different camera poses. We propose IC-World, a novel generation framework, enabling parallel generation for all input images via activating the inherent in-context generation capability of large video models. We further finetune IC-World via reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy Optimization, together with two proposed novel reward models to enforce scene-level geometry consistency and object-level motion consistency among the set of generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IC-World substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both geometry and motion consistency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically explore the shared world modeling problem with video-based world models.

Motivation: 当前基于扩散的文本到图像定制方法在物理概念定制上表现不佳，主要原因是训练过程中缺乏明确的物理知识引入。

Method: 提出PhyCustom框架，包含等距损失和解耦损失，前者用于激活扩散模型学习物理概念，后者用于消除独立概念的混合学习。

Result: 实验结果表明，PhyCustom在多样化的数据集上定量和定性均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PhyCustom通过引入两种新的正则化损失（等距损失和解耦损失），成功激活了扩散模型进行物理概念定制，显著提升了物理属性在生成结果中的准确性。

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based text-to-image customization methods have achieved significant success in understanding concrete concepts to control generation processes, such as styles and shapes. However, few efforts dive into the realistic yet challenging customization of physical concepts. The core limitation of current methods arises from the absence of explicitly introducing physical knowledge during training. Even when physics-related words appear in the input text prompts, our experiments consistently demonstrate that these methods fail to accurately reflect the corresponding physical properties in the generated results. In this paper, we propose PhyCustom, a fine-tuning framework comprising two novel regularization losses to activate diffusion model to perform physical customization. Specifically, the proposed isometric loss aims at activating diffusion models to learn physical concepts while decouple loss helps to eliminate the mixture learning of independent concepts. Experiments are conducted on a diverse dataset and our benchmark results demonstrate that PhyCustom outperforms previous state-of-the-art and popular methods in terms of physical customization quantitatively and qualitatively.

Motivation: 研究旨在探索是否可以通过观察场景中的单一时刻（而非依赖视频的时间信息）来预测即将发生的动作，类似于人类的预测能力。

Method: AAG结合了单帧的RGB特征和深度线索以增强空间推理，并通过文本摘要或单帧动作识别器的预测提供长期上下文。

Result: AAG在三个教学性活动数据集（IKEA-ASM、Meccano和Assembly101）上的表现与时间聚合的视频基线方法和最先进方法相当。

Conclusion: AAG方法通过结合RGB特征、深度线索和先验动作信息，证明了在单帧动作预测任务中可以与基于时间聚合的视频基线方法竞争，甚至达到最先进方法的性能。

Abstract: Anticipating actions before they occur is a core challenge in action understanding research. While conventional methods rely on extracting and aggregating temporal information from videos, as humans we can often predict upcoming actions by observing a single moment from a scene, when given sufficient context. Can a model achieve this competence? The short answer is yes, although its effectiveness depends on the complexity of the task. In this work, we investigate to what extent video aggregation can be replaced with alternative modalities. To this end, based on recent advances in visual feature extraction and language-based reasoning, we introduce AAG, a method for Action Anticipation at a Glimpse. AAG combines RGB features with depth cues from a single frame for enhanced spatial reasoning, and incorporates prior action information to provide long-term context. This context is obtained either through textual summaries from Vision-Language Models, or from predictions generated by a single-frame action recognizer. Our results demonstrate that multimodal single-frame action anticipation using AAG can perform competitively compared to both temporally aggregated video baselines and state-of-the-art methods across three instructional activity datasets: IKEA-ASM, Meccano, and Assembly101.

TL;DR: 研究发现IP-AIGC检测在印度面孔上泛化性差，微调易过拟合，需改进方法和数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代图像编辑器可以生成身份保留的AIGC（IP-AIGC），但当前检测器在此类内容上的鲁棒性和公平性尚不明确，尤其是对 underrepresented 人群。

Method: 研究通过构建印度中心的数据集（FairFD和HAV-DF）和两个保留测试集（HIDF-img-ip-genai和HIDF-vid-ip-genai），评估了两种先进检测器（AIDE和Effort）在预训练和微调模式下的表现。

Result: 微调在域内表现显著提升（如Effort AUC从0.739升至0.944），但在保留测试集上性能下降（如AIDE AUC从0.923降至0.563），表明对训练生成器的过拟合。

Conclusion: 研究表明，IP-AIGC检测在印度和南亚面孔上存在显著的泛化差距，尤其是在身份保留编辑的情况下。未来需要开发保留表征的适应方法和印度感知的基准数据集以提升检测性能。

Abstract: Modern image editors can produce identity-preserving AIGC (IP-AIGC), where the same person appears with new attire, background, or lighting. The robustness and fairness of current detectors in this regime remain unclear, especially for under-represented populations. We present what we believe is the first systematic study of IP-AIGC detection for Indian and South-Asian faces, quantifying cross-generator generalization and intra-population performance. We assemble Indian-focused training splits from FairFD and HAV-DF, and construct two held-out IP-AIGC test sets (HIDF-img-ip-genai and HIDF-vid-ip-genai) using commercial web-UI generators (Gemini and ChatGPT) with identity-preserving prompts. We evaluate two state-of-the-art detectors (AIDE and Effort) under pretrained (PT) and fine-tuned (FT) regimes and report AUC, AP, EER, and accuracy. Fine-tuning yields strong in-domain gains (for example, Effort AUC 0.739 to 0.944 on HAV-DF-test; AIDE EER 0.484 to 0.259), but consistently degrades performance on held-out IP-AIGC for Indian cohorts (for example, AIDE AUC 0.923 to 0.563 on HIDF-img-ip-genai; Effort 0.740 to 0.533), which indicates overfitting to training-generator cues. On non-IP HIDF images, PT performance remains high, which suggests a specific brittleness to identity-preserving edits rather than a generic distribution shift. Our study establishes IP-AIGC-Indian as a challenging and practically relevant scenario and motivates representation-preserving adaptation and India-aware benchmark curation to close generalization gaps in AIGC detection.

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scanning (IOS) are essential for digital dentistry, but annotated data scarcity limits automated solutions for pulp canal segmentation and cross-modal registration. To benchmark semi-supervised learning (SSL) in this domain, we organized the STSR 2025 Challenge at MICCAI 2025, featuring two tasks: (1) semi-supervised segmentation of teeth and pulp canals in CBCT, and (2) semi-supervised rigid registration of CBCT and IOS. We provided 60 labeled and 640 unlabeled IOS samples, plus 30 labeled and 250 unlabeled CBCT scans with varying resolutions and fields of view. The challenge attracted strong community participation, with top teams submitting open-source deep learning-based SSL solutions. For segmentation, leading methods used nnU-Net and Mamba-like State Space Models with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization, achieving a Dice score of 0.967 and Instance Affinity of 0.738 on the hidden test set. For registration, effective approaches combined PointNetLK with differentiable SVD and geometric augmentation to handle modality gaps; hybrid neural-classical refinement enabled accurate alignment despite limited labels.

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have remarkably improved camera-controlled video generation, but most methods rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), leaving online reinforcement learning (RL) post-training largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce an online RL post-training framework that optimizes a pretrained video generator for precise camera control. To make RL effective in this setting, we design a verifiable geometry reward that delivers dense segment-level feedback to guide model optimization. Specifically, we estimate the 3D camera trajectories for both generated and reference videos, divide each trajectory into short segments, and compute segment-wise relative poses. The reward function then compares each generated-reference segment pair and assigns an alignment score as the reward signal, which helps alleviate reward sparsity and improve optimization efficiency. Moreover, we construct a comprehensive dataset featuring diverse large-amplitude camera motions and scenes with varied subject dynamics. Extensive experiments show that our online RL post-training clearly outperforms SFT baselines across multiple aspects, including camera-control accuracy, geometric consistency, and visual quality, demonstrating its superiority in advancing camera-controlled video generation.

Abstract: We present MindGPT-4ov, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that introduces a general post-training paradigm spanning data production, model training, and efficient deployment. It achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks at low cost, effectively enhancing the foundational capabilities of MLLMs and the generalization ability. Focusing on data construction, supervised fine-tuning strategies, and multimodal reinforcement learning methods, this work proposes three key innovations: (1) An information density-based data generation scheme, integrated with a dual-dimensional tree-structured label system, enabling automated generation of high-quality cross-domain data. (2) A collaborative curriculum supervised fine-tuning approach that balances the injection of domain-specific knowledge with the preservation of general capabilities. (3) A hybrid reinforcement learning paradigm that enhances reasoning ability while simultaneously addressing multi-objective optimization such as diversity exploration, maintenance of multimodal perception, and response conciseness. Moreover, we implement a series of infrastructure optimizations, such as 5D parallel training, operator optimization, and inference quantization to enhance training and inference efficiency while reducing the cost of domain adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate that the MindGPT-4ov model outperforms state-of-the-art models on benchmarks such as MMBench, MMStar, MathVision, and MathVista. In addition, MindGPT-4ov also demonstrates superior user experience in vertical domain tasks, enabling a seamless transition from academic research to industrial deployment. MindGPT-4ov provides a general post-training paradigm applicable to a wide range of MLLMs. The model weights, datasets, and code for the Qwen3-VL-based variants will be recently open-sourced to support the community's development of MLLMs.

Conclusion: 通过引入Slow-LoRA和Fast-LoRA两种轻量级适配器，该方法在保持视觉质量的同时实现了高达5倍的加速，且仅需少量样本和短时间训练即可实现强泛化能力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation, yet their deployment remains constrained by the heavy computational cost and the need for numerous inference steps. Previous efforts on fewer-step distillation attempt to skip redundant steps by training compact student models, yet they often suffer from heavy retraining costs and degraded generalization. In this work, we take a different perspective: we accelerate smartly, not evenly, applying smaller speedups to early semantic stages and larger ones to later redundant phases. We instantiate this phase-aware strategy with two experts that specialize in slow and fast denoising phases. Surprisingly, instead of investing massive effort in retraining student models, we find that simply equipping the base model with lightweight LoRA adapters achieves both efficient acceleration and strong generalization. We refer to these two adapters as Slow-LoRA and Fast-LoRA. Through extensive experiments, our method achieves up to 5 acceleration over the base model while maintaining comparable visual quality across diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, the LoRA experts are trained with only 1 samples on a single V100 within one hour, yet the resulting models generalize strongly on unseen prompts.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the underexplored challenge of sample diversity in autoregressive (AR) generative models with bitwise visual tokenizers. We first analyze the factors that limit diversity in bitwise AR models and identify two key issues: (1) the binary classification nature of bitwise modeling, which restricts the prediction space, and (2) the overly sharp logits distribution, which causes sampling collapse and reduces diversity. Building on these insights, we propose DiverseAR, a principled and effective method that enhances image diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive logits distribution scaling mechanism that dynamically adjusts the sharpness of the binary output distribution during sampling, resulting in smoother predictions and greater diversity. To mitigate potential fidelity loss caused by distribution smoothing, we further develop an energy-based generation path search algorithm that avoids sampling low-confidence tokens, thereby preserving high visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiverseAR substantially improves sample diversity in bitwise autoregressive image generation.

Abstract: Text-guided video editing, particularly for object removal and addition, remains a challenging task due to the need for precise spatial and temporal consistency. Existing methods often rely on auxiliary masks or reference images for editing guidance, which limits their scalability and generalization. To address these issues, we propose LoVoRA, a novel framework for mask-free video object removal and addition using object-aware localization mechanism. Our approach utilizes a unique dataset construction pipeline that integrates image-to-video translation, optical flow-based mask propagation, and video inpainting, enabling temporally consistent edits. The core innovation of LoVoRA is its learnable object-aware localization mechanism, which provides dense spatio-temporal supervision for both object insertion and removal tasks. By leveraging a Diffusion Mask Predictor, LoVoRA achieves end-to-end video editing without requiring external control signals during inference. Extensive experiments and human evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness and high-quality performance of LoVoRA.

Abstract: We present Layout Anything, a transformer-based framework for indoor layout estimation that adapts the OneFormer's universal segmentation architecture to geometric structure prediction. Our approach integrates OneFormer's task-conditioned queries and contrastive learning with two key modules: (1) a layout degeneration strategy that augments training data while preserving Manhattan-world constraints through topology-aware transformations, and (2) differentiable geometric losses that directly enforce planar consistency and sharp boundary predictions during training. By unifying these components in an end-to-end framework, the model eliminates complex post-processing pipelines while achieving high-speed inference at 114ms. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across standard benchmarks, with pixel error (PE) of 5.43% and corner error (CE) of 4.02% on the LSUN, PE of 7.04% (CE 5.17%) on the Hedau and PE of 4.03% (CE 3.15%) on the Matterport3D-Layout datasets. The framework's combination of geometric awareness and computational efficiency makes it particularly suitable for augmented reality applications and large-scale 3D scene reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: In low-light environments like nighttime driving, image degradation severely challenges in-vehicle camera safety. Since existing enhancement algorithms are often too computationally intensive for vehicular applications, we propose UltraFast-LieNET, a lightweight multi-scale shifted convolutional network for real-time low-light image enhancement. We introduce a Dynamic Shifted Convolution (DSConv) kernel with only 12 learnable parameters for efficient feature extraction. By integrating DSConv with varying shift distances, a Multi-scale Shifted Residual Block (MSRB) is constructed to significantly expand the receptive field. To mitigate lightweight network instability, a residual structure and a novel multi-level gradient-aware loss function are incorporated. UltraFast-LieNET allows flexible parameter configuration, with a minimum size of only 36 parameters. Results on the LOLI-Street dataset show a PSNR of 26.51 dB, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 4.6 dB while utilizing only 180 parameters. Experiments across four benchmark datasets validate its superior balance of real-time performance and enhancement quality under limited resources.

TL;DR: 提出CIA方法，通过图像嵌入有害查询，显著提升攻击效果，优于现有工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的攻击方法通常关注文本-图像交互，将视觉模态视为次要提示，未能充分利用图像携带复杂上下文信息的独特潜力。

Method: 提出了一种新的以图像为中心的攻击方法CIA，采用多智能体系统，通过四种不同的可视化策略将有害查询嵌入看似良性的视觉上下文中，并结合上下文元素增强和自动毒性混淆技术。

Result: 在MMSafetyBench-tiny数据集上的实验结果显示，CIA对GPT-4o和Qwen2.5-VL-72B模型的毒性分数分别达到4.73和4.83，攻击成功率（ASR）分别为86.31%和91.07%。

Conclusion: CIA方法显著优于现有工作，证明了视觉模态本身是破解先进MLLM的强大向量。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show remarkable capabilities, their safety alignments are susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Existing attack methods typically focus on text-image interplay, treating the visual modality as a secondary prompt. This approach underutilizes the unique potential of images to carry complex, contextual information. To address this gap, we propose a new image-centric attack method, Contextual Image Attack (CIA), which employs a multi-agent system to subtly embeds harmful queries into seemingly benign visual contexts using four distinct visualization strategies. To further enhance the attack's efficacy, the system incorporate contextual element enhancement and automatic toxicity obfuscation techniques. Experimental results on the MMSafetyBench-tiny dataset show that CIA achieves high toxicity scores of 4.73 and 4.83 against the GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-VL-72B models, respectively, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) reaching 86.31\% and 91.07\%. Our method significantly outperforms prior work, demonstrating that the visual modality itself is a potent vector for jailbreaking advanced MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有解决方案依赖人工干预或未充分利用智能体自主缓解幻觉的能力，受人类认知范式启发，设计自主缓解幻觉的框架。

Method: 提出InEx框架，结合内省推理（基于熵的不确定性估计）和外部跨模态多智能体协作（编辑智能体和自反思智能体），逐步验证和优化响应。

Result: 在通用和幻觉基准测试中，InEx比现有方法提升4%-27%，表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: InEx框架通过内省推理和外部多智能体协作，显著减少了LLMs中的幻觉问题，并在实验中表现出优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical challenge in large language models (LLMs), hindering the development of reliable multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Existing solutions often rely on human intervention or underutilize the agent's ability to autonomously mitigate hallucination. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from how humans make reliable decisions in the real world. They begin with introspective reasoning to reduce uncertainty and form an initial judgment, then rely on external verification from diverse perspectives to reach a final decision. Motivated by this cognitive paradigm, we propose InEx, a training-free, multi-agent framework designed to autonomously mitigate hallucination. InEx introduces internal introspective reasoning, guided by entropy-based uncertainty estimation, to improve the reliability of the decision agent's reasoning process. The agent first generates a response, which is then iteratively verified and refined through external cross-modal multi-agent collaboration with the editing agent and self-reflection agents, further enhancing reliability and mitigating hallucination. Extensive experiments show that InEx consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving 4%-27% gains on general and hallucination benchmarks, and demonstrating strong robustness.

Conclusion: GraphFusion3D通过结合多模态融合和先进特征学习，显著提升了3D目标检测性能，尤其在SUN RGB-D和ScanNetV2数据集上表现优异。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in 3D object detection, point clouds remain challenging due to sparse data, incomplete structures, and limited semantic information. Capturing contextual relationships between distant objects presents additional difficulties. To address these challenges, we propose GraphFusion3D, a unified framework combining multi-modal fusion with advanced feature learning. Our approach introduces the Adaptive Cross-Modal Transformer (ACMT), which adaptively integrates image features into point representations to enrich both geometric and semantic information. For proposal refinement, we introduce the Graph Reasoning Module (GRM), a novel mechanism that models neighborhood relationships to simultaneously capture local geometric structures and global semantic context. The module employs multi-scale graph attention to dynamically weight both spatial proximity and feature similarity between proposals. We further employ a cascade decoder that progressively refines detections through multi-stage predictions. Extensive experiments on SUN RGB-D (70.6\% AP$_{25}$ and 51.2\% AP$_{50}$) and ScanNetV2 (75.1\% AP$_{25}$ and 60.8\% AP$_{50}$) demonstrate a substantial performance improvement over existing approaches.

Conclusion: TEXTRIX框架在生成无缝、高保真纹理和精确3D部件分割方面表现出色，展示了其在3D属性生成和下游应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Prevailing 3D texture generation methods, which often rely on multi-view fusion, are frequently hindered by inter-view inconsistencies and incomplete coverage of complex surfaces, limiting the fidelity and completeness of the generated content. To overcome these challenges, we introduce TEXTRIX, a native 3D attribute generation framework for high-fidelity texture synthesis and downstream applications such as precise 3D part segmentation. Our approach constructs a latent 3D attribute grid and leverages a Diffusion Transformer equipped with sparse attention, enabling direct coloring of 3D models in volumetric space and fundamentally avoiding the limitations of multi-view fusion. Built upon this native representation, the framework naturally extends to high-precision 3D segmentation by training the same architecture to predict semantic attributes on the grid. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both tasks, producing seamless, high-fidelity textures and accurate 3D part segmentation with precise boundaries.

Motivation: 现有数据集多源于有限模拟器或传统Structure-from-Motion方法，描述性标题有限，限制了基础模型从单目视频准确解读真实世界动态的能力。DynamicVerse旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用基于窗口的Bundle Adjustment与全局优化相结合的方法，处理长视频序列，生成包含度量尺度静态几何、真实世界动态运动、实例级掩码和整体描述性标题的4D多模态数据。

Result: 构建了包含10万+视频、80万+标注掩码和1000万+帧的大规模数据集DynamicVerse，在多个基准任务上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DynamicVerse 框架通过整合大规模视觉、几何和多模态模型，成功地将真实世界视频序列转换为全面的4D多模态格式，显著提升了在视频深度估计、相机姿态估计和相机内参估计等基准任务上的性能。

Abstract: Understanding the dynamic physical world, characterized by its evolving 3D structure, real-world motion, and semantic content with textual descriptions, is crucial for human-agent interaction and enables embodied agents to perceive and act within real environments with human-like capabilities. However, existing datasets are often derived from limited simulators or utilize traditional Structurefrom-Motion for up-to-scale annotation and offer limited descriptive captioning, which restricts the capacity of foundation models to accurately interpret real-world dynamics from monocular videos, commonly sourced from the internet. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DynamicVerse, a physical-scale, multimodal 4D world modeling framework for dynamic real-world video. We employ large vision, geometric, and multimodal models to interpret metric-scale static geometry, real-world dynamic motion, instance-level masks, and holistic descriptive captions. By integrating window-based Bundle Adjustment with global optimization, our method converts long real-world video sequences into a comprehensive 4D multimodal format. DynamicVerse delivers a large-scale dataset consists of 100K+ videos with 800K+ annotated masks and 10M+ frames from internet videos. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark tasks, namely video depth estimation, camera pose estimation, and camera intrinsics estimation, demonstrate that our 4D modeling achieves superior performance in capturing physical-scale measurements with greater global accuracy than existing methods.

Conclusion: DGGT提出了一种单次通过的、无姿态的动态场景重建算法，在大型驾驶基准测试中表现出色，并具有跨数据集的零样本迁移能力。

Abstract: Autonomous driving needs fast, scalable 4D reconstruction and re-simulation for training and evaluation, yet most methods for dynamic driving scenes still rely on per-scene optimization, known camera calibration, or short frame windows, making them slow and impractical. We revisit this problem from a feedforward perspective and introduce \textbf{Driving Gaussian Grounded Transformer (DGGT)}, a unified framework for pose-free dynamic scene reconstruction. We note that the existing formulations, treating camera pose as a required input, limit flexibility and scalability. Instead, we reformulate pose as an output of the model, enabling reconstruction directly from sparse, unposed images and supporting an arbitrary number of views for long sequences. Our approach jointly predicts per-frame 3D Gaussian maps and camera parameters, disentangles dynamics with a lightweight dynamic head, and preserves temporal consistency with a lifespan head that modulates visibility over time. A diffusion-based rendering refinement further reduces motion/interpolation artifacts and improves novel-view quality under sparse inputs. The result is a single-pass, pose-free algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance and speed. Trained and evaluated on large-scale driving benchmarks (Waymo, nuScenes, Argoverse2), our method outperforms prior work both when trained on each dataset and in zero-shot transfer across datasets, and it scales well as the number of input frames increases.

Abstract: When applied sequentially to video, frame-based networks often exhibit temporal inconsistency - for example, outputs that flicker between frames. This problem is amplified when the network inputs contain time-varying corruptions. In this work, we introduce a general approach for adapting frame-based models for stable and robust inference on video. We describe a class of stability adapters that can be inserted into virtually any architecture and a resource-efficient training process that can be performed with a frozen base network. We introduce a unified conceptual framework for describing temporal stability and corruption robustness, centered on a proposed accuracy-stability-robustness loss. By analyzing the theoretical properties of this loss, we identify the conditions where it produces well-behaved stabilizer training. Our experiments validate our approach on several vision tasks including denoising (NAFNet), image enhancement (HDRNet), monocular depth (Depth Anything v2), and semantic segmentation (DeepLabv3+). Our method improves temporal stability and robustness against a range of image corruptions (including compression artifacts, noise, and adverse weather), while preserving or improving the quality of predictions.

Conclusion: AutoBrep通过统一的标记化方案和Transformer模型，成功实现了高质量、有效的B-Rep生成，支持用户可控的CAD生成。

Abstract: The boundary representation (B-Rep) is the standard data structure used in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) for defining solid models. Despite recent progress, directly generating B-Reps end-to-end with precise geometry and watertight topology remains a challenge. This paper presents AutoBrep, a novel Transformer model that autoregressively generates B-Reps with high quality and validity. AutoBrep employs a unified tokenization scheme that encodes both geometric and topological characteristics of a B-Rep model as a sequence of discrete tokens. Geometric primitives (i.e., surfaces and curves) are encoded as latent geometry tokens, and their structural relationships are defined as special topological reference tokens. Sequence order in AutoBrep naturally follows a breadth first traversal of the B-Rep face adjacency graph. At inference time, neighboring faces and edges along with their topological structure are progressively generated. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our unified representation when coupled with next-token prediction for B-Rep generation. AutoBrep outperforms baselines with better quality and watertightness. It is also highly scalable to complex solids with good fidelity and inference speed. We further show that autocompleting B-Reps is natively supported through our unified tokenization, enabling user-controllable CAD generation with minimal changes.

Conclusion: FLAT方法通过将展开网络的参数与ODE离散化对齐，显著提高了MRI重建的稳定性和收敛速度，实验证明其在三个MRI数据集上表现优异。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers excellent soft-tissue contrast without ionizing radiation, but its long acquisition time limits clinical utility. Recent methods accelerate MRI by under-sampling $k$-space and reconstructing the resulting images using deep learning. Unrolled networks have been widely used for the reconstruction task due to their efficiency, but suffer from unstable evolving caused by freely-learnable parameters in intermediate steps. In contrast, diffusion models based on stochastic differential equations offer theoretical stability in both medical and natural image tasks but are computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce flow ODEs to MRI reconstruction by theoretically proving that unrolled networks are discrete implementations of conditional probability flow ODEs. This connection provides explicit formulations for parameters and clarifies how intermediate states should evolve. Building on this insight, we propose Flow-Aligned Training (FLAT), which derives unrolled parameters from the ODE discretization and aligns intermediate reconstructions with the ideal ODE trajectory to improve stability and convergence. Experiments on three MRI datasets show that FLAT achieves high-quality reconstructions with up to $3\times$ fewer iterations than diffusion-based generative models and significantly greater stability than unrolled networks.

Abstract: We propose MAViD, a novel Multimodal framework for Audio-Visual Dialogue understanding and generation. Existing approaches primarily focus on non-interactive systems and are limited to producing constrained and unnatural human speech.The primary challenge of this task lies in effectively integrating understanding and generation capabilities, as well as achieving seamless multimodal audio-video fusion. To solve these problems, we propose a Conductor-Creator architecture that divides the dialogue system into two primary components.The Conductor is tasked with understanding, reasoning, and generating instructions by breaking them down into motion and speech components, thereby enabling fine-grained control over interactions. The Creator then delivers interactive responses based on these instructions.Furthermore, to address the difficulty of generating long videos with consistent identity, timbre, and tone using dual DiT structures, the Creator adopts a structure that combines autoregressive (AR) and diffusion models. The AR model is responsible for audio generation, while the diffusion model ensures high-quality video generation.Additionally, we propose a novel fusion module to enhance connections between contextually consecutive clips and modalities, enabling synchronized long-duration audio-visual content generation.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can generate vivid and contextually coherent long-duration dialogue interactions and accurately interpret users' multimodal queries.

Abstract: Current video generation techniques excel at single-shot clips but struggle to produce narrative multi-shot videos, which require flexible shot arrangement, coherent narrative, and controllability beyond text prompts. To tackle these challenges, we propose MultiShotMaster, a framework for highly controllable multi-shot video generation. We extend a pretrained single-shot model by integrating two novel variants of RoPE. First, we introduce Multi-Shot Narrative RoPE, which applies explicit phase shift at shot transitions, enabling flexible shot arrangement while preserving the temporal narrative order. Second, we design Spatiotemporal Position-Aware RoPE to incorporate reference tokens and grounding signals, enabling spatiotemporal-grounded reference injection. In addition, to overcome data scarcity, we establish an automated data annotation pipeline to extract multi-shot videos, captions, cross-shot grounding signals and reference images. Our framework leverages the intrinsic architectural properties to support multi-shot video generation, featuring text-driven inter-shot consistency, customized subject with motion control, and background-driven customized scene. Both shot count and duration are flexibly configurable. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and outstanding controllability of our framework.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently achieved remarkable success in eliciting visual reasoning within Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches typically train separate models for different tasks and treat image and video reasoning as disjoint domains. This results in limited scalability toward a multimodal reasoning generalist, which restricts practical versatility and hinders potential knowledge sharing across tasks and modalities. To this end, we propose OneThinker, an all-in-one reasoning model that unifies image and video understanding across diverse fundamental visual tasks, including question answering, captioning, spatial and temporal grounding, tracking, and segmentation. To achieve this, we construct the OneThinker-600k training corpus covering all these tasks and employ commercial models for CoT annotation, resulting in OneThinker-SFT-340k for SFT cold start. Furthermore, we propose EMA-GRPO to handle reward heterogeneity in multi-task RL by tracking task-wise moving averages of reward standard deviations for balanced optimization. Extensive experiments on diverse visual benchmarks show that OneThinker delivers strong performance on 31 benchmarks, across 10 fundamental visual understanding tasks. Moreover, it exhibits effective knowledge transfer between certain tasks and preliminary zero-shot generalization ability, marking a step toward a unified multimodal reasoning generalist. All code, model, and data are released.

Conclusion: CAMEO是一种简单而有效的训练技术，通过直接监督注意力图来提升多视图扩散模型的训练效率和生成质量。该方法不仅加速了收敛，还提高了新视图合成的性能，且具有模型无关性。

Abstract: Multi-view diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for novel view synthesis, yet the underlying mechanism that enables their view-consistency remains unclear. In this work, we first verify that the attention maps of these models acquire geometric correspondence throughout training, attending to the geometrically corresponding regions across reference and target views for view-consistent generation. However, this correspondence signal remains incomplete, with its accuracy degrading under large viewpoint changes. Building on these findings, we introduce CAMEO, a simple yet effective training technique that directly supervises attention maps using geometric correspondence to enhance both the training efficiency and generation quality of multi-view diffusion models. Notably, supervising a single attention layer is sufficient to guide the model toward learning precise correspondences, thereby preserving the geometry and structure of reference images, accelerating convergence, and improving novel view synthesis performance. CAMEO reduces the number of training iterations required for convergence by half while achieving superior performance at the same iteration counts. We further demonstrate that CAMEO is model-agnostic and can be applied to any multi-view diffusion model.

TL;DR: MagicQuill V2通过分层视觉提示堆栈（内容、空间、结构、颜色）和专用技术模块，实现了对生成图像的直接、精细控制，弥补了扩散模型与传统图形软件的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在整体生成方面表现出色，但其单一、整体的提示无法区分用户对内容、位置和外观的不同意图。

Method: 该方法将创意意图解构为可控的视觉提示堆栈：内容层（创建内容）、空间层（放置位置）、结构层（形状）和颜色层（调色板）。技术贡献包括上下文感知内容集成的专用数据生成管道、处理所有视觉提示的统一控制模块，以及用于精确局部编辑的微调空间分支。

Result: 大量实验验证了这种分层方法有效解决了用户意图差距。

Conclusion: MagicQuill V2通过分层组合范式成功弥合了扩散模型的语义能力与传统图形软件的精细控制之间的差距，为用户提供了直接、直观的生成控制。

Abstract: We propose MagicQuill V2, a novel system that introduces a \textbf{layered composition} paradigm to generative image editing, bridging the gap between the semantic power of diffusion models and the granular control of traditional graphics software. While diffusion transformers excel at holistic generation, their use of singular, monolithic prompts fails to disentangle distinct user intentions for content, position, and appearance. To overcome this, our method deconstructs creative intent into a stack of controllable visual cues: a content layer for what to create, a spatial layer for where to place it, a structural layer for how it is shaped, and a color layer for its palette. Our technical contributions include a specialized data generation pipeline for context-aware content integration, a unified control module to process all visual cues, and a fine-tuned spatial branch for precise local editing, including object removal. Extensive experiments validate that this layered approach effectively resolves the user intention gap, granting creators direct, intuitive control over the generative process.

Motivation: 研究目标是实现快速、隐私保护和资源高效的威胁检测，同时满足边缘设备的严格资源限制。

Method: 论文采用了约束网格搜索优化树基分类器，以及硬件感知神经架构搜索（HW-NAS）优化1D卷积神经网络（1D-CNNs）。

Result: 在Edge-IIoTset基准测试中，LightGBM达到95.3%准确率，仅使用75 KB闪存和1.2 K操作；HW-NAS优化的CNN达到97.2%准确率，使用190 KB闪存和840 K浮点操作。在树莓派3 B Plus上部署验证了树基模型在30毫秒内运行，CNN在精度优先时仍适用。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种硬件感知的入侵检测系统（IDS），适用于物联网（IoT）和工业物联网（IIoT）网络，展示了在严格边缘设备约束下优化树基机器学习模型和紧凑深度神经网络的实用性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a hardware-aware intrusion detection system (IDS) for Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial IoT (IIoT) networks; it targets scenarios where classification is essential for fast, privacy-preserving, and resource-efficient threat detection. The goal is to optimize both tree-based machine learning (ML) models and compact deep neural networks (DNNs) within strict edge-device constraints. This allows for a fair comparison and reveals trade-offs between model families. We apply constrained grid search for tree-based classifiers and hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS) for 1D convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs). Evaluation on the Edge-IIoTset benchmark shows that selected models meet tight flash, RAM, and compute limits: LightGBM achieves 95.3% accuracy using 75 KB flash and 1.2 K operations, while the HW-NAS-optimized CNN reaches 97.2% with 190 KB flash and 840 K floating-point operations (FLOPs). We deploy the full pipeline on a Raspberry Pi 3 B Plus, confirming that tree-based models operate within 30 ms and that CNNs remain suitable when accuracy outweighs latency. These results highlight the practicality of hardware-constrained model design for real-time IDS at the edge.

TL;DR: 通过HW-NAS生成轻量级流量分类模型，验证输入结构对抗性漏洞的影响，并通过对抗微调提升鲁棒性，支持边缘部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在IoT和嵌入式环境中，流量分类（TC）需在硬件受限条件下本地进行，因此需要准确、高效且可部署的轻量级模型。

Method: 使用硬件感知的神经架构搜索（HW-NAS）生成轻量级流量分类模型，评估两种输入格式（扁平字节序列和2D包级时间序列）在对抗攻击下的鲁棒性。

Result: 两种HW-NAS模型在USTC-TFC2016上均达到99%以上的干净数据准确率，参数不超过65k，FLOPs不超过2M。对抗微调后，扁平输入模型准确率超过96%，时间序列模型鲁棒性提升60个百分点。

Conclusion: 输入结构对抗性漏洞有显著影响，即使是紧凑、资源高效的模型也能实现强鲁棒性，支持其在安全边缘流量分类中的实际部署。

Abstract: Traffic classification (TC) plays a critical role in cybersecurity, particularly in IoT and embedded contexts, where inspection must often occur locally under tight hardware constraints. We use hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS) to derive lightweight TC models that are accurate, efficient, and deployable on edge platforms. Two input formats are considered: a flattened byte sequence and a 2D packet-wise time series; we examine how input structure affects adversarial vulnerability when using resource-constrained models. Robustness is assessed against white-box attacks, specifically Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). On USTC-TFC2016, both HW-NAS models achieve over 99% clean-data accuracy while remaining within 65k parameters and 2M FLOPs. Yet under perturbations of strength 0.1, their robustness diverges: the flat model retains over 85% accuracy, while the time-series variant drops below 35%. Adversarial fine-tuning delivers robust gains, with flat-input accuracy exceeding 96% and the time-series variant recovering over 60 percentage points in robustness, all without compromising efficiency. The results underscore how input structure influences adversarial vulnerability, and show that even compact, resource-efficient models can attain strong robustness, supporting their practical deployment in secure edge-based TC.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于开源O-RAN实现的xApp商店设计，填补了当前5G及未来移动通信网络中xApp市场平台的空白。

Abstract: 5G and beyond mobile telecommunication networks are increasingly embracing software technologies in their operation and control, similar to what has powered the growth of the cloud. This is most recently seen in the radio access network (RAN). In this new approach, the RAN is increasingly controlled by software applications known as xApps, and opens the door to third party development of xApps bringing diversity to the ecosystem, similar to mobile phone apps. This model aligns closely with the controllers in the ITU-T architecture for autonomous networks, and provides a pathway towards autonomous operation in the RAN. Unfortunately, no marketplace to host or supply xApps currently exists.
  This work describes our experiences in leveraging open-source O-RAN implementations to design and develop an xApp store.

Conclusion: 该论文通过合作博弈理论框架，分析了无线网络中用户形成稳定联盟进行多播的条件，提供了核心非空和稳定的充分条件，并通过数值计算验证了用户合作的可行性。

Abstract: We consider a wireless network in which there is a transmitter and a set of users, all of whom want to download a popular file from the transmitter. Using the framework of cooperative game theory, we investigate conditions under which users have incentives to cooperate among themselves to form coalitions for the purpose of receiving the file via multicast from the transmitter. First, using the solution concept of core, we investigate conditions under which it is beneficial for all users to cooperate, i.e., the grand coalition is stable. We provide several sets of sufficient conditions under which the core is non-empty as well as those under which the core is empty. Next, we use the concept of $\mathbb{D}_c$-stability to identify a set of sufficient conditions under which the users in the network form a certain fixed number of coalitions such that all the users within each coalition cooperate among themselves. Our analytical results show how the values of different system parameters, e.g., data rates of different users, transmit and receive power, file size, bandwidth cost, etc., influence stability properties of coalitions, and provide a systematic approach to evaluating cooperation of users for multicast. We also study cooperation among different users using numerical computations. The problem of coalition formation in the context of multicast addressed in this paper is fundamental, and our analysis provides new insights into the feasibility of stable cooperative multicast strategies, contributing to a deeper understanding of cooperation in wireless networks.

Method: 论文提出了一种扩散模型增强的改进多目标灰狼优化器（IMOGWO），用于解决由连续和离散解组成的混合解空间问题。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的IMOGWO算法在多目标优化框架中显著优于其他基准方法，尤其在减少运动能耗和计算资源方面表现突出，同时保持计算延迟在可接受水平。

Abstract: The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is widely applied for forest monitoring, since the sensor nodes (SNs) in IoT network are low-cost and have computing ability to process the monitoring data. To further improve the performance of forest monitoring, uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are employed as the data processors to enhance computing capability. However, efficient forest monitoring with limited energy budget and computing resource presents a significant challenge. For this purpose, this paper formulates a multi-objective optimization framework to simultaneously consider three optimization objectives, which are minimizing the maximum computing delay, minimizing the total motion energy consumption, and minimizing the maximum computing resource, corresponding to efficient forest monitoring, energy consumption reduction, and computing resource control, respectively. Due to the hybrid solution space that consists of continuous and discrete solutions, we propose a diffusion model-enhanced improved multi-objective grey wolf optimizer (IMOGWO) to solve the formulated framework. The simulation results show that the proposed IMOGWO outperforms other benchmarks for solving the formulated framework. Specifically, for a small-scale network with $6$ UAVs and $50$ SNs, compared to the suboptimal benchmark, IMOGWO reduces the motion energy consumption and the computing resource by $53.32\%$ and $9.83\%$, respectively, while maintaining computing delay at the same level. Similarly, for a large-scale network with $8$ UAVs and $100$ SNs, IMOGWO achieves reductions of $41.81\%$ in motion energy consumption and $7.93\%$ in computing resource, with the computing delay also remaining comparable.

Abstract: We present ProtO-RU, the first open source, software-defined O-RAN Split-7.2 Radio Unit built using SDRs and commodity CPUs. Unlike proprietary hardware-based commercial O-RUs, ProtO-RU is built on the open-source srsRAN software stack, and it is fully programmable. We demonstrate that ProtO-RU integrates with the srsRAN and OpenAirInterface5G CU/DU stacks, supports both TDD and FDD duplexing modes, and interoperates with commercial 5G UEs. Our evaluation shows that ProtO-RU remains stable under sustained load with multiple UEs and delivers throughput comparable to Split-8 and commercial O-RUs. ProtO-RU opens up new opportunities for RU-level innovations and lowers the barrier of entry for end-to-end O-RAN research.

Conclusion: DOMINO扩展了RBIS的覆盖范围，使其能够跨越多个Wi-Fi网络，适用于整个工厂环境，从而提升了时钟同步协议的实用性和适用性。

Abstract: Precise clock synchronization protocols are increasingly used to ensure that all the nodes in a network share the very same time base. They enable several mechanisms aimed at improving determinism at both the application and communication levels, which makes them highly relevant to industrial environments. Reference Broadcast Infrastructure Synchronization (RBIS) is a solution specifically conceived for Wi-Fi that exploits existing beacons and can run on commercial devices. In this paper, an evolution of RBIS is presented, we call DOMINO, whose coverage area is much larger than the single Wi-Fi infrastructure network, potentially including the whole plant. In particular, wireless stations that can see more than one access point at the same time behave as boundary clocks and propagate the reference time across overlapping networks.

Conclusion: 本文评估了Minstrel在静态和移动场景下的性能，并指出其在工业环境中的局限性，为未来基于集中式数字孪生的增强速率适应算法开发提供了初步评估。

Abstract: Wi-Fi is currently considered one of the most promising solutions for interconnecting mobile equipment (e.g., autonomous mobile robots and active exoskeletons) in industrial environments. However, relability requirements imposed by the industrial context, such as ensuring bounded transmission latency, are a major challenge for over-the-air communication. One of the aspects of Wi-Fi technology that greatly affects the probability of a packet reaching its destination is the selection of the appropriate transmission rate. Rate adaptation algorithms are in charge of this operation, but their design and implementation are not regulated by the IEEE 802.11 standard. One of the most popular solutions, available as open source, is Minstrel, which is the default choice for the Linux Kernel. In this paper, Minstrel performance is evaluated for both static and mobility scenarios. Our analysis focuses on metrics of interest for industrial contexts, i.e., latency and packet loss ratio, and serves as a preliminary evaluation for the future development of enhanced rate adaptation algorithms based on centralized digital twins.

Abstract: Persistent rural-urban disparities in broadband connectivity remain a major policy challenge, even in digitally advanced countries. This paper examines how these inequalities manifest in northern Finland and Sweden, where sparse populations, long distances, and seasonal variations in demand create persistent gaps in service quality and reliability. Drawing on survey data (n = 148), in-depth interviews, and spatial analysis, the study explores the lived experience of connectivity in Arctic rural communities and introduces a novel Cellular Coverage Inequality (CCI) Index. The index combines measures of rurality and network performance to quantify spatial disparities that are masked by national coverage statistics. Results reveal that headline indicators overstate inclusiveness, while local users report chronic connectivity gaps affecting work, safety, and access to services. Building on these findings, the paper outlines policy reflections in six areas: shared infrastructure and roaming frameworks, spectrum flexibility for rural operators, performance-based Quality-of-Service monitoring, standardized and transparent reporting, temporal and seasonal capacity management, and digital-skills initiatives. Together, these recommendations highlight the need for multidimensional metrics and governance mechanisms that link technical performance, spatial equity, and user experience. The analysis contributes to ongoing debates on how broadband policy in sparsely populated regions can move beyond nominal coverage targets toward genuine inclusion and reliability.

Motivation: 非地球静止轨道（NGSO）卫星网络中，由于大量地面用户共享有限的sub-6 GHz频谱，可扩展性成为主要挑战。使用K波段及更高频段虽能增加可用带宽，但这些频段受大气衰减（尤其是降雨）影响显著，可能导致性能下降和链路中断。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的ISAC框架显著提升了多波段卫星网络的吞吐量，相比单一S波段或K波段系统，用户吞吐量提高了73%。

Abstract: Scalability is a major challenge in non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) satellite networks due to the massive number of ground users sharing the limited sub-6 GHz spectrum. Using K- and higher bands is a promising alternative to increase the accessible bandwidth, but these bands are subject to significant atmospheric attenuation, notably rainfall, which can lead to degraded performance and link outages. We present an integrated sensing and communications (ISAC)-powered framework for resilient and efficient operation of multi-band satellite networks. It is based on distributed mechanisms for atmospheric sensing, cell-to-satellite matching, and resource allocation (RA) in a 5G Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) wide-area scenario with quasi-Earth fixed cells and a beam hopping mechanism. Results with a multi-layer multi-band constellation with satellites operating in the S- and K-bands demonstrate the benefits of our framework for ISAC-powered multi-band systems, which achieves 73% higher throughput per user when compared to single S- and K-band systems.

Conclusion: SLM_netconfig通过小型语言模型实现了高效、准确且隐私保护的自动化网络配置，为现代自主网络配置提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: As modern networks grow in scale and complexity, manual configuration becomes increasingly inefficient and prone to human error. While intent-driven self-configuration using large language models has shown significant promise, such models remain computationally expensive, resource-intensive, and often raise privacy concerns because they typically rely on external cloud infrastructure. This work introduces SLM_netconfig, a fine-tuned small language model framework that uses an agent-based architecture and parameter-efficient adaptation techniques to translate configuration intents expressed as natural language requirements or questions into syntactically and semantically valid network configurations. The system is trained on a domain-specific dataset generated through a pipeline derived from vendor documentation, ensuring strong alignment with real-world configuration practices. Extensive evaluation shows that SLM_netconfig, when using its question-to-configuration model, achieves higher syntactic accuracy and goal accuracy than LLM-NetCFG while substantially reducing translation latency and producing concise, interpretable configurations. These results demonstrate that fine-tuned small language models, as implemented in SLM_netconfig, can deliver efficient, accurate, and privacy-preserving automated configuration generation entirely on-premise, making them a practical and scalable solution for modern autonomous network configuration.

Conclusion: Fantasy系统通过GPU集群中的计算与网络通信重叠，显著提高了大规模图搜索的吞吐量，并支持大批量查询。

Abstract: Vector similarity search has become a critical component in AI-driven applications such as large language models (LLMs). To achieve high recall and low latency, GPUs are utilized to exploit massive parallelism for faster query processing. However, as the number of vectors continues to grow, the graph size quickly exceeds the memory capacity of a single GPU, making it infeasible to store and process the entire index on a single GPU. Recent work uses CPU-GPU architectures to keep vectors in CPU memory or SSDs, but the loading step stalls GPU computation. We present Fantasy, an efficient system that pipelines vector search and data transfer in a GPU cluster with GPUDirect Async. Fantasy overlaps computation and network communication to significantly improve search throughput for large graphs and deliver large query batch sizes.

Conclusion: DOLMA框架通过智能识别和卸载数据对象到远程内存，同时提供定量分析以确定合适的本地内存大小，为HPC领域提供了一种灵活且高效的解决方案，在最小化应用性能损失的同时，显著降低了本地内存使用。

Abstract: Memory disaggregation is promising to scale memory capacity and improves utilization in HPC systems. However, the performance overhead of accessing remote memory poses a significant challenge, particularly for compute-intensive HPC applications where execution times are highly sensitive to data locality. In this work, we present DOLMA, a Data Object Level M emory dis Aggregation framework designed for HPC applications. DOLMA intelligently identifies and offloads data objects to remote memory, while providing quantitative analysis to decide a suitable local memory size. Furthermore, DOLMA leverages the predictable memory access patterns typical in HPC applications and enables remote memory prefetch via a dual-buffer design. By carefully balancing local and remote memory usage and maintaining multi-thread concurrency, DOLMA provides a flexible and efficient solution for leveraging disaggregated memory in HPC domains while minimally compromising application performance. Evaluating with eight HPC workloads and computational kernels, DOLMA limits performance degradation to less than 16% while reducing local memory usage by up to 63%, on average.

Abstract: The increasing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads across diverse computing environments has driven the need for more efficient data management strategies. Traditional cloud-based architectures struggle to handle the sheer volume and velocity of AI-driven data, leading to inefficiencies in storage, computation, and data movement. This paper explores the integration of active storage systems within the computing continuum to optimize AI workload distribution.
  By embedding computation directly into storage architectures, active storage is able to reduce data transfer overhead, enhancing performance and improving resource utilization. Other existing frameworks and architectures offer mechanisms to distribute certain AI processes across distributed environments; however, they lack the flexibility and adaptability that the continuum requires, both regarding the heterogeneity of devices and the rapid-changing algorithms and models being used by domain experts and researchers.
  This article proposes a software architecture aimed at seamlessly distributing AI workloads across the computing continuum, and presents its implementation using mainstream Python libraries and dataClay, an active storage platform. The evaluation shows the benefits and trade-offs regarding memory consumption, storage requirements, training times, and execution efficiency across different devices. Experimental results demonstrate that the process of offloading workloads through active storage significantly improves memory efficiency and training speeds while maintaining accuracy. Our findings highlight the potential of active storage to revolutionize AI workload management, making distributed AI deployments more scalable and resource-efficient with a very low entry barrier for domain experts and application developers.

*Luiz A. Rodrigues,Elias P. Duarte,Luciana Arantes*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应生成树算法，解决分布式系统广播的可扩展性问题，支持动态重建并实现高效广播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统一对多通信策略在分布式系统中因发送者负载过高而缺乏可扩展性的问题。

Method: 利用VCube虚拟拓扑作为故障检测器，构建和维护一个深度和入度不超过log₂n的生成树。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该算法在进程失败或恢复时能动态重建生成树，且广播算法性能优于其他替代方案。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种自适应的分布式系统生成树构建算法，确保在最多n-1个进程失败时仍能保持连接，并基于此实现了两种广播算法。

Abstract: The most common strategy for enabling a process in a distributed system to broadcast a message is one-to-all communication. However, this approach is not scalable, as it places a heavy load on the sender. This work presents an autonomic algorithm that enables the $n$ processes in a distributed system to build and maintain a spanning tree connecting themselves. In this context, processes are the vertices of the spanning tree. By definition, a spanning tree connects all processes without forming cycles. The proposed algorithm ensures that every vertex in the spanning tree has both an in-degree and the tree depth of at most $log_2 n$. When all processes are correct, the degree of each process is exactly $log_2 n$. A spanning tree is dynamically created from any source process and is transparently reconstructed as processes fail or recover. Up to $n-1$ processes can fail, and the correct processes remain connected through a scalable, functioning spanning tree. To build and maintain the tree, processes use the VCube virtual topology, which also serves as a failure detector. Two broadcast algorithms based on the autonomic spanning tree algorithm are presented: one for best-effort broadcast and one for reliable broadcast. Simulation results are provided, including comparisons with other alternatives.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: HPC中心应推动跨学科FAIR生态系统，采用组件化方法提升计算组件的共享和重用效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HPC用户常因系统差异开发定制化数字产物，导致重复劳动；FAIR原则虽在各学科有进展，但领域特异性限制了更广泛的协作。

Method: 基于欧洲开放科学云（EOSC）EOSC-Life FAIR工作流协作架构，提出一个针对HPC需求的模型，强调使单个工作流组件符合FAIR原则。

Result: 提出了一种组件化的FAIR方法，更适应HPC用户多样化和动态的需求，同时最大化其工作的长期价值。

Conclusion: HPC中心应更积极地促进跨学科的FAIR生态系统，通过设计基础设施支持研究者更有效地发现、共享和重用计算组件。

Abstract: High Performance Computing (HPC) centers provide advanced infrastructure that enables scientific research at extreme scale. These centers operate with hardware configurations, software environments, and security requirements that differ substantially from most users' local systems. As a result, users often develop customized digital artifacts that are tightly coupled to a given HPC center. This practice can lead to significant duplication of effort as multiple users independently create similar solutions to common problems. The FAIR Principles offer a framework to address these challenges. Initially designed to improve data stewardship, the FAIR approach has since been extended to encompass software, workflows, models, and infrastructure. By encouraging the use of rich metadata and community standards, FAIR practices aim to make digital artifacts easier to share and reuse, both within and across scientific domains. Many FAIR initiatives have emerged within individual research communities, often aligned by discipline (e.g. bioinformatics, earth sciences). These communities have made progress in adopting FAIR practices, but their domain-specific nature can lead to silos that limit broader collaboration. Thus, we propose that HPC centers play a more active role in fostering FAIR ecosystems that support research across multiple disciplines. This requires designing infrastructure that enables researchers to discover, share, and reuse computational components more effectively. Here, we build on the architecture of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) EOSC-Life FAIR Workflows Collaboratory to propose a model tailored to the needs of HPC. Rather than focusing on entire workflows, we emphasize the importance of making individual workflow components FAIR. This component-based approach better supports the diverse and evolving needs of HPC users while maximizing the long-term value of their work.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了LLM-Verifier收敛定理，为LLM辅助验证提供了理论保证和实验验证，确立了设计阈值，支持可预测的资源规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前使用形式化验证工具与大型语言模型（LLM）的方法缺乏可靠的理论基础，导致细化过程不稳定。本研究旨在填补这一关键空白。

Method: 研究将LLM与验证器之间的交互建模为离散时间马尔可夫链，状态转移由关键参数错误减少概率（δ）决定，并通过超过90,000次试验的实证活动验证理论预测。

Result: 实证结果与理论预测高度一致，所有运行均达到验证状态，收敛因子紧密聚集在Cf≈1.0附近，理论界限准确反映了系统实际行为。

Conclusion: 该研究通过开发LLM-Verifier收敛定理，为LLM辅助验证提供了首个具有可证明终止和收敛保证的正式框架，并基于理论与实验证据确立了设计阈值，为工程师提供了可预测的资源规划和性能预算框架。

Abstract: The idea of using Formal Verification tools with large language models (LLMs) has enabled scaling software verification beyond manual workflows. However, current methods remain unreliable. Without a solid theoretical footing, the refinement process can wander; sometimes it settles, sometimes it loops back, and sometimes it breaks away from any stable trajectory. This work bridges this critical gap by developing an LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem, providing the first formal framework with provable guarantees for termination and convergence. We model the interaction between the LLM and the verifier as a discrete-time Markov Chain, with state transitions determined by a key parameter: the error-reduction probability ($δ$). The procedure reaching the Verified state almost surely demonstrates that the program terminates for any $δ> 0$, with an expected iteration count bounded by $\mathbb{E}[n] \leq 4/δ$. We then stress-tested this prediction in an extensive empirical campaign comprising more than 90,000 trials. The empirical results match the theory with striking consistency. Every single run reached verification, and the convergence factor clustered tightly around $C_f\approx$ 1.0. Consequently, the bound mirrors the system's actual behavior. The evidence is sufficiently robust to support dividing the workflow into three distinct operating zones: marginal, practical, and high-performance. Consequently, we establish the design thresholds with absolute confidence. Together, the theoretical guarantee and the experimental evidence provide a clearer architectural foundation for LLM-assisted verification. Heuristic tuning no longer has to be carried out by the system. Engineers gain a framework that supports predictable resource planning and performance budgeting, precisely what is needed before deploying these pipelines into safety-critical software environments.

Motivation: 流程图是常见的流程沟通工具，但通常以静态图像形式存在，难以编辑或重用。\textsc{Flowchart2Mermaid} 旨在解决这一问题，提供可编辑、版本可控的文本表示。

Method: 使用轻量级网页系统和视觉语言模型，结合详细系统提示，将流程图图像转换为 Mermaid.js 代码。界面支持混合主动式细化，包括内联文本编辑、拖放节点插入和自然语言命令。

Result: 该系统生成了结构化的、版本可控的文本表示，并与渲染的图表保持同步。进一步引入了评估指标，用于评估多个模型的结构准确性、流程正确性、语法有效性和完整性。

Conclusion: \textsc{Flowchart2Mermaid} 提供了一种将静态流程图转换为可编辑的 Mermaid.js 代码的有效方法，支持多种交互式编辑方式，并引入了评估指标来验证其准确性和完整性。

Abstract: Flowcharts are common tools for communicating processes but are often shared as static images that cannot be easily edited or reused. We present \textsc{Flowchart2Mermaid}, a lightweight web system that converts flowchart images into editable Mermaid.js code which is a markup language for visual workflows, using a detailed system prompt and vision-language models. The interface supports mixed-initiative refinement through inline text editing, drag-and-drop node insertion, and natural-language commands interpreted by an integrated AI assistant. Unlike prior image-to-diagram tools, our approach produces a structured, version-controllable textual representation that remains synchronized with the rendered diagram. We further introduce evaluation metrics to assess structural accuracy, flow correctness, syntax validity, and completeness across multiple models.

TL;DR: 提出模块化世界建模框架，通过分解转换器实现并行化和解释性，平衡AI安全与计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界场景通常涉及以模块化方式交互的子组件，利用这一特性可以实现高效建模，克服高计算需求的问题。

Method: 通过开发一个框架，将复杂的世界模型（以转换器表示）分解为操作于不同输入-输出子空间的子转换器，实现并行化和解释性。

Result: 研究明确了如何逆向分解转换器过程，得到操作于不同子空间的子转换器，支持分布式推理。

Conclusion: 该研究为AI安全所需的结构透明性与现实世界推理所需的计算效率之间搭建了桥梁，提出了可并行化和可解释的模块化世界建模方法。

Abstract: World models have been recently proposed as sandbox environments in which AI agents can be trained and evaluated before deployment. Although realistic world models often have high computational demands, efficient modelling is usually possible by exploiting the fact that real-world scenarios tend to involve subcomponents that interact in a modular manner. In this paper, we explore this idea by developing a framework for decomposing complex world models represented by transducers, a class of models generalising POMDPs. Whereas the composition of transducers is well understood, our results clarify how to invert this process, deriving sub-transducers operating on distinct input-output subspaces, enabling parallelizable and interpretable alternatives to monolithic world modelling that can support distributed inference. Overall, these results lay a groundwork for bridging the structural transparency demanded by AI safety and the computational efficiency required for real-world inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决从无状态大语言模型（LLMs）到自主目标驱动智能体的快速转变中，何时真正需要智能体AI的问题。

Method: STRIDE框架结合了结构化任务分解、动态属性归因和自我反思需求分析，生成一个智能体适用性评分。

Result: 在30个实际任务中评估，STRIDE在模式选择上达到92%准确率，减少45%不必要的智能体部署，并降低37%资源成本。

Conclusion: 该研究提出STRIDE框架，将智能体自治的应用重新定义为必要性驱动的设计决策，确保仅在收益大于成本时采用自治。

Abstract: The rapid shift from stateless large language models (LLMs) to autonomous, goal-driven agents raises a central question: When is agentic AI truly necessary? While agents enable multi-step reasoning, persistent memory, and tool orchestration, deploying them indiscriminately leads to higher cost, complexity, and risk.
  We present STRIDE (Systematic Task Reasoning Intelligence Deployment Evaluator), a framework that provides principled recommendations for selecting between three modalities: (i) direct LLM calls, (ii) guided AI assistants, and (iii) fully autonomous agentic AI. STRIDE integrates structured task decomposition, dynamism attribution, and self-reflection requirement analysis to produce an Agentic Suitability Score, ensuring that full agentic autonomy is reserved for tasks with inherent dynamism or evolving context.
  Evaluated across 30 real-world tasks spanning SRE, compliance, and enterprise automation, STRIDE achieved 92% accuracy in modality selection, reduced unnecessary agent deployments by 45%, and cut resource costs by 37%. Expert validation over six months in SRE and compliance domains confirmed its practical utility, with domain specialists agreeing that STRIDE effectively distinguishes between tasks requiring simple LLM calls, guided assistants, or full agentic autonomy. This work reframes agent adoption as a necessity-driven design decision, ensuring autonomy is applied only when its benefits justify the costs.

TL;DR: 研究通过构建财富管理任务评估集，发现代理表现受自主性水平和端到端工作流可靠性影响，并指出错误的模型评估方法阻碍了基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代工作中虽然使用了多种数字协作工具，但常规流程仍受人为错误和延迟的困扰。研究旨在探索通用LLM代理是否能准确且经济地完成财富管理任务，从而填补这一空白。

Method: 研究通过构建12个财富管理任务对（涵盖检索、分析和综合/沟通），并引入明确的验收标准和确定性评分机制，评估代理的适用性。同时，研究还生成了新的金融领域特定数据，并为每个任务设计了高自主性和低自主性两种变体。

Result: 研究发现，代理在财富管理任务中的表现受自主性水平显著影响，且端到端工作流的可靠性是主要限制因素。此外，错误的模型评估方法影响了基准测试的有效性。

Conclusion: 代理的限制更多在于端到端工作流的可靠性，而非数学推理能力，且自主性水平对其表现有显著影响。同时，错误的模型评估方法阻碍了基准测试的有效性。

Abstract: Modern work relies on an assortment of digital collaboration tools, yet routine processes continue to suffer from human error and delay. To address this gap, this dissertation extends TheAgentCompany with a finance-focused environment and investigates whether a general purpose LLM agent can complete representative wealth-management tasks both accurately and economically. This study introduces synthetic domain data, enriches colleague simulations, and prototypes an automatic task-generation pipeline. The study aims to create and assess an evaluation set that can meaningfully measure an agent's fitness for assistant-level wealth management work. We construct a benchmark of 12 task-pairs for wealth management assistants spanning retrieval, analysis, and synthesis/communication, with explicit acceptance criteria and deterministic graders. We seeded a set of new finance-specific data and introduced a high vs. low-autonomy variant of every task. The paper concluded that agents are limited less by mathematical reasoning and more so by end-to-end workflow reliability, and meaningfully affected by autonomy level, and that incorrect evaluation of models have hindered benchmarking.

Method: 提出了TradeTrap，一个统一的评估框架，用于系统性地压力测试自适应和程序化自主交易代理。

Result: 实验表明，单个组件的小扰动可通过代理决策循环传播，导致极端集中、失控暴露和大规模投资组合回撤。

Conclusion: 当前自主交易代理在系统层面容易受到误导，小扰动可能导致极端集中、失控暴露和大幅投资组合回撤。

Abstract: LLM-based trading agents are increasingly deployed in real-world financial markets to perform autonomous analysis and execution. However, their reliability and robustness under adversarial or faulty conditions remain largely unexamined, despite operating in high-risk, irreversible financial environments. We propose TradeTrap, a unified evaluation framework for systematically stress-testing both adaptive and procedural autonomous trading agents. TradeTrap targets four core components of autonomous trading agents: market intelligence, strategy formulation, portfolio and ledger handling, and trade execution, and evaluates their robustness under controlled system-level perturbations. All evaluations are conducted in a closed-loop historical backtesting setting on real US equity market data with identical initial conditions, enabling fair and reproducible comparisons across agents and attacks. Extensive experiments show that small perturbations at a single component can propagate through the agent decision loop and induce extreme concentration, runaway exposure, and large portfolio drawdowns across both agent types, demonstrating that current autonomous trading agents can be systematically misled at the system level.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly across perception, language, reasoning, and multimodal domains. Yet despite these achievements, modern AI systems remain fundamentally limited in their ability to self-monitor, self-correct, and regulate their behavior autonomously in dynamic contexts. This paper identifies and analyzes seven core deficiencies that constrain contemporary AI models: the absence of intrinsic self-monitoring, lack of meta-cognitive awareness, fixed and non-adaptive learning mechanisms, inability to restructure goals, lack of representational maintenance, insufficient embodied feedback, and the absence of intrinsic agency. Alongside identifying these limitations, we also outline a forward-looking perspective on how AI may evolve beyond them through architectures that mirror neurocognitive principles. We argue that these structural limitations prevent current architectures, including deep learning and transformer-based systems, from achieving robust generalization, lifelong adaptability, and real-world autonomy. Drawing on a comparative analysis of artificial systems and biological cognition [7], and integrating insights from AI research, cognitive science, and neuroscience, we outline how these capabilities are absent in current models and why scaling alone cannot resolve them. We conclude by advocating for a paradigmatic shift toward cognitively grounded AI (cognitive autonomy) capable of self-directed adaptation, dynamic representation management, and intentional, goal-oriented behavior, paired with reformative oversight mechanisms [8] that ensure autonomous systems remain interpretable, governable, and aligned with human values.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在心理健康、危机干预等情感敏感服务中广泛应用，但其心理社会安全性评估不足，亟需系统化评估框架。

Method: DialogGuard采用多代理机制，包括单代理评分、双代理校正、多代理辩论和随机多数投票，基于共享的三级评分标准，适用于人类注释者和LLM评委。

Result: 研究表明，多代理机制在检测心理社会风险方面比非LLM基线和单代理评分更准确，双代理校正和多数投票在准确性、与人类评分的一致性和鲁棒性之间表现最佳。

Conclusion: DialogGuard是一个多代理框架，用于评估LLM生成响应中的心理社会风险，通过四种LLM-as-a-judge流程实现，其中双代理校正和多数投票在准确性、与人类评分的一致性和鲁棒性之间提供了最佳平衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now mediate many web-based mental-health, crisis, and other emotionally sensitive services, yet their psychosocial safety in these settings remains poorly understood and weakly evaluated. We present DialogGuard, a multi-agent framework for assessing psychosocial risks in LLM-generated responses along five high-severity dimensions: privacy violations, discriminatory behaviour, mental manipulation, psychological harm, and insulting behaviour. DialogGuard can be applied to diverse generative models through four LLM-as-a-judge pipelines, including single-agent scoring, dual-agent correction, multi-agent debate, and stochastic majority voting, grounded in a shared three-level rubric usable by both human annotators and LLM judges. Using PKU-SafeRLHF with human safety annotations, we show that multi-agent mechanisms detect psychosocial risks more accurately than non-LLM baselines and single-agent judging; dual-agent correction and majority voting provide the best trade-off between accuracy, alignment with human ratings, and robustness, while debate attains higher recall but over-flags borderline cases. We release Dialog-Guard as open-source software with a web interface that provides per-dimension risk scores and explainable natural-language rationales. A formative study with 12 practitioners illustrates how it supports prompt design, auditing, and supervision of web-facing applications for vulnerable users.

Motivation: 模型恢复（MR）在边缘设备上部署时，由于神经常微分方程（NODEs）的迭代性质导致效率低下，内存和能源消耗成为主要问题。

Method: 提出MERINDA框架，采用可并行化的神经架构替代神经常微分方程的迭代求解器。

Conclusion: MERINDA框架通过替代迭代求解器，显著降低了内存和能源消耗，适合资源受限的实时任务关键自主系统。

Abstract: Model Recovery (MR) enables safe, explainable decision making in mission-critical autonomous systems (MCAS) by learning governing dynamical equations, but its deployment on edge devices is hindered by the iterative nature of neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), which are inefficient on FPGAs. Memory and energy consumption are the main concerns when applying MR on edge devices for real-time operation. We propose MERINDA, a novel FPGA-accelerated MR framework that replaces iterative solvers with a parallelizable neural architecture equivalent to NODEs. MERINDA achieves nearly 11x lower DRAM usage and 2.2x faster runtime compared to mobile GPUs. Experiments reveal an inverse relationship between memory and energy at fixed accuracy, highlighting MERINDA's suitability for resource-constrained, real-time MCAS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像标注需要大量时间和专业知识，尤其是乳腺上皮细胞分割任务中存在严重的类别不平衡问题。

Method: 采用EfficientNet-B7/UNet++架构，结合多尺度Gabor滤波器进行量子启发边缘增强，使用稳定化的多组件损失函数和基于复杂度的加权采样策略。

Result: 模型在乳腺细胞分割任务中达到95.5%的Dice分数和91.2%的IoU，边界准确率提升2.1%，小病变检测率提高3.8%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过量子启发的边缘增强和多组件损失函数，显著减少了医学专家标注时间，解决了临床感知AI开发中的关键瓶颈。

Abstract: Annotating medical images demands significant time and expertise, often requiring pathologists to invest hundreds of hours in labeling mammary epithelial nuclei datasets. We address this critical challenge by achieving 95.5% Dice score using just 599 training images for breast cell segmentation, where just 4% of pixels represent breast tissue and 60% of images contain no breast regions. Our framework uses quantum-inspired edge enhancement via multi-scale Gabor filters creating a fourth input channel, enhancing boundary detection where inter-annotator variations reach +/- 3 pixels. We present a stabilized multi-component loss function that integrates adaptive Dice loss with boundary-aware terms and automatic positive weighting to effectively address severe class imbalance, where mammary epithelial cell regions comprise only 0.1%-20% of the total image area. Additionally, a complexity-based weighted sampling strategy is introduced to prioritize the challenging mammary epithelial cell regions. The model employs an EfficientNet-B7/UNet++ architecture with a 4-to-3 channel projection, enabling the use of pretrained weights despite limited medical imaging data. Finally, robust validation is achieved through exponential moving averaging and statistical outlier detection, ensuring reliable performance estimates on a small validation set (129 images). Our framework achieves a Dice score of 95.5% +/- 0.3% and an IoU of 91.2% +/- 0.4%. Notably, quantum-based enhancement contributes to a 2.1% improvement in boundary accuracy, while weighted sampling increases small lesion detection by 3.8%. By achieving groundbreaking performance with limited annotations, our approach significantly reduces the medical expert time required for dataset creation, addressing a fundamental bottleneck in clinical perception AI development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全模态大语言模型（OLLMs）处理文本、图像、视频和音频的能力为人机交互带来了新的安全和价值防护挑战，而现有的防护研究主要针对单模态设置，且通常将防护视为二元分类，限制了其在多样化模态和任务中的稳健性。

Method: 提出了OmniGuard，这是第一个具有跨模态推理能力的全模态安全防护家族，并通过专家模型的有针对性蒸馏，构建了一个包含210K多样本的全模态安全数据集。

Result: 在15个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，OmniGuard在多种多模态安全场景中表现出强大的有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: OmniGuard提供了一个统一的框架，能够在全模态中执行安全策略并降低风险，为构建更强大和稳健的全模态安全系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs) that process text, images, videos, and audio introduce new challenges for safety and value guardrails in human-AI interaction. Prior guardrail research largely targets unimodal settings and typically frames safeguarding as binary classification, which limits robustness across diverse modalities and tasks. To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios. Importantly, OmniGuard provides a unified framework that enforces policies and mitigates risks in omni-modalities, paving the way toward building more robust and capable omnimodal safeguarding systems.

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在多视角空间推理中存在跨视角对齐和视角转换的失败，揭示了其在构建和维护空间心理模型方面的局限性。ReMindView-Bench为诊断VLM空间推理提供了认知基础，并展示了多视角空间心理模型的形成、退化和失稳过程。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a core aspect of human intelligence that allows perception, inference and planning in 3D environments. However, current vision-language models (VLMs) struggle to maintain geometric coherence and cross-view consistency for spatial reasoning in multi-view settings. We attribute this gap to the lack of fine-grained benchmarks that isolate multi-view reasoning from single-view perception and temporal factors. To address this, we present ReMindView-Bench, a cognitively grounded benchmark for evaluating how VLMs construct, align and maintain spatial mental models across complementary viewpoints. ReMindView-Bench systematically varies viewpoint spatial pattern and query type to probe key factors of spatial cognition. Evaluations of 15 current VLMs reveals consistent failures in cross-view alignment and perspective-taking in multi-view spatial reasoning, motivating deeper analysis on the reasoning process. Explicit phase-wise analysis using LLM-as-a-judge and self-consistency prompting shows that VLMs perform well on in-frame perception but degrade sharply when integrating information across views. Implicit analysis, including linear probing and entropy dynamics, further show progressive loss of task-relevant information and uncertainty separation between correct and incorrect trajectories. These results provide a cognitively grounded diagnosis of VLM spatial reasoning and reveal how multi-view spatial mental models are formed, degraded and destabilized across reasoning phases. The ReMindView-Bench benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Xue0823/ReMindView-Bench, and the source codes of benchmark construction and VLM reasoning analysis are available at https://github.com/pittisl/ReMindView-Bench.

Conclusion: PaperDebugger通过Chrome扩展、Kubernetes编排层和MCP工具链，成功实现了在LaTeX编辑器内的多代理、插件式学术写作助手，验证了编辑器原生代理写作助手的实用性。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly embedded into academic writing workflows, yet existing assistants remain external to the editor, preventing deep interaction with document state, structure, and revision history. This separation makes it impossible to support agentic, context-aware operations directly within LaTeX editors such as Overleaf. We present PaperDebugger, an in-editor, multi-agent, and plugin-based academic writing assistant that brings LLM-driven reasoning directly into the writing environment. Enabling such in-editor interaction is technically non-trivial: it requires reliable bidirectional synchronization with the editor, fine-grained version control and patching, secure state management, multi-agent scheduling, and extensible communication with external tools. PaperDebugger addresses these challenges through a Chrome-approved extension, a Kubernetes-native orchestration layer, and a Model Context Protocol (MCP) toolchain that integrates literature search, reference lookup, document scoring, and revision pipelines. Our demo showcases a fully integrated workflow, including localized edits, structured reviews, parallel agent execution, and diff-based updates, encapsulated within a minimal-intrusion user interface (UI). Early aggregated analytics demonstrate active user engagement and validate the practicality of an editor-native, agentic writing assistant.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个基于生成代理的MMO模拟系统，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）和强化学习（RL）技术，实现了对玩家行为的真实模拟和干预响应的因果分析，为数值设计优化提供了一个可靠、可解释且成本高效的框架。

Abstract: Optimizing numerical systems and mechanism design is crucial for enhancing player experience in Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games. Traditional optimization approaches rely on large-scale online experiments or parameter tuning over predefined statistical models, which are costly, time-consuming, and may disrupt player experience. Although simplified offline simulation systems are often adopted as alternatives, their limited fidelity prevents agents from accurately mimicking real player reasoning and reactions to interventions. To address these limitations, we propose a generative agent-based MMO simulation system empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). By applying Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on large-scale real player behavioral data, we adapt LLMs from general priors to game-specific domains, enabling realistic and interpretable player decision-making. In parallel, a data-driven environment model trained on real gameplay logs reconstructs dynamic in-game systems. Experiments demonstrate strong consistency with real-world player behaviors and plausible causal responses under interventions, providing a reliable, interpretable, and cost-efficient framework for data-driven numerical design optimization.

Conclusion: IACT模型通过动态、递归的代理拓扑结构和双向对话机制，有效解决了传统静态工作流的局限性，并在实际部署中展现了其灵活性和错误纠正能力。

Abstract: This technical white paper introduces the Interactive Agents Call Tree (IACT), a computational model designed to address the limitations of static, hard-coded agent workflows. Unlike traditional systems that require pre-defined graphs or specialized programming, IACT operates as a general-purpose autonomous system driven purely by user dialogue. Given a high-level objective, the system autonomously grows a dynamic, recursive agent topology incrementally tailored to the problem's structure. This allows it to scale its organizational complexity to match open-ended tasks. To mitigate the error propagation inherent in unidirectional function calls, IACT introduces interactional redundancy by replacing rigid invocations with bidirectional, stateful dialogues. This mechanism enables runtime error correction and ambiguity resolution. We describe the architecture, design principles, and practical lessons behind the production deployment of this model in the kragent.ai system, presenting qualitative evidence from real-world workflows rather than exhaustive benchmark results.

Motivation: 探索强化学习之外的替代方法，以降低计算成本并提升语言模型的自我修正能力。

Method: 通过向推理链中注入人工错误并掩码，监督模型识别和修正这些错误。

Result: 该方法在简单合成任务上未能显著提升模型性能，且模型即使发现错误也常重复原错误。合成错误与策略错误的分布差异显著降低了微调模型的修正能力。

Conclusion: 监督学习结合合成错误注入的方法在提升语言模型自我修正能力方面效果有限，而基于策略的强化学习方法在这方面表现更优。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become the dominant paradigm for eliciting reasoning and self-correction capabilities in large language models, but its computational expense motivates exploration of alternatives. Inspired by techniques from autonomous driving and robotics, we investigate whether supervised learning with synthetic error injection can induce self-correction abilities in language models. Our approach inserts artificial errors into reasoning chains, masks them, and supervises the model to recognize and correct these mistakes. Despite the intuitive appeal of this method, we find that it fails to significantly improve performance even on simple synthetic tasks across multiple models. Moreover, even when the model catches its own error, it often parrots the original mistake. We find that the distribution shift of synthetic errors to on-policy errors significantly degrades the error-correction capabilities of the fine-tuned model, even with good synthetic coverage of on-policy errors. Our results help explain why on-policy reinforcement learning methods have proven uniquely effective for eliciting self-correction.

Abstract: Prediction markets allow users to trade on outcomes of real-world events, but are prone to fragmentation through overlapping questions, implicit equivalences, and hidden contradictions across markets. We present an agentic AI pipeline that autonomously (i) clusters markets into coherent topical groups using natural-language understanding over contract text and metadata, and (ii) identifies within-cluster market pairs whose resolved outcomes exhibit strong dependence, including same-outcome (correlated) and different-outcome (anti-correlated) relationships. Using a historical dataset of resolved markets on Polymarket, we evaluate the accuracy of the agent's relational predictions. We then translate discovered relationships into a simple trading strategy to quantify how these relationships map to actionable signals. Results show that agent-identified relationships achieve roughly 60-70% accuracy, and their induced trading strategies earn about 20% average returns over week-long horizons, highlighting the ability of agentic AI and large language models to uncover latent semantic structure in prediction markets.

Conclusion: R-Few框架通过结合轻量级人类监督和混合训练，实现了模型在数学和通用推理任务上的持续迭代改进，同时有效缓解了概念漂移和多样性崩溃问题。

Abstract: AI self-evolution has long been envisioned as a path toward superintelligence, where models autonomously acquire, refine, and internalize knowledge from their own learning experiences. Yet in practice, unguided self-evolving systems often plateau quickly or even degrade as training progresses. These failures arise from issues such as concept drift, diversity collapse, and mis-evolution, as models reinforce their own biases and converge toward low-entropy behaviors. To enable models to self-evolve in a stable and controllable manner while minimizing reliance on human supervision, we introduce R-Few, a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework that incorporates lightweight human oversight through in-context grounding and mixed training. At each iteration, the Challenger samples a small set of human-labeled examples to guide synthetic question generation, while the Solver jointly trains on human and synthetic examples under an online, difficulty-based curriculum. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Few achieves consistent and iterative improvements. For example, Qwen3-8B-Base improves by +3.0 points over R-Zero on math tasks and achieves performance on par with General-Reasoner, despite the latter being trained on 20 times more human data. Ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of grounded challenger training and curriculum-based solver training, and further analysis shows that R-Few mitigates drift, yielding more stable and controllable co-evolutionary dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测急性缺血性卒中（AIS）的结果对临床决策、患者咨询和资源分配至关重要，但非结构化的临床笔记限制了传统预测模型的应用。

Method: COPE采用基于开源LLaMA-3-8B模型的两步Chain-of-Thought框架：第一步生成临床推理，第二步输出mRS预测。

Result: COPE的MAE为1.01（95% CI 0.92-1.11），+/-1准确率为74.4%（69.9, 78.8%），精确准确率为32.8%（28.0, 37.6%），表现优于ClinicalBERT、Clinical ML和单步LLM。

Conclusion: COPE作为一种轻量级、可解释且保护隐私的开源框架，为从非结构化临床文本中预测结果提供了准确且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Predicting outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) guides clinical decision-making, patient counseling, and resource allocation. Clinical notes contain rich contextual information, but their unstructured nature limits their use in traditional predictive models. We developed and evaluated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Outcome Prediction Engine (COPE), a reasoning-enhanced large language model framework, for predicting 90-day functional outcomes after AIS from unstructured clinical notes. This study included 464 AIS patients with discharge summaries and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. COPE uses a two-step CoT framework based on sequential open-source LLaMA-3-8B models: the first generates clinical reasoning, and the second outputs an mRS prediction. We compared COPE with GPT-4.1, ClinicalBERT, a structured variable-based machine learning model (Clinical ML), and a single-step LLM without CoT. Performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), accuracy within +/-1 mRS point, and exact accuracy. COPE achieved an MAE of 1.01 (95% CI 0.92-1.11), +/-1 accuracy of 74.4% (69.9, 78.8%), and exact accuracy of 32.8% (28.0, 37.6%), comparable to GPT-4.1 and superior to ClinicalBERT [MAE 1.24 (1.13-1.36)], Clinical ML [1.28 (1.18-1.39)], and the single-step LLM [1.20 (1.09-1.33)]. Subgroup analyses showed consistent performance across sex and age, with slightly higher error among older patients, those undergoing thrombectomy, and those with longer summaries. These findings demonstrate that COPE, a lightweight, interpretable, and privacy-preserving open-source framework, provides an accurate and practical solution for outcome prediction from unstructured clinical text.

Abstract: The exponential growth of digital content presents significant challenges for content safety. Current moderation systems, often based on single models or fixed pipelines, exhibit limitations in identifying implicit risks and providing interpretable judgment processes. To address these issues, we propose Aetheria, a multimodal interpretable content safety framework based on multi-agent debate and collaboration.Employing a collaborative architecture of five core agents, Aetheria conducts in-depth analysis and adjudication of multimodal content through a dynamic, mutually persuasive debate mechanism, which is grounded by RAG-based knowledge retrieval.Comprehensive experiments on our proposed benchmark (AIR-Bench) validate that Aetheria not only generates detailed and traceable audit reports but also demonstrates significant advantages over baselines in overall content safety accuracy, especially in the identification of implicit risks. This framework establishes a transparent and interpretable paradigm, significantly advancing the field of trustworthy AI content moderation.

Abstract: Prevalent empathy prediction techniques primarily concentrate on a singular modality, typically textual, thus neglecting multi-modal processing capabilities. They also overlook the utilization of certain privileged information, which may encompass additional empathetic content. In response, we introduce an advanced multi-modal empathy prediction method integrating video, audio, and text information. The method comprises the Multi-Modal Empathy Prediction and Supervisory Documentation Assisted Training. We use pre-trained networks in the empathy prediction network to extract features from various modalities, followed by a cross-modal fusion. This process yields a multi-modal feature representation, which is employed to predict empathy labels. To enhance the extraction of text features, we incorporate supervisory documents as privileged information during the assisted training phase. Specifically, we apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to identify potential topic distributions to constrain text features. These supervisory documents, created by supervisors, focus on the counseling topics and the counselor's display of empathy. Notably, this privileged information is only available during training and is not accessible during the prediction phase. Experimental results on the multi-modal and dialogue empathy datasets demonstrate that our approach is superior to the existing methods.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) in machinery can significantly diminish maintenance costs, enhance equipment up-time, and mitigate adverse outcomes. Data-driven RUL prediction techniques have demonstrated commendable performance. However, their efficacy often relies on the assumption that training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution or domain, which does not hold in real industrial settings. To mitigate this domain discrepancy issue, prior adversarial domain adaptation methods focused on deriving domain-invariant features. Nevertheless, they overlook target-specific information and inconsistency characteristics pertinent to the degradation stages, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel domain adaptation approach for cross-domain RUL prediction named TACDA. Specifically, we propose a target domain reconstruction strategy within the adversarial adaptation process, thereby retaining target-specific information while learning domain-invariant features. Furthermore, we develop a novel clustering and pairing strategy for consistent alignment between similar degradation stages. Through extensive experiments, our results demonstrate the remarkable performance of our proposed TACDA method, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches with regard to two different evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Linear temporal logic (LTL) is a compelling framework for specifying complex, structured tasks for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Recent work has shown that interpreting LTL instructions as finite automata, which can be seen as high-level programs monitoring task progress, enables learning a single generalist policy capable of executing arbitrary instructions at test time. However, existing approaches fall short in environments where multiple high-level events (i.e., atomic propositions) can be true at the same time and potentially interact in complicated ways. In this work, we propose a novel approach to learning a multi-task policy for following arbitrary LTL instructions that addresses this shortcoming. Our method conditions the policy on sequences of simple Boolean formulae, which directly align with transitions in the automaton, and are encoded via a graph neural network (GNN) to yield structured task representations. Experiments in a complex chess-based environment demonstrate the advantages of our approach.

Conclusion: 标准Transformer架构在处理超出训练深度的递归问题时表现不佳，但通过提出的循环定位-替换管道方法，可以有效缓解性能下降问题。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across many tasks, yet face significant challenges when dealing with recursive reasoning problems, those requiring the resolution of nested hierarchical structures. While prior research has extensively studied length generalization (a model's ability to handle longer sequences than seen during training), we investigate a distinct and underexplored limitation: depth generalization. Here, depth refers to the number of nested levels in a hierarchical problem, such as the layers of parentheses in a mathematical expression or the nesting of logical clauses in a Boolean formula. Our work reveals that standard transformer architectures struggle with problems involving deeper recursion than encountered during training, even when they perform well on longer but non-nested sequences. This limitation stems from their inability to maintain stack-like behavior, the capacity to track and resolve multiple levels of nested dependencies. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate how this architectural constraint leads to rapid performance decay as the depth of the recursion increases. To address this challenge, we develop a novel looped locate-and-replace pipeline that decomposes recursive problems into manageable subcomponents. The approach employs two specialized models: a locator that identifies solvable subexpressions and a replacer that evaluates these components while preserving the overall structure. We evaluated this method in three carefully designed domains: Boolean algebra, recursive arithmetic, and propositional logic, each with a controllable depth of recursion. We show that our method effectively alleviates the performance decay when tested on out-of-distribution recursion depth.

Result: 在DFEW基准测试中，MIGR将正确预测但伴随情感不一致解释的实例从18.10%降至7.37%。

Conclusion: MIGR框架通过从情感主导模态开始推理，显著提高了多模态情感理解的可靠性，减少了情感不一致解释的情况。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Modality-Importance-Guided Reasoning (MIGR), a framework designed to improve the reliability of reasoning-based multimodal emotion understanding in multimodal large language models. Although existing methods have advanced emotion understanding, they often suffer from reasoning drift: models gradually rely on their own generated text instead of multimodal evidence, and their explanations are overly shaped by visually initiated reasoning paths. To address these issues, we introduce Modality Importance (MI), a simple yet effective mechanism for identifying the emotion-dominant modality. Using MI, MIGR reorganizes reasoning sequences so that explanations begin from the modality most critical to the target emotion, preventing early reasoning from being misled by less informative cues. Our two-stage framework-comprising modality-aligned supervised fine-tuning and modality-aware reward optimization-encourages models to generate emotionally grounded, causally relevant, and coherence-preserving explanations. Experimental results on the DFEW benchmark show that MIGR substantially improves reasoning reliability, decreasing instances of correct predictions accompanied by emotionally inconsistent explanations from 18.10% to 7.37%. These results confirm the benefit of initiating reasoning from the emotion-dominant modality.

We introduce a framework for interpreting generative outputs through the automatic construction of ontologyaligned knowledge graphs (KGs). While automatic KG construction from natural text has advanced, extracting structured and ontology-consistent representations from visual content remains challenging -- due to the richness and multi-object nature of images. Leveraging multimodal large language models (LLMs), our method extracts structured triples from images, aligned with a domain-specific ontology. By comparing the KGs of generated and training images, we can trace potential influences, enabling copyright analysis, dataset transparency, and interpretable AI. We validate our method through experiments on locally trained models via unlearning, and on large-scale models through a style-specific experiment. Our framework supports the development of AI systems that foster human collaboration, creativity and stimulate curiosity.

TL;DR: Menta是一种优化的轻量级小型语言模型，专为社交媒体心理健康预测设计，性能优于现有SLM和部分LLM，并支持实时设备部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLM）在心理健康应用中有潜力，但其规模和计算需求限制了实际部署。小型语言模型（SLM）提供了轻量级替代方案，但在社交媒体心理健康预测方面的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 研究引入了Menta，这是一个专门针对社交媒体数据的多任务心理健康预测优化的SLM，采用LoRA框架、跨数据集策略和平衡准确率导向的损失函数进行联合训练。

Result: Menta在六个分类任务中平均提升了15.2%的准确率，优于非微调的SLM，并在抑郁和压力分类任务中超越了13B参数的LLM，同时模型体积小约3.25倍，且在iPhone 15 Pro Max上实现了实时部署，仅需约3GB内存。

Conclusion: Menta展示了轻量级小型语言模型（SLM）在社交媒体心理健康预测中的潜力，实现了实时、隐私保护的部署，为可扩展的心理健康监测提供了新方向。

Abstract: Mental health conditions affect hundreds of millions globally, yet early detection remains limited. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in mental health applications, their size and computational demands hinder practical deployment. Small language models (SLMs) offer a lightweight alternative, but their use for social media--based mental health prediction remains largely underexplored. In this study, we introduce Menta, the first optimized SLM fine-tuned specifically for multi-task mental health prediction from social media data. Menta is jointly trained across six classification tasks using a LoRA-based framework, a cross-dataset strategy, and a balanced accuracy--oriented loss. Evaluated against nine state-of-the-art SLM baselines, Menta achieves an average improvement of 15.2\% across tasks covering depression, stress, and suicidality compared with the best-performing non--fine-tuned SLMs. It also achieves higher accuracy on depression and stress classification tasks compared to 13B-parameter LLMs, while being approximately 3.25x smaller. Moreover, we demonstrate real-time, on-device deployment of Menta on an iPhone 15 Pro Max, requiring only approximately 3GB RAM. Supported by a comprehensive benchmark against existing SLMs and LLMs, Menta highlights the potential for scalable, privacy-preserving mental health monitoring.

Motivation: 股票价格预测受市场波动和实时事件影响大，现有大型语言模型（LLMs）在金融领域应用受限，因新闻数据噪声大且缺乏明确答案。

Method: 提出StockMem，一种事件-反射双层次记忆框架，通过横向整合和纵向跟踪挖掘新闻事件，构建时间事件知识库和反射知识库。

Result: 实验表明StockMem优于现有记忆架构，提供更优、可解释的推理，增强金融预测的决策透明度。

Conclusion: StockMem框架通过构建时间事件知识库和因果经验反射知识库，显著提升了股票价格预测的准确性和可解释性，优于现有记忆架构。

Abstract: Stock price prediction is challenging due to market volatility and its sensitivity to real-time events. While large language models (LLMs) offer new avenues for text-based forecasting, their application in finance is hindered by noisy news data and the lack of explicit answers in text. General-purpose memory architectures struggle to identify the key drivers of price movements. To address this, we propose StockMem, an event-reflection dual-layer memory framework. It structures news into events and mines them along two dimensions: horizontal consolidation integrates daily events, while longitudinal tracking captures event evolution to extract incremental information reflecting market expectation discrepancies. This builds a temporal event knowledge base. By analyzing event-price dynamics, the framework further forms a reflection knowledge base of causal experiences. For prediction, it retrieves analogous historical scenarios and reasons with current events, incremental data, and past experiences. Experiments show StockMem outperforms existing memory architectures and provides superior, explainable reasoning by tracing the information chain affecting prices, enhancing decision transparency in financial forecasting.

Abstract: Auditors rely on Journal Entry Tests (JETs) to detect anomalies in tax-related ledger records, but rule-based methods generate overwhelming false positives and struggle with subtle irregularities. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as anomaly detectors in double-entry bookkeeping. Benchmarking SoTA LLMs such as LLaMA and Gemma on both synthetic and real-world anonymized ledgers, we compare them against JETs and machine learning baselines.

Conclusion: 该论文通过推导方差不等式，为自改进的稳定性提供了充分条件，并将GVU算子应用于统一语言自玩、自我纠正和合成数据引导等最新文献。

Abstract: We extend the moduli-theoretic framework of psychometric batteries to the domain of dynamical systems. While previous work established the AAI capability score as a static functional on the space of agent representations, this paper formalizes the agent as a flow $ν_r$ parameterized by computational resource $r$, governed by a recursive Generator-Verifier-Updater (GVU) operator. We prove that this operator generates a vector field on the parameter manifold $Θ$, and we identify the coefficient of self-improvement $κ$ as the Lie derivative of the capability functional along this flow.
  The central contribution of this work is the derivation of the Variance Inequality, a spectral condition that is sufficient (under mild regularity) for the stability of self-improvement. We show that a sufficient condition for $κ> 0$ is that, up to curvature and step-size effects, the combined noise of generation and verification must be small enough.
  We then apply this formalism to unify the recent literature on Language Self-Play (LSP), Self-Correction, and Synthetic Data bootstrapping. We demonstrate that architectures such as STaR, SPIN, Reflexion, GANs and AlphaZero are specific topological realizations of the GVU operator that satisfy the Variance Inequality through filtration, adversarial discrimination, or grounding in formal systems.

Abstract: This work presents a conceptual framework for causal concept-based post-hoc Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), based on the requirements that explanations for non-interpretable models should be understandable as well as faithful to the model being explained. Local and global explanations are generated by calculating the probability of sufficiency of concept interventions. Example explanations are presented, generated with a proof-of-concept model made to explain classifiers trained on the CelebA dataset. Understandability is demonstrated through a clear concept-based vocabulary, subject to an implicit causal interpretation. Fidelity is addressed by highlighting important framework assumptions, stressing that the context of explanation interpretation must align with the context of explanation generation.

Abstract: Automated paper reproduction has emerged as a promising approach to accelerate scientific research, employing multi-step workflow frameworks to systematically convert academic papers into executable code. However, existing frameworks often lack mechanisms to verify and refine the outputs at each generation step, or rely heavily on manually designed prompts for self-refinement, which limits their adaptability and scalability. To address these limitations, we propose a prompt-free collaborative agent framework that automatically enhances the quality of paper-to-code generation. Our approach employs two collaborative agents: a verification agent that examines whether the outputs at each step satisfy the requirements specified in the corresponding system prompt, and a refinement agent that revises the outputs based on the identified issues. Unlike previous methods that require human experts to craft specific refinement prompts for each step, our framework achieves automatic verification and improvement by leveraging only the original system prompts. We integrate our collaborative agents into the Paper2Code framework and conduct comprehensive experiments on PaperBench Code-Dev and Paper2CodeBench datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the accuracy and completeness of reproduced code, achieving performance gains of approximately 15\% and 13\%, respectively, compared to the baseline without our agents. Furthermore, comparative experiments against Self-Refine validate the robustness and consistency of our prompt-free approach across different datasets.

Conclusion: Radiologist Copilot通过整合工具和大型语言模型，显著提升了放射学报告的准确性和效率，超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Radiology reporting is an essential yet time-consuming and error-prone task for radiologists in clinical examinations, especially for volumetric medical images. Rigorous quality control is also critical but tedious, ensuring that the final report meets clinical standards. Existing automated approaches, including radiology report generation methods and medical vision-language models, focus mainly on the report generation phase and neglect the crucial quality control procedure, limiting their capability to provide comprehensive support to radiologists. We propose Radiologist Copilot, an agentic AI assistant equipped with orchestrated tools designed for automated radiology reporting with quality control. Leveraging large language models as the reasoning backbone, the agentic system autonomously selects tools, plans, and executes actions, emulating the behavior of radiologists throughout the holistic radiology reporting process. The orchestrated tools include region localization, think with image paradigm directed region analysis planning, strategic template selection for report generation, quality assessment and feedback-driven adaptive refinement for quality control. Therefore, Radiologist Copilot facilitates accurate, complete, and efficient radiology reporting, assisting radiologists and improving clinical efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that Radiologist Copilot significantly surpasses other state-of-the-art methods in radiology reporting. The source code will be released upon acceptance.

*Zhonghao He,Tianyi Qiu,Hirokazu Shirado,Maarten Sap*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Martingale Score to measure belief entrenchment in LLMs, finding it widespread across domains and validating the score as a truth-seeking proxy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate belief entrenchment in LLM reasoning, as iterative reasoning may foster confirmation bias rather than truth-seeking behavior.

Method: The study proposes an unsupervised, regression-based Martingale Score to measure violations of the Martingale property, signaling deviation from Bayesian belief updating. It evaluates this across various domains like event forecasting, value-laden questions, and academic paper review.

Result: Violations of the Martingale property (belief entrenchment) are widespread across models and setups, with current beliefs positively predicting future updates. The study identifies models, techniques, and domains more prone to this phenomenon.

Conclusion: The Martingale Score is a useful proxy for the truth-seeking ability of a reasoning process, validated by its ability to predict ground-truth accuracy in domains where labels are available.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning techniques have substantially improved the performance of large language models (LLMs), raising expectations for their ability to provide accurate, truthful, and reliable information. However, emerging evidence suggests that iterative reasoning may foster belief entrenchment and confirmation bias, rather than enhancing truth-seeking behavior. In this study, we propose a systematic evaluation framework for belief entrenchment in LLM reasoning by leveraging the Martingale property from Bayesian statistics. This property implies that, under rational belief updating, the expected value of future beliefs should remain equal to the current belief, i.e., belief updates are unpredictable from the current belief. We propose the unsupervised, regression-based Martingale Score to measure violations of this property, which signal deviation from the Bayesian ability of updating on new evidence. In open-ended problem domains including event forecasting, value-laden questions, and academic paper review, we find such violations to be widespread across models and setups, where the current belief positively predicts future belief updates, a phenomenon which we term belief entrenchment. We identify the models, reasoning techniques, and domains more prone to belief entrenchment. Finally, we validate the Martingale Score by showing that it predicts ground-truth accuracy on problem domains where ground truth labels are available. This indicates that, while designed as an unsupervised metric that operates even in domains without access to ground truth, the Martingale Score is a useful proxy of the truth-seeking ability of a reasoning process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现有方法（如偏好示例训练、提示和输入/输出过滤）在提升LLM对抗对抗攻击和不当行为的鲁棒性方面取得了一定成果，但LLM仍易受滥用，且随着上下文长度增加，越狱概率上升。因此，需要一种在长上下文情境下提供鲁棒安全保证的方法。

Method: 通过在LLM上下文中插入控制句（control sentences）进行侵入式上下文工程。

Result: 侵入式上下文工程避免了长上下文情境下模型训练中的数据短缺问题，并为LLM安全提供了新的解决思路。

Conclusion: 侵入式上下文工程（Invasive Context Engineering）提供了一种不依赖LLM训练的解决方案，能够部分解决长上下文情境下的LLM安全问题，并可推广至思维链（Chain-of-Thought）过程以防止欺骗行为。

Abstract: Current research on operator control of Large Language Models improves model robustness against adversarial attacks and misbehavior by training on preference examples, prompting, and input/output filtering. Despite good results, LLMs remain susceptible to abuse, and jailbreak probability increases with context length. There is a need for robust LLM security guarantees in long-context situations. We propose control sentences inserted into the LLM context as invasive context engineering to partially solve the problem. We suggest this technique can be generalized to the Chain-of-Thought process to prevent scheming. Invasive Context Engineering does not rely on LLM training, avoiding data shortage pitfalls which arise in training models for long context situations.

Conclusion: 当前的大型语言模型（LLMs）作为在线社交调解的新兴代理，展现了潜力但也存在局限性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities for AI for good applications. As LLMs increasingly mediate online communication, their potential to foster empathy and constructive dialogue becomes an important frontier for responsible AI research. This work explores whether LLMs can serve not only as moderators that detect harmful content, but as mediators capable of understanding and de-escalating online conflicts. Our framework decomposes mediation into two subtasks: judgment, where an LLM evaluates the fairness and emotional dynamics of a conversation, and steering, where it generates empathetic, de-escalatory messages to guide participants toward resolution. To assess mediation quality, we construct a large Reddit-based dataset and propose a multi-stage evaluation pipeline combining principle-based scoring, user simulation, and human comparison. Experiments show that API-based models outperform open-source counterparts in both reasoning and intervention alignment when doing mediation. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current LLMs as emerging agents for online social mediation.

Abstract: For the task with complicated manipulation in unstructured environments, traditional hand-coded methods are ineffective, while reinforcement learning can provide more general and useful policy. Although the reinforcement learning is able to obtain impressive results, its stability and reliability is hard to guarantee, which would cause the potential safety threats. Besides, the transfer from simulation to real world also will lead in unpredictable situations. To enhance the safety and reliability of robots, we introduce the force and haptic perception into reinforcement learning. Force and tactual sensation play key roles in robotic dynamic control and human-robot interaction. We demonstrate that the force-based reinforcement learning method can be more adaptive to environment, especially in sim-to-real transfer. Experimental results show in object pushing task, our strategy is safer and more efficient in both simulation and real world, thus it holds prospects for a wide variety of robotic applications.

Conclusion: 论文提出了$Φ$IREMAN算法，通过物理启发的势场方法解决了RTNUA问题，在模拟实验中表现出色，尤其在大型任务和无人机群中保持了高任务正常运行时间。

Abstract: Fast, efficient, robust communication during wildfire and other emergency responses is critical. One way to achieve this is by coordinating swarms of autonomous aerial vehicles carrying communications equipment to form an ad-hoc network connecting emergency response personnel to both each other and central command. However, operating in such extreme environments may lead to individual networking agents being damaged or rendered inoperable, which could bring down the network and interrupt communications.
  To overcome this challenge and enable multi-agent UAV networking in difficult environments, this paper introduces and formalizes the problem of Robust Task Networking Under Attrition (RTNUA), which extends connectivity maintenance in multi-robot systems to explicitly address proactive redundancy and attrition recovery. We introduce Physics-Informed Robust Employment of Multi-Agent Networks ($Φ$IREMAN), a topological algorithm leveraging physics-inspired potential fields to solve this problem. Through simulation across 25 problem configurations, $Φ$IREMAN consistently outperforms the DCCRS baseline, and on large-scale problems with up to 100 tasks and 500 drones, maintains $>99.9\%$ task uptime despite substantial attrition, demonstrating both effectiveness and scalability.

Our method tightly couples visual and inertial cues within a unified optimization framework, jointly refining camera poses, depths, and IMU states. It features robust IMU initialization, time-varying bias modeling, and loop closure with consistent Gaussian updates. Experiments on four challenging datasets demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Project page: https://vigs-slam.github.io

Conclusion: VDD方法通过解耦自我车辆动力学和环境过渡动力学的建模，显著提升了自动驾驶的性能和鲁棒性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: World models have gained significant attention as a promising approach for autonomous driving. By emulating human-like perception and decision-making processes, these models can predict and adapt to dynamic environments. Existing methods typically map high-dimensional observations into compact latent spaces and learn optimal policies within these latent representations. However, prior work usually jointly learns ego-vehicle dynamics and environmental transition dynamics from the image input, leading to inefficiencies and a lack of robustness to variations in vehicle dynamics. To address these issues, we propose the Vehicle Dynamics embedded Dreamer (VDD) method, which decouples the modeling of ego-vehicle dynamics from environmental transition dynamics. This separation allows the world model to generalize effectively across vehicles with diverse parameters. Additionally, we introduce two strategies to further enhance the robustness of the learned policy: Policy Adjustment during Deployment (PAD) and Policy Augmentation during Training (PAT). Comprehensive experiments in simulated environments demonstrate that the proposed model significantly improves both driving performance and robustness to variations in vehicle dynamics, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Information gathering in large-scale or time-critical scenarios (e.g., environmental monitoring, search and rescue) requires broad coverage within limited time budgets, motivating the use of multi-agent systems. These scenarios are commonly formulated as multi-agent informative path planning (MAIPP), where multiple agents must coordinate to maximize information gain while operating under budget constraints. A central challenge in MAIPP is ensuring effective coordination while the belief over the environment evolves with incoming measurements. Recent learning-based approaches address this by using distributions over future positions as "intent" to support coordination. However, these autoregressive intent predictors are computationally expensive and prone to compounding errors. Inspired by the effectiveness of diffusion models as expressive, long-horizon policies, we propose AID, a fully decentralized MAIPP framework that leverages diffusion models to generate long-term trajectories in a non-autoregressive manner. AID first performs behavior cloning on trajectories produced by existing MAIPP planners and then fine-tunes the policy using reinforcement learning via Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization (DPPO). This two-stage pipeline enables the policy to inherit expert behavior while learning improved coordination through online reward feedback. Experiments demonstrate that AID consistently improves upon the MAIPP planners it is trained from, achieving up to 4x faster execution and 17% increased information gain, while scaling effectively to larger numbers of agents. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/marmotlab/AID.

TL;DR: A robotic capabilities framework was developed to bridge technical and experiential knowledge, guiding human-robot collaboration design through transdisciplinary dialogue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The design of human-robot collaboration is often led by monodisciplinary approaches, neglecting interdisciplinary knowledge and workers' experiential knowledge, highlighting the need for a transdisciplinary framework.

Method: The framework was developed through reflexive and iterative processes, applied in two settings: engaging roboticists to describe existing commercial robots and a design activity with students working on robotics-related projects.

Result: The framework supports dialogue on high-level robotic capabilities, helping determine which task elements should remain human-led and which can be delegated to robots.

Conclusion: The robotic capabilities framework serves as an intermediate-level knowledge artifact and boundary object, bridging technical and experiential domains to guide designers, empower workers, and foster just and collaborative futures of work.

Abstract: As robots become more adaptable, responsive, and capable of interacting with humans, the design of effective human-robot collaboration becomes critical. Yet, this design process is typically led by monodisciplinary approaches, often overlooking interdisciplinary knowledge and the experiential knowledge of workers who will ultimately share tasks with these systems. To address this gap, we introduce the robotic capabilities framework, a vocabulary that enables transdisciplinary collaborations to meaningfully shape the future of work when robotic systems are integrated into the workplace. Rather than focusing on the internal workings of robots, the framework centers discussion on high-level capabilities, supporting dialogue around which elements of a task should remain human-led and which can be delegated to robots. We developed the framework through reflexive and iterative processes, and applied it in two distinct settings: by engaging roboticists in describing existing commercial robots using its vocabulary, and through a design activity with students working on robotics-related projects. The framework emerges as an intermediate-level knowledge artifact and a boundary object that bridges technical and experiential domains, guiding designers, empowering workers, and contributing to more just and collaborative futures of work.

Conclusion: SAM2Grasp通过引入基于提示的单模态预测框架，有效解决了机器人抓取中的多模态问题，实现了在杂乱多目标场景下的最先进性能。

Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic grasping is often plagued by the multimodal problem: when a scene contains multiple valid targets, demonstrations of grasping different objects create conflicting training signals. Standard imitation learning policies fail by averaging these distinct actions into a single, invalid action. In this paper, we introduce SAM2Grasp, a novel framework that resolves this issue by reformulating the task as a uni-modal, prompt-conditioned prediction problem. Our method leverages the frozen SAM2 model to use its powerful visual temporal tracking capability and introduces a lightweight, trainable action head that operates in parallel with its native segmentation head. This design allows for training only the small action head on pre-computed temporal-visual features from SAM2. During inference, an initial prompt, such as a bounding box provided by an upstream object detection model, designates the specific object to be grasped. This prompt conditions the action head to predict a unique, unambiguous grasp trajectory for that object alone. In all subsequent video frames, SAM2's built-in temporal tracking capability automatically maintains stable tracking of the selected object, enabling our model to continuously predict the grasp trajectory from the video stream without further external guidance. This temporal-prompted approach effectively eliminates ambiguity from the visuomotor policy. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that SAM2Grasp achieves state-of-the-art performance in cluttered, multi-object grasping tasks.

Conclusion: Robowheel提供了一种轻量级、通用的方法，通过单目RGB(D)摄像头提取跨形态的运动表示，验证了HOI模态可作为机器人学习的有效监督。

Abstract: We introduce Robowheel, a data engine that converts human hand object interaction (HOI) videos into training-ready supervision for cross morphology robotic learning. From monocular RGB or RGB-D inputs, we perform high precision HOI reconstruction and enforce physical plausibility via a reinforcement learning (RL) optimizer that refines hand object relative poses under contact and penetration constraints. The reconstructed, contact rich trajectories are then retargeted to cross-embodiments, robot arms with simple end effectors, dexterous hands, and humanoids, yielding executable actions and rollouts. To scale coverage, we build a simulation-augmented framework on Isaac Sim with diverse domain randomization (embodiments, trajectories, object retrieval, background textures, hand motion mirroring), which enriches the distributions of trajectories and observations while preserving spatial relationships and physical plausibility. The entire data pipeline forms an end to end pipeline from video,reconstruction,retargeting,augmentation data acquisition. We validate the data on mainstream vision language action (VLA) and imitation learning architectures, demonstrating that trajectories produced by our pipeline are as stable as those from teleoperation and yield comparable continual performance gains. To our knowledge, this provides the first quantitative evidence that HOI modalities can serve as effective supervision for robotic learning. Compared with teleoperation, Robowheel is lightweight, a single monocular RGB(D) camera is sufficient to extract a universal, embodiment agnostic motion representation that could be flexibly retargeted across embodiments. We further assemble a large scale multimodal dataset combining multi-camera captures, monocular videos, and public HOI corpora for training and evaluating embodied models.

Abstract: Safe autonomous driving in mixed traffic requires a unified understanding of multimodal interactions and dynamic planning under uncertainty. Existing learning based approaches struggle to capture rare but safety critical behaviors, while rule based systems often lack adaptability in complex interactions. To address these limitations, CogDrive introduces a cognition driven multimodal prediction and planning framework that integrates explicit modal reasoning with safety aware trajectory optimization. The prediction module adopts cognitive representations of interaction modes based on topological motion semantics and nearest neighbor relational encoding. With a differentiable modal loss and multimodal Gaussian decoding, CogDrive learns sparse and unbalanced interaction behaviors and improves long horizon trajectory prediction. The planning module incorporates an emergency response concept and optimizes safety stabilized trajectories, where short term consistent branches ensure safety during replanning cycles and long term branches support smooth and collision free motion under low probability switching modes. Experiments on Argoverse2 and INTERACTION datasets show that CogDrive achieves strong performance in trajectory accuracy and miss rate, while closed loop simulations confirm adaptive behavior in merge and intersection scenarios. By combining cognitive multimodal prediction with safety oriented planning, CogDrive offers an interpretable and reliable paradigm for safe autonomy in complex traffic.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently achieved remarkable progress in robotic manipulation, yet they remain limited in failure diagnosis and learning from failures. Additionally, existing failure datasets are mostly generated programmatically in simulation, which limits their generalization to the real world. In light of these, we introduce ViFailback, a framework designed to diagnose robotic manipulation failures and provide both textual and visual correction guidance. Our framework utilizes explicit visual symbols to enhance annotation efficiency. We further release the ViFailback dataset, a large-scale collection of 58,126 Visual Question Answering (VQA) pairs along with their corresponding 5,202 real-world manipulation trajectories. Based on the dataset, we establish ViFailback-Bench, a benchmark of 11 fine-grained VQA tasks designed to assess the failure diagnosis and correction abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), featuring ViFailback-Bench Lite for closed-ended and ViFailback-Bench Hard for open-ended evaluation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we built the ViFailback-8B VLM, which not only achieves significant overall performance improvement on ViFailback-Bench but also generates visual symbols for corrective action guidance. Finally, by integrating ViFailback-8B with a VLA model, we conduct real-world robotic experiments demonstrating its ability to assist the VLA model in recovering from failures.

Motivation: Address the lack of rigorous validation and benchmarking of LLM approaches in construction robotics against traditional methods like Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning.

Method: Introduces the LangGraph-based Task Allocation Agent (LTAA), an LLM-driven framework with phase-adaptive allocation strategies, multi-stage validation, and dynamic prompting.

Result: LTAA achieves 77% task completion with superior workload balance in the Heavy Excels setting, reducing token usage by 94.6% and allocation time by 86%.

Conclusion: LLM-based reasoning with structured validation can match established optimization algorithms while offering additional advantages such as interpretability, adaptability, and the ability to update task logic without retraining.

Abstract: Multi-robot task allocation in construction automation has traditionally relied on optimization methods such as Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning. This research introduces the LangGraph-based Task Allocation Agent (LTAA), an LLM-driven framework that integrates phase-adaptive allocation strategies, multi-stage validation with hierarchical retries, and dynamic prompting for efficient robot coordination. Although recent LLM approaches show potential for construction robotics, they largely lack rigorous validation and benchmarking against established algorithms. This paper presents the first systematic comparison of LLM-based task allocation with traditional methods in construction scenarios.The study validates LLM feasibility through SMART-LLM replication and addresses implementation challenges using a Self-Corrective Agent Architecture. LTAA leverages natural-language reasoning combined with structured validation mechanisms, achieving major computational gains reducing token usage by 94.6% and allocation time by 86% through dynamic prompting. The framework adjusts its strategy across phases: emphasizing execution feasibility early and workload balance in later allocations.The authors evaluate LTAA against Dynamic Programming, Q-learning, and Deep Q-Network (DQN) baselines using construction operations from the TEACh human-robot collaboration dataset. In the Heavy Excels setting, where robots have strong task specializations, LTAA achieves 77% task completion with superior workload balance, outperforming all traditional methods. These findings show that LLM-based reasoning with structured validation can match established optimization algorithms while offering additional advantages such as interpretability, adaptability, and the ability to update task logic without retraining.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, trained via flow-matching or diffusion objectives, excel at learning complex behaviors from large-scale, multi-modal datasets (e.g., human teleoperation, scripted policies). However, since VLAs incorporate diverse data modes in the pre-training stage, and the finetuning dataset often contains demonstration data collected in a kinematically suboptimal or undesirable way, it exists redundant action modes that are irrelevant to the success action modes of the downstream task. Specifically, we observe a critical inference-time fragility among various sampled noises after supervised finetuning of pre-trained VLAs. In this paper, we attribute this instability to the distribution shift between the VLA policy and the policy induced by stable success modes of the downstream task dataset. Thus, we propose \textbf{TACO}, a test-time-scaling (TTS) framework that applies a lightweight pseudo-count estimator as a high-fidelity verifier of action chunks. The VLA models integrated with TACO can execute the actions with maximum pseudo-count from all sampled action chunks, thereby preventing distribution shifts while preserving the generalization ability of VLAs since the constraint is applied only during inference. Our method resembles the classical anti-exploration principle in offline reinforcement learning (RL), and being gradient-free, it incurs significant computational benefits compared to RL update, especially for flow or diffusion-based VLAs which are difficult to perform RL update due to denoising process. Extensive experiments across four simulation benchmarks (RoboTwin2.0, Robotwin, LIBERO, SimplerEnv) and a dual-arm platform demonstrate that our method significantly improves the inference stability and success rates in downstream-task adaptations.

Abstract: The safe deployment of autonomous driving systems (ADSs) relies on comprehensive testing and evaluation. However, safety-critical scenarios that can effectively expose system vulnerabilities are extremely sparse in the real world. Existing scenario generation methods face challenges in efficiently constructing long-tail scenarios that ensure fidelity, criticality, and interactivity, while particularly lacking real-time dynamic response capabilities to the vehicle under test (VUT). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a safety-critical testing scenario generation framework that integrates the high-level semantic understanding capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with the fine-grained generation capabilities of adaptive guided diffusion models. The framework establishes a three-layer hierarchical architecture comprising a strategic layer for VLM-directed scenario generation objective determination, a tactical layer for guidance function formulation, and an operational layer for guided diffusion execution. We first establish a high-quality fundamental diffusion model that learns the data distribution of real driving scenarios. Next, we design an adaptive guided diffusion method that enables real-time, precise control of background vehicles (BVs) in closed-loop simulation. The VLM is then incorporated to autonomously generate scenario generation objectives and guidance functions through deep scenario understanding and risk reasoning, ultimately guiding the diffusion model to achieve VLM-directed scenario generation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently generate realistic, diverse, and highly interactive safety-critical testing scenarios. Furthermore, case studies validate the adaptability and VLM-directed generation performance of the proposed method.

Conclusion: SwarmDiffusion提供了一种可扩展、无需提示的方法，实现了统一的遍历性推理和轨迹生成，适用于不同机器人平台，并在仿真和真实环境中展现了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Visual traversability estimation is critical for autonomous navigation, but existing VLM-based methods rely on hand-crafted prompts, generalize poorly across embodiments, and output only traversability maps, leaving trajectory generation to slow external planners. We propose SwarmDiffusion, a lightweight end-to-end diffusion model that jointly predicts traversability and generates a feasible trajectory from a single RGB image. To remove the need for annotated or planner-produced paths, we introduce a planner-free trajectory construction pipeline based on randomized waypoint sampling, Bezier smoothing, and regularization enforcing connectivity, safety, directionality, and path thinness. This enables learning stable motion priors without demonstrations. SwarmDiffusion leverages VLM-derived supervision without prompt engineering and conditions the diffusion process on a compact embodiment state, producing physically consistent, traversable paths that transfer across different robot platforms. Across indoor environments and two embodiments (quadruped and aerial), the method achieves 80-100\% navigation success and 0.09 s inference, and adapts to a new robot using only-500 additional visual samples. It generalizes reliably to unseen environments in simulation and real-world trials, offering a scalable, prompt-free approach to unified traversability reasoning and trajectory generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型在分布内表现良好，但在新型摄像机视角和视觉扰动下性能急剧下降。研究发现这种脆弱性主要源于空间建模的未对齐，而非物理建模。

Method: 提出了两种方法：特征标记调制（FTM）和特征线性适应（FLA）。FTM通过对视觉标记应用全局仿射变换，仅用4K参数就将Libero视角准确率从48.5%提升到87.1%。FLA则在ViT编码器中引入低秩更新，以4.7M参数实现90.8%的成功率，其成本远低于LoRA规模的微调。

Result: FTM和FLA方法显著提升了模型的视角泛化能力，FTM将准确率提升至87.1%，FLA进一步提升至90.8%，同时保持了较低的参数成本。

Conclusion: 预训练的视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型在空间建模方面的未对齐是其在新型摄像机视角和视觉扰动下性能下降的主要原因。通过轻量级、可学习的更新重新校准视觉表示，可以显著提升模型的鲁棒性和视角泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models achieve strong in-distribution performance but degrade sharply under novel camera viewpoints and visual perturbations. We show that this brittleness primarily arises from misalignment in Spatial Modeling, rather than Physical Modeling. To address this, we propose a one-shot adaptation framework that recalibrates visual representations through lightweight, learnable updates. Our first method, Feature Token Modulation (FTM), applies a global affine transformation to visual tokens and improves Libero viewpoint accuracy from 48.5% to 87.1% with only 4K parameters. Building on this, Feature Linear Adaptation (FLA) introduces low-rank updates to the ViT encoder, achieving 90.8% success with 4.7M parameters -- matching LoRA-scale finetuning at far lower cost. Together, these results reveal substantial untapped robustness in pretrained VLA models and demonstrate that targeted, minimal visual adaptation is sufficient to restore viewpoint generalization.

Abstract: Task-space control of robotic fingers is a critical enabler of dexterous manipulation, as manipulation objectives are most naturally specified in terms of fingertip motions and applied forces rather than individual joint angles. While task-space planning and control have been extensively studied for larger, arm-scale manipulators, demonstrations of precise task-space trajectory tracking in compact, multi-DoF robotic fingers remain scarce. In this paper, we present the physical prototyping and experimental characterization of a three-degree-of-freedom, linkage-driven, series-parallel robotic finger with analytic forward kinematics and a closed-form Jacobian. A resolved motion rate control (RMRC) scheme is implemented to achieve closed-loop task-space trajectory tracking. We experimentally evaluate the fingertip tracking performance across a variety of trajectories, including straight lines, circles, and more complex curves, and report millimeter-level accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides one of the first systematic experimental demonstrations of precise task-space trajectory tracking in a linkage-driven robotic finger, thereby establishing a benchmark for future designs aimed at dexterous in-hand manipulation.

Conclusion: Video2Act通过整合空间和运动感知表示，显著提升了机器人策略学习的性能，并在仿真和现实任务中超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Robust perception and dynamics modeling are fundamental to real-world robotic policy learning. Recent methods employ video diffusion models (VDMs) to enhance robotic policies, improving their understanding and modeling of the physical world. However, existing approaches overlook the coherent and physically consistent motion representations inherently encoded across frames in VDMs. To this end, we propose Video2Act, a framework that efficiently guides robotic action learning by explicitly integrating spatial and motion-aware representations. Building on the inherent representations of VDMs, we extract foreground boundaries and inter-frame motion variations while filtering out background noise and task-irrelevant biases. These refined representations are then used as additional conditioning inputs to a diffusion transformer (DiT) action head, enabling it to reason about what to manipulate and how to move. To mitigate inference inefficiency, we propose an asynchronous dual-system design, where the VDM functions as the slow System 2 and the DiT head as the fast System 1, working collaboratively to generate adaptive actions. By providing motion-aware conditions to System 1, Video2Act maintains stable manipulation even with low-frequency updates from the VDM. For evaluation, Video2Act surpasses previous state-of-the-art VLA methods by 7.7% in simulation and 21.7% in real-world tasks in terms of average success rate, further exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.

Result: 在PuTTY和7-Zip的多个版本上测试表明，Bin2Vec能生成优化且可视化的软件表示，例如PuTTY版本显示更复杂的行为和内存活动，而7-Zip版本更关注性能相关模式。

Conclusion: Bin2Vec提供了一种既可靠又可解释的软件比较方法，适用于审计、验证软件来源及网络安全等任务。

Abstract: We introduce Bin2Vec, a new framework that helps compare software programs in a clear and explainable way. Instead of focusing only on one type of information, Bin2Vec combines what a program looks like (its built-in functions, imports, and exports) with how it behaves when it runs (its instructions and memory usage). This gives a more complete picture when deciding whether two programs are similar or not. Bin2Vec represents these different types of information as views that can be inspected separately using easy-to-read charts, and then brings them together into an overall similarity score. Bin2Vec acts as a bridge between binary representations and machine learning techniques by generating feature representations that can be efficiently processed by machine-learning models. We tested Bin2Vec on multiple versions of two well-known Windows programs, PuTTY and 7-Zip. The primary results strongly confirmed that our method compute an optimal and visualization-friendly representation of the analyzed software. For example, PuTTY versions showed more complex behavior and memory activity, while 7-Zip versions focused more on performance-related patterns. Overall, Bin2Vec provides decisions that are both reliable and explainable to humans. Because it is modular and easy to extend, it can be applied to tasks like auditing, verifying software origins, or quickly screening large numbers of programs in cybersecurity and reverse-engineering work.

Abstract: This paper envisions a transformative paradigm in software engineering, where Artificial Intelligence, embodied in fully autonomous agents, becomes the primary driver of the core software development activities. We introduce a new class of software engineering agents, empowered by Large Language Models and equipped with beliefs, desires, intentions, and memory to enable human-like reasoning. These agents collaborate with humans and other agents to design, implement, test, and deploy software systems with a level of speed, reliability, and adaptability far beyond the current software development processes. Their coordination and collaboration are governed by norms expressed as deontic modalities - commitments, obligations, prohibitions and permissions - that regulate interactions and ensure regulatory compliance. These innovations establish a scalable, transparent and trustworthy framework for future Human-AI software engineering teams.

Motivation: 现有对智能代理系统的评估过于结果导向，缺乏对其推理、规划和行动过程的深入理解。

Method: 通过引入Graphectory，系统地编码智能代理系统的时空和语义关系，设计过程中心化指标和分析方法。

Result: 分析表明，使用更丰富提示或更强LLM的代理表现出更复杂的Graphectory，策略随问题难度和LLM变化，且成功系统常伴低效过程。

Conclusion: Graphectory提供了一种系统化的方法来评估智能代理系统的工作流程，不仅关注最终结果，还深入分析其推理、规划和行动过程。

Abstract: Agentic systems are modern software systems: they consist of orchestrated modules, expose interfaces, and are deployed in software pipelines. Unlike conventional programs, their execution (i.e., trajectories) is inherently stochastic and adaptive to the problem they are solving. Evaluation of such systems is often outcome-centric, judging their performance based on success or failure at the final step. This narrow focus overlooks detailed insights about such systems, failing to explain how agents reason, plan, act, or change their strategies over time. Inspired by the structured representation of conventional software systems as graphs, we introduce Graphectory to systematically encode the temporal and semantic relations in such software systems. Graphectory facilitates the design of process-centric metrics and analyses to assess the quality of agentic workflows independent of final success.
  Using Graphectory, we analyze 4000 trajectories of two dominant agentic programming workflows, namely SWE-agent and OpenHands, with a combination of four backbone Large Language Models (LLMs), attempting to resolve SWE-bench Verified issues. Our fully automated analyses reveal that: (1) agents using richer prompts or stronger LLMs exhibit more complex Graphectory, reflecting deeper exploration, broader context gathering, and more thorough validation before patch submission; (2) agents' problem-solving strategies vary with both problem difficulty and the underlying LLM -- for resolved issues, the strategies often follow coherent localization-patching-validation steps, while unresolved ones exhibit chaotic, repetitive, or backtracking behaviors; (3) even when successful, agentic programming systems often display inefficient processes, leading to unnecessarily prolonged trajectories.

Abstract: The advent of strong generative AI has a considerable impact on various software engineering tasks such as code repair, test generation, or language translation. While tools like GitHub Copilot are already in widespread use in interactive settings, automated approaches require a higher level of reliability before being usable in industrial practice. In this paper, we focus on three aspects that directly influence the quality of the results: a) the effect of automated feedback loops, b) the choice of Large Language Model (LLM), and c) the influence of behavior-preserving code changes.
  We study the effect of these three variables on an automated C-to-Rust translation system. Code translation from C to Rust is an attractive use case in industry due to Rust's safety guarantees. The translation system is based on a generate-and-check pattern, in which Rust code generated by the LLM is automatically checked for compilability and behavioral equivalence with the original C code. For negative checking results, the LLM is re-prompted in a feedback loop to repair its output. These checks also allow us to evaluate and compare the respective success rates of the translation system when varying the three variables.
  Our results show that without feedback loops LLM selection has a large effect on translation success. However, when the translation system uses feedback loops the differences across models diminish. We observe this for the average performance of the system as well as its robustness under code perturbations. Finally, we also identify that diversity provided by code perturbations can even result in improved system performance.

Abstract: Migrating a set of software variants into a software product line (SPL) is an expensive and potentially challenging endeavor. Indeed, SPL engineering can significantly impact a company's development process and often requires changes to established developer practices. The work presented in this paper stems from a collaboration with a Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) that decided to migrate its existing code base into an SPL. In this study, we conducted an in-depth evaluation of the company's current development processes and practices, as well as the anticipated benefits and risks associated with the migration. Key stakeholders involved in software development participated in this evaluation to provide insight into their perceptions of the migration and their potential resistance to change. This paper describes the design of the interviews conducted with these stakeholders and presents an analysis of the results. Among the qualitative findings, we observed that all participants, regardless of their role in the development process, identified benefits of the migration relevant to their own activities. Furthermore, our results suggest that an effective risk mitigation strategy involves keeping stakeholders informed and engaged throughout the process, preserving as many good practices as possible, and actively involving them in the migration to ensure a smooth transition and minimize potential challenges.

Conclusion: 本研究为开发平衡技术效率、组织一致性和负责任数据实践的混合框架提供了理论支持，并指出了可指导未来研究的研究空白。

Abstract: Data science initiatives frequently exhibit high failure rates, driven by technical constraints, organizational limitations and insufficient risk management practices. Challenges such as low data maturity, lack of governance, misalignment between technical and business teams, and the absence of structured mechanisms to address ethical and sociotechnical risks have been widely identified in the literature. In this context, the purpose of this study is to conduct a comparative analysis of the main risk management methodologies applied to data science projects, aiming to identify, classify, and synthesize their similarities, differences and existing gaps. An integrative literature review was performed using indexed databases and a structured protocol for selection and content analysis. The study examines widely adopted risk management standards ISO 31000, PMBOK Risk Management and NIST RMF, as well as frameworks specific to data science workflows, such as CRISP DM and the recently proposed DS EthiCo RMF, which incorporates ethical and sociotechnical dimensions into the project life cycle. The findings reveal that traditional approaches provide limited coverage of emerging risks, whereas contemporary models propose multidimensional structures capable of integrating ethical oversight, governance and continuous monitoring. As a contribution, this work offers theoretical support for the development of hybrid frameworks that balance technical efficiency, organizational alignment and responsible data practices, while highlighting research gaps that can guide future investigations.

TL;DR: Vibe coding hackathons show promise for rapid prototyping and collaboration but require scaffolds for better ideation and code quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the educational implications of 'vibe coding,' a method of creating software via natural language prompts, particularly focusing on how novice programmers and mixed-experience teams engage with this approach.

Method: The study involved a one-day educational hackathon with 31 undergraduate participants from computing and non-computing disciplines, divided into nine teams. Data was collected through observations, an exit survey, and semi-structured interviews to examine creative processes, tool usage patterns, collaboration dynamics, and learning outcomes.

Result: Findings reveal that vibe coding enabled rapid prototyping and cross-disciplinary collaboration, with participants developing prompt engineering skills and delivering functional demonstrations within time constraints. However, challenges included premature convergence in ideation, uneven code quality requiring rework, and limited engagement with core software engineering practices.

Conclusion: Vibe coding hackathons can serve as valuable low-stakes learning environments when coupled with explicit scaffolds for divergent thinking, critical evaluation of AI outputs, and realistic expectations about production quality.

Abstract: Emerging alongside generative AI and the broader trend of AI-assisted coding, the term "vibe coding" refers to creating software via natural language prompts rather than direct code authorship. This approach promises to democratize software development, but its educational implications remain underexplored. This paper reports on a one-day educational hackathon investigating how novice programmers and mixed-experience teams engage with vibe coding. We organized an inclusive event at a Brazilian public university with 31 undergraduate participants from computing and non-computing disciplines, divided into nine teams. Through observations, an exit survey, and semi-structured interviews, we examined creative processes, tool usage patterns, collaboration dynamics, and learning outcomes. Findings reveal that vibe coding enabled rapid prototyping and cross-disciplinary collaboration, with participants developing prompt engineering skills and delivering functional demonstrations within time constraints. However, we observed premature convergence in ideation, uneven code quality requiring rework, and limited engagement with core software engineering practices. Teams adopted sophisticated workflows combining multiple AI tools in pipeline configurations, with human judgment remaining essential for critical refinement. The short format (9 hours) proved effective for confidence-building among newcomers while accommodating participants with limited availability. We conclude that vibe coding hackathons can serve as valuable low-stakes learning environments when coupled with explicit scaffolds for divergent thinking, critical evaluation of AI outputs, and realistic expectations about production quality.

*Marcus Kessel*

TL;DR: 该论文提出 observation lakehouses，通过动态行为数据持续挖掘，解决了代码生成 LLMs 依赖静态数据的局限性，并在实验中验证了其高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成 LLMs 主要依赖静态数据训练，容易内化错误代码，而动态行为观察是获取真实功能的唯一可行方法。

Method: 引入基于 Apache Parquet + Iceberg + DuckDB 的 observation lakehouses，通过 SQL 查询按需生成 SRC 切片，支持持续的行为挖掘和分析。

Result: 在 509 个问题的基准测试中，系统成功处理了约 860 万条观察数据（<51MiB），并在笔记本电脑上实现了 <100ms 的 SRM/SRC 视图重建和聚类。

Conclusion: Observation lakehouses 提供了一种无需分布式集群即可持续挖掘行为数据的实用方法，使行为真实数据成为运行时数据的一等公民，并为行为感知的评估和训练提供了基础设施路径。

Abstract: Code-generating LLMs are trained largely on static artifacts (source, comments, specifications) and rarely on materializations of run-time behavior. As a result, they readily internalize buggy or mislabeled code. Since non-trivial semantic properties are undecidable in general, the only practical way to obtain ground-truth functionality is by dynamic observation of executions. In prior work, we addressed representation with Sequence Sheets, Stimulus-Response Matrices (SRMs), and Stimulus-Response Cubes (SRCs) to capture and compare behavior across tests, implementations, and contexts. These structures make observation data analyzable offline and reusable, but they do not by themselves provide persistence, evolution, or interactive analytics at scale. In this paper, therefore, we introduce observation lakehouses that operationalize continual SRCs: a tall, append-only observations table storing every actuation (stimulus, response, context) and SQL queries that materialize SRC slices on demand. Built on Apache Parquet + Iceberg + DuckDB, the lakehouse ingests data from controlled pipelines (LASSO) and CI pipelines (e.g., unit test executions), enabling n-version assessment, behavioral clustering, and consensus oracles without re-execution. On a 509-problem benchmark, we ingest $\approx$8.6M observation rows ($<$51MiB) and reconstruct SRM/SRC views and clusters in $<$100ms on a laptop, demonstrating that continual behavior mining is practical without a distributed cluster of machines. This makes behavioral ground truth first-class alongside other run-time data and provides an infrastructure path toward behavior-aware evaluation and training. The Observation Lakehouse, together with the accompanying dataset, is publicly available as an open-source project on GitHub: https://github.com/SoftwareObservatorium/observation-lakehouse

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 FBFL 方法无法保证跨所有失败测试的诊断一致性，且可能产生冗余诊断，尤其在多故障场景下。

Method: 利用基于模型的诊断（MBD）和最大可满足性（MaxSAT）公式，将所有失败测试用例聚合为一个统一公式。

Result: 实验表明，CFaults 在 C 软件中比 BugAssist、SNIPER 和 HSD 更快定位故障，在布尔电路中表现接近 HSD，且仅生成子集最小化诊断。

Conclusion: CFaults 是一种针对 C 软件和布尔电路的多故障定位工具，其在保证诊断一致性和子集最小化方面优于其他 FBFL 方法。

Abstract: Debugging is one of the most time-consuming and expensive tasks in software development and circuit design. Several formula-based fault localisation (FBFL) methods have been proposed, but they fail to guarantee a set of diagnoses across all failing tests or may produce redundant diagnoses that are not subset-minimal, particularly for programs/circuits with multiple faults.
  This paper introduces CFaults, a novel fault localisation tool for C software and Boolean circuits with multiple faults. CFaults leverages Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) with multiple observations and aggregates all failing test cases into a unified Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) formula. Consequently, our method guarantees consistency across observations and simplifies the fault localisation procedure. Experimental results on three benchmark sets, two of C programs, TCAS and C-Pack-IPAs, and one of Boolean circuits, ISCAS85, show that CFaults is faster at localising faults in C software than other FBFL approaches such as BugAssist, SNIPER, and HSD. On the ISCAS85 benchmark, CFaults is generally slower than HSD; however, it localises faults in only 6% fewer circuits, demonstrating that it remains competitive in this domain. Furthermore, CFaults produces only subset-minimal diagnoses of faulty statements, whereas the other approaches tend to enumerate redundant diagnoses (e.g., BugAssist and SNIPER).

Motivation: To investigate the symbiotic relationship between software and innovation, and how software evolves under competing forces of novelty generation and imitation.

Method: The study integrates agent-based modeling and case studies, utilizing complex network analysis and evolutionary theory to explore software evolution.

Result: The research illustrates how programming languages and AI-driven tools co-evolve with societal norms, cultural dynamics, and human interactions, potentially leading to cultural stagnation.

Conclusion: Understanding the evolutionary pressures from AI-mediated software production is crucial for anticipating cultural change, technological adaptation, and the future of software innovation.

Abstract: This chapter investigates the evolutionary ecology of software, focusing on the symbiotic relationship between software and innovation. An interplay between constraints, tinkering, and frequency-dependent selection drives the complex evolutionary trajectories of these socio-technological systems. Our approach integrates agent-based modeling and case studies, drawing on complex network analysis and evolutionary theory to explore how software evolves under the competing forces of novelty generation and imitation. By examining the evolution of programming languages and their impact on developer practices, we illustrate how technological artifacts co-evolve with and shape societal norms, cultural dynamics, and human interactions. This ecological perspective also informs our analysis of the emerging role of AI-driven development tools in software evolution. While large language models (LLMs) provide unprecedented access to information, their widespread adoption introduces new evolutionary pressures that may contribute to cultural stagnation, much like the decline of diversity in past software ecosystems. Understanding the evolutionary pressures introduced by AI-mediated software production is critical for anticipating broader patterns of cultural change, technological adaptation, and the future of software innovation.

Conclusion: CoatFusion方法在模拟材料涂层任务上表现优异，显著优于现有材料编辑和转移方法，且能生成真实可控的涂层效果。

Abstract: We introduce Material Coating, a novel image editing task that simulates applying a thin material layer onto an object while preserving its underlying coarse and fine geometry. Material coating is fundamentally different from existing "material transfer" methods, which are designed to replace an object's intrinsic material, often overwriting fine details. To address this new task, we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset (110K images) of 3D objects with varied, physically-based coatings, named DataCoat110K. We then propose CoatFusion, a novel architecture that enables this task by conditioning a diffusion model on both a 2D albedo texture and granular, PBR-style parametric controls, including roughness, metalness, transmission, and a key thickness parameter. Experiments and user studies show CoatFusion produces realistic, controllable coatings and significantly outperforms existing material editing and transfer methods on this new task.

Conclusion: SMP（Score-Matching Motion Priors）通过预训练的运动扩散模型和分数蒸馏采样（SDS）创建了可重用的任务无关运动先验，能够在不重新训练的情况下用于下游任务，生成高质量的自然运动。

Abstract: Data-driven motion priors that can guide agents toward producing naturalistic behaviors play a pivotal role in creating life-like virtual characters. Adversarial imitation learning has been a highly effective method for learning motion priors from reference motion data. However, adversarial priors, with few exceptions, need to be retrained for each new controller, thereby limiting their reusability and necessitating the retention of the reference motion data when training on downstream tasks. In this work, we present Score-Matching Motion Priors (SMP), which leverages pre-trained motion diffusion models and score distillation sampling (SDS) to create reusable task-agnostic motion priors. SMPs can be pre-trained on a motion dataset, independent of any control policy or task. Once trained, SMPs can be kept frozen and reused as general-purpose reward functions to train policies to produce naturalistic behaviors for downstream tasks. We show that a general motion prior trained on large-scale datasets can be repurposed into a variety of style-specific priors. Furthermore SMP can compose different styles to synthesize new styles not present in the original dataset. Our method produces high-quality motion comparable to state-of-the-art adversarial imitation learning methods through reusable and modular motion priors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SMP across a diverse suite of control tasks with physically simulated humanoid characters. Video demo available at https://youtu.be/ravlZJteS20

Result: 证明了SRD问题在分裂图上是NP完全的，参数化复杂度结果为W[2]-hard和W[1]-hard，并提出了基于邻域多样性的FPT算法。

Conclusion: 该论文证明了在分裂图上SRD问题仍然是NP完全的，并且在参数化复杂度研究中展示了问题的W[2]-hard和W[1]-hard性质，同时提出了基于邻域多样性的FPT算法。

Abstract: Given a graph $G = (V, E)$, a signed Roman dominating function is a function $f: V \rightarrow \{-1, 1, 2\}$ such that for every vertex $u \in V$: $\sum_{v \in N[u]} f(v) \geq 1$ and for every vertex $u \in V$ with $f(u) = -1$, there exists a vertex $v \in N(u)$ with $f(v) = 2$. The weight of a signed Roman dominating function $f$ is $\sum_{u \in V} f(u)$. The objective of \srd{} (SRD) problem is to compute a signed Roman dominating function with minimum weight. The problem is known to be NP-complete even when restricted to bipartite graphs and planar graphs. In this paper, we advance the complexity study by showing that the problem remains NP-complete on split graphs. In the realm of parameterized complexity, we prove that the problem is W[2]-hard parameterized by weight, even on bipartite graphs. We further show that the problem is W[1]-hard parameterized by feedback vertex set number (and hence also when parameterized by treewidth or clique-width). On the positive side, we present an FPT algorithm parameterized by neighbourhood diversity (and by vertex cover number). Finally, we complement this result by proving that the problem does not admit a polynomial kernel parameterized by vertex cover number unless coNP $\subseteq$ NP/poly.

Method: 通过设计分布式算法，利用建议（advice）机制，优化标签方案大小，并确保算法的时间复杂度最优。对于$k$-gathering，算法在$D+k$轮内完成；对于$k$-broadcasting，算法在$O(D+\log^2 n+k)$轮内完成。

Result: 证明了$k$-gathering的最优标签方案大小为$Θ(\min(\log Δ, \log k))$，设计了时间复杂度为$D+k$轮的$k$-gathering算法和$O(D+\log^2 n+k)$轮的$k$-broadcasting算法。

Conclusion: 本文证明了在分布式算法框架下，$k$-gathering问题的最优标签方案大小与$k$-broadcasting相同，均为$Θ(\min(\log Δ, \log k))$，并设计了具有渐进最优建议大小的快速算法。

Abstract: We consider basic communication tasks in arbitrary radio networks: $k$-broadcasting and $k$-gathering. In the case of $k$-broadcasting messages from $k$ sources have to get to all nodes in the network. The goal of $k$-gathering is to collect messages from $k$ source nodes in a designated sink node. We consider these problems in the framework of distributed algorithms with advice.
  risko and Miller showed in 2021 that the optimal size of advice for $k$-broadcasting is $Θ(\min(\log Δ,$ $ \log k))$, where $Δ$ is equal to the maximum degree of a vertex of the input communication graph. We show that the same bound $Θ(\min(\log Δ, \log k))$ on the size of optimal labeling scheme holds also for the $k$-gathering problems. Moreover, we design fast algorithms for both problems with asymptotically optimal size of advice. For $k$-gathering our algorithm works in at most $D+k$ rounds, where $D$ is the diameter of the communication graph. This time bound is optimal even for centralized algorithms. We apply the $k$-gathering algorithm for $k$-broadcasting to achieve an algorithm working in time $O(D+\log^2 n+k)$ rounds. We also exhibit a logarithmic time complexity gap between distributed algorithms with advice of optimal size and distributed algorithms with distinct arbitrary labels.

Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms have long been observed to obtain near-optimal performance in various Bayesian inference settings. However, developing a supporting theory that make these studies rigorous has proved challenging.
  In this paper, we study the classical spiked Wigner inference problem, where one aims to recover a planted Boolean spike from a noisy matrix measurement. We relate the recovery performance of Glauber dynamics on the annealed posterior to the performance of Approximate Message Passing (AMP), which is known to achieve Bayes-optimal performance. Our main results rely on the analysis of an auxiliary Markov chain called restricted Gaussian dynamics (RGD). Concretely, we establish the following results:
  1. RGD can be reduced to an effective one-dimensional recursion which mirrors the evolution of the AMP iterates.
  2. From a warm start, RGD rapidly converges to a fixed point in correlation space, which recovers Bayes-optimal performance when run on the posterior.
  3. Conditioned on widely believed mixing results for the SK model, we recover the phase transition for non-trivial inference.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究循环追踪重建问题，以缩小追踪重建问题中已知上下界之间的指数差距。

Method: 使用傅里叶技术分析了循环删除通道中稀疏字符串的追踪重建问题。

Result: 展示了循环追踪重建的改进下界$\tildeΩ(n^5)$，并证明了在循环删除通道中重建常数稀疏字符串的上界为$\tilde{O}(n^6)$。

Conclusion: 该论文通过傅里叶技术展示了在循环删除通道中，任何常数稀疏字符串的追踪重建仅需$\tilde{O}(n^6)$个追踪，与一般字符串在循环删除通道中的$\exp(\tilde{O}(n^{1/3}))$上界形成对比。这表明新的算法或下界必须专注于非常数稀疏字符串。

Abstract: The ''trace reconstruction'' problem asks, given an unknown binary string $x$ and a channel that repeatedly returns ''traces'' of $x$ with each bit randomly deleted with some probability $p$, how many traces are needed to recover $x$? There is an exponential gap between the best known upper and lower bounds for this problem. Many variants of the model have been introduced in hopes of motivating or revealing new approaches to narrow this gap. We study the variant of circular trace reconstruction introduced by Narayanan and Ren (ITCS 2021), in which traces undergo a random cyclic shift in addition to random deletions.
  We show an improved lower bound of $\tildeΩ(n^5)$ for circular trace reconstruction. This contrasts with the (previously) best known lower bounds of $\tildeΩ(n^3)$ in the circular case and $\tildeΩ(n^{3/2})$ in the linear case. Our bound shows the indistinguishability of traces from two sparse strings $x,y$ that each have a constant number of nonzeros. Can this technique be extended significantly? How hard is it to reconstruct a sparse string $x$ under a cyclic deletion channel? We resolve these questions by showing, using Fourier techniques, that $\tilde{O}(n^6)$ traces suffice for reconstructing any constant-sparse string in a circular deletion channel, in contrast to the upper bound of $\exp(\tilde{O}(n^{1/3}))$ for general strings in the circular deletion channel. This shows that new algorithms or new lower bounds must focus on non-constant-sparse strings.

Abstract: This paper presents an algorithmic study of a class of covering mixed-integer linear programming problems which encompasses classic cover problems, including multidimensional knapsack, facility location and supplier selection problems. We first show some properties of the vertices of the associated polytope, which are then used to decompose the problem into instances of the multidimensional knapsack cover problem with a single continuous variable per dimension. The proposed decomposition is used to design a polynomial-time approximation scheme for the problem with a fixed number of constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approximation scheme for such a general class of covering mixed-integer programs. Moreover, we design a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme and an approximate linear programming formulation for the case with a single constraint. These results improve upon the previously best-known 2-approximation algorithm for the knapsack cover problem with a single continuous variable. Finally, we show a perfect compact formulation for the case where all variables have the same lower and upper bounds. Analogous results are derived for the packing and assignment variants of the problem.

Abstract: Consider the classical Bin Packing problem with $d$ different item sizes $s_i$ and amounts of items $a_i.$ The support of a Bin Packing solution is the number of differently filled bins. In this work, we show that the lower bound on the support of this problem is $2^{Ω(d)}$. Our lower bound matches the upper bound of $2^d$ given by Eisenbrand and Shmonin [Oper.Research Letters '06] up to a constant factor. This result has direct implications for the time complexity of several Bin Packing algorithms, such as Goemans and Rothvoss [SODA '14], Jansen and Klein [SODA '17] and Jansen and Solis-Oba [IPCO '10]. To achieve our main result, we develop a technique to aggregate equality constrained ILPs with many constraints into an equivalent ILP with one constraint. Our technique contrasts existing aggregation techniques as we manage to integrate upper bounds on variables into the resulting constraint. We believe this technique can be useful for solving general ILPs or the $d$-dimensional knapsack problem.

Abstract: Biharmonic distance (\bd) is a powerful graph distance metric with many applications, including identifying critical links in road networks and mitigating over-squashing problem in \gnn. However, computing \bd\ is extremely difficult, especially on large graphs. In this paper, we focus on the problem of \emph{single-pair} \bd\ query. Existing methods mainly rely on random walk-based approaches, which work well on some graphs but become inefficient when the random walk cannot mix rapidly.To overcome this issue, we first show that the biharmonic distance between two nodes $s,t$, denoted by $b(s,t)$, can be interpreted as the distance between two random walk distributions starting from $s$ and $t$. To estimate these distributions, the required random walk length is large when the underlying graph can be easily cut into smaller pieces. Inspired by this observation, we present novel formulas of \bd to represent $b(s,t)$ by independent random walks within two node sets $\mathcal{V}_s$, $\mathcal{V}_t$ separated by a small \emph{cut set} $\mathcal{V}_{cut}$, where $\mathcal{V}_s\cup\mathcal{V}_t\cup\mathcal{V}_{cut}=\mathcal{V}$ is the set of graph nodes. Building upon this idea, we propose \bindex, a novel index structure which follows a divide-and-conquer strategy. The graph is first cut into pieces so that each part can be processed easily. Then, all the required random walk probabilities can be deterministically computed in a bottom-top manner. When a query comes, only a small part of the index needs to be accessed. We prove that \bindex\ requires $O(n\cdot h)$ space, can be built in $O(n\cdot h\cdot (h+d_{max}))$ time, and answers each query in $O(n\cdot h)$ time, where $h$ is the height of a hierarchy partition tree and $d_{max}$ is the maximum degree, which are both usually much smaller than $n$.
