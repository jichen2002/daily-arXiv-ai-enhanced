The weight of a signed Roman dominating function $f$ is $\\sum_{u \\in V} f(u)$. The objective of \\srd{} (SRD) problem is to compute a signed Roman dominating function with minimum weight. The problem is known to be NP-complete even when restricted to bipartite graphs and planar graphs. In this paper, we advance the complexity study by showing that the problem remains NP-complete on split graphs. In the realm of parameterized complexity, we prove that the problem is W[2]-hard parameterized by weight, even on bipartite graphs. We further show that the problem is W[1]-hard parameterized by feedback vertex set number (and hence also when parameterized by treewidth or clique-width). On the positive side, we present an FPT algorithm parameterized by neighbourhood diversity (and by vertex cover number). Finally, we complement this result by proving that the problem does not admit a polynomial kernel parameterized by vertex cover number unless coNP $\\subseteq$ NP/poly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86SRD\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u5206\u88c2\u56fe\u4e0a\u4ecd\u4e3aNP\u5b8c\u5168\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3aW[2]-hard\u548cW[1]-hard\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u90bb\u57df\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684FPT\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76SRD\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u56fe\u7c7b\u4e0a\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5206\u88c2\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684NP\u5b8c\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86SRD\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u56fe\u7c7b\u4e0a\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86SRD\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u5206\u88c2\u56fe\u4e0a\u662fNP\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3aW[2]-hard\u548cW[1]-hard\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u90bb\u57df\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684FPT\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u5206\u88c2\u56fe\u4e0aSRD\u95ee\u9898\u4ecd\u7136\u662fNP\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\u7684W[2]-hard\u548cW[1]-hard\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u90bb\u57df\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684FPT\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Moreover, we design fast algorithms for both problems with asymptotically optimal size of advice. For $k$-gathering our algorithm works in at most $D+k$ rounds, where $D$ is the diameter of the communication graph. This time bound is optimal even for centralized algorithms.

There is an exponential gap between the best known upper and lower bounds for this problem. Many variants of the model have been introduced in hopes of motivating or revealing new approaches to narrow this gap. We study the variant of circular trace reconstruction introduced by Narayanan and Ren (ITCS 2021), in which traces undergo a random cyclic shift in addition to random deletions.\n  We show an improved lower bound of $\\tilde\u03a9(n^5)$ for circular trace reconstruction. This contrasts with the (previously) best known lower bounds of $\\tilde\u03a9(n^3)$ in the circular case and $\\tilde\u03a9(n^{3/2})$ in the linear case. Our bound shows the indistinguishability of traces from two sparse strings $x,y$ that each have a constant number of nonzeros. Can this technique be extended significantly? How hard is it to reconstruct a sparse string $x$ under a cyclic deletion channel? We resolve these questions by showing, using Fourier techniques, that $\\tilde{O}(n^6)$ traces suffice for reconstructing any constant-sparse string in a circular deletion channel, in contrast to the upper bound of $\\exp(\\tilde{O}(n^{1/3}))$ for general strings in the circular deletion channel.

To enhance the safety and reliability of robots, we introduce the force and haptic perception into reinforcement learning.

However, current methods remain unreliable. Without a solid theoretical footing, the refinement process can wander; sometimes it settles, sometimes it loops back, and sometimes it breaks away from any stable trajectory. This work bridges this critical gap by developing an LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem, providing the first formal framework with provable guarantees for termination and convergence. We model the interaction between the LLM and the verifier as a discrete-time Markov Chain, with state transitions determined by a key parameter: the error-reduction probability ($\u03b4$). The procedure reaching the Verified state almost surely demonstrates that the program terminates for any $\u03b4> 0$, with an expected iteration count bounded by $\\mathbb{E}[n] \\leq 4/\u03b4$. We then stress-tested this prediction in an extensive empirical campaign comprising more than 90,000 trials. The empirical results match the theory with striking consistency. Every single run reached verification, and the convergence factor clustered tightly around $C_f\\approx$ 1.0. Consequently, the bound mirrors the system's actual behavior. The evidence is sufficiently robust to support dividing the workflow into three distinct operating zones: marginal, practical, and high-performance. Consequently, we establish the design thresholds with absolute confidence. Together, the theoretical guarantee and the experimental evidence provide a clearer architectural foundation for LLM-assisted verification. Heuristic tuning no longer has to be carried out by the system. Engineers gain a framework that supports predictable resource planning and performance budgeting, precisely what is needed before deploying these pipelines into safety-critical software environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LLM-Verifier\u6536\u655b\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4f7f\u7528\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ec6\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c06LLM\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\uff0c\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u7531\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u9519\u8bef\u51cf\u5c11\u6982\u7387\uff08\u03b4\uff09\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u8fc790,000\u6b21\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6d3b\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u8fd0\u884c\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u56e0\u5b50\u7d27\u5bc6\u805a\u96c6\u5728Cf\u22481.0\u9644\u8fd1\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u754c\u9650\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9645\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u53d1LLM-Verifier\u6536\u655b\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7ec8\u6b62\u548c\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Earth observation (EO) satellites provide critical, frequent coverage for mapping inundation, yet operational accuracy depends heavily on labeled datasets and model generalization. Recent Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs), such as ESA-IBM's TerraMind, offer improved generalizability through large-scale self-supervised pretraining, but their performance on diverse global flood events remains poorly understood.\n  We fine-tune TerraMind for flood extent mapping using FloodsNet, a harmonized multimodal dataset containing co-located Sentinel-1 (Synthetic Aperture Radar, SAR data) and Sentinel-2 (optical) imagery for 85 flood events worldwide. We tested four configurations (base vs. large models; frozen vs. unfrozen backbones) and compared against the TerraMind Sen1Floods11 example and a U-Net trained on both FloodsNet and Sen1Floods11. The base-unfrozen configuration provided the best balance of accuracy, precision, and recall at substantially lower computational cost than the large model. The large unfrozen model achieved the highest recall. Models trained on FloodsNet outperformed the Sen1Floods11-trained example in recall with similar overall accuracy. U-Net achieved higher recall than all GFM configurations, though with slightly lower accuracy and precision.\n  Our results demonstrate that integrating multimodal optical and SAR data and fine-tuning a GFM can enhance near-real-time flood mapping.

Instead of focusing only on one type of information, Bin2Vec combines what a program looks like (its built-in functions, imports, and exports) with how it behaves when it runs (its instructions and memory usage). This gives a more complete picture when deciding whether two programs are similar or not. Bin2Vec represents these different types of information as views that can be inspected separately using easy-to-read charts, and then brings them together into an overall similarity score. Bin2Vec acts as a bridge between binary representations and machine learning techniques by generating feature representations that can be efficiently processed by machine-learning models. We tested Bin2Vec on multiple versions of two well-known Windows programs, PuTTY and 7-Zip. The primary results strongly confirmed that our method compute an optimal and visualization-friendly representation of the analyzed software. For example, PuTTY versions showed more complex behavior and memory activity, while 7-Zip versions focused more on performance-related patterns. Overall, Bin2Vec provides decisions that are both reliable and explainable to humans.

This allows for a fair comparison and reveals trade-offs between model families. We apply constrained grid search for tree-based classifiers and hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS) for 1D convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs). Evaluation on the Edge-IIoTset benchmark shows that selected models meet tight flash, RAM, and compute limits: LightGBM achieves 95.3% accuracy using 75 KB flash and 1.2 K operations, while the HW-NAS-optimized CNN reaches 97.2% with 190 KB flash and 840 K floating-point operations (FLOPs). We deploy the full pipeline on a Raspberry Pi 3 B Plus, confirming that tree-based models operate within 30 ms and that CNNs remain suitable when accuracy outweighs latency.

We first show some properties of the vertices of the associated polytope, which are then used to decompose the problem into instances of the multidimensional knapsack cover problem with a single continuous variable per dimension. The proposed decomposition is used to design a polynomial-time approximation scheme for the problem with a fixed number of constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approximation scheme for such a general class of covering mixed-integer programs. Moreover, we design a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme and an approximate linear programming formulation for the case with a single constraint.

Adversarial imitation learning has been a highly effective method for learning motion priors from reference motion data. However, adversarial priors, with few exceptions, need to be retrained for each new controller, thereby limiting their reusability and necessitating the retention of the reference motion data when training on downstream tasks. In this work, we present Score-Matching Motion Priors (SMP), which leverages pre-trained motion diffusion models and score distillation sampling (SDS) to create reusable task-agnostic motion priors. SMPs can be pre-trained on a motion dataset, independent of any control policy or task. Once trained, SMPs can be kept frozen and reused as general-purpose reward functions to train policies to produce naturalistic behaviors for downstream tasks. We show that a general motion prior trained on large-scale datasets can be repurposed into a variety of style-specific priors. Furthermore SMP can compose different styles to synthesize new styles not present in the original dataset. Our method produces high-quality motion comparable to state-of-the-art adversarial imitation learning methods through reusable and modular motion priors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SMP across a diverse suite of control tasks with physically simulated humanoid characters.

Published in IEEE Transactions on Multimedia. Code available at: https://github.com/hdeng26/Contex", "summary": "Contrastive learning has gained popularity and pushes state-of-the-art performance across numerous large-scale benchmarks. In contrastive learning, the contrastive loss function plays a pivotal role in discerning similarities between samples through techniques such as rotation or cropping. However, this learning mechanism can also introduce information distortion from the augmented samples. This is because the trained model may develop a significant overreliance on information from samples with identical labels, while concurrently neglecting positive pairs that originate from the same initial image, especially in expansive datasets. This paper proposes a context-enriched contrastive loss function that concurrently improves learning effectiveness and addresses the information distortion by encompassing two convergence targets. The first component, which is notably sensitive to label contrast, differentiates between features of identical and distinct classes which boosts the contrastive training efficiency. Meanwhile, the second component draws closer the augmented samples from the same source image and distances all other samples. We evaluate the proposed approach on image classification tasks, which are among the most widely accepted 8 recognition large-scale benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, ImageNet, BiasedMNIST, UTKFace, and CelebA datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improvements over 16 state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods in terms of both generalization performance and learning convergence speed. Interestingly, our technique stands out in addressing systematic distortion tasks. It demonstrates a 22.9% improvement compared to original contrastive loss functions in the downstream BiasedMNIST dataset, highlighting its promise for more efficient and equitable downstream training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u4fe1\u606f\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u76f8\u540c\u6807\u7b7e\u6837\u672c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u6765\u81ea\u540c\u4e00\u521d\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6b63\u5bf9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6536\u655b\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e30\u5bcc\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u589e\u5f3a\u6807\u7b7e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u62c9\u8fd1\u6765\u81ea\u540c\u4e00\u6e90\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u57288\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e16\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728BiasedMNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa22.9%\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

We use hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS) to derive lightweight TC models that are accurate, efficient, and deployable on edge platforms. Two input formats are considered: a flattened byte sequence and a 2D packet-wise time series; we examine how input structure affects adversarial vulnerability when using resource-constrained models. Robustness is assessed against white-box attacks, specifically Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). On USTC-TFC2016, both HW-NAS models achieve over 99% clean-data accuracy while remaining within 65k parameters and 2M FLOPs. Yet under perturbations of strength 0.1, their robustness diverges: the flat model retains over 85% accuracy, while the time-series variant drops below 35%. Adversarial fine-tuning delivers robust gains, with flat-input accuracy exceeding 96% and the time-series variant recovering over 60 percentage points in robustness, all without compromising efficiency.

A natural strategy is to apply super-resolution (SR) to low-resolution (LR) input views, but independently enhancing each image introduces multi-view inconsistencies, leading to blurry renders. Prior methods attempt to mitigate these inconsistencies through learned neural components, temporally consistent video priors, or joint optimization on LR and SR views, but all uniformly apply SR across every image. In contrast, our key insight is that close-up LR views may contain high-frequency information for regions also captured in more distant views, and that we can use the camera pose relative to scene geometry to inform where to add SR content. Building from this insight, we propose SplatSuRe, a method that selectively applies SR content only in undersampled regions lacking high-frequency supervision, yielding sharper and more consistent results.

Whereas the composition of transducers is well understood, our results clarify how to invert this process, deriving sub-transducers operating on distinct input-output subspaces, enabling parallelizable and interpretable alternatives to monolithic world modelling that can support distributed inference. Overall, these results lay a groundwork for bridging the structural transparency demanded by AI safety and the computational efficiency required for real-world inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e73\u8861AI\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u901a\u5e38\u6d89\u53ca\u4ee5\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u65b9\u5f0f\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5b50\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e00\u7279\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u4ee5\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u8868\u793a\uff09\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u8f93\u5165-\u8f93\u51fa\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5b50\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u9006\u5411\u5206\u89e3\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5b50\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aAI\u5b89\u5168\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u900f\u660e\u6027\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u63a8\u7406\u6240\u9700\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u642d\u5efa\u4e86\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Simultaneously, benchmarks of vision language models (VLMs) have not kept pace with the complexity of scenes that VLMs are used to annotate. In this work, we propose a structured methodology for jointly evaluating T2I models and VLMs by testing whether VLMs can identify 27 specific failure modes in the images generated by T2I models conditioned on challenging prompts. Our second contribution is a dataset of prompts and images generated by 5 T2I models (Flux, SD3-Medium, SD3-Large, SD3.5-Medium, SD3.5-Large) and the corresponding annotations from VLMs (Molmo, InternVL3, Pixtral) annotated by an LLM (Llama3) to test whether VLMs correctly identify the failure mode in a generated image.

However, computing \\bd\\ is extremely difficult, especially on large graphs. In this paper, we focus on the problem of \\emph{single-pair} \\bd\\ query. Existing methods mainly rely on random walk-based approaches, which work well on some graphs but become inefficient when the random walk cannot mix rapidly.To overcome this issue, we first show that the biharmonic distance between two nodes $s,t$, denoted by $b(s,t)$, can be interpreted as the distance between two random walk distributions starting from $s$ and $t$. To estimate these distributions, the required random walk length is large when the underlying graph can be easily cut into smaller pieces. Inspired by this observation, we present novel formulas of \\bd to represent $b(s,t)$ by independent random walks within two node sets $\\mathcal{V}_s$, $\\mathcal{V}_t$ separated by a small \\emph{cut set} $\\mathcal{V}_{cut}$, where $\\mathcal{V}_s\\cup\\mathcal{V}_t\\cup\\mathcal{V}_{cut}=\\mathcal{V}$ is the set of graph nodes. Building upon this idea, we propose \\bindex, a novel index structure which follows a divide-and-conquer strategy. The graph is first cut into pieces so that each part can be processed easily. Then, all the required random walk probabilities can be deterministically computed in a bottom-top manner. When a query comes, only a small part of the index needs to be accessed. We prove that \\bindex\\ requires $O(n\\cdot h)$ space, can be built in $O(n\\cdot h\\cdot (h+d_{max}))$ time, and answers each query in $O(n\\cdot h)$ time, where $h$ is the height of a hierarchy partition tree and $d_{max}$ is the maximum degree, which are both usually much smaller than $n$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faBIndex\u7d22\u5f15\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6cbb\u7b56\u7565\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u5355\u5bf9\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u53cc\u8c03\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u5272\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u65e0\u6cd5\u5feb\u901f\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u56fe\u4e0a\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u56fe\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u5206\u5272\u6210\u5c0f\u5757\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u56fe\u5206\u5272\u4e3a\u6613\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u5e95\u5411\u4e0a\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u6784\u5efaBIndex\u7d22\u5f15\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "BIndex\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aO(n\u00b7h)\u3001\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3aO(n\u00b7h\u00b7(h+d_max))\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5O(n\u00b7h)\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u56de\u7b54\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dh\u548cd_max\u901a\u5e38\u8fdc\u5c0f\u4e8en\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aBIndex\u7684\u65b0\u7d22\u5f15\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u5355\u5bf9\u8282\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u8c03\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\uff08BD\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6cbb\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u5212\u5206\u6811\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

By emulating human-like perception and decision-making processes, these models can predict and adapt to dynamic environments. Existing methods typically map high-dimensional observations into compact latent spaces and learn optimal policies within these latent representations. However, prior work usually jointly learns ego-vehicle dynamics and environmental transition dynamics from the image input, leading to inefficiencies and a lack of robustness to variations in vehicle dynamics. To address these issues, we propose the Vehicle Dynamics embedded Dreamer (VDD) method, which decouples the modeling of ego-vehicle dynamics from environmental transition dynamics. This separation allows the world model to generalize effectively across vehicles with diverse parameters. Additionally, we introduce two strategies to further enhance the robustness of the learned policy: Policy Adjustment during Deployment (PAD) and Policy Augmentation during Training (PAT).

Our primary goal is to uncover the causes behind such methods and propose a comprehensible solution for that. To address this, we introduce an attention-based reference point shifting (ARPS) layer, which robustly identifies a common reference point of two partial point sets, thereby acquiring transformation-invariant features. The ARPS layer employs a well-studied attention module to find a common reference point rather than the overlap region. Owing to this, it significantly enhances the performance of DeepGMR and its recent variant, UGMMReg.

At subsequent stages of patient diagnosis, genetic information is extracted to help select specific patient treatment options. As the efficacy of cancer treatment often relies on early diagnosis and treatment, we build a deep latent variable model to determine patients' somatic mutation profiles based on their corresponding medical images. We first introduce a point cloud representation of lesions images to allow for invariance to the imaging modality. We then propose, LLOST, a model with dual variational autoencoders coupled together by a separate shared latent space that unifies features from the lesion point clouds and counts of distinct somatic mutations. Therefore our model consists of three latent space, each of which is learned with a conditional normalizing flow prior to account for the diverse distributions of each domain. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on de-identified medical images from The Cancer Imaging Archive and the corresponding somatic mutations from the Pan Cancer dataset of The Cancer Genomic Archive. We show the model's predictive performance on the counts of specific mutations as well as it's ability to accurately predict the occurrence of mutations. In particular, shared patterns between the imaging and somatic mutation domain that reflect cancer type. We conclude with a remark on how to improve the model and possible future avenues of research to include other genetic domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faLLOST\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u9884\u6d4b\u4f53\u7ec6\u80de\u7a81\u53d8\u8c31\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a81\u53d8\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f71\u50cf\u4e0e\u7a81\u53d8\u95f4\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u764c\u75c7\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u7597\u6548\u5f80\u5f80\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u9884\u6d4b\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u4f53\u7ec6\u80de\u7a81\u53d8\u8c31\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u65e9\u671f\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u6a21\u578bLLOST\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c06\u75c5\u53d8\u70b9\u4e91\u548c\u4f53\u7ec6\u80de\u7a81\u53d8\u8ba1\u6570\u7279\u5f81\u7edf\u4e00\u8d77\u6765\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7a7a\u95f4\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u6761\u4ef6\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u5148\u9a8c\u6765\u9002\u5e94\u5404\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u7a81\u53d8\u8ba1\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\u53ca\u7a81\u53d8\u53d1\u751f\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f71\u50cf\u4e0e\u4f53\u7ec6\u80de\u7a81\u53d8\u9886\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u764c\u75c7\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u4ee5\u7eb3\u5165\u5176\u4ed6\u9057\u4f20\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

While tools like GitHub Copilot are already in widespread use in interactive settings, automated approaches require a higher level of reliability before being usable in industrial practice. In this paper, we focus on three aspects that directly influence the quality of the results: a) the effect of automated feedback loops, b) the choice of Large Language Model (LLM), and c) the influence of behavior-preserving code changes.\n  We study the effect of these three variables on an automated C-to-Rust translation system. Code translation from C to Rust is an attractive use case in industry due to Rust's safety guarantees. The translation system is based on a generate-and-check pattern, in which Rust code generated by the LLM is automatically checked for compilability and behavioral equivalence with the original C code. For negative checking results, the LLM is re-prompted in a feedback loop to repair its output. These checks also allow us to evaluate and compare the respective success rates of the translation system when varying the three variables.\n  Our results show that without feedback loops LLM selection has a large effect on translation success. However, when the translation system uses feedback loops the differences across models diminish. We observe this for the average performance of the system as well as its robustness under code perturbations. Finally, we also identify that diversity provided by code perturbations can even result in improved system performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u3001LLM\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\u5bf9C\u5230Rust\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u6270\u52a8\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u3001LLM\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u4ee3\u7801\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff09\u4e2d\u7ed3\u679c\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5de5\u4e1a\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210-\u68c0\u67e5\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u91cd\u65b0\u63d0\u793aLLM\u4fee\u590d\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u52a8\u5316C\u5230Rust\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e09\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u3001LLM\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u4fdd\u7559\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u65f6\uff0cLLM\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u540e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u51cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u4e14\u4ee3\u7801\u6270\u52a8\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u4ee3\u7801\u6270\u52a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u751a\u81f3\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

First, using the solution concept of core, we investigate conditions under which it is beneficial for all users to cooperate, i.e., the grand coalition is stable. We provide several sets of sufficient conditions under which the core is non-empty as well as those under which the core is empty. Next, we use the concept of $\\mathbb{D}_c$-stability to identify a set of sufficient conditions under which the users in the network form a certain fixed number of coalitions such that all the users within each coalition cooperate among themselves. Our analytical results show how the values of different system parameters, e.g., data rates of different users, transmit and receive power, file size, bandwidth cost, etc., influence stability properties of coalitions, and provide a systematic approach to evaluating cooperation of users for multicast. We also study cooperation among different users using numerical computations.

However, this approach is not scalable, as it places a heavy load on the sender. This work presents an autonomic algorithm that enables the $n$ processes in a distributed system to build and maintain a spanning tree connecting themselves. In this context, processes are the vertices of the spanning tree. By definition, a spanning tree connects all processes without forming cycles. The proposed algorithm ensures that every vertex in the spanning tree has both an in-degree and the tree depth of at most $log_2 n$. When all processes are correct, the degree of each process is exactly $log_2 n$. A spanning tree is dynamically created from any source process and is transparently reconstructed as processes fail or recover. Up to $n-1$ processes can fail, and the correct processes remain connected through a scalable, functioning spanning tree. To build and maintain the tree, processes use the VCube virtual topology, which also serves as a failure detector. Two broadcast algorithms based on the autonomic spanning tree algorithm are presented: one for best-effort broadcast and one for reliable broadcast. Simulation results are provided, including comparisons with other alternatives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u6811\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e7f\u64ad\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u5efa\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5e7f\u64ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u901a\u4fe1\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u56e0\u53d1\u9001\u8005\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8fc7\u9ad8\u800c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528VCube\u865a\u62df\u62d3\u6251\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e00\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u5165\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc7log\u2082n\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6811\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8fdb\u7a0b\u5931\u8d25\u6216\u6062\u590d\u65f6\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u5efa\u751f\u6210\u6811\uff0c\u4e14\u5e7f\u64ad\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u6811\u6784\u5efa\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u6700\u591an-1\u4e2a\u8fdb\u7a0b\u5931\u8d25\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5e7f\u64ad\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

These scenarios are commonly formulated as multi-agent informative path planning (MAIPP), where multiple agents must coordinate to maximize information gain while operating under budget constraints. A central challenge in MAIPP is ensuring effective coordination while the belief over the environment evolves with incoming measurements. Recent learning-based approaches address this by using distributions over future positions as \"intent\" to support coordination. However, these autoregressive intent predictors are computationally expensive and prone to compounding errors. Inspired by the effectiveness of diffusion models as expressive, long-horizon policies, we propose AID, a fully decentralized MAIPP framework that leverages diffusion models to generate long-term trajectories in a non-autoregressive manner. AID first performs behavior cloning on trajectories produced by existing MAIPP planners and then fine-tunes the policy using reinforcement learning via Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization (DPPO). This two-stage pipeline enables the policy to inherit expert behavior while learning improved coordination through online reward feedback. Experiments demonstrate that AID consistently improves upon the MAIPP planners it is trained from, achieving up to 4x faster execution and 17% increased information gain, while scaling effectively to larger numbers of agents.

However, fine appearance details need to be represented as a large number of small Gaussian primitives, which can be wasteful when geometry and appearance exhibit different frequency characteristics.\n  Inspired by the long tradition of texture mapping, we propose to use texture to represent detailed appearance where possible. Our main focus is to incorporate per-primitive texture maps that adapt to the scene in a principled manner during Gaussian Splatting optimization. We do this by proposing a new appearance representation for 2D Gaussian primitives with textures where the size of a texel is bounded by the image sampling frequency and adapted to the content of the input images. We achieve this by adaptively upscaling or downscaling the texture resolution during optimization. In addition, our approach enables control of the number of primitives during optimization based on texture resolution. We show that our approach performs favorably in image quality and total number of parameters used compared to alternative solutions for textured Gaussian primitives.

This study introduces synthetic domain data, enriches colleague simulations, and prototypes an automatic task-generation pipeline. The study aims to create and assess an evaluation set that can meaningfully measure an agent's fitness for assistant-level wealth management work.

We seeded a set of new finance-specific data and introduced a high vs. low-autonomy variant of every task.

In this study, we conducted an in-depth evaluation of the company's current development processes and practices, as well as the anticipated benefits and risks associated with the migration. Key stakeholders involved in software development participated in this evaluation to provide insight into their perceptions of the migration and their potential resistance to change. This paper describes the design of the interviews conducted with these stakeholders and presents an analysis of the results. Among the qualitative findings, we observed that all participants, regardless of their role in the development process, identified benefits of the migration relevant to their own activities.

However, efficient forest monitoring with limited energy budget and computing resource presents a significant challenge. For this purpose, this paper formulates a multi-objective optimization framework to simultaneously consider three optimization objectives, which are minimizing the maximum computing delay, minimizing the total motion energy consumption, and minimizing the maximum computing resource, corresponding to efficient forest monitoring, energy consumption reduction, and computing resource control, respectively. Due to the hybrid solution space that consists of continuous and discrete solutions, we propose a diffusion model-enhanced improved multi-objective grey wolf optimizer (IMOGWO) to solve the formulated framework. The simulation results show that the proposed IMOGWO outperforms other benchmarks for solving the formulated framework. Specifically, for a small-scale network with $6$ UAVs and $50$ SNs, compared to the suboptimal benchmark, IMOGWO reduces the motion energy consumption and the computing resource by $53.32\\%$ and $9.83\\%$, respectively, while maintaining computing delay at the same level. Similarly, for a large-scale network with $8$ UAVs and $100$ SNs, IMOGWO achieves reductions of $41.81\\%$ in motion energy consumption and $7.93\\%$ in computing resource, with the computing delay also remaining comparable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7070\u72fc\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff08IMOGWO\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u68ee\u6797\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u9884\u7b97\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u68ee\u6797\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7070\u72fc\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff08IMOGWO\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u7531\u8fde\u7eed\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u89e3\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cIMOGWO\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5747\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684IMOGWO\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd0\u52a8\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5728\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u6c34\u5e73\u3002"}}

These centers operate with hardware configurations, software environments, and security requirements that differ substantially from most users' local systems. As a result, users often develop customized digital artifacts that are tightly coupled to a given HPC center. This practice can lead to significant duplication of effort as multiple users independently create similar solutions to common problems. The FAIR Principles offer a framework to address these challenges. Initially designed to improve data stewardship, the FAIR approach has since been extended to encompass software, workflows, models, and infrastructure. By encouraging the use of rich metadata and community standards, FAIR practices aim to make digital artifacts easier to share and reuse, both within and across scientific domains. Many FAIR initiatives have emerged within individual research communities, often aligned by discipline (e.g. bioinformatics, earth sciences). These communities have made progress in adopting FAIR practices, but their domain-specific nature can lead to silos that limit broader collaboration. Thus, we propose that HPC centers play a more active role in fostering FAIR ecosystems that support research across multiple disciplines. This requires designing infrastructure that enables researchers to discover, share, and reuse computational components more effectively. Here, we build on the architecture of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) EOSC-Life FAIR Workflows Collaboratory to propose a model tailored to the needs of HPC. Rather than focusing on entire workflows, we emphasize the importance of making individual workflow components FAIR.

To address this gap, we introduce the robotic capabilities framework, a vocabulary that enables transdisciplinary collaborations to meaningfully shape the future of work when robotic systems are integrated into the workplace. Rather than focusing on the internal workings of robots, the framework centers discussion on high-level capabilities, supporting dialogue around which elements of a task should remain human-led and which can be delegated to robots. We developed the framework through reflexive and iterative processes, and applied it in two distinct settings: by engaging roboticists in describing existing commercial robots using its vocabulary, and through a design activity with students working on robotics-related projects.

Current literature for tackling generalisation on out-of-distribution data and domain gaps due to modality changes has been widely researched but mostly for natural scene data. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to the surgical scenes due to limited visual cues and often extremely diverse scenarios compared to the natural scene data. Inspired by these works in natural scenes to push generalisability on OOD data, we hypothesise that exploiting the style and content information in the surgical scenes could minimise the appearances, making it less variable to sudden changes such as blood or imaging artefacts. This can be achieved by performing instance normalisation and feature covariance mapping techniques for robust and generalisable feature representations. Further, to eliminate the risk of removing salient feature representation associated with the objects of interest, we introduce a restitution module within the feature learning ResNet backbone that can enable the retention of useful task-relevant features. To tackle the lack of multiclass and multicentre data for surgical scene segmentation, we also provide a newly curated dataset that can be vital for addressing generalisability in this domain. Our proposed RobustSurg obtained nearly 23% improvement on the baseline DeepLabv3+ and from 10-32% improvement on the SOTA in terms of mean IoU score on an unseen centre HeiCholSeg dataset when trained on CholecSeg8K.

Challenges such as low data maturity, lack of governance, misalignment between technical and business teams, and the absence of structured mechanisms to address ethical and sociotechnical risks have been widely identified in the literature. In this context, the purpose of this study is to conduct a comparative analysis of the main risk management methodologies applied to data science projects, aiming to identify, classify, and synthesize their similarities, differences and existing gaps. An integrative literature review was performed using indexed databases and a structured protocol for selection and content analysis. The study examines widely adopted risk management standards ISO 31000, PMBOK Risk Management and NIST RMF, as well as frameworks specific to data science workflows, such as CRISP DM and the recently proposed DS EthiCo RMF, which incorporates ethical and sociotechnical dimensions into the project life cycle. The findings reveal that traditional approaches provide limited coverage of emerging risks, whereas contemporary models propose multidimensional structures capable of integrating ethical oversight, governance and continuous monitoring.

Standard imitation learning policies fail by averaging these distinct actions into a single, invalid action. In this paper, we introduce SAM2Grasp, a novel framework that resolves this issue by reformulating the task as a uni-modal, prompt-conditioned prediction problem. Our method leverages the frozen SAM2 model to use its powerful visual temporal tracking capability and introduces a lightweight, trainable action head that operates in parallel with its native segmentation head. This design allows for training only the small action head on pre-computed temporal-visual features from SAM2. During inference, an initial prompt, such as a bounding box provided by an upstream object detection model, designates the specific object to be grasped. This prompt conditions the action head to predict a unique, unambiguous grasp trajectory for that object alone. In all subsequent video frames, SAM2's built-in temporal tracking capability automatically maintains stable tracking of the selected object, enabling our model to continuously predict the grasp trajectory from the video stream without further external guidance.

While their accuracy is exceptional in flat regions, the capturing is susceptible to miss small geometric structures and may fail with dark, absorbent materials. Alternatively, capturing multiple photos of the scene and applying 3D photogrammetry can infer these details as they often represent feature-rich regions. However, the accuracy of LiDAR for featureless regions is rarely reached. Therefore, we suggest combining the strengths of LiDAR and camera-based capture by introducing SurfFill: a Gaussian surfel-based LiDAR completion scheme. We analyze LiDAR capturings and attribute LiDAR beam divergence as a main factor for artifacts, manifesting mostly at thin structures and edges. We use this insight to introduce an ambiguity heuristic for completed scans by evaluating the change in density in the point cloud. This allows us to identify points close to missed areas, which we can then use to grow additional points from to complete the scan. For this point growing, we constrain Gaussian surfel reconstruction [Huang et al. 2024] to focus optimization and densification on these ambiguous areas. Finally, Gaussian primitives of the reconstruction in ambiguous areas are extracted and sampled for points to complete the point cloud. To address the challenges of large-scale reconstruction, we extend this pipeline with a divide-and-conquer scheme for building-sized point cloud completion. We evaluate on the task of LiDAR point cloud completion of synthetic and real-world scenes and find that our method outperforms previous reconstruction methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "SurfFill\u7ed3\u5408LiDAR\u4e0e\u76f8\u673a\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u9762\u5143\u8865\u5168\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u4f18\u5316\u8584\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "LiDAR\u5728\u5e73\u5766\u533a\u57df\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4f46\u6613\u9057\u6f0f\u5c0f\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6697\u8272\u6750\u6599\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u800c\u6444\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\u6cd5\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ec6\u8282\u4f46\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u7f3a\u5931\u533a\u57df\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790LiDAR\u6355\u83b7\u4e2d\u7684\u5149\u675f\u53d1\u6563\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u7cca\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u6f5c\u5728\u9057\u6f0f\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u9762\u5143\u91cd\u5efa\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684LiDAR\u70b9\u4e91\u8865\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSurfFill\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SurfFill\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408LiDAR\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u6355\u83b7\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u65af\u9762\u5143\u57fa\u7840\u7684LiDAR\u8865\u5168\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u70b9\u4e91\u8865\u5168\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8584\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u533a\u57df\u3002"}}

Yet despite these achievements, modern AI systems remain fundamentally limited in their ability to self-monitor, self-correct, and regulate their behavior autonomously in dynamic contexts. This paper identifies and analyzes seven core deficiencies that constrain contemporary AI models: the absence of intrinsic self-monitoring, lack of meta-cognitive awareness, fixed and non-adaptive learning mechanisms, inability to restructure goals, lack of representational maintenance, insufficient embodied feedback, and the absence of intrinsic agency. Alongside identifying these limitations, we also outline a forward-looking perspective on how AI may evolve beyond them through architectures that mirror neurocognitive principles. We argue that these structural limitations prevent current architectures, including deep learning and transformer-based systems, from achieving robust generalization, lifelong adaptability, and real-world autonomy. Drawing on a comparative analysis of artificial systems and biological cognition [7], and integrating insights from AI research, cognitive science, and neuroscience, we outline how these capabilities are absent in current models and why scaling alone cannot resolve them. We conclude by advocating for a paradigmatic shift toward cognitively grounded AI (cognitive autonomy) capable of self-directed adaptation, dynamic representation management, and intentional, goal-oriented behavior, paired with reformative oversight mechanisms [8] that ensure autonomous systems remain interpretable, governable, and aligned with human values.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u4ee3AI\u5728\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u884c\u4e3a\u8c03\u8282\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684AI\u67b6\u6784\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u884c\u4e3a\u8c03\u8282\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u5de5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u751f\u7269\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u5e76\u6574\u5408AI\u7814\u7a76\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e03\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u8ba4\u77e5\u539f\u5219\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u8d85\u8d8a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3b\u5f20\u5411\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684AI\uff08\u8ba4\u77e5\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u6211\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u8868\u5f81\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u6709\u610f\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u914d\u5408\u6539\u9769\u6027\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u7ba1\u7406\u5e76\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

Existing end-to-end multifractal methods rely on heavy pooling or strong feature-space decimation, which constrain tasks such as semantic segmentation.

These methods leverage relationships between the probability mass of the exponents and the multifractal spectrum to form statistical descriptions of encoder embeddings, implemented as channel-attention functions in convolutional networks.\n  Using a U-Net-based framework, we show that multifractal recalibration yields substantial gains over a baseline equipped with other channel-attention mechanisms that also use higher-order statistics. Given the proven ability of multifractal analysis to capture pathological regularities, we validate our approach on three public medical-imaging datasets: ISIC18 (dermoscopy), Kvasir-SEG (endoscopy), and BUSI (ultrasound).\n  Our empirical analysis also provides insights into the behavior of these attention layers.

In particular, wireless stations that can see more than one access point at the same time behave as boundary clocks and propagate the reference time across overlapping networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "DOMINO\u662fRBIS\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fb9\u754c\u65f6\u949f\u673a\u5236\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6574\u4e2a\u5de5\u5382\u7684\u65f6\u949f\u540c\u6b65\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u65f6\u949f\u540c\u6b65\u534f\u8bae\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684RBIS\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u6574\u4e2a\u5de5\u5382\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "DOMINO\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u770b\u5230\u591a\u4e2a\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7ad9\u70b9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u754c\u65f6\u949f\uff0c\u5c06\u53c2\u8003\u65f6\u95f4\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "DOMINO\u663e\u8457\u6269\u5927\u4e86RBIS\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u8de8\u8d8a\u5355\u4e2aWi-Fi\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u3002", "conclusion": "DOMINO\u6269\u5c55\u4e86RBIS\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u8de8\u8d8a\u591a\u4e2aWi-Fi\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6574\u4e2a\u5de5\u5382\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65f6\u949f\u540c\u6b65\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

From monocular RGB or RGB-D inputs, we perform high precision HOI reconstruction and enforce physical plausibility via a reinforcement learning (RL) optimizer that refines hand object relative poses under contact and penetration constraints. The reconstructed, contact rich trajectories are then retargeted to cross-embodiments, robot arms with simple end effectors, dexterous hands, and humanoids, yielding executable actions and rollouts. To scale coverage, we build a simulation-augmented framework on Isaac Sim with diverse domain randomization (embodiments, trajectories, object retrieval, background textures, hand motion mirroring), which enriches the distributions of trajectories and observations while preserving spatial relationships and physical plausibility. The entire data pipeline forms an end to end pipeline from video,reconstruction,retargeting,augmentation data acquisition. We validate the data on mainstream vision language action (VLA) and imitation learning architectures, demonstrating that trajectories produced by our pipeline are as stable as those from teleoperation and yield comparable continual performance gains. To our knowledge, this provides the first quantitative evidence that HOI modalities can serve as effective supervision for robotic learning. Compared with teleoperation, Robowheel is lightweight, a single monocular RGB(D) camera is sufficient to extract a universal, embodiment agnostic motion representation that could be flexibly retargeted across embodiments.

The key difficulty lies in preserving the subject's original temporal behavior, demanding that every edited frame remains precisely synchronized with the corresponding source frame. We present Sync-LoRA, a method for editing portrait videos that achieves high-quality visual modifications while maintaining frame-accurate synchronization and identity consistency. Our approach uses an image-to-video diffusion model, where the edit is defined by modifying the first frame and then propagated to the entire sequence. To enable accurate synchronization, we train an in-context LoRA using paired videos that depict identical motion trajectories but differ in appearance. These pairs are automatically generated and curated through a synchronization-based filtering process that selects only the most temporally aligned examples for training. This training setup teaches the model to combine motion cues from the source video with the visual changes introduced in the edited first frame. Trained on a compact, highly curated set of synchronized human portraits, Sync-LoRA generalizes to unseen identities and diverse edits (e.g., modifying appearance, adding objects, or changing backgrounds), robustly handling variations in pose and expression. Our results demonstrate high visual fidelity and strong temporal coherence, achieving a robust balance between edit fidelity and precise motion preservation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Sync-LoRA \u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587 LoRA \u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8096\u50cf\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5e27\u7ea7\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8096\u50cf\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u65f6\u95f4\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u7b2c\u4e00\u5e27\u5e76\u5c06\u7f16\u8f91\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587 LoRA\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7b5b\u9009\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "Sync-LoRA \u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u5f3a\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Sync-LoRA \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7f16\u8f91\u8096\u50cf\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u89c9\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5e27\u7ea7\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

We present DialogGuard, a multi-agent framework for assessing psychosocial risks in LLM-generated responses along five high-severity dimensions: privacy violations, discriminatory behaviour, mental manipulation, psychological harm, and insulting behaviour. DialogGuard can be applied to diverse generative models through four LLM-as-a-judge pipelines, including single-agent scoring, dual-agent correction, multi-agent debate, and stochastic majority voting, grounded in a shared three-level rubric usable by both human annotators and LLM judges. Using PKU-SafeRLHF with human safety annotations, we show that multi-agent mechanisms detect psychosocial risks more accurately than non-LLM baselines and single-agent judging; dual-agent correction and majority voting provide the best trade-off between accuracy, alignment with human ratings, and robustness, while debate attains higher recall but over-flags borderline cases.

These approaches cannot provide diagnostic, interpretable feedback, offering little insight into why the video quality is degraded. Most of them are also specialized, format-specific metrics rather than truly ``generic\" solutions, as they are designed to learn a compromised representation from disparate perceptual domains. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Unified-VQA, a framework that provides a single, unified quality model applicable to various distortion types within multiple video formats by recasting generic VQA as a Diagnostic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) problem. Unified-VQA employs multiple ``perceptual experts'' dedicated to distinct perceptual domains. A novel multi-proxy expert training strategy is designed to optimize each expert using a ranking-inspired loss, guided by the most suitable proxy metric for its domain.

As a result, they readily internalize buggy or mislabeled code. Since non-trivial semantic properties are undecidable in general, the only practical way to obtain ground-truth functionality is by dynamic observation of executions. In prior work, we addressed representation with Sequence Sheets, Stimulus-Response Matrices (SRMs), and Stimulus-Response Cubes (SRCs) to capture and compare behavior across tests, implementations, and contexts. These structures make observation data analyzable offline and reusable, but they do not by themselves provide persistence, evolution, or interactive analytics at scale. In this paper, therefore, we introduce observation lakehouses that operationalize continual SRCs: a tall, append-only observations table storing every actuation (stimulus, response, context) and SQL queries that materialize SRC slices on demand. Built on Apache Parquet + Iceberg + DuckDB, the lakehouse ingests data from controlled pipelines (LASSO) and CI pipelines (e.g., unit test executions), enabling n-version assessment, behavioral clustering, and consensus oracles without re-execution. On a 509-problem benchmark, we ingest $\\approx$8.6M observation rows ($<$51MiB) and reconstruct SRM/SRC views and clusters in $<$100ms on a laptop, demonstrating that continual behavior mining is practical without a distributed cluster of machines. This makes behavioral ground truth first-class alongside other run-time data and provides an infrastructure path toward behavior-aware evaluation and training.

One of the aspects of Wi-Fi technology that greatly affects the probability of a packet reaching its destination is the selection of the appropriate transmission rate. Rate adaptation algorithms are in charge of this operation, but their design and implementation are not regulated by the IEEE 802.11 standard.

Existing learning based approaches struggle to capture rare but safety critical behaviors, while rule based systems often lack adaptability in complex interactions.

The prediction module adopts cognitive representations of interaction modes based on topological motion semantics and nearest neighbor relational encoding. With a differentiable modal loss and multimodal Gaussian decoding, CogDrive learns sparse and unbalanced interaction behaviors and improves long horizon trajectory prediction. The planning module incorporates an emergency response concept and optimizes safety stabilized trajectories, where short term consistent branches ensure safety during replanning cycles and long term branches support smooth and collision free motion under low probability switching modes. Experiments on Argoverse2 and INTERACTION datasets show that CogDrive achieves strong performance in trajectory accuracy and miss rate, while closed loop simulations confirm adaptive behavior in merge and intersection scenarios.

We introduce AV-SpeakerBench, a curated benchmark of 3,212 multiple-choice questions focused on speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in real-world videos. It features: (1) a speaker-centered formulation that treats speakers-not scenes-as the core reasoning unit; (2) fusion-grounded question design embedding audiovisual dependencies into question semantics; and (3) expert-curated annotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity. Comprehensive evaluations show that the Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the best results. Among open models, Qwen3-Omni-30B approaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weaker audiovisual fusion rather than visual perception.

Several formula-based fault localisation (FBFL) methods have been proposed, but they fail to guarantee a set of diagnoses across all failing tests or may produce redundant diagnoses that are not subset-minimal, particularly for programs/circuits with multiple faults.\n  This paper introduces CFaults, a novel fault localisation tool for C software and Boolean circuits with multiple faults. CFaults leverages Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) with multiple observations and aggregates all failing test cases into a unified Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) formula. Consequently, our method guarantees consistency across observations and simplifies the fault localisation procedure. Experimental results on three benchmark sets, two of C programs, TCAS and C-Pack-IPAs, and one of Boolean circuits, ISCAS85, show that CFaults is faster at localising faults in C software than other FBFL approaches such as BugAssist, SNIPER, and HSD. On the ISCAS85 benchmark, CFaults is generally slower than HSD; however, it localises faults in only 6% fewer circuits, demonstrating that it remains competitive in this domain.

This paper examines how these inequalities manifest in northern Finland and Sweden, where sparse populations, long distances, and seasonal variations in demand create persistent gaps in service quality and reliability. Drawing on survey data (n = 148), in-depth interviews, and spatial analysis, the study explores the lived experience of connectivity in Arctic rural communities and introduces a novel Cellular Coverage Inequality (CCI) Index. The index combines measures of rurality and network performance to quantify spatial disparities that are masked by national coverage statistics. Results reveal that headline indicators overstate inclusiveness, while local users report chronic connectivity gaps affecting work, safety, and access to services. Building on these findings, the paper outlines policy reflections in six areas: shared infrastructure and roaming frameworks, spectrum flexibility for rural operators, performance-based Quality-of-Service monitoring, standardized and transparent reporting, temporal and seasonal capacity management, and digital-skills initiatives. Together, these recommendations highlight the need for multidimensional metrics and governance mechanisms that link technical performance, spatial equity, and user experience.

Additionally, existing failure datasets are mostly generated programmatically in simulation, which limits their generalization to the real world. In light of these, we introduce ViFailback, a framework designed to diagnose robotic manipulation failures and provide both textual and visual correction guidance. Our framework utilizes explicit visual symbols to enhance annotation efficiency. We further release the ViFailback dataset, a large-scale collection of 58,126 Visual Question Answering (VQA) pairs along with their corresponding 5,202 real-world manipulation trajectories. Based on the dataset, we establish ViFailback-Bench, a benchmark of 11 fine-grained VQA tasks designed to assess the failure diagnosis and correction abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), featuring ViFailback-Bench Lite for closed-ended and ViFailback-Bench Hard for open-ended evaluation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we built the ViFailback-8B VLM, which not only achieves significant overall performance improvement on ViFailback-Bench but also generates visual symbols for corrective action guidance. Finally, by integrating ViFailback-8B with a VLA model, we conduct real-world robotic experiments demonstrating its ability to assist the VLA model in recovering from failures.

We address this critical challenge by achieving 95.5% Dice score using just 599 training images for breast cell segmentation, where just 4% of pixels represent breast tissue and 60% of images contain no breast regions. Our framework uses quantum-inspired edge enhancement via multi-scale Gabor filters creating a fourth input channel, enhancing boundary detection where inter-annotator variations reach +/- 3 pixels. We present a stabilized multi-component loss function that integrates adaptive Dice loss with boundary-aware terms and automatic positive weighting to effectively address severe class imbalance, where mammary epithelial cell regions comprise only 0.1%-20% of the total image area. Additionally, a complexity-based weighted sampling strategy is introduced to prioritize the challenging mammary epithelial cell regions. The model employs an EfficientNet-B7/UNet++ architecture with a 4-to-3 channel projection, enabling the use of pretrained weights despite limited medical imaging data. Finally, robust validation is achieved through exponential moving averaging and statistical outlier detection, ensuring reliable performance estimates on a small validation set (129 images). Our framework achieves a Dice score of 95.5% +/- 0.3% and an IoU of 91.2% +/- 0.4%. Notably, quantum-based enhancement contributes to a 2.1% improvement in boundary accuracy, while weighted sampling increases small lesion detection by 3.8%.

To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios.

Previous generative approaches rely on weather-scale autoregression for climate emulation, but this is inherently slow for long climate horizons and has yet to demonstrate stable rollouts under nonstationary forcings. Here, we introduce Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flows (SPF), a new class of flow matching approaches that model data hierarchically across spatial and temporal scales. Inspired by cascaded video models, SPF partitions the generative trajectory into a spatiotemporal pyramid, progressively increasing spatial resolution to reduce computation and coupling each stage with an associated timescale to enable direct sampling at any temporal level in the pyramid. This design, together with conditioning each stage on prescribed physical forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases or aerosols), enables efficient, parallel climate emulation at multiple timescales. On ClimateBench, SPF outperforms strong flow matching baselines and pre-trained models at yearly and monthly timescales while offering fast sampling, especially at coarser temporal levels. To scale SPF, we curate ClimateSuite, the largest collection of Earth system simulations to date, comprising over 33,000 simulation-years across ten climate models and the first dataset to include simulations of climate interventions. We find that the scaled SPF model demonstrates good generalization to held-out scenarios across climate models.

Da Fonseca"], "title": "Network Self-Configuration based on Fine-Tuned Small Language Models", "comment": "16 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables", "summary": "As modern networks grow in scale and complexity, manual configuration becomes increasingly inefficient and prone to human error. While intent-driven self-configuration using large language models has shown significant promise, such models remain computationally expensive, resource-intensive, and often raise privacy concerns because they typically rely on external cloud infrastructure. This work introduces SLM_netconfig, a fine-tuned small language model framework that uses an agent-based architecture and parameter-efficient adaptation techniques to translate configuration intents expressed as natural language requirements or questions into syntactically and semantically valid network configurations.

Yang Zhang leads the whole project", "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, trained via flow-matching or diffusion objectives, excel at learning complex behaviors from large-scale, multi-modal datasets (e.g., human teleoperation, scripted policies). However, since VLAs incorporate diverse data modes in the pre-training stage, and the finetuning dataset often contains demonstration data collected in a kinematically suboptimal or undesirable way, it exists redundant action modes that are irrelevant to the success action modes of the downstream task. Specifically, we observe a critical inference-time fragility among various sampled noises after supervised finetuning of pre-trained VLAs. In this paper, we attribute this instability to the distribution shift between the VLA policy and the policy induced by stable success modes of the downstream task dataset. Thus, we propose \\textbf{TACO}, a test-time-scaling (TTS) framework that applies a lightweight pseudo-count estimator as a high-fidelity verifier of action chunks. The VLA models integrated with TACO can execute the actions with maximum pseudo-count from all sampled action chunks, thereby preventing distribution shifts while preserving the generalization ability of VLAs since the constraint is applied only during inference. Our method resembles the classical anti-exploration principle in offline reinforcement learning (RL), and being gradient-free, it incurs significant computational benefits compared to RL update, especially for flow or diffusion-based VLAs which are difficult to perform RL update due to denoising process.

However, current vision-language models (VLMs) struggle to maintain geometric coherence and cross-view consistency for spatial reasoning in multi-view settings. We attribute this gap to the lack of fine-grained benchmarks that isolate multi-view reasoning from single-view perception and temporal factors. To address this, we present ReMindView-Bench, a cognitively grounded benchmark for evaluating how VLMs construct, align and maintain spatial mental models across complementary viewpoints. ReMindView-Bench systematically varies viewpoint spatial pattern and query type to probe key factors of spatial cognition. Evaluations of 15 current VLMs reveals consistent failures in cross-view alignment and perspective-taking in multi-view spatial reasoning, motivating deeper analysis on the reasoning process. Explicit phase-wise analysis using LLM-as-a-judge and self-consistency prompting shows that VLMs perform well on in-frame perception but degrade sharply when integrating information across views. Implicit analysis, including linear probing and entropy dynamics, further show progressive loss of task-relevant information and uncertainty separation between correct and incorrect trajectories. These results provide a cognitively grounded diagnosis of VLM spatial reasoning and reveal how multi-view spatial mental models are formed, degraded and destabilized across reasoning phases.

Enabling such in-editor interaction is technically non-trivial: it requires reliable bidirectional synchronization with the editor, fine-grained version control and patching, secure state management, multi-agent scheduling, and extensible communication with external tools. PaperDebugger addresses these challenges through a Chrome-approved extension, a Kubernetes-native orchestration layer, and a Model Context Protocol (MCP) toolchain that integrates literature search, reference lookup, document scoring, and revision pipelines. Our demo showcases a fully integrated workflow, including localized edits, structured reviews, parallel agent execution, and diff-based updates, encapsulated within a minimal-intrusion user interface (UI). Early aggregated analytics demonstrate active user engagement and validate the practicality of an editor-native, agentic writing assistant.

However, safety-critical scenarios that can effectively expose system vulnerabilities are extremely sparse in the real world. Existing scenario generation methods face challenges in efficiently constructing long-tail scenarios that ensure fidelity, criticality, and interactivity, while particularly lacking real-time dynamic response capabilities to the vehicle under test (VUT). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a safety-critical testing scenario generation framework that integrates the high-level semantic understanding capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with the fine-grained generation capabilities of adaptive guided diffusion models. The framework establishes a three-layer hierarchical architecture comprising a strategic layer for VLM-directed scenario generation objective determination, a tactical layer for guidance function formulation, and an operational layer for guided diffusion execution. We first establish a high-quality fundamental diffusion model that learns the data distribution of real driving scenarios. Next, we design an adaptive guided diffusion method that enables real-time, precise control of background vehicles (BVs) in closed-loop simulation. The VLM is then incorporated to autonomously generate scenario generation objectives and guidance functions through deep scenario understanding and risk reasoning, ultimately guiding the diffusion model to achieve VLM-directed scenario generation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently generate realistic, diverse, and highly interactive safety-critical testing scenarios. Furthermore, case studies validate the adaptability and VLM-directed generation performance of the proposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408VLM\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e09\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u6784\u5efa\u786e\u4fdd\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u5173\u952e\u6027\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u573a\u666f\u65b9\u9762\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u88ab\u6d4b\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u54cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u5c42\u5c42\u6b21\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6218\u7565\u5c42\uff08VLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u786e\u5b9a\uff09\u3001\u6218\u672f\u5c42\uff08\u5f15\u5bfc\u51fd\u6570\u5236\u5b9a\uff09\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u5c42\uff08\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6267\u884c\uff09\u3002\u9996\u5148\u5efa\u7acb\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u771f\u5b9e\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u95ed\u73af\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u80cc\u666f\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u7ed3\u5408VLM\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u63a8\u7406\u81ea\u4e3b\u751f\u6210\u573a\u666f\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548cVLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548cVLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Traditional optimization approaches rely on large-scale online experiments or parameter tuning over predefined statistical models, which are costly, time-consuming, and may disrupt player experience. Although simplified offline simulation systems are often adopted as alternatives, their limited fidelity prevents agents from accurately mimicking real player reasoning and reactions to interventions. To address these limitations, we propose a generative agent-based MMO simulation system empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). By applying Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on large-scale real player behavioral data, we adapt LLMs from general priors to game-specific domains, enabling realistic and interpretable player decision-making. In parallel, a data-driven environment model trained on real gameplay logs reconstructs dynamic in-game systems. Experiments demonstrate strong consistency with real-world player behaviors and plausible causal responses under interventions, providing a reliable, interpretable, and cost-efficient framework for data-driven numerical design optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLLMs\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7406MMO\u6a21\u62df\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SFT\u548cRL\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u73a9\u5bb6\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4e3a\u6e38\u620f\u6570\u503c\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5728\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6216\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8017\u65f6\u957f\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u5e72\u6270\u73a9\u5bb6\u4f53\u9a8c\uff1b\u79bb\u7ebf\u6a21\u62df\u7cfb\u7edf\u5219\u56e0\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6a21\u62df\u73a9\u5bb6\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u73a9\u5bb6\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\uff0c\u5c06LLMs\u4ece\u901a\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\u9002\u5e94\u5230\u6e38\u620f\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u91cd\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u6e38\u620f\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u73a9\u5bb6\u884c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5e72\u9884\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5408\u7406\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7406\u7684MMO\u6a21\u62df\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u73a9\u5bb6\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u503c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Unlike traditional systems that require pre-defined graphs or specialized programming, IACT operates as a general-purpose autonomous system driven purely by user dialogue. Given a high-level objective, the system autonomously grows a dynamic, recursive agent topology incrementally tailored to the problem's structure. This allows it to scale its organizational complexity to match open-ended tasks. To mitigate the error propagation inherent in unidirectional function calls, IACT introduces interactional redundancy by replacing rigid invocations with bidirectional, stateful dialogues.

Inspired by techniques from autonomous driving and robotics, we investigate whether supervised learning with synthetic error injection can induce self-correction abilities in language models. Our approach inserts artificial errors into reasoning chains, masks them, and supervises the model to recognize and correct these mistakes. Despite the intuitive appeal of this method, we find that it fails to significantly improve performance even on simple synthetic tasks across multiple models.

However, when deployed in online settings such as driving scenarios, predictions are made over temporal windows, making it non-trivial to maintain consistency across time. Recent strategies align consecutive predictions by solving global transformation, yet our analysis reveals their fundamental limitations in assumption validity, local alignment scope, and robustness under noisy geometry. In this work, we propose a higher-DOF and long-term alignment framework based on Thin Plate Spline, leveraging globally propagated control points to correct spatially varying inconsistencies. In addition, we adopt a point-agnostic submap registration design that is inherently robust to noisy geometry predictions. The proposed framework is fully plug-and-play, compatible with diverse 3D foundation models and camera configurations (e.g., monocular or surround-view). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently yields more coherent geometry and lower trajectory errors across multiple datasets, backbone models, and camera setups, highlighting its robustness and generality.

In this paper, we present the physical prototyping and experimental characterization of a three-degree-of-freedom, linkage-driven, series-parallel robotic finger with analytic forward kinematics and a closed-form Jacobian. A resolved motion rate control (RMRC) scheme is implemented to achieve closed-loop task-space trajectory tracking. We experimentally evaluate the fingertip tracking performance across a variety of trajectories, including straight lines, circles, and more complex curves, and report millimeter-level accuracy.

Yet in practice, unguided self-evolving systems often plateau quickly or even degrade as training progresses. These failures arise from issues such as concept drift, diversity collapse, and mis-evolution, as models reinforce their own biases and converge toward low-entropy behaviors. To enable models to self-evolve in a stable and controllable manner while minimizing reliance on human supervision, we introduce R-Few, a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework that incorporates lightweight human oversight through in-context grounding and mixed training. At each iteration, the Challenger samples a small set of human-labeled examples to guide synthetic question generation, while the Solver jointly trains on human and synthetic examples under an online, difficulty-based curriculum. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Few achieves consistent and iterative improvements. For example, Qwen3-8B-Base improves by +3.0 points over R-Zero on math tasks and achieves performance on par with General-Reasoner, despite the latter being trained on 20 times more human data. Ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of grounded challenger training and curriculum-based solver training, and further analysis shows that R-Few mitigates drift, yielding more stable and controllable co-evolutionary dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "R-Few\u901a\u8fc7\u6311\u6218\u8005-\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u6307\u5bfc\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u8fdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "R-Few\u91c7\u7528\u6311\u6218\u8005-\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5219\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u96be\u5ea6\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4e0b\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cQwen3-8B-Base\u6bd4R-Zero\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863.0\u5206\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u591a20\u500d\u7684General-Reasoner\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u6311\u6218\u8005\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "R-Few\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u8fed\u4ee3\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Recent methods employ video diffusion models (VDMs) to enhance robotic policies, improving their understanding and modeling of the physical world. However, existing approaches overlook the coherent and physically consistent motion representations inherently encoded across frames in VDMs. To this end, we propose Video2Act, a framework that efficiently guides robotic action learning by explicitly integrating spatial and motion-aware representations. Building on the inherent representations of VDMs, we extract foreground boundaries and inter-frame motion variations while filtering out background noise and task-irrelevant biases. These refined representations are then used as additional conditioning inputs to a diffusion transformer (DiT) action head, enabling it to reason about what to manipulate and how to move. To mitigate inference inefficiency, we propose an asynchronous dual-system design, where the VDM functions as the slow System 2 and the DiT head as the fast System 1, working collaboratively to generate adaptive actions. By providing motion-aware conditions to System 1, Video2Act maintains stable manipulation even with low-frequency updates from the VDM. For evaluation, Video2Act surpasses previous state-of-the-art VLA methods by 7.7% in simulation and 21.7% in real-world tasks in terms of average success rate, further exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Video2Act\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408VDMs\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5f02\u6b65\u53cc\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08VDMs\uff09\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Video2Act\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u524d\u666f\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u5e27\u95f4\u8fd0\u52a8\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u8fc7\u6ee4\u80cc\u666f\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08DiT\uff09\u52a8\u4f5c\u5934\u7684\u989d\u5916\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5f02\u6b65\u53cc\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0cVDM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6162\u901f\u7cfb\u7edf2\uff0cDiT\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5feb\u901f\u7cfb\u7edf1\uff0c\u534f\u540c\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "Video2Act\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u53477.7%\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u534721.7%\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Video2Act\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Clinical notes contain rich contextual information, but their unstructured nature limits their use in traditional predictive models. We developed and evaluated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Outcome Prediction Engine (COPE), a reasoning-enhanced large language model framework, for predicting 90-day functional outcomes after AIS from unstructured clinical notes. This study included 464 AIS patients with discharge summaries and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. COPE uses a two-step CoT framework based on sequential open-source LLaMA-3-8B models: the first generates clinical reasoning, and the second outputs an mRS prediction. We compared COPE with GPT-4.1, ClinicalBERT, a structured variable-based machine learning model (Clinical ML), and a single-step LLM without CoT. Performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), accuracy within +/-1 mRS point, and exact accuracy. COPE achieved an MAE of 1.01 (95% CI 0.92-1.11), +/-1 accuracy of 74.4% (69.9, 78.8%), and exact accuracy of 32.8% (28.0, 37.6%), comparable to GPT-4.1 and superior to ClinicalBERT [MAE 1.24 (1.13-1.36)], Clinical ML [1.28 (1.18-1.39)], and the single-step LLM [1.20 (1.09-1.33)]. Subgroup analyses showed consistent performance across sex and age, with slightly higher error among older patients, those undergoing thrombectomy, and those with longer summaries.

Recent efforts pursue unified multimodal models that integrate heterogeneous components to support both capabilities within a single framework. However, such unification introduces inference inefficiencies, e.g., specific tasks or samples may not require the full knowledge or capacity of the unified model. Yet, a systematic understanding of how these inefficiencies manifest across different components remains limited. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of unified multimodal model components using training-free pruning as a probing methodology, considering both depth pruning and width reduction. Our study reveals that the understanding component exhibits notable compressibility in both understanding and generation tasks, which is more pronounced in the latter. In contrast, the generation components are highly sensitive to compression, with performance deteriorating sharply even under moderate compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adaptation, inspired by the dynamic activation patterns observed across different samples. This approach partitions the generation module into multiple experts and enables sparse activation to restore generation quality. We validate the effectiveness of sparse activation through expert-frozen tuning and further demonstrate that a fully trainable adaptation delivers additional gains. As a result, the adapted BAGEL model achieves performance comparable to the full model while activating only about half of its parameters.

We provide an unprecedented look into the creation of nuScenes, as well as its extensions nuImages and Panoptic nuScenes, summarizing many technical details that have hitherto not been revealed in academic publications. Furthermore, we trace how the influence of nuScenes impacted a large number of other datasets that were released later and how it defined numerous standards that are used by the community to this day.

This framework establishes a transparent and interpretable paradigm, significantly advancing the field of trustworthy AI content moderation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Aetheria\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5185\u5bb9\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8fa9\u8bba\u673a\u5236\u548cRAG\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u5b57\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u589e\u957f\u5bf9\u5185\u5bb9\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u56fa\u5b9a\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u5ba1\u6838\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u9690\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5224\u65ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u4e0e\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408RAG\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u88c1\u51b3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08AIR-Bench\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cAetheria\u4e0d\u4ec5\u751f\u6210\u8be6\u7ec6\u4e14\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u5185\u5bb9\u5b89\u5168\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9690\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u8bc6\u522b\uff09\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Aetheria\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u4e0e\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u5b89\u5168\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Existing deep-learning multi-view crowd counting methods project different camera view images onto a common space to obtain ground-plane density maps, requiring abundant and costly crowd annotations and camera calibrations. Hence, calibration-free methods are proposed that do not require camera calibrations and scene-level crowd annotations. However, existing calibration-free methods still require expensive image-level crowd annotations for training the single-view counting module. Thus, in this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised calibration-free multi-view crowd counting method (WSCF-MVCC), directly using crowd count as supervision for the single-view counting module rather than density maps constructed from crowd annotations. Instead, a self-supervised ranking loss that leverages multi-scale priors is utilized to enhance the model's perceptual ability without additional annotation costs. What's more, the proposed model leverages semantic information to achieve a more accurate view matching and, consequently, a more precise scene-level crowd count estimation. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three widely used multi-view counting datasets under weakly supervised settings, indicating that it is more suitable for practical deployment compared with calibrated methods.

Consequently, they may struggle with basic perception tasks that conventional models handle reliably. Given the substantial cost of pre-training and fine-tuning VLMs, continue training on augmented data yields limited and diminishing returns. In this paper, we present Visual Augmentation Chain-of-Thought (VACoT), a framework that dynamically invokes image augmentations during model inference. By incorporating post-hoc transformations such as denoising, VACoT substantially improves robustness on challenging and out-of-distribution inputs, especially in OCR-related adversarial scenarios. Distinct from prior approaches limited to local cropping, VACoT integrates a structured collection of general visual augmentations, broadening the query image views while reducing training complexity and computational overhead with efficient agentic reinforcement learning. We propose a conditional reward scheme that encourages necessary augmentation while penalizing verbose responses, ensuring concise and effective reasoning in perception tasks.

However, because of the fundamental disparity in geometric accuracy between these sensors, indiscriminate fusion in previous methods often leads to degraded performance. In this paper, we propose BEVDilation, a novel LiDAR-centric framework that prioritizes LiDAR information in the fusion. By formulating image BEV features as implicit guidance rather than naive concatenation, our strategy effectively alleviates the spatial misalignment caused by image depth estimation errors. Furthermore, the image guidance can effectively help the LiDAR-centric paradigm to address the sparsity and semantic limitations of point clouds. Specifically, we propose a Sparse Voxel Dilation Block that mitigates the inherent point sparsity by densifying foreground voxels through image priors. Moreover, we introduce a Semantic-Guided BEV Dilation Block to enhance the LiDAR feature diffusion processing with image semantic guidance and long-range context capture. On the challenging nuScenes benchmark, BEVDilation achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive computational efficiency.

TB, a persistent infectious disease affecting humanity for millennia, poses challenges in diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings. Traditional methods, such as sputum smear microscopy and culture, are inefficient, prompting the exploration of advanced technologies like deep learning and computer vision. The study utilized a dataset from Kaggle, consisting of 4,200 chest X-rays, to develop and compare the performance of the two machine learning models. Preprocessing involved data splitting, augmentation, and resizing to enhance training efficiency. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, were employed to assess model performance. Results showcase that the SqueezeNet achieved a loss of 32%, accuracy of 89%, precision of 98%, recall of 80%, and an F1 score of 87%. In contrast, the ResNet-50 model exhibited a loss of 54%, accuracy of 73%, precision of 88%, recall of 52%, and an F1 score of 65%. This study emphasizes the potential of machine learning in TB detection and possible implications for early identification and treatment initiation.

In this work, we present U4D, an uncertainty-aware framework for 4D LiDAR world modeling. Our approach first estimates spatial uncertainty maps from a pretrained segmentation model to localize semantically challenging regions. It then performs generation in a \"hard-to-easy\" manner through two sequential stages: (1) uncertainty-region modeling, which reconstructs high-entropy regions with fine geometric fidelity, and (2) uncertainty-conditioned completion, which synthesizes the remaining areas under learned structural priors. To further ensure temporal coherence, U4D incorporates a mixture of spatio-temporal (MoST) block that adaptively fuses spatial and temporal representations during diffusion.

Existing methods often struggle to efficiently extract valuable scene information from redundant data, thereby reducing computational efficiency and prediction accuracy, especially when dealing with intricate agent interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel map-free trajectory prediction algorithm that achieves trajectory prediction across the temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. Specifically, in temporal information processing, We utilize a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to adaptively select critical frequency components. Concurrently, we extract these components and integrate multi-scale temporal features.

Data-driven RUL prediction techniques have demonstrated commendable performance. However, their efficacy often relies on the assumption that training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution or domain, which does not hold in real industrial settings. To mitigate this domain discrepancy issue, prior adversarial domain adaptation methods focused on deriving domain-invariant features. Nevertheless, they overlook target-specific information and inconsistency characteristics pertinent to the degradation stages, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel domain adaptation approach for cross-domain RUL prediction named TACDA. Specifically, we propose a target domain reconstruction strategy within the adversarial adaptation process, thereby retaining target-specific information while learning domain-invariant features. Furthermore, we develop a novel clustering and pairing strategy for consistent alignment between similar degradation stages.

However, in many real-world scenarios, we are unable to access the model parameters and architectural details due to privacy concerns and security constraints. Traditional fine-tuning or adaptation is hindered, leading to the demand for input-level strategies that can enhance generalization without modifying model weights. To this end, we propose a \\textbf{S}tyle-\\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{GE}neralization framework (\\textbf{SAGE}), which improves the generalization of frozen models under privacy constraints. SAGE learns to synthesize visual prompts that implicitly align feature distributions across styles instead of directly fine-tuning the backbone. Specifically, we first utilize style transfer to construct a diverse style representation of the source domain, thereby learning a set of style characteristics that can cover a wide range of visual features. Then, the model adaptively fuses these style cues according to the visual context of each input, forming a dynamic prompt that harmonizes the image appearance without touching the interior of the model. Through this closed-loop design, SAGE effectively bridges the gap between frozen model invariance and the diversity of unseen domains.

However, existing approaches fall short in environments where multiple high-level events (i.e., atomic propositions) can be true at the same time and potentially interact in complicated ways. In this work, we propose a novel approach to learning a multi-task policy for following arbitrary LTL instructions that addresses this shortcoming.

However, most existing methods focus on processing captured images or sequential frames in real time, without explicitly evaluating the quality of the on-the-go 3D reconstruction or providing guided feedback to enhance image acquisition in the target area. This work presents On-the-fly Feedback SfM, an explore-and-exploit framework for real-time UAV photogrammetry, enabling iterative exploration of unseen regions and exploitation of already observed and reconstructed areas in near real time. Built upon SfM on-the-fly , the proposed method integrates three modules: (1) online incremental coarse-mesh generation for dynamically expanding sparse 3D point cloud; (2) online mesh quality assessment with actionable indicators; and (3) predictive path planning for on-the-fly trajectory refinement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves in-situ reconstruction and evaluation in near real time while providing actionable feedback that markedly reduces coverage gaps and re-flight costs. Via the integration of data collection, processing, 3D reconstruction and assessment, and online feedback, our on the-fly feedback SfM could be an alternative for the transition from traditional passive working mode to a more intelligent and adaptive exploration workflow.

While prior research has extensively studied length generalization (a model's ability to handle longer sequences than seen during training), we investigate a distinct and underexplored limitation: depth generalization. Here, depth refers to the number of nested levels in a hierarchical problem, such as the layers of parentheses in a mathematical expression or the nesting of logical clauses in a Boolean formula. Our work reveals that standard transformer architectures struggle with problems involving deeper recursion than encountered during training, even when they perform well on longer but non-nested sequences. This limitation stems from their inability to maintain stack-like behavior, the capacity to track and resolve multiple levels of nested dependencies. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate how this architectural constraint leads to rapid performance decay as the depth of the recursion increases. To address this challenge, we develop a novel looped locate-and-replace pipeline that decomposes recursive problems into manageable subcomponents. The approach employs two specialized models: a locator that identifies solvable subexpressions and a replacer that evaluates these components while preserving the overall structure. We evaluated this method in three carefully designed domains: Boolean algebra, recursive arithmetic, and propositional logic, each with a controllable depth of recursion. We show that our method effectively alleviates the performance decay when tested on out-of-distribution recursion depth.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0Transformer\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6df1\u5c42\u9012\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5faa\u73af\u5b9a\u4f4d-\u66ff\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9012\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8d85\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u5d4c\u5957\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u5b9a\u4f4d-\u66ff\u6362\u7ba1\u9053\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u9012\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u5b50\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5668\u548c\u66ff\u6362\u5668\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e03\u5c14\u4ee3\u6570\u3001\u9012\u5f52\u7b97\u672f\u548c\u547d\u9898\u903b\u8f91\u4e09\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u8d85\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u9012\u5f52\u6df1\u5ea6\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8870\u51cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6807\u51c6Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8d85\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u5b9a\u4f4d-\u66ff\u6362\u7ba1\u9053\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Despite their strong detection performance, these methods suffer from relatively low association accuracy. Through detailed analysis, we observe that object embeddings produced by the shared DETR architecture display excessively high inter-object similarity, as it emphasizes only category-level discrimination within single frames. In contrast, tracking requires instance-level distinction across frames with spatial and temporal continuity, for which current end-to-end approaches insufficiently optimize object embeddings. To address this, we introduce FDTA (From Detection to Association), an explicit feature refinement framework that enhances object discriminativeness across three complementary perspectives. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial Adapter (SA) to integrate depth-aware cues for spatial continuity, a Temporal Adapter (TA) to aggregate historical information for temporal dependencies, and an Identity Adapter (IA) to leverage quality-aware contrastive learning for instance-level separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FDTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging MOT benchmarks, including DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BFT, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed discriminative embedding enhancement strategy.

Although existing methods have advanced emotion understanding, they often suffer from reasoning drift: models gradually rely on their own generated text instead of multimodal evidence, and their explanations are overly shaped by visually initiated reasoning paths. To address these issues, we introduce Modality Importance (MI), a simple yet effective mechanism for identifying the emotion-dominant modality. Using MI, MIGR reorganizes reasoning sequences so that explanations begin from the modality most critical to the target emotion, preventing early reasoning from being misled by less informative cues. Our two-stage framework-comprising modality-aligned supervised fine-tuning and modality-aware reward optimization-encourages models to generate emotionally grounded, causally relevant, and coherence-preserving explanations. Experimental results on the DFEW benchmark show that MIGR substantially improves reasoning reliability, decreasing instances of correct predictions accompanied by emotionally inconsistent explanations from 18.10% to 7.37%.

The RaDelft data set, although seminal, provides only LiDAR annotations and no public code to generate radar labels, limiting reproducibility and downstream research. In this work, we reproduce the numerical results of the RaDelft group and demonstrate that a camera-guided radar labeling pipeline can generate accurate labels for radar point clouds without relying on human annotations. By projecting radar point clouds into camera-based semantic segmentation and applying spatial clustering, we create labels that significantly enhance the accuracy of radar labels.

While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in mental health applications, their size and computational demands hinder practical deployment. Small language models (SLMs) offer a lightweight alternative, but their use for social media--based mental health prediction remains largely underexplored. In this study, we introduce Menta, the first optimized SLM fine-tuned specifically for multi-task mental health prediction from social media data. Menta is jointly trained across six classification tasks using a LoRA-based framework, a cross-dataset strategy, and a balanced accuracy--oriented loss. Evaluated against nine state-of-the-art SLM baselines, Menta achieves an average improvement of 15.2\\% across tasks covering depression, stress, and suicidality compared with the best-performing non--fine-tuned SLMs. It also achieves higher accuracy on depression and stress classification tasks compared to 13B-parameter LLMs, while being approximately 3.25x smaller. Moreover, we demonstrate real-time, on-device deployment of Menta on an iPhone 15 Pro Max, requiring only approximately 3GB RAM. Supported by a comprehensive benchmark against existing SLMs and LLMs, Menta highlights the potential for scalable, privacy-preserving mental health monitoring.

To address these challenges, we propose Nav-$R^2$, a framework that explicitly models two critical types of relationships, target-environment modeling and environment-action planning, through structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning coupled with a Similarity-Aware Memory. We construct a Nav$R^2$-CoT dataset that teaches the model to perceive the environment, focus on target-related objects in the surrounding context and finally make future action plans. Our SA-Mem preserves the most target-relevant and current observation-relevant features from both temporal and semantic perspectives by compressing video frames and fusing historical observations, while introducing no additional parameters. Compared to previous methods, Nav-R^2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in localizing unseen objects through a streamlined and efficient pipeline, avoiding overfitting to seen object categories while maintaining real-time inference at 2Hz.

While large language models (LLMs) offer new avenues for text-based forecasting, their application in finance is hindered by noisy news data and the lack of explicit answers in text. General-purpose memory architectures struggle to identify the key drivers of price movements. To address this, we propose StockMem, an event-reflection dual-layer memory framework. It structures news into events and mines them along two dimensions: horizontal consolidation integrates daily events, while longitudinal tracking captures event evolution to extract incremental information reflecting market expectation discrepancies. This builds a temporal event knowledge base. By analyzing event-price dynamics, the framework further forms a reflection knowledge base of causal experiences. For prediction, it retrieves analogous historical scenarios and reasons with current events, incremental data, and past experiences.

In this paper, we study MAD for solving vision-and-language reasoning problems. Our setup enables generalizing the debate protocol with heterogeneous experts that possess single- and multi-modal capabilities. To this end, we present Weighted Iterative Society-of-Experts (WISE), a generalized and modular MAD framework that partitions the agents into Solvers, that generate solutions, and Reflectors, that verify correctness, assign weights, and provide natural language feedback. To aggregate the agents' solutions across debate rounds, while accounting for variance in their responses and the feedback weights, we present a modified Dawid-Skene algorithm for post-processing that integrates our two-stage debate model. We evaluate WISE on SMART-840, VisualPuzzles, EvoChart-QA, and a new SMART-840++ dataset with programmatically generated problem instances of controlled difficulty.

However, existing methods optimized for standard metrics often struggle to detect thin structural components and yield masks with irregular boundaries, lacking the geometric precision required for subsequent vectorization. To address this issue, we introduce MitUNet, a hybrid neural network architecture specifically designed for wall segmentation tasks in the context of 3D modeling. In MitUNet, we utilize a hierarchical Mix-Transformer encoder to capture global context and a U-Net decoder enhanced with scSE attention blocks for precise boundary recovery. Furthermore, we propose an optimization strategy based on the Tversky loss function to effectively balance precision and recall. By fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the loss function, we prioritize the suppression of false positive noise along wall boundaries while maintaining high sensitivity to thin structures. Our experiments on the public CubiCasa5k dataset and a proprietary regional dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures the generation of structurally correct masks with high boundary accuracy, outperforming standard single-task models.

While previous work established the AAI capability score as a static functional on the space of agent representations, this paper formalizes the agent as a flow $\u03bd_r$ parameterized by computational resource $r$, governed by a recursive Generator-Verifier-Updater (GVU) operator. We prove that this operator generates a vector field on the parameter manifold $\u0398$, and we identify the coefficient of self-improvement $\u03ba$ as the Lie derivative of the capability functional along this flow.\n  The central contribution of this work is the derivation of the Variance Inequality, a spectral condition that is sufficient (under mild regularity) for the stability of self-improvement. We show that a sufficient condition for $\u03ba> 0$ is that, up to curvature and step-size effects, the combined noise of generation and verification must be small enough.\n  We then apply this formalism to unify the recent literature on Language Self-Play (LSP), Self-Correction, and Synthetic Data bootstrapping. We demonstrate that architectures such as STaR, SPIN, Reflexion, GANs and AlphaZero are specific topological realizations of the GVU operator that satisfy the Variance Inequality through filtration, adversarial discrimination, or grounding in formal systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6a21\u6570\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7GVU\u7b97\u5b50\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u4e3a\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u5c55\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u7535\u6c60\u7684\u6a21\u6570\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5230\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4ee3\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u5206\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u6d41\u03bd_r\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u9012\u5f52\u7684\u751f\u6210-\u9a8c\u8bc1-\u66f4\u65b0\uff08GVU\uff09\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u7b97\u5b50\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u6d41\u5f62\u0398\u4e0a\u751f\u6210\u5411\u91cf\u573a\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u7cfb\u6570\u03ba\u4e3a\u80fd\u529b\u6cdb\u51fd\u6cbf\u8be5\u6d41\u7684Lie\u5bfc\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u8054\u5408\u566a\u58f0\u8db3\u591f\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u03ba>0\u7684\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u5bfc\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06GVU\u7b97\u5b50\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7edf\u4e00\u8bed\u8a00\u81ea\u73a9\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b49\u6700\u65b0\u6587\u732e\u3002"}}

Current methods typically fine-tune a universal model on the entire dataset, which potentially compromises the ability to generalize to unseen domains. To fill this gap, we provide a theoretical understanding of the generalization ability for VLM fine-tuning, which reveals that training multiple parameter-efficient expert models on partitioned source domains leads to better generalization than fine-tuning a universal model. Inspired by this finding, we propose a two-step domain-expert-Guided DG (GuiDG) framework. GuiDG first employs prompt tuning to obtain source domain experts, then introduces a Cross-Modal Attention module to guide the fine-tuning of the vision encoder via adaptive expert integration. To better evaluate few-shot DG, we construct ImageNet-DG from ImageNet and its variants. Extensive experiments on standard DG benchmarks and ImageNet-DG demonstrate that GuiDG improves upon state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods while maintaining efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "GuiDG\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5355\u4e00\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u9886\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff08GuiDG\uff09\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u83b7\u53d6\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6574\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u81ea\u5efa\u7684ImageNet-DG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cGuiDG\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GuiDG\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Through extensive experiments, we find that supervised fine-tuning enables effective memorization of fundamental knowledge, serving as a crucial foundation for subsequent training. Building on this, single-turn reinforcement learning further enhances generalization to unseen scenarios. Finally, multi-turn reinforcement learning encourages the development of exploration strategies through interactive trial and error, leading to further improvements in screen navigation performance.

However, existing frameworks often lack mechanisms to verify and refine the outputs at each generation step, or rely heavily on manually designed prompts for self-refinement, which limits their adaptability and scalability. To address these limitations, we propose a prompt-free collaborative agent framework that automatically enhances the quality of paper-to-code generation. Our approach employs two collaborative agents: a verification agent that examines whether the outputs at each step satisfy the requirements specified in the corresponding system prompt, and a refinement agent that revises the outputs based on the identified issues. Unlike previous methods that require human experts to craft specific refinement prompts for each step, our framework achieves automatic verification and improvement by leveraging only the original system prompts.

However, scaling them to hours- or days-long videos remains highly challenging due to limited context capacity and the loss of critical visual details during abstraction. Existing memory-augmented methods mitigate this by leveraging textual summaries of video segments, yet they heavily rely on text and fail to utilize visual evidence when reasoning over complex scenes. Moreover, retrieving from fixed temporal scales further limits their flexibility in capturing events that span variable durations. To address this, we introduce WorldMM, a novel multimodal memory agent that constructs and retrieves from multiple complementary memories, encompassing both textual and visual representations. WorldMM comprises three types of memory: episodic memory indexes factual events across multiple temporal scales, semantic memory continuously updates high-level conceptual knowledge, and visual memory preserves detailed information about scenes. During inference, an adaptive retrieval agent iteratively selects the most relevant memory source and leverages multiple temporal granularities based on the query, continuing until it determines that sufficient information has been gathered. WorldMM significantly outperforms existing baselines across five long video question-answering benchmarks, achieving an average 8.4% performance gain over previous state-of-the-art methods, showing its effectiveness on long video reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "WorldMM\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff08\u6587\u672c+\u89c6\u89c9\uff09\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bb9\u91cf\u6709\u9650\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e14\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6355\u6349\u53ef\u53d8\u65f6\u957f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "WorldMM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5e76\u68c0\u7d22\u4e09\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff1a\u8de8\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7d22\u5f15\uff08\u60c5\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff09\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u6982\u5ff5\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u8bed\u4e49\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff09\u548c\u4fdd\u7559\u573a\u666f\u7ec6\u8282\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68c0\u7d22\u4ee3\u7406\u57fa\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u8fed\u4ee3\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6e90\u548c\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u7c92\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "WorldMM\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53478.4%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "WorldMM\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53478.4%\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Mainly characterized by dimmed and blurred visions, or peripheral vision loss, glaucoma is well known to occur due to damages in the optic nerve from increased intraocular pressure (IOP) or neovascularization within the retina. Traditionally, most glaucoma related works and clinical diagnosis focused on detecting these damages in the optic nerve by using patient data from perimetry tests, optic papilla inspections and tonometer-based IOP measurements. Recently, with advancements in computer vision AI models, such as VGG16 or Vision Transformers (ViT), AI-automatized glaucoma detection and optic cup segmentation based on retinal fundus images or OCT recently exhibited significant performance in aiding conventional diagnosis with high performance. However, current AI-driven glaucoma detection approaches still have significant room for improvement in terms of reliability, excessive parameter usage, possibility of spurious correlation within detection, and limitations in applications to intervention analysis or clinical simulations. Thus, this research introduced a novel causal representation driven glaucoma detection model: LightHCG, an extremely lightweight Convolutional VAE-based latent glaucoma representation model that can consider the true causality among glaucoma-related physical factors within the optic nerve region. Using HSIC-based latent space disentanglement and Graph Autoencoder based unsupervised causal representation learning, LightHCG not only exhibits higher performance in classifying glaucoma with 93~99% less weights, but also enhances the possibility of AI-driven intervention analysis, compared to existing advanced vision models such as InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 or VGG16.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9752\u5149\u773c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578bLightHCG\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u89e3\u7f20\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1AI\u5728\u9752\u5149\u773c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u89c6\u676f\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u3001\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53ca\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\u5e94\u7528\u4e0a\u4ecd\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eHSIC\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u89e3\u7f20\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u540d\u4e3aLightHCG\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5377\u79efVAE\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "LightHCG\u5728\u9752\u5149\u773c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8693~99%\u7684\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eInceptionV3\u3001MobileNetV2\u548cVGG16\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "LightHCG\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9752\u5149\u773c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd8\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

Pretrained VLMs enable fine-tuning on small datasets or zero-shot inference, achieving performance comparable to task-specific models. Contrastive learning (CL) is a key paradigm for training VLMs but inherently requires large batch sizes for effective learning, making it computationally demanding and often limited to well-resourced institutions. Moreover, with limited data in healthcare, it is important to prioritize knowledge extraction from both data and models during training to improve performance. Therefore, we focus on leveraging the momentum method combined with distillation to simultaneously address computational efficiency and knowledge exploitation. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) leveraging momentum self-distillation to enhance multimodal learning, and (2) integrating momentum mechanisms with gradient accumulation to enlarge the effective batch size without increasing resource consumption. Our method attains competitive performance with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in zero-shot classification, while providing a substantial boost in the few-shot adaption, achieving over 90% AUC-ROC and improving retrieval tasks by 2-3%. Importantly, our method achieves high training efficiency with a single GPU while maintaining reasonable training time.

However, emerging evidence suggests that iterative reasoning may foster belief entrenchment and confirmation bias, rather than enhancing truth-seeking behavior. In this study, we propose a systematic evaluation framework for belief entrenchment in LLM reasoning by leveraging the Martingale property from Bayesian statistics. This property implies that, under rational belief updating, the expected value of future beliefs should remain equal to the current belief, i.e., belief updates are unpredictable from the current belief. We propose the unsupervised, regression-based Martingale Score to measure violations of this property, which signal deviation from the Bayesian ability of updating on new evidence. In open-ended problem domains including event forecasting, value-laden questions, and academic paper review, we find such violations to be widespread across models and setups, where the current belief positively predicts future belief updates, a phenomenon which we term belief entrenchment. We identify the models, reasoning techniques, and domains more prone to belief entrenchment. Finally, we validate the Martingale Score by showing that it predicts ground-truth accuracy on problem domains where ground truth labels are available. This indicates that, while designed as an unsupervised metric that operates even in domains without access to ground truth, the Martingale Score is a useful proxy of the truth-seeking ability of a reasoning process.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces a Martingale Score to measure belief entrenchment in LLMs, finding it widespread across domains and validating the score as a truth-seeking proxy.", "motivation": "To systematically evaluate belief entrenchment in LLM reasoning, as iterative reasoning may foster confirmation bias rather than truth-seeking behavior.", "method": "The study proposes an unsupervised, regression-based Martingale Score to measure violations of the Martingale property, signaling deviation from Bayesian belief updating.

Meta-learning approaches explicitly learn good initializations, but they require an additional meta-training phase over many tasks, incur high training cost, and can be unstable. At the same time, the number of task-specific pre-trained models continues to grow, yet the question of how to transfer them to new tasks with minimal additional training remains relatively underexplored. We propose BOLT (Basis-Oriented Low-rank Transfer), a framework that reuses existing fine-tuned models not by merging weights, but instead by extracting an orthogonal, task-informed spectral basis and adapting within that subspace. In the offline phase, BOLT collects dominant singular directions from multiple task vectors and orthogonalizes them per layer to form reusable bases. In the online phase, we freeze these bases and train only a small set of diagonal coefficients per layer for the new task, yielding a rank-controlled update with very few trainable parameters. This design provides (i) a strong, training-free initialization for unseen tasks, obtained by pooling source-task coefficients, along with a lightweight rescaling step while leveraging the shared orthogonal bases, and (ii) a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) path that, in our experiments, achieves robust performance compared to common PEFT baselines as well as a representative meta-learned initialization. Our results show that constraining adaptation to a task-informed orthogonal subspace provides an effective alternative for unseen-task transfer.", "AI": {"tldr": "BOLT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u91cd\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u672a\u89c1\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u9002\u5e94\u672a\u89c1\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u73b0\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u957f\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "BOLT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u6b63\u4ea4\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u57fa\u5e76\u5728\u8be5\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u91cd\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u79bb\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\u6536\u96c6\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5947\u5f02\u65b9\u5411\u5e76\u6309\u5c42\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u5f62\u6210\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u57fa\uff1b\u5728\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\u51bb\u7ed3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u57fa\u5e76\u4ec5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6bcf\u5c42\u4e00\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u5bf9\u89d2\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "BOLT\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u76f8\u6bd4\u5e38\u89c1\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ea6\u675f\u9002\u5e94\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e3a\u672a\u89c1\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u79fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing SNNs typically replicate inputs directly or aggregate them into frames at fixed intervals. Such strategies lead to neurons receiving nearly identical stimuli across time steps, severely limiting the model's expressive power, particularly in complex tasks like object detection. In this work, we propose the Temporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE) to strengthen SNNs' capacity for temporal information modeling. TDE consists of two modules: a Spiking Encoder (SE) that generates diverse input stimuli across time steps, and an Attention Gating Module (AGM) that guides the SE generation based on inter-temporal dependencies. Moreover, to eliminate the high-energy multiplication operations introduced by the AGM, we propose a Spike-Driven Attention (SDA) to reduce attention-related energy consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TDE can be seamlessly integrated into existing SNN-based detectors and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving mAP50-95 scores of 57.7% on the static PASCAL VOC dataset and 47.6% on the neuromorphic EvDET200K dataset.

However, capturing intra-style diversity, where a single style should correspond to diverse motion variations, remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based framework, ClusterStyle, to address this limitation. Instead of learning an unstructured embedding from each style motion, we leverage a set of prototypes to effectively model diverse style patterns across motions belonging to the same style category. We consider two types of style diversity: global-level diversity among style motions of the same category, and local-level diversity within the temporal dynamics of motion sequences. These components jointly shape two structured style embedding spaces, i.e., global and local, optimized via alignment with non-learnable prototype anchors. Furthermore, we augment the pretrained text-to-motion generation model with the Stylistic Modulation Adapter (SMA) to integrate the style features.

However, effective multimodal reasoning requires both accurate perception and robust reasoning, and weakness in either limits the performance of VLMs. Prior efforts to enhance reasoning often depend on high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data, obtained via labor-intensive human annotations, costly proprietary models, or self-training methods that overlook perception. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective self-training framework called See-Think-Learn (STL). At its core, STL introduces a structured reasoning template that encourages the model to see before thinking, first extracting visual attributes in textual form, then using them to guide reasoning. The framework jointly improves perception and reasoning by having the model generate and learn from its own structured rationales in a self-training loop. Furthermore, we augment the training data with negative rationales, i.e. explanations that justify why certain answer choices are incorrect, to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between correct and misleading responses. This fosters more discriminative and robust learning. Experiments across diverse domains show that STL consistently outperforms baselines trained directly only on answers or self-generated reasoning, while qualitative analysis confirms the high quality of its rationales.

We pose a fundamental question: Does audio-video joint denoising training improve video generation, even when we only care about video quality? To study this, we introduce a parameter-efficient Audio-Video Full DiT (AVFullDiT) architecture that leverages pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) and text-to-audio (T2A) modules for joint denoising. We train (i) a T2AV model with AVFullDiT and (ii) a T2V-only counterpart under identical settings. Our results provide the first systematic evidence that audio-video joint denoising can deliver more than synchrony. We observe consistent improvements on challenging subsets featuring large and object contact motions. We hypothesize that predicting audio acts as a privileged signal, encouraging the model to internalize causal relationships between visual events and their acoustic consequences (e.g., collision $\\times$ impact sound), which in turn regularizes video dynamics.

However, when deployed in real life, agents often face sequential tasks, where each new sub-task follows the completion of the previous one, and certain sub-tasks may be infeasible, such as searching for a non-existent object. Compared with the single-task setting, the core challenge lies in reusing spatial knowledge accumulated from previous explorations to support subsequent reasoning and exploration. In this work, we investigate this underexplored yet practically significant embodied AI challenge. To evaluate this challenge, we introduce SEER-Bench, a new Sequential Embodied Exploration and Reasoning Benchmark encompassing encompassing two classic embodied tasks: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) and Embodied Multi-modal Navigation (EMN). Building on SEER-Bench, we propose 3DSPMR, a 3D SPatial Memory Reasoning approach that exploits relational, visual, and geometric cues from explored regions to augment Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for reasoning and exploration in sequential embodied tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly incorporate geometric information into MLLM-based spatial understanding and reasoning.

Among various approaches, distribution matching (DM)-based methods have attracted attention for their high efficiency. However, they often overlook the evolution of feature representations during training, which limits the expressiveness of synthetic data and weakens downstream performance. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory Guided Dataset Distillation (TGDD), which reformulates distribution matching as a dynamic alignment process along the model's training trajectory. At each training stage, TGDD captures evolving semantics by aligning the feature distribution between the synthetic and original dataset. Meanwhile, it introduces a distribution constraint regularization to reduce class overlap. This design helps synthetic data preserve both semantic diversity and representativeness, improving performance in downstream tasks. Without additional optimization overhead, TGDD achieves a favorable balance between performance and efficiency.

Recent multi-agent frameworks simulate Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) debates to mitigate single-model bias, but open-ended discussions amplify textual noise and computational cost while failing to anchor reasoning to visual evidence, the cornerstone of medical decision-making. We propose UCAgents, a hierarchical multi-agent framework enforcing unidirectional convergence through structured evidence auditing. Inspired by clinical workflows, UCAgents forbids position changes and limits agent interactions to targeted evidence verification, suppressing rhetorical drift while amplifying visual signal extraction. In UCAgents, a one-round inquiry discussion is introduced to uncover potential risks of visual-textual misalignment. This design jointly constrains visual ambiguity and textual noise, a dual-noise bottleneck that we formalize via information theory. Extensive experiments on four medical VQA benchmarks show UCAgents achieves superior accuracy (71.3% on PathVQA, +6.0% over state-of-the-art) with 87.7% lower token cost, the evaluation results further confirm that UCAgents strikes a balance between uncovering more visual evidence and avoiding confusing textual interference.

However, existing methods typically adopt standard decoders from language modeling, which rely on a causal attention mask. This design introduces two fundamental conflicts in 3D scene understanding: sequential bias among order-agnostic 3D objects and restricted object-instruction attention, hindering task-specific reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Spatial Language Instruction Mask (3D-SLIM), an effective masking strategy that replaces the causal mask with an adaptive attention mask tailored to the spatial structure of 3D scenes. Our 3D-SLIM introduces two key components: a Geometry-adaptive Mask that constrains attention based on spatial density rather than token order, and an Instruction-aware Mask that enables object tokens to directly access instruction context. This design allows the model to process objects based on their spatial relationships while being guided by the user's task. 3D-SLIM is simple, requires no architectural modifications, and adds no extra parameters, yet it yields substantial performance improvements across diverse 3D scene-language tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLM baselines validate its effectiveness and underscore the critical role of decoder design in 3D multi-modal reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "3D-SLIM\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7a7a\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a9\u7801\u89e3\u51b33D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u67b6\u6784\u5373\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u4f7f\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a9\u7801\u5bfc\u81f4\u987a\u5e8f\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61-\u6307\u4ee4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e863D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa3D-SLIM\uff0c\u5305\u542bGeometry-adaptive Mask\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff09\u548cInstruction-aware Mask\uff08\u5141\u8bb8\u5bf9\u8c61\u4ee4\u724c\u76f4\u63a5\u8bbf\u95ee\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548cLLM\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e863D-SLIM\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "3D-SLIM\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u573a\u666f-\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u53c2\u6570\u6216\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\u3002"}}

We present YingVideo-MV, the first cascaded framework for music-driven long-video generation. Our approach integrates audio semantic analysis, an interpretable shot planning module (MV-Director), temporal-aware diffusion Transformer architectures, and long-sequence consistency modeling to enable automatic synthesis of high-quality music performance videos from audio signals. We construct a large-scale Music-in-the-Wild Dataset by collecting web data to support the achievement of diverse, high-quality results. Observing that existing long-video generation methods lack explicit camera motion control, we introduce a camera adapter module that embeds camera poses into latent noise. To enhance continulity between clips during long-sequence inference, we further propose a time-aware dynamic window range strategy that adaptively adjust denoising ranges based on audio embedding.

We present MedSeg-TTA, a comprehensive benchmark that examines twenty representative adaptation methods across seven imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, ultrasound, pathology, dermoscopy, OCT, and chest X-ray, under fully unified data preprocessing, backbone configuration, and test time protocols. The benchmark encompasses four significant adaptation paradigms: Input-level Transformation, Feature-level Alignment, Output-level Regularization, and Prior Estimation, enabling the first systematic cross-modality comparison of their reliability and applicability. The results show that no single paradigm performs best in all conditions. Input-level methods are more stable under mild appearance shifts. Feature-level and Output-level methods offer greater advantages in boundary-related metrics, whereas prior-based methods exhibit strong modality dependence. Several methods degrade significantly under large inter-center and inter-device shifts, which highlights the importance of principled method selection for clinical deployment.

This process,which encompasses layout detection, text recognition, and relational understanding, is particularly crucial for empowering next-generation Vision-Language Models. Current methods, however, rely on fragmented, multi-stage pipelines that suffer from error propagation and fail to leverage the synergies of joint training. In this paper, we introduce dots.ocr, a single Vision-Language Model that, for the first time, demonstrates the advantages of jointly learning three core tasks within a unified, end-to-end framework. This is made possible by a highly scalable data engine that synthesizes a vast multilingual corpus, empowering the model to deliver robust performance across a wide array of tasks, encompassing diverse languages, layouts, and domains.

This dissertation aims to investigate the core challenges of zero-shot AC/AS and presents principled solutions rooted in theory and algorithmic design.\n  We first formalize the problem of consistent anomalies, a failure mode in which recurring similar anomalies systematically bias distance-based methods. By analyzing the statistical and geometric behavior of patch representations from pre-trained Vision Transformers, we identify two key phenomena - similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout - that describe how relationships among normal patches change with and without consistent anomalies in settings characterized by highly similar objects.\n  We then introduce CoDeGraph, a graph-based framework for filtering consistent anomalies built on the similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout phenomena. Through multi-stage graph construction, community detection, and structured refinement, CoDeGraph effectively suppresses the influence of consistent anomalies.\n  Next, we extend this framework to 3D medical imaging by proposing a training-free, computationally efficient volumetric tokenization strategy for MRI data. This enables a genuinely zero-shot 3D anomaly detection pipeline and shows that volumetric anomaly segmentation is achievable without any 3D training samples.\n  Finally, we bridge batch-based and text-based zero-shot methods by demonstrating that CoDeGraph-derived pseudo-masks can supervise prompt-driven vision-language models.

Existing sparse-attention variants offer partial speedups, yet lack a systematic analysis of how global attention contributes to multi-view reasoning. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth investigation of the global attention modules in VGGT and $\u03c0^3$ to better understand their roles. Our analysis reveals a clear division of roles in the alternating global-frame architecture: early global layers do not form meaningful correspondences, middle layers perform cross-view alignment, and last layers provide only minor refinements. Guided by these findings, we propose a training-free two-step acceleration scheme: (1) converting early global layers into frame attention, and (2) subsampling global attention by subsampling K/V over patch tokens with diagonal preservation and a mean-fill component. We instantiate this strategy on VGGT and $\u03c0^3$ and evaluate across standard pose and point-map benchmarks.

To address this, We introduce OmniPerson, the first unified identity-preserving pedestrian generation pipeline for visible/infrared image/video ReID tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1) We proposed OmniPerson, a unified generation model, offering holistic and fine-grained control over all key pedestrian attributes. Supporting RGB/IR modality image/video generation with any number of reference images, two kinds of person poses, and text. Also including RGB-to-IR transfer and image super-resolution abilities.2) We designed Multi-Refer Fuser for robust identity preservation with any number of reference images as input, making OmniPerson could distill a unified identity from a set of multi-view reference images, ensuring our generated pedestrians achieve high-fidelity pedestrian generation.3) We introduce PersonSyn, the first large-scale dataset for multi-reference, controllable pedestrian generation, and present its automated curation pipeline which transforms public, ID-only ReID benchmarks into a richly annotated resource with the dense, multi-modal supervision required for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniPerson achieves SoTA in pedestrian generation, excelling in both visual fidelity and identity consistency.

A popular approach to achieve robust representations is to use web-scale scientific data. However, current biomedical vision-language pretraining typically compresses rich scientific figures and text into coarse figure-level pairs, discarding the fine-grained correspondences that clinicians actually rely on when zooming into local structures. To tackle this issue, we introduce Panel2Patch, a novel data pipeline that mines hierarchical structure from existing biomedical scientific literature, i.e., multi-panel, marker-heavy figures and their surrounding text, and converts them into multi-granular supervision. Given scientific figures and captions, Panel2Patch parses layouts, panels, and visual markers, then constructs hierarchical aligned vision-language pairs at the figure, panel, and patch levels, preserving local semantics instead of treating each figure as a single data sample. Built on this hierarchical corpus, we develop a granularity-aware pretraining strategy that unifies heterogeneous objectives from coarse didactic descriptions to fine region-focused phrases.

Recent approaches have leveraged motion graphs to harness the potential of existing video data. To retrieve an appropriate trajectory from the graph, previous methods either utilize the distance between features extracted from the input audio and those associated with the motions in the graph or embed both the input audio and motion into a shared feature space. However, these techniques may not be optimal due to the many-to-many mapping nature between audio and gestures, which cannot be adequately addressed by one-to-one mapping. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel framework that initially employs a diffusion model to generate gesture motions. The diffusion model implicitly learns the joint distribution of audio and motion, enabling the generation of contextually appropriate gestures from input audio sequences. Furthermore, our method extracts both low-level and high-level features from the input audio to enrich the training process of the diffusion model. Subsequently, a meticulously designed motion-based retrieval algorithm is applied to identify the most suitable path within the graph by assessing both global and local similarities in motion. Given that not all nodes in the retrieved path are sequentially continuous, the final step involves seamlessly stitching together these segments to produce a coherent video output. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of our proposed method, demonstrating a significant improvement over prior approaches in terms of synchronization accuracy and naturalness of generated gestures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u624b\u52bf\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u624b\u52bf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u6620\u5c04\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5904\u7406\u591a\u5bf9\u591a\u6620\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u624b\u52bf\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u56fe\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7247\u6bb5\u65e0\u7f1d\u62fc\u63a5\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u8f93\u5165\u97f3\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4f4e\u5c42\u548c\u9ad8\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5408\u9002\u7684\u624b\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u540c\u6b65\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u624b\u52bf\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To evaluate these video generation models, existing benchmarks primarily focus on factors related to visual perception and understanding, like visual aesthetics, instruction adherence, and temporal coherence. However, the rule-based reasoning capabilities of video generation models remain largely unexplored. Although recent studies have carried out preliminary explorations into whether video models can serve as zero-shot learners, they still lack a fine-grained decomposition of reasoning capabilities and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. To address this gap, we introduce RULER-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of video generation models from the perspective of cognitive rules. Built upon two fundamental paradigms: text-to-video and image-to-video, RULER-Bench covers 40 representative tasks spanning six rule categories with 622 high-quality annotated instances. For the evaluation of each generated video, we construct a checklist covering four metrics and leverage GPT-o3 to assign scores to each question, achieving 85% alignment with human judgements. Extensive experiments show that the state-of-the-art model achieves only 48.87% on the rule coherence metric, highlighting significant room for improvement in the reasoning capability of next-level video models.

Project page: https://tkhkaeio.github.io/projects/25-dfmamba/index.html", "summary": "Modeling daily hand interactions often struggles with severe occlusions, such as when two hands overlap, which highlights the need for robust feature learning in 3D hand pose estimation (HPE). To handle such occluded hand images, it is vital to effectively learn the relationship between local image features (e.g., for occluded joints) and global context (e.g., cues from inter-joints, inter-hands, or the scene). However, most current 3D HPE methods still rely on ResNet for feature extraction, and such CNN's inductive bias may not be optimal for 3D HPE due to its limited capability to model the global context. To address this limitation, we propose an effective and efficient framework for visual feature extraction in 3D HPE using recent state space modeling (i.e., Mamba), dubbed Deformable Mamba (DF-Mamba). DF-Mamba is designed to capture global context cues beyond standard convolution through Mamba's selective state modeling and the proposed deformable state scanning. Specifically, for local features after convolution, our deformable scanning aggregates these features within an image while selectively preserving useful cues that represent the global context. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of structured 3D HPE, with comparable inference speed to ResNet-50.

To bridge this gap, we introduce PPTBench, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs on PowerPoint-related tasks. Leveraging a diverse source of 958 PPTX files, PPTBench evaluates models across four categories with 4,439 samples, including Detection, Understanding, Modification, and Generation. Our experiments reveal a substantial gap between semantic understanding and visual-layout reasoning in current MLLMs: models can interpret slide content but fail to produce coherent spatial arrangements. Ablation and further analysis show that current MLLMs struggle to combine visual cues with JSON-based layout structures and fail to integrate visual information into their API planning ability. And case studies visually expose systematic layout errors such as misalignment and element overlap. These findings provides a new perspective on evaluating VLLMs in PPT scenarios, highlighting challenges and directions for future research on visual-structural reasoning and coherent slide generation.

To address this challenge, we explore the potential of foundation models by proposing a novel pretraining strategy that leverages large-scale simulated datasets to learn robust spatial-spectral priors. Specifically, our approach first constructs diverse simulated datasets by applying various degradation operations (blur, noise, downsampling) and augmentations (bands generation, channel shuffling, high-pass filtering, color jittering, etc.) to natural images from ImageNet and remote sensing images from SkyScript. We then pretrain fusion models on these simulated data to learn generalizable spatial-spectral representations. The pretrained models are subsequently evaluated on six datasets (WorldView-2/3/4, IKONOS, QuickBird, GaoFen-2) using zero-shot and one-shot paradigms, with both full- and freeze-tuning approaches for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on different network architectures including convolutional neural networks, Transformer, and Mamba demonstrate that our pretraining strategy significantly improves generalization performance across different satellite sensors and imaging conditions for various fusion models. The pretrained models achieve superior results in zero-shot scenarios and show remarkable adaptation capability with minimal real data in one-shot settings.

It contains over 440,000 facial trajectories in total, among which more than 52,000 are longer than 10 frames, including 68 manually reviewed trajectories that span the entire 150 frames. To the best of our knowledge, PoreTrack3D is the first benchmark dataset to capture both traditional facial landmarks and pore-scale keypoints trajectory, advancing the study of fine-grained facial expressions through the analysis of subtle skin-surface motion.

Adversarial training is the leading defense designed to improve model robustness. However, its effect on the transferability of attacks is underexplored. In this work, we ask whether adversarial training unintentionally increases the transferability of adversarial examples. To answer this, we trained a diverse zoo of 36 models, including CNNs and ViTs, and conducted comprehensive transferability experiments. Our results reveal a clear paradox: adversarially trained (AT) models produce perturbations that transfer more effectively than those from standard models, which introduce a new ecosystem risk. To enable reproducibility and further study, we release all models, code, and experimental scripts. Furthermore, we argue that robustness evaluations should assess not only the resistance of a model to transferred attacks but also its propensity to produce transferable adversarial examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u867d\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5374\u610f\u5916\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e8636\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ecCNN\u548cViT\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u660e\u663e\u7684\u6096\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08AT\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8981\u8003\u8651\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8fc1\u79fb\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u62b5\u6297\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd8\u5e94\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u7684\u503e\u5411\u3002"}}

Text-conditioned Selective Video-to-Audio Generation", "comment": null, "summary": "This work introduces a new task, text-conditioned selective video-to-audio (V2A) generation, which produces only the user-intended sound from a multi-object video. This capability is especially crucial in multimedia production, where audio tracks are handled individually for each sound source for precise editing, mixing, and creative control. However, current approaches generate single source-mixed sounds at once, largely because visual features are entangled, and region cues or prompts often fail to specify the source. We propose SelVA, a novel text-conditioned V2A model that treats the text prompt as an explicit selector of target source and modulates video encoder to distinctly extract prompt-relevant video features. The proposed supplementary tokens promote cross-attention by suppressing text-irrelevant activations with efficient parameter tuning, yielding robust semantic and temporal grounding. SelVA further employs a self-augmentation scheme to overcome the lack of mono audio track supervision. We evaluate SelVA on VGG-MONOAUDIO, a curated benchmark of clean single-source videos for such a task. Extensive experiments and ablations consistently verify its effectiveness across audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization.

Yet existing solutions generally collapse these factors into simplified reasoning with latent embeddings, rendering the reasoning chain opaque and essentially intractable. We therefore adopt an explicit decomposition perspective and introduce ReVSeg, which executes reasoning as sequential decisions in the native interface of pretrained vision language models (VLMs). Rather than folding all reasoning into a single-step prediction, ReVSeg executes three explicit operations -- semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding -- aligning pretrained capabilities. We further employ reinforcement learning to optimize the multi-step reasoning chain, enabling the model to self-refine its decision quality from outcome-driven signals. Experimental results demonstrate that ReVSeg attains state-of-the-art performances on standard video object segmentation benchmarks and yields interpretable reasoning trajectories.

We address these limitations by proposing PolarGuide-GSDR, a polarization-forward-guided paradigm establishing a bidirectional coupling mechanism between polarization and 3DGS: first 3DGS's geometric priors are leveraged to resolve polarization ambiguity, and then the refined polarization information cues are used to guide 3DGS's normal and spherical harmonic representation. This process achieves high-fidelity reflection separation and full-scene reconstruction without requiring environment maps or restrictive material assumptions. We demonstrate on public and self-collected datasets that PolarGuide-GSDR achieves state-of-the-art performance in specular reconstruction, normal estimation, and novel view synthesis, all while maintaining real-time rendering capabilities.

To address this issue, we develop a lightweight diffusion method, PGP-DiffSR, by removing redundant information from diffusion models under the guidance of the phase information of inputs for efficient image super-resolution. We first identify the intra-block redundancy within the diffusion backbone and propose a progressive pruning approach that removes redundant blocks while reserving restoration capability. We note that the phase information of the restored images produced by the pruned diffusion model is not well estimated. To solve this problem, we propose a phase-exchange adapter module that explores the phase information of the inputs to guide the pruned diffusion model for better restoration performance. We formulate the progressive pruning approach and the phase-exchange adapter module into a unified model.

Recent study address this issue by dividing the image into smaller crops and computing the semantic similarity between each crop and a query using a pretrained retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model. The most relevant crops are then selected to localize the target object and suppress irrelevant information. However, such crop-based processing can fragment complete objects across multiple crops, thereby disrupting the computation of semantic similarity. In our experiments, we find that image crops of objects with different sizes are better handled at different resolutions. Based on this observation, we propose Multi-resolution Retrieval-Detection (MRD), a training-free framework for high-resolution image understanding. To address the issue of semantic similarity bias caused by objects being split across different image crops, we propose a multi-resolution semantic fusion method, which integrates semantic similarity maps obtained at different resolutions to produce more accurate semantic information and preserve the integrity of target objects. Furthermore, to achieve direct localization of target objects at a global scale, we introduce an open-vocalbulary object detection (OVD) model that identifies object regions using a sliding-window approach.Experiments on high-resolution image understanding benchmarks using different MLLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "MRD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8bed\u4e49\u878d\u5408\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u88c1\u526a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u8c61\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMulti-resolution Retrieval-Detection (MRD)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8bed\u4e49\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540cMLLMs\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMRD\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MRD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8bed\u4e49\u878d\u5408\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540cMLLMs\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches typically process foreground and background regions indiscriminately, often resulting in background interference and suboptimal instance discovery performance on real-world data. To address this limitation, we propose Foreground-Aware Slot Attention (FASA), a two-stage framework that explicitly separates foreground from background to enable precise object discovery. In the first stage, FASA performs a coarse scene decomposition to distinguish foreground from background regions through a dual-slot competition mechanism. These slots are initialized via a clustering-based strategy, yielding well-structured representations of salient regions. In the second stage, we introduce a masked slot attention mechanism where the first slot captures the background while the remaining slots compete to represent individual foreground objects. To further address over-segmentation of foreground objects, we incorporate pseudo-mask guidance derived from a patch affinity graph constructed with self-supervised image features to guide the learning of foreground slots. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FASA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of explicit foreground modeling and pseudo-mask guidance for robust scene decomposition and object-coherent representation.

In particular, ALDI++ with a Vision Transformer for Detection (ViTDet) backbone achieves the highest mean average precision (mAP), confirming the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures for cross-domain object detection. Additionally, our category-wise analysis highlights consistent improvements in detection accuracy, reinforcing the robustness of the model across diverse object classes.

To address these challenges, we propose GeoBridge, a foundation model that performs bidirectional matching across views and supports language-to-image retrieval. Going beyond traditional satellite-centric formulations, GeoBridge builds on a novel semantic-anchor mechanism that bridges multi-view features through textual descriptions for robust, flexible localization. In support of this task, we construct GeoLoc, the first large-scale, cross-modal, and multi-view aligned dataset comprising over 50,000 pairs of drone, street-view panorama, and satellite images as well as their textual descriptions, collected from 36 countries, ensuring both geographic and semantic alignment. We performed broad evaluations across multiple tasks.

Many pruning methods rely solely on token importance and thus overlook inter-token redundancy, retaining numerous duplicated tokens and wasting capacity. Although some redundancy-aware approaches have been proposed, they often ignore the spatial relationships among visual tokens. This can lead to overly sparse selections of retained tokens that fail to adequately cover the regions of target objects. To address these limitations, we propose VLM-Pruner, a training-free token pruning algorithm that explicitly balances redundancy and spatial sparsity. We introduce a centrifugal token pruning paradigm that enables near-to-far selection while prioritizing the preservation of fine-grained object details. Moreover, we design a Buffering for Spatial Sparsity (BSS) criterion that defers the selection of spatially distant tokens. We further adopt a parallel greedy strategy to conduct token selection efficiently. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we selectively fuse salient information from the discarded tokens into the retained ones.

To support this task, we present the BiAudio dataset, comprising approximately 97K video-binaural audio pairs spanning diverse real-world scenes and camera rotation trajectories, constructed through a semi-automated pipeline.

Robust and accurate inter-subject image registration of these whole-body MR images would enable their body-wide spatial standardization, and region-/voxel-wise correlation analysis of non-imaging data with image-derived parameters (e.g., tissue volume or fat content). We propose a sex-stratified inter-subject whole-body MR image registration approach that uses subcutaneous adipose tissue- and muscle-masks from the state-of-the-art VIBESegmentator method to augment intensity-based graph-cut registration. The proposed method was evaluated on a subset of 4000 subjects by comparing it to an intensity-only method as well as two previously published registration methods, uniGradICON and MIRTK. The evaluation comprised overlap measures applied to the 71 VIBESegmentator masks: 1) Dice scores, and 2) voxel-wise label error frequency. Additionally, voxel-wise correlation between age and each of fat content and tissue volume was studied to exemplify the usefulness for medical research. The proposed method exhibited a mean dice score of 0.77 / 0.75 across the cohort and the 71 masks for males/females, respectively. When compared to the intensity-only registration, the mean values were 6 percentage points (pp) higher for both sexes, and the label error frequency was decreased in most tissue regions. These differences were 9pp / 8pp against uniGradICON and 12pp / 13pp against MIRTK. Using the proposed method, the age-correlation maps were less noisy and showed higher anatomical alignment.

However, transferring such capabilities to remote sensing imagery remains challenging, as targets are often extremely small within kilometer-scale scenes, and queries typically involve intricate geospatial relations such as relative positions, spatial hierarchies, or contextual dependencies across distant objects. To address these challenges, we propose GeoViS, a Geospatially Rewarded Visual Search framework that reformulates remote sensing visual grounding as a progressive search-and-reasoning process. Rather than directly predicting the target location in a single step, GeoViS actively explores the global image through a tree-structured sequence of visual cues, integrating multimodal perception, spatial reasoning, and reward-guided exploration to refine geospatial hypotheses iteratively. This design enables the model to detect subtle small-scale targets while maintaining holistic scene awareness.

This is achieved through a dedicated augmentation strategy that simulates the visual domain shift between satellite and real-world UAV views. We introduce CAEVL, an efficient model designed to exploit this paradigm, and validate it on ViLD, a new and challenging dataset of real-world UAV images that we release to the community.

Accurate detection of methane emissions is the key to taking timely action and minimizing their impact on climate change. We present AttMetNet, a novel attention-enhanced deep learning framework for methane plume detection with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The major challenge in developing a methane detection model is to accurately identify methane plumes from Sentinel-2's B11 and B12 bands while suppressing false positives caused by background variability and diverse land cover types. Traditional detection methods typically depend on the differences or ratios between these bands when comparing the scenes with and without plumes. However, these methods often require verification by a domain expert because they generate numerous false positives. Recent deep learning methods make some improvements using CNN-based architectures, but lack mechanisms to prioritize methane-specific features. AttMetNet introduces a methane-aware architecture that fuses the Normalized Difference Methane Index (NDMI) with an attention-enhanced U-Net. By jointly exploiting NDMI's plume-sensitive cues and attention-driven feature selection, AttMetNet selectively amplifies methane absorption features while suppressing background noise. This integration establishes a first-of-its-kind architecture tailored for robust methane plume detection in real satellite imagery. Additionally, we employ focal loss to address the severe class imbalance arising from both limited positive plume samples and sparse plume pixels within imagery. Furthermore, AttMetNet is trained on the real methane plume dataset, making it more robust to practical scenarios.

The surgical smoke can be classified into different types based on its motion patterns, leading to distinctive spatio-temporal characteristics across smoky laparoscopic videos. However, existing desmoking methods fail to account for such smoke-type-specific distinctions. Therefore, we propose the first Smoke-Type-Aware Laparoscopic Video Desmoking Network (STANet) by introducing two smoke types: Diffusion Smoke and Ambient Smoke. Specifically, a smoke mask segmentation sub-network is designed to jointly conduct smoke mask and smoke type predictions based on the attention-weighted mask aggregation, while a smokeless video reconstruction sub-network is proposed to perform specially desmoking on smoky features guided by two types of smoke mask. To address the entanglement challenges of two smoke types, we further embed a coarse-to-fine disentanglement module into the mask segmentation sub-network, which yields more accurate disentangled masks through the smoke-type-aware cross attention between non-entangled and entangled regions. In addition, we also construct the first large-scale synthetic video desmoking dataset with smoke type annotations.

Existing data construction methods face a scale-quality trade-off: human annotations are high-quality but not scalable, while automated pipelines suffer from error propagation and noise. To address this, we introduce a lightweight data pipeline that replaces multi-toolchains with an end-to-end model and a unified post-verification stage. For scalable quality control, we train a 7B dual-task expert model, \\textbf{Qwen-Verify}, for efficient failure detection and instruction recaptioning. This pipeline yields \\textbf{UnicEdit-10M}, a 10M-scale dataset spanning diverse basic and complex editing tasks.

The core of this task lies in understanding the multi-modal composed query and achieving accurate composed feature learning. Within multi-modal queries, the video modality typically carries richer semantic content compared to the textual modality. However, previous works have largely overlooked the disparity in information density between these two modalities. This limitation can lead to two critical issues: 1) modification subject referring ambiguity and 2) limited detailed semantic focus, both of which degrade the performance of CVR models. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel CVR framework, namely the Hierarchical Uncertainty-aware Disambiguation network (HUD). HUD is the first framework that leverages the disparity in information density between video and text to enhance multi-modal query understanding. It comprises three key components: (a) Holistic Pronoun Disambiguation, (b) Atomistic Uncertainty Modeling, and (c) Holistic-to-Atomistic Alignment. By exploiting overlapping semantics through holistic cross-modal interaction and fine-grained semantic alignment via atomistic-level cross-modal interaction, HUD enables effective object disambiguation and enhances the focus on detailed semantics, thereby achieving precise composed feature learning. Moreover, our proposed HUD is also applicable to the Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) task and achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets for both CVR and CIR tasks.

While conventional methods rely on extracting and aggregating temporal information from videos, as humans we can often predict upcoming actions by observing a single moment from a scene, when given sufficient context. Can a model achieve this competence? The short answer is yes, although its effectiveness depends on the complexity of the task. In this work, we investigate to what extent video aggregation can be replaced with alternative modalities. To this end, based on recent advances in visual feature extraction and language-based reasoning, we introduce AAG, a method for Action Anticipation at a Glimpse. AAG combines RGB features with depth cues from a single frame for enhanced spatial reasoning, and incorporates prior action information to provide long-term context. This context is obtained either through textual summaries from Vision-Language Models, or from predictions generated by a single-frame action recognizer.

A Cross-Generator Study", "comment": null, "summary": "Modern image editors can produce identity-preserving AIGC (IP-AIGC), where the same person appears with new attire, background, or lighting. The robustness and fairness of current detectors in this regime remain unclear, especially for under-represented populations. We present what we believe is the first systematic study of IP-AIGC detection for Indian and South-Asian faces, quantifying cross-generator generalization and intra-population performance. We assemble Indian-focused training splits from FairFD and HAV-DF, and construct two held-out IP-AIGC test sets (HIDF-img-ip-genai and HIDF-vid-ip-genai) using commercial web-UI generators (Gemini and ChatGPT) with identity-preserving prompts. We evaluate two state-of-the-art detectors (AIDE and Effort) under pretrained (PT) and fine-tuned (FT) regimes and report AUC, AP, EER, and accuracy. Fine-tuning yields strong in-domain gains (for example, Effort AUC 0.739 to 0.944 on HAV-DF-test; AIDE EER 0.484 to 0.259), but consistently degrades performance on held-out IP-AIGC for Indian cohorts (for example, AIDE AUC 0.923 to 0.563 on HIDF-img-ip-genai; Effort 0.740 to 0.533), which indicates overfitting to training-generator cues. On non-IP HIDF images, PT performance remains high, which suggests a specific brittleness to identity-preserving edits rather than a generic distribution shift. Our study establishes IP-AIGC-Indian as a challenging and practically relevant scenario and motivates representation-preserving adaptation and India-aware benchmark curation to close generalization gaps in AIGC detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0IP-AIGC\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u9762\u5b54\u4e0a\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u7559\u7684AIGC\uff08IP-AIGC\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u6b64\u7c7b\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9 underrepresented \u4eba\u7fa4\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5370\u5ea6\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08FairFD\u548cHAV-DF\uff09\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u4fdd\u7559\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\uff08HIDF-img-ip-genai\u548cHIDF-vid-ip-genai\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff08AIDE\u548cEffort\uff09\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u57df\u5185\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff08\u5982Effort AUC\u4ece0.739\u5347\u81f30.944\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff08\u5982AIDE AUC\u4ece0.923\u964d\u81f30.563\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cIP-AIGC\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u548c\u5357\u4e9a\u9762\u5b54\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u7559\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u672a\u6765\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4fdd\u7559\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5370\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce an online RL post-training framework that optimizes a pretrained video generator for precise camera control. To make RL effective in this setting, we design a verifiable geometry reward that delivers dense segment-level feedback to guide model optimization. Specifically, we estimate the 3D camera trajectories for both generated and reference videos, divide each trajectory into short segments, and compute segment-wise relative poses. The reward function then compares each generated-reference segment pair and assigns an alignment score as the reward signal, which helps alleviate reward sparsity and improve optimization efficiency. Moreover, we construct a comprehensive dataset featuring diverse large-amplitude camera motions and scenes with varied subject dynamics.

Focusing on data construction, supervised fine-tuning strategies, and multimodal reinforcement learning methods, this work proposes three key innovations: (1) An information density-based data generation scheme, integrated with a dual-dimensional tree-structured label system, enabling automated generation of high-quality cross-domain data. (2) A collaborative curriculum supervised fine-tuning approach that balances the injection of domain-specific knowledge with the preservation of general capabilities. (3) A hybrid reinforcement learning paradigm that enhances reasoning ability while simultaneously addressing multi-objective optimization such as diversity exploration, maintenance of multimodal perception, and response conciseness. Moreover, we implement a series of infrastructure optimizations, such as 5D parallel training, operator optimization, and inference quantization to enhance training and inference efficiency while reducing the cost of domain adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate that the MindGPT-4ov model outperforms state-of-the-art models on benchmarks such as MMBench, MMStar, MathVision, and MathVista.

Previous efforts on fewer-step distillation attempt to skip redundant steps by training compact student models, yet they often suffer from heavy retraining costs and degraded generalization. In this work, we take a different perspective: we accelerate smartly, not evenly, applying smaller speedups to early semantic stages and larger ones to later redundant phases. We instantiate this phase-aware strategy with two experts that specialize in slow and fast denoising phases. Surprisingly, instead of investing massive effort in retraining student models, we find that simply equipping the base model with lightweight LoRA adapters achieves both efficient acceleration and strong generalization. We refer to these two adapters as Slow-LoRA and Fast-LoRA. Through extensive experiments, our method achieves up to 5 acceleration over the base model while maintaining comparable visual quality across diverse benchmarks.

Building on these insights, we propose DiverseAR, a principled and effective method that enhances image diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive logits distribution scaling mechanism that dynamically adjusts the sharpness of the binary output distribution during sampling, resulting in smoother predictions and greater diversity.

Existing methods often rely on auxiliary masks or reference images for editing guidance, which limits their scalability and generalization. To address these issues, we propose LoVoRA, a novel framework for mask-free video object removal and addition using object-aware localization mechanism. Our approach utilizes a unique dataset construction pipeline that integrates image-to-video translation, optical flow-based mask propagation, and video inpainting, enabling temporally consistent edits.

Existing solutions often rely on human intervention or underutilize the agent's ability to autonomously mitigate hallucination. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from how humans make reliable decisions in the real world. They begin with introspective reasoning to reduce uncertainty and form an initial judgment, then rely on external verification from diverse perspectives to reach a final decision. Motivated by this cognitive paradigm, we propose InEx, a training-free, multi-agent framework designed to autonomously mitigate hallucination. InEx introduces internal introspective reasoning, guided by entropy-based uncertainty estimation, to improve the reliability of the decision agent's reasoning process. The agent first generates a response, which is then iteratively verified and refined through external cross-modal multi-agent collaboration with the editing agent and self-reflection agents, further enhancing reliability and mitigating hallucination. Extensive experiments show that InEx consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving 4%-27% gains on general and hallucination benchmarks, and demonstrating strong robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "InEx\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u7701\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u81ea\u4e3b\u7f13\u89e3LLMs\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u6216\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u4e3b\u7f13\u89e3\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u8303\u5f0f\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u4e3b\u7f13\u89e3\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faInEx\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5185\u7701\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff09\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\uff08\u7f16\u8f91\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u81ea\u53cd\u601d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff09\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u901a\u7528\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cInEx\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u53474%-27%\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "InEx\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u7701\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86LLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We revisit this problem from a feedforward perspective and introduce \\textbf{Driving Gaussian Grounded Transformer (DGGT)}, a unified framework for pose-free dynamic scene reconstruction. We note that the existing formulations, treating camera pose as a required input, limit flexibility and scalability. Instead, we reformulate pose as an output of the model, enabling reconstruction directly from sparse, unposed images and supporting an arbitrary number of views for long sequences. Our approach jointly predicts per-frame 3D Gaussian maps and camera parameters, disentangles dynamics with a lightweight dynamic head, and preserves temporal consistency with a lifespan head that modulates visibility over time. A diffusion-based rendering refinement further reduces motion/interpolation artifacts and improves novel-view quality under sparse inputs.

We describe a class of stability adapters that can be inserted into virtually any architecture and a resource-efficient training process that can be performed with a frozen base network. We introduce a unified conceptual framework for describing temporal stability and corruption robustness, centered on a proposed accuracy-stability-robustness loss. By analyzing the theoretical properties of this loss, we identify the conditions where it produces well-behaved stabilizer training.

Despite recent progress, directly generating B-Reps end-to-end with precise geometry and watertight topology remains a challenge. This paper presents AutoBrep, a novel Transformer model that autoregressively generates B-Reps with high quality and validity. AutoBrep employs a unified tokenization scheme that encodes both geometric and topological characteristics of a B-Rep model as a sequence of discrete tokens. Geometric primitives (i.e., surfaces and curves) are encoded as latent geometry tokens, and their structural relationships are defined as special topological reference tokens. Sequence order in AutoBrep naturally follows a breadth first traversal of the B-Rep face adjacency graph. At inference time, neighboring faces and edges along with their topological structure are progressively generated. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our unified representation when coupled with next-token prediction for B-Rep generation. AutoBrep outperforms baselines with better quality and watertightness. It is also highly scalable to complex solids with good fidelity and inference speed. We further show that autocompleting B-Reps is natively supported through our unified tokenization, enabling user-controllable CAD generation with minimal changes.

Recent methods accelerate MRI by under-sampling $k$-space and reconstructing the resulting images using deep learning. Unrolled networks have been widely used for the reconstruction task due to their efficiency, but suffer from unstable evolving caused by freely-learnable parameters in intermediate steps. In contrast, diffusion models based on stochastic differential equations offer theoretical stability in both medical and natural image tasks but are computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce flow ODEs to MRI reconstruction by theoretically proving that unrolled networks are discrete implementations of conditional probability flow ODEs. This connection provides explicit formulations for parameters and clarifies how intermediate states should evolve. Building on this insight, we propose Flow-Aligned Training (FLAT), which derives unrolled parameters from the ODE discretization and aligns intermediate reconstructions with the ideal ODE trajectory to improve stability and convergence.

Existing approaches primarily focus on non-interactive systems and are limited to producing constrained and unnatural human speech.The primary challenge of this task lies in effectively integrating understanding and generation capabilities, as well as achieving seamless multimodal audio-video fusion. To solve these problems, we propose a Conductor-Creator architecture that divides the dialogue system into two primary components.The Conductor is tasked with understanding, reasoning, and generating instructions by breaking them down into motion and speech components, thereby enabling fine-grained control over interactions. The Creator then delivers interactive responses based on these instructions.Furthermore, to address the difficulty of generating long videos with consistent identity, timbre, and tone using dual DiT structures, the Creator adopts a structure that combines autoregressive (AR) and diffusion models. The AR model is responsible for audio generation, while the diffusion model ensures high-quality video generation.Additionally, we propose a novel fusion module to enhance connections between contextually consecutive clips and modalities, enabling synchronized long-duration audio-visual content generation.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can generate vivid and contextually coherent long-duration dialogue interactions and accurately interpret users' multimodal queries.", "AI": {"tldr": "MAViD\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Conductor-Creator\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u957f\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u975e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53d7\u9650\u4e14\u4e0d\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u97f3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u6574\u5408\u53ca\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Conductor-Creator\u67b6\u6784\uff0cConductor\u8d1f\u8d23\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6307\u4ee4\uff0cCreator\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u751f\u6210\u4ea4\u4e92\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8fde\u63a5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u751f\u52a8\u4e14\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5e76\u51c6\u786e\u89e3\u8bfb\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "conclusion": "MAViD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7Conductor-Creator\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u751f\u52a8\u4e14\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ea4\u4e92\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u89e3\u8bfb\u7528\u6237\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u67e5\u8be2\u3002"}}

To this end, we propose OneThinker, an all-in-one reasoning model that unifies image and video understanding across diverse fundamental visual tasks, including question answering, captioning, spatial and temporal grounding, tracking, and segmentation. To achieve this, we construct the OneThinker-600k training corpus covering all these tasks and employ commercial models for CoT annotation, resulting in OneThinker-SFT-340k for SFT cold start. Furthermore, we propose EMA-GRPO to handle reward heterogeneity in multi-task RL by tracking task-wise moving averages of reward standard deviations for balanced optimization. Extensive experiments on diverse visual benchmarks show that OneThinker delivers strong performance on 31 benchmarks, across 10 fundamental visual understanding tasks.

However, this correspondence signal remains incomplete, with its accuracy degrading under large viewpoint changes. Building on these findings, we introduce CAMEO, a simple yet effective training technique that directly supervises attention maps using geometric correspondence to enhance both the training efficiency and generation quality of multi-view diffusion models. Notably, supervising a single attention layer is sufficient to guide the model toward learning precise correspondences, thereby preserving the geometry and structure of reference images, accelerating convergence, and improving novel view synthesis performance.

Extensive experiments validate that this layered approach effectively resolves the user intention gap, granting creators direct, intuitive control over the generative process.", "AI": {"tldr": "MagicQuill V2\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u5806\u6808\uff08\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u989c\u8272\uff09\u548c\u4e13\u7528\u6280\u672f\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u3001\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u5f62\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5355\u4e00\u3001\u6574\u4f53\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5916\u89c2\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u610f\u56fe\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u521b\u610f\u610f\u56fe\u89e3\u6784\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u5806\u6808\uff1a\u5185\u5bb9\u5c42\uff08\u521b\u5efa\u5185\u5bb9\uff09\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c42\uff08\u653e\u7f6e\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff09\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5c42\uff08\u5f62\u72b6\uff09\u548c\u989c\u8272\u5c42\uff08\u8c03\u8272\u677f\uff09\u3002\u6280\u672f\u8d21\u732e\u5305\u62ec\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u5185\u5bb9\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u3001\u5904\u7406\u6240\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7528\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u5c40\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u652f\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "MagicQuill V2\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u7ec4\u5408\u8303\u5f0f\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u5f62\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a7\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u3001\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u751f\u6210\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}
