### [1] [Hierarchical Process Reward Models are Symbolic Vision Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03126)
*Shan Zhang,Aotian Chen,Kai Zou,Jindong Gu,Yuan Xue,Anton van den Hengel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出自监督符号自动编码器，通过分层奖励和稳定机制，显著提升符号视觉学习性能，在多个任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决符号计算机视觉中基于像素的视觉模型与符号视觉学习之间的差异，提出了一种能够解析图表为几何基元并保持其关系的自监督方法。

Method: 采用自监督符号自动编码器架构，结合符号分层过程奖励建模和稳定化机制，编码图表为结构化基元及其相互关系，并通过可执行引擎解码重建输入图表。

Result: 在几何图表重建中MSE减少了98.2%，在图表重建任务中超越GPT-4o 0.6%，在MathGlance感知基准上提升了13%，在MathVerse和GeoQA推理基准上提升了3%。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新型的自监督符号自动编码器，通过符号分层过程奖励建模和稳定化机制，有效提升了符号视觉学习的性能，并在多个任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Symbolic computer vision represents diagrams through explicit logical rules and structured representations, enabling interpretable understanding in machine vision. This requires fundamentally different learning paradigms from pixel-based visual models. Symbolic visual learners parse diagrams into geometric primitives-points, lines, and shapes-whereas pixel-based learners operate on textures and colors. We propose a novel self-supervised symbolic auto-encoder that encodes diagrams into structured primitives and their interrelationships within the latent space, and decodes them through our executable engine to reconstruct the input diagrams. Central to this architecture is Symbolic Hierarchical Process Reward Modeling, which applies hierarchical step-level parsing rewards to enforce point-on-line, line-on-shape, and shape-on-relation consistency. Since vanilla reinforcement learning exhibits poor exploration in the policy space during diagram reconstruction; we thus introduce stabilization mechanisms to balance exploration and exploitation. We fine-tune our symbolic encoder on downstream tasks, developing a neuro-symbolic system that integrates the reasoning capabilities of neural networks with the interpretability of symbolic models through reasoning-grounded visual rewards. Evaluations across reconstruction, perception, and reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: achieving a 98.2% reduction in MSE for geometric diagram reconstruction, surpassing GPT-4o by 0.6% with a 7B model on chart reconstruction, and improving by +13% on the MathGlance perception benchmark, and by +3% on MathVerse and GeoQA reasoning benchmarks.

### [2] [Drainage: A Unifying Framework for Addressing Class Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03182)
*Yasser Taha,Grégoire Montavon,Nils Körber*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出排水节点框架，有效处理噪声标签和异常样本，显著提升模型在高噪声环境下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习在噪声标签、类别模糊性以及异常样本处理方面的挑战，特别是在实例依赖和非对称标签噪声情况下。

Method: 通过在网络输出端添加排水节点，重新分配概率质量至不确定性，同时保持端到端训练和可微性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100等数据集上，高噪声环境下准确率提升高达9%，在真实数据集（如mini-WebVision、mini-ImageNet和Clothing-1M）上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的排水节点框架在噪声标签、类别模糊性以及异常样本处理方面表现出色，显著提升了模型在高噪声环境下的准确性，并在多个真实数据集上达到或超越了现有最先进方法。

Abstract: Modern deep learning faces significant challenges with noisy labels, class ambiguity, as well as the need to robustly reject out-of-distribution or corrupted samples. In this work, we propose a unified framework based on the concept of a "drainage node'' which we add at the output of the network. The node serves to reallocate probability mass toward uncertainty, while preserving desirable properties such as end-to-end training and differentiability. This mechanism provides a natural escape route for highly ambiguous, anomalous, or noisy samples, particularly relevant for instance-dependent and asymmetric label noise. In systematic experiments involving the addition of varying proportions of instance-dependent noise or asymmetric noise to CIFAR-10/100 labels, our drainage formulation achieves an accuracy increase of up to 9\% over existing approaches in the high-noise regime. Our results on real-world datasets, such as mini-WebVision, mini-ImageNet and Clothing-1M, match or surpass existing state-of-the-art methods. Qualitative analysis reveals a denoising effect, where the drainage neuron consistently absorbs corrupt, mislabeled, or outlier data, leading to more stable decision boundaries. Furthermore, our drainage formulation enables applications well beyond classification, with immediate benefits for web-scale, semi-supervised dataset cleaning, and open-set applications.

### [3] [Deep-BrownConrady: Prediction of Camera Calibration and Distortion Parameters Using Deep Learning and Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14510)
*Faiz Muhammad Chaudhry,Jarno Ralli,Jerome Leudet,Fahad Sohrab,Farhad Pakdaman,Pierre Corbani,Moncef Gabbouj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用深度学习从单张图像预测相机校准参数，结合合成与真实数据训练，解决了传统方法的多图像需求限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统校准方法需要多张校准对象图像，这在公开数据集中往往不可行。本研究旨在通过深度学习从单张图像预测校准参数，解决这一限制。

Method: 研究采用基于ResNet架构的深度学习网络，在合成数据集上进行训练，预测遵循Brown-Conrady镜头模型的相机校准参数。

Result: 模型能够准确预测相机和镜头参数，尤其在合成数据训练后对真实世界图像的校准任务表现良好。

Conclusion: 该研究成功展示了通过深度学习模型从单张图像预测相机和镜头参数的可行性，并开发了一个全面的合成数据集，为模型训练和测试提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: This research addresses the challenge of camera calibration and distortion parameter prediction from a single image using deep learning models. The main contributions of this work are: (1) demonstrating that a deep learning model, trained on a mix of real and synthetic images, can accurately predict camera and lens parameters from a single image, and (2) developing a comprehensive synthetic dataset using the AILiveSim simulation platform. This dataset includes variations in focal length and lens distortion parameters, providing a robust foundation for model training and testing. The training process predominantly relied on these synthetic images, complemented by a small subset of real images, to explore how well models trained on synthetic data can perform calibration tasks on real-world images. Traditional calibration methods require multiple images of a calibration object from various orientations, which is often not feasible due to the lack of such images in publicly available datasets. A deep learning network based on the ResNet architecture was trained on this synthetic dataset to predict camera calibration parameters following the Brown-Conrady lens model. The ResNet architecture, adapted for regression tasks, is capable of predicting continuous values essential for accurate camera calibration in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality.
  Keywords: Camera calibration, distortion, synthetic data, deep learning, residual networks (ResNet), AILiveSim, horizontal field-of-view, principal point, Brown-Conrady Model.

### [4] [Does Head Pose Correction Improve Biometric Facial Recognition?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03199)
*Justin Norman,Hany Farid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现选择性结合CFR-GAN和CodeFormer能提升面部识别准确率，而盲目使用恢复技术会适得其反。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究针对现实世界中图像质量差、非正面姿态和遮挡导致生物特征面部识别模型准确率显著下降的问题，探索AI驱动的头部姿态校正和图像恢复是否能提升识别准确率。

Method: 通过模型无关的大规模法证评估流程，评估了三种恢复方法（3D重建NextFace、2D正面化CFR-GAN和特征增强CodeFormer）对面部识别准确率的影响。

Result: 发现盲目应用这些技术会显著降低面部识别准确率，但选择性应用CFR-GAN与CodeFormer结合的方法能带来显著改进。

Conclusion: 选择性应用CFR-GAN与CodeFormer结合的方法能显著提升面部识别准确率，而盲目应用这些技术反而会降低识别效果。

Abstract: Biometric facial recognition models often demonstrate significant decreases in accuracy when processing real-world images, often characterized by poor quality, non-frontal subject poses, and subject occlusions. We investigate whether targeted, AI-driven, head-pose correction and image restoration can improve recognition accuracy. Using a model-agnostic, large-scale, forensic-evaluation pipeline, we assess the impact of three restoration approaches: 3D reconstruction (NextFace), 2D frontalization (CFR-GAN), and feature enhancement (CodeFormer). We find that naive application of these techniques substantially degrades facial recognition accuracy. However, we also find that selective application of CFR-GAN combined with CodeFormer yields meaningful improvements.

### [5] [LLM-Guided Material Inference for 3D Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03237)
*Nafiseh Izadyar,Teseo Schneider*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出两阶段LLM方法，从3D点云推断材质组成，无需任务特定训练，验证了语言模型在3D数据中的通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D形状数据集和模型仅关注几何，忽略了决定物体外观的材质属性。

Method: 采用两阶段大型语言模型（LLM）方法：第一阶段预测物体语义，第二阶段为每个几何段分配合理的材质。

Result: 在Fusion/ABS和ShapeNet的1,000个形状上，该方法实现了高语义和材质合理性。

Conclusion: 语言模型可以作为通用先验知识，在3D数据中桥接几何推理与材质理解。

Abstract: Most existing 3D shape datasets and models focus solely on geometry, overlooking the material properties that determine how objects appear. We introduce a two-stage large language model (LLM) based method for inferring material composition directly from 3D point clouds with coarse segmentations. Our key insight is to decouple reasoning about what an object is from what it is made of. In the first stage, an LLM predicts the object's semantic; in the second stage, it assigns plausible materials to each geometric segment, conditioned on the inferred semantics. Both stages operate in a zero-shot manner, without task-specific training. Because existing datasets lack reliable material annotations, we evaluate our method using an LLM-as-a-Judge implemented in DeepEval. Across 1,000 shapes from Fusion/ABS and ShapeNet, our method achieves high semantic and material plausibility. These results demonstrate that language models can serve as general-purpose priors for bridging geometric reasoning and material understanding in 3D data.

### [6] [Flux4D: Flow-based Unsupervised 4D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03210)
*Jingkang Wang,Henry Che,Yun Chen,Ze Yang,Lily Goli,Sivabalan Manivasagam,Raquel Urtasun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flux4D是一种无监督4D重建框架，通过直接预测3D高斯及其运动动态，高效重建大规模动态场景，无需标注或预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如NeRF和3DGS）在可扩展性和依赖标注方面存在局限，而自监督方法受限于逐场景优化和超参数敏感性。Flux4D旨在解决这些问题。

Method: Flux4D采用仅基于光度损失和‘尽可能静态’正则化的方法，直接从原始数据中分解动态元素，无需预训练监督模型或基础先验。

Result: 在户外驾驶数据集上的实验表明，Flux4D在可扩展性、泛化能力和重建质量上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Flux4D通过无监督方式直接预测3D高斯及其运动动态，实现了大规模动态场景的高效重建，显著提升了可扩展性、泛化能力和重建质量。

Abstract: Reconstructing large-scale dynamic scenes from visual observations is a fundamental challenge in computer vision, with critical implications for robotics and autonomous systems. While recent differentiable rendering methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved impressive photorealistic reconstruction, they suffer from scalability limitations and require annotations to decouple actor motion. Existing self-supervised methods attempt to eliminate explicit annotations by leveraging motion cues and geometric priors, yet they remain constrained by per-scene optimization and sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we introduce Flux4D, a simple and scalable framework for 4D reconstruction of large-scale dynamic scenes. Flux4D directly predicts 3D Gaussians and their motion dynamics to reconstruct sensor observations in a fully unsupervised manner. By adopting only photometric losses and enforcing an "as static as possible" regularization, Flux4D learns to decompose dynamic elements directly from raw data without requiring pre-trained supervised models or foundational priors simply by training across many scenes. Our approach enables efficient reconstruction of dynamic scenes within seconds, scales effectively to large datasets, and generalizes well to unseen environments, including rare and unknown objects. Experiments on outdoor driving datasets show Flux4D significantly outperforms existing methods in scalability, generalization, and reconstruction quality.

*Richard Füzesséry,Kaziwa Saleh,Sándor Szénási,Zoltán Vámossy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用GPT-4o和GPT-5的文本提示实现零样本对象计数，性能媲美现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）在无需监督的情况下完成计数任务的可能性，避免现有方法对大量标注数据和视觉示例的依赖。

Method: 利用GPT-4o和GPT-5的多模态能力，仅通过文本提示进行零样本对象计数。

Result: 在FSC-147和CARPK数据集上评估，模型表现与最先进的零样本方法相当或更优。

Conclusion: 研究发现，GPT-4o和GPT-5在FSC-147数据集上的表现与现有零样本方法相当，甚至在某些情况下超越它们。

Abstract: Zero-shot object counting attempts to estimate the number of object instances belonging to novel categories that the vision model performing the counting has never encountered during training. Existing methods typically require large amount of annotated data and often require visual exemplars to guide the counting process. However, large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools with remarkable reasoning and data understanding abilities, which suggest the possibility of utilizing them for counting tasks without any supervision. In this work we aim to leverage the visual capabilities of two multi-modal LLMs, GPT-4o and GPT-5, to perform object counting in a zero-shot manner using only textual prompts. We evaluate both models on the FSC-147 and CARPK datasets and provide a comparative analysis. Our findings show that the models achieve performance comparable to the state-of-the-art zero-shot approaches on FSC-147, in some cases, even surpass them.

*Liying Lu,Raphaël Achddou,Sabine Süsstrunk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种仅需单张噪声图像和暗帧的噪声合成方法，结合泊松分布和傅里叶域采样，实现高效低光去噪，性能领先。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低光条件下拍摄的原始图像由于光子计数低和传感器噪声而非常嘈杂。基于学习的去噪器可以重建高质量图像，但训练这些去噪器需要大量干净的噪声图像配对数据集，难以收集。噪声合成是大规模数据采集的替代方案。

Method: 提出了一种通用且实用的噪声合成方法，仅需每个ISO设置下的单个噪声图像和单个暗帧。该方法通过泊松分布表示信号相关噪声，并引入傅里叶域频谱采样算法来精确建模信号无关噪声。

Result: 该方法能够生成多样化的噪声实现，保持真实传感器噪声的空间和统计特性，且在多个低光去噪基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的噪声合成方法不仅准确且实用，还在多个低光去噪基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Raw images taken in low-light conditions are very noisy due to low photon count and sensor noise. Learning-based denoisers have the potential to reconstruct high-quality images. For training, however, these denoisers require large paired datasets of clean and noisy images, which are difficult to collect. Noise synthesis is an alternative to large-scale data acquisition: given a clean image, we can synthesize a realistic noisy counterpart. In this work, we propose a general and practical noise synthesis method that requires only one single noisy image and one single dark frame per ISO setting. We represent signal-dependent noise with a Poisson distribution and introduce a Fourier-domain spectral sampling algorithm to accurately model signal-independent noise. The latter generates diverse noise realizations that maintain the spatial and statistical properties of real sensor noise. As opposed to competing approaches, our method neither relies on simplified parametric models nor on large sets of clean-noisy image pairs. Our synthesis method is not only accurate and practical, it also leads to state-of-the-art performances on multiple low-light denoising benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 潜在扩散模型（LDMs）在图像修复和局部编辑方面取得了显著进展，但其固有的潜在压缩常导致像素级不一致，现有方法无法完全消除这些伪影。

Method: PixPerfect 结合了（i）可微分的判别性像素空间、（ii）全面的伪影模拟管道和（iii）直接的像素空间细化方案，以解决潜在扩散模型中的像素级不一致问题。

Result: 在修复、物体移除和插入基准测试中，PixPerfect 显著提升了感知保真度和编辑性能。

Conclusion: PixPerfect 通过像素级细化框架显著提升了局部图像编辑的感知保真度和下游编辑性能，为稳健且高保真的局部图像编辑设定了新标准。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) have markedly advanced the quality of image inpainting and local editing. However, the inherent latent compression often introduces pixel-level inconsistencies, such as chromatic shifts, texture mismatches, and visible seams along editing boundaries. Existing remedies, including background-conditioned latent decoding and pixel-space harmonization, usually fail to fully eliminate these artifacts in practice and do not generalize well across different latent representations or tasks. We introduce PixPerfect, a pixel-level refinement framework that delivers seamless, high-fidelity local edits across diverse LDM architectures and tasks. PixPerfect leverages (i) a differentiable discriminative pixel space that amplifies and suppresses subtle color and texture discrepancies, (ii) a comprehensive artifact simulation pipeline that exposes the refiner to realistic local editing artifacts during training, and (iii) a direct pixel-space refinement scheme that ensures broad applicability across diverse latent representations and tasks. Extensive experiments on inpainting, object removal, and insertion benchmarks demonstrate that PixPerfect substantially enhances perceptual fidelity and downstream editing performance, establishing a new standard for robust and high-fidelity localized image editing.

Result: 使用NASA的MASTER数据进行实验，结果表明两阶段管道在速度和准确性之间取得了良好的平衡。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段管道（PyroFocus）在速度和准确性之间取得了良好的平衡，展示了在未来野火监测任务中实时边缘部署的潜力。

Abstract: Rapid and accurate wildfire detection is crucial for emergency response and environmental management. In airborne and spaceborne missions, real-time algorithms must distinguish between no fire, active fire, and post-fire conditions, and estimate fire intensity. Multispectral and hyperspectral thermal imagers provide rich spectral information, but high data dimensionality and limited onboard resources make real-time processing challenging. As wildfires increase in frequency and severity, the need for low-latency and computationally efficient onboard detection methods is critical.
  We present a systematic evaluation of multiple deep learning architectures, including custom Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, for multi-class fire classification. We also introduce PyroFocus, a two-stage pipeline that performs fire classification followed by fire radiative power (FRP) regression or segmentation to reduce inference time and computational cost for onboard deployment. Using data from NASA's MODIS/ASTER Airborne Simulator (MASTER), which is similar to a next-generation fire detection sensor, we compare accuracy, inference latency, and resource efficiency.
  Experimental results show that the proposed two-stage pipeline achieves strong trade-offs between speed and accuracy, demonstrating significant potential for real-time edge deployment in future wildfire monitoring missions.

Conclusion: SpatialReasoner在H$^2$U3D数据集上实现了最先进的性能，通过粗到细的主动探索范式，显著减少了所需的图像数量。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large-scale 3D environments remains challenging for current vision-language models, which are typically constrained to room-scale scenarios. We introduce H$^2$U3D (Holistic House Understanding in 3D), a 3D visual question answering dataset designed for house-scale scene understanding. H$^2$U3D features multi-floor environments spanning up to three floors and 10-20 rooms, covering more than 300 m$^2$. Through an automated annotation pipeline, it constructs hierarchical coarse-to-fine visual representations and generates diverse question-answer pairs with chain-of-thought annotations. We further propose SpatialReasoner, an active perception framework that autonomously invokes spatial tools to explore 3D scenes based on textual queries. SpatialReasoner is trained through a two-stage strategy: a supervised cold start followed by reinforcement learning with an adaptive exploration reward that promotes efficient exploration while discouraging redundant operations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpatialReasoner achieves state-of-the-art performance on H$^2$U3D, outperforming strong baselines including GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Pro. Notably, our method attains superior results while using only 3-4 images in total on average, compared to baselines requiring 16+ images, highlighting the effectiveness of our coarse-to-fine active exploration paradigm.

Conclusion: NavMapFusion通过融合低精度的导航地图和高精度的传感器数据，生成了准确且实时的环境表示，为自动驾驶提供了更安全可靠的导航基础。

Abstract: Accurate environmental representations are essential for autonomous driving, providing the foundation for safe and efficient navigation. Traditionally, high-definition (HD) maps are providing this representation of the static road infrastructure to the autonomous system a priori. However, because the real world is constantly changing, such maps must be constructed online from on-board sensor data. Navigation-grade standard-definition (SD) maps are widely available, but their resolution is insufficient for direct deployment. Instead, they can be used as coarse prior to guide the online map construction process. We propose NavMapFusion, a diffusion-based framework that performs iterative denoising conditioned on high-fidelity sensor data and on low-fidelity navigation maps. This paper strives to answer: (1) How can coarse, potentially outdated navigation maps guide online map construction? (2) What advantages do diffusion models offer for map fusion? We demonstrate that diffusion-based map construction provides a robust framework for map fusion. Our key insight is that discrepancies between the prior map and online perception naturally correspond to noise within the diffusion process; consistent regions reinforce the map construction, whereas outdated segments are suppressed. On the nuScenes benchmark, NavMapFusion conditioned on coarse road lines from OpenStreetMap data reaches a 21.4% relative improvement on 100 m, and even stronger improvements on larger perception ranges, while maintaining real-time capabilities. By fusing low-fidelity priors with high-fidelity sensor data, the proposed method generates accurate and up-to-date environment representations, guiding towards safer and more reliable autonomous driving.

Abstract: Design generation, in its essence, is a step-by-step process where designers progressively refine and enhance their work through careful modifications. Despite this fundamental characteristic, existing approaches mainly treat design synthesis as a single-step generation problem, significantly underestimating the inherent complexity of the creative process. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel problem setting called Step-by-Step Layered Design Generation, which tasks a machine learning model with generating a design that adheres to a sequence of instructions from a designer. Leveraging recent advancements in multi-modal LLMs, we propose SLEDGE: Step-by-step LayEred Design GEnerator to model each update to a design as an atomic, layered change over its previous state, while being grounded in the instruction. To complement our new problem setting, we introduce a new evaluation suite, including a dataset and a benchmark. Our exhaustive experimental analysis and comparison with state-of-the-art approaches tailored to our new setup demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. We hope our work will attract attention to this pragmatic and under-explored research area.

Conclusion: ProtoEFNet 是一种新型的视频原型学习模型，用于连续 EF 回归，能够在不牺牲准确性的情况下提供临床相关解释。

Abstract: Ejection fraction (EF) is a crucial metric for assessing cardiac function and diagnosing conditions such as heart failure. Traditionally, EF estimation requires manual tracing and domain expertise, making the process time-consuming and subject to interobserver variability. Most current deep learning methods for EF prediction are black-box models with limited transparency, which reduces clinical trust. Some post-hoc explainability methods have been proposed to interpret the decision-making process after the prediction is made. However, these explanations do not guide the model's internal reasoning and therefore offer limited reliability in clinical applications. To address this, we introduce ProtoEFNet, a novel video-based prototype learning model for continuous EF regression. The model learns dynamic spatiotemporal prototypes that capture clinically meaningful cardiac motion patterns. Additionally, the proposed Prototype Angular Separation (PAS) loss enforces discriminative representations across the continuous EF spectrum. Our experiments on the EchonetDynamic dataset show that ProtoEFNet can achieve accuracy on par with its non-interpretable counterpart while providing clinically relevant insight. The ablation study shows that the proposed loss boosts performance with a 2% increase in F1 score from 77.67$\pm$2.68 to 79.64$\pm$2.10.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型在图像修复中易产生幻觉，这在医疗影像等安全关键领域会引发严重问题。现有评估方法因标记数据的高成本和主观性受限。

Method: 引入HalluGen，一个基于扩散的框架，合成具有可控类型、位置和严重程度的真实幻觉。

Result: 构建了首个大规模幻觉数据集（4,350张标注图像），并开发了SHAFE指标和改进的幻觉检测器。

Conclusion: HalluGen及其开放数据集为安全关键图像修复中的幻觉评估建立了首个可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Generative models are prone to hallucinations: plausible but incorrect structures absent in the ground truth. This issue is problematic in image restoration for safety-critical domains such as medical imaging, industrial inspection, and remote sensing, where such errors undermine reliability and trust. For example, in low-field MRI, widely used in resource-limited settings, restoration models are essential for enhancing low-quality scans, yet hallucinations can lead to serious diagnostic errors. Progress has been hindered by a circular dependency: evaluating hallucinations requires labeled data, yet such labels are costly and subjective. We introduce HalluGen, a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes realistic hallucinations with controllable type, location, and severity, producing perceptually realistic but semantically incorrect outputs (segmentation IoU drops from 0.86 to 0.36). Using HalluGen, we construct the first large-scale hallucination dataset comprising 4,350 annotated images derived from 1,450 brain MR images for low-field enhancement, enabling systematic evaluation of hallucination detection and mitigation. We demonstrate its utility in two applications: (1) benchmarking image quality metrics and developing Semantic Hallucination Assessment via Feature Evaluation (SHAFE), a feature-based metric with soft-attention pooling that improves hallucination sensitivity over traditional metrics; and (2) training reference-free hallucination detectors that generalize to real restoration failures. Together, HalluGen and its open dataset establish the first scalable foundation for evaluating hallucinations in safety-critical image restoration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 分层注意力模型在3D医学影像中检测亚临床异常时表现优于传统2D/3D CNN和ViT，因其能更好地匹配异常的空间尺度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测体积医学影像中微弱、空间分布异常的挑战，以及早期疾病信号的微妙、非相邻性质常因次优架构归纳偏差而丢失。

Method: 本研究对16种现代深度学习架构进行了控制比较，包括2D/3D卷积、混合和体积变换器家族，用于从3D前段OCT体积中检测亚临床圆锥角膜（SKC）。

Result: 分层注意力模型在稀疏异常（亚临床）机制中表现出21-23%更高的敏感性和特异性，其优势源于精确的空间尺度对齐。

Conclusion: 分层注意力模型为3D医学影像中的早期病理变化分析提供了一种原则性和有效的方法，为未来的体积异常检测系统提供了设计指导。

Abstract: The detection of weak, spatially distributed anomalies in volumetric medical imaging remains a major challenge. The subtle, non-adjacent nature of early disease signals is often lost due to suboptimal architectural inductive biases: 2D/3D CNNs impose strong locality, while ViTs diffuse unconstrained global attention. This conflict leaves the optimal inductive structure for robust, sparse volumetric pattern recognition unresolved. This study presents a controlled comparison of sixteen modern deep learning architectures spanning 2D/3D convolutional, hybrid, and volumetric transformer families for subclinical keratoconus (SKC) detection from 3D anterior segment OCT volumes. We demonstrate that hierarchical attention models offer a superior and more parameter-efficient inductive bias, surpassing the performance of both 2D and 3D CNNs and ViTs. Our results show 21-23% higher sensitivity and specificity in the sparse anomaly (subclinical) regime. Mechanistic analyses reveal that this advantage stems from precise spatial scale alignment: hierarchical windowing produces effective receptive fields matched to the intermediate, multi-slice extent of subclinical abnormalities. This avoids excessive CNN locality and diffuse global attention. Attention-distance measurements confirm a key insight into architectural adaptation: the required spatial integration length shifts significantly based on the signal strength, with subclinical cases necessitating longer integration compared to both healthy and manifest disease states. Representational similarity and auxiliary age/sex prediction tasks further support the generalizability of these inductive principles. The findings provide design guidance for future volumetric anomaly detection systems, establishing hierarchical attention as a principled and effective approach for early pathological change analysis in 3D medical imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeeU通过2D→4D→2D框架学习连续4D动态，实现物理一致的新视觉内容生成，适用于多种任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉理解、预测和生成方法直接操作于2D观测，导致性能不佳，因此提出学习连续4D动态以生成未见视觉内容。

Method: SeeU采用2D→4D→2D学习框架：首先从稀疏的单目2D帧重建4D世界，然后在低秩表示和物理约束下学习连续4D动态，最后通过时空上下文感知生成未见区域。

Result: SeeU在未见时间生成、未见空间生成和视频编辑等任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: 通过建模4D动态，SeeU实现了连续且物理一致的新视觉内容生成，在多个任务中展现出强大潜力。

Abstract: Images and videos are discrete 2D projections of the 4D world (3D space + time). Most visual understanding, prediction, and generation operate directly on 2D observations, leading to suboptimal performance. We propose SeeU, a novel approach that learns the continuous 4D dynamics and generate the unseen visual contents. The principle behind SeeU is a new 2D$\to$4D$\to$2D learning framework. SeeU first reconstructs the 4D world from sparse and monocular 2D frames (2D$\to$4D). It then learns the continuous 4D dynamics on a low-rank representation and physical constraints (discrete 4D$\to$continuous 4D). Finally, SeeU rolls the world forward in time, re-projects it back to 2D at sampled times and viewpoints, and generates unseen regions based on spatial-temporal context awareness (4D$\to$2D). By modeling dynamics in 4D, SeeU achieves continuous and physically-consistent novel visual generation, demonstrating strong potentials in multiple tasks including unseen temporal generation, unseen spatial generation, and video editing.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的深度学习系统在肺癌分类中表现出色，准确率达98%，为实际医疗应用提供了高准确性、透明性和鲁棒性的解决方案。

Abstract: Lung cancer is a very deadly disease worldwide, and its early diagnosis is crucial for increasing patient survival rates. Computed tomography (CT) scans are widely used for lung cancer diagnosis as they can give detailed lung structures. However, manual interpretation is time-consuming and prone to human error. To surmount this challenge, the study proposes a deep learning-based automatic lung cancer classification system to enhance detection accuracy and interpretability. The IQOTHNCCD lung cancer dataset is utilized, which is a public CT scan dataset consisting of cases categorized into Normal, Benign, and Malignant and used DenseNet169, which includes Squeezeand-Excitation blocks for attention-based feature extraction, Focal Loss for handling class imbalance, and a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for multi-scale feature fusion. In addition, an SVM model was developed using MobileNetV2 for feature extraction, improving its classification performance. For model interpretability enhancement, the study integrated Grad-CAM for the visualization of decision-making regions in CT scans and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) for explanation of feature contributions within the SVM model. Intensive evaluation was performed, and it was found that both DenseNet169 and SVM models achieved 98% accuracy, suggesting their robustness for real-world medical practice. These results open up the potential for deep learning to improve the diagnosis of lung cancer by a higher level of accuracy, transparency, and robustness.

TL;DR: FireSentry是一个高分辨率野火数据集，FiReDiff通过双模态预测和分割提升了野火蔓延预测的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的野火蔓延预测研究主要关注粗时空尺度，依赖低分辨率卫星数据，仅能捕捉宏观火灾状态，限制了高精度局部火灾动态建模能力。

Method: 利用同步无人机平台收集的亚米级空间和亚秒级时间分辨率的多模态数据，建立了一个包含物理基础、数据驱动和生成模型的综合基准。提出了FiReDiff，一种新颖的双模态范式，首先在红外模态中预测未来视频序列，然后在掩码模态中基于生成的动态精确分割火灾掩码。

Result: FiReDiff在生成模型中实现了最先进的性能，视频质量在PSNR、SSIM、LPIPS和FVD方面分别提升了39.2%、36.1%、50.0%和29.4%，掩码准确度在AUPRC、F1分数、IoU和MSE方面分别提升了3.3%、59.1%、42.9%和62.5%。

Conclusion: FireSentry基准数据集和FiReDiff范式共同推动了细粒度野火预测和动态灾害模拟的进步。

Abstract: Fine-grained wildfire spread prediction is crucial for enhancing emergency response efficacy and decision-making precision. However, existing research predominantly focuses on coarse spatiotemporal scales and relies on low-resolution satellite data, capturing only macroscopic fire states while fundamentally constraining high-precision localized fire dynamics modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we present FireSentry, a provincial-scale multi-modal wildfire dataset characterized by sub-meter spatial and sub-second temporal resolution. Collected using synchronized UAV platforms, FireSentry provides visible and infrared video streams, in-situ environmental measurements, and manually validated fire masks. Building on FireSentry, we establish a comprehensive benchmark encompassing physics-based, data-driven, and generative models, revealing the limitations of existing mask-only approaches. Our analysis proposes FiReDiff, a novel dual-modality paradigm that first predicts future video sequences in the infrared modality, and then precisely segments fire masks in the mask modality based on the generated dynamics. FiReDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, with video quality gains of 39.2% in PSNR, 36.1% in SSIM, 50.0% in LPIPS, 29.4% in FVD, and mask accuracy gains of 3.3% in AUPRC, 59.1% in F1 score, 42.9% in IoU, and 62.5% in MSE when applied to generative models. The FireSentry benchmark dataset and FiReDiff paradigm collectively advance fine-grained wildfire forecasting and dynamic disaster simulation.

TL;DR: ShelfGaussian是一个基于高斯的多模态3D场景理解框架，通过结合视觉基础模型和多模态传感器数据，显著提升了零样本语义占用预测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯方法要么局限于封闭集语义监督，要么仅依赖2D自监督，导致几何质量下降或仅限于相机设置。ShelfGaussian旨在充分利用高斯的潜力，解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了一种多模态高斯变换器（Multi-Modal Gaussian Transformer）和架式监督学习范式（Shelf-Supervised Learning Paradigm），结合2D图像和3D场景级别的监督优化高斯表示。

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes数据集上实现了最先进的零样本语义占用预测性能，并在无人地面车辆（UGV）的多样化城市场景中验证了其实际应用效果。

Conclusion: ShelfGaussian通过结合多模态传感器数据和视觉基础模型（VFMs）的监督，实现了在3D场景理解中的卓越性能，特别是在零样本语义占用预测方面表现优异。

Abstract: We introduce ShelfGaussian, an open-vocabulary multi-modal Gaussian-based 3D scene understanding framework supervised by off-the-shelf vision foundation models (VFMs). Gaussian-based methods have demonstrated superior performance and computational efficiency across a wide range of scene understanding tasks. However, existing methods either model objects as closed-set semantic Gaussians supervised by annotated 3D labels, neglecting their rendering ability, or learn open-set Gaussian representations via purely 2D self-supervision, leading to degraded geometry and limited to camera-only settings. To fully exploit the potential of Gaussians, we propose a Multi-Modal Gaussian Transformer that enables Gaussians to query features from diverse sensor modalities, and a Shelf-Supervised Learning Paradigm that efficiently optimizes Gaussians with VFM features jointly at 2D image and 3D scene levels. We evaluate ShelfGaussian on various perception and planning tasks. Experiments on Occ3D-nuScenes demonstrate its state-of-the-art zero-shot semantic occupancy prediction performance. ShelfGaussian is further evaluated on an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to assess its in the-wild performance across diverse urban scenarios.

TL;DR: MOS框架通过模态一致表示学习和跨模态数据生成与特征融合，显著提升了光学与SAR图像之间的跨模态船舶重识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光学与SAR图像之间的模态差距是跨模态船舶重识别的主要挑战，因此需要一种新的框架来缩小这一差距并实现模态一致的特征学习。

Method: MOS框架包含两个核心组件：模态一致表示学习（MCRL）和跨模态数据生成与特征融合（CDGF）。MCRL通过去噪SAR图像处理和类间模态对齐损失来对齐跨模态的特征分布；CDGF利用布朗桥扩散模型合成跨模态样本，并在推理时与原始特征融合以增强对齐和区分性。

Result: 在HOSS ReID数据集上的实验表明，MOS在所有评估协议下均显著优于现有方法，R1准确率在ALL to ALL、Optical to SAR和SAR to Optical设置下分别提高了+3.0%、+6.2%和+16.4%。

Conclusion: MOS框架通过模态一致表示学习和跨模态数据生成与特征融合，显著缩小了光学与SAR图像之间的模态差距，提升了跨模态船舶重识别的性能。

Abstract: Cross-modal ship re-identification (ReID) between optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has recently emerged as a critical yet underexplored task in maritime intelligence and surveillance. However, the substantial modality gap between optical and SAR images poses a major challenge for robust identification. To address this issue, we propose MOS, a novel framework designed to mitigate the optical-SAR modality gap and achieve modality-consistent feature learning for optical-SAR cross-modal ship ReID. MOS consists of two core components: (1) Modality-Consistent Representation Learning (MCRL) applies denoise SAR image procession and a class-wise modality alignment loss to align intra-identity feature distributions across modalities. (2) Cross-modal Data Generation and Feature fusion (CDGF) leverages a brownian bridge diffusion model to synthesize cross-modal samples, which are subsequently fused with original features during inference to enhance alignment and discriminability. Extensive experiments on the HOSS ReID dataset demonstrate that MOS significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation protocols, achieving notable improvements of +3.0%, +6.2%, and +16.4% in R1 accuracy under the ALL to ALL, Optical to SAR, and SAR to Optical settings, respectively. The code and trained models will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: ViDiC-1K 数据集挑战多模态模型在视频对间精细描述相似性和差异的能力，揭示现有模型的性能不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言系统在动态场景的比较感知能力（如运动连续性、事件演变或编辑一致性）方面尚未充分探索，而静态图像的差异描述方法无法捕捉时间上的变化。

Method: 提出了 ViDiC（视频差异描述）任务及其对应的 ViDiC-1K 数据集，包含 1,000 个精选视频对，标注了超过 4,000 个比较检查项，涵盖七个类别。采用双检查表框架，基于 LLM-as-a-Judge 协议分别测量相似性和差异的准确性。

Result: 对 19 个代表性多模态模型的实验显示，它们在比较描述和差异感知能力上存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: ViDiC-1K 数据集旨在为多模态智能的视频理解、编辑感知和比较推理奠定坚实基础，并揭示现有模型在比较描述和差异感知能力上的显著性能差距。

Abstract: Understanding visual differences between dynamic scenes requires the comparative perception of compositional, spatial, and temporal changes--a capability that remains underexplored in existing vision-language systems. While prior work on Image Difference Captioning (IDC) has enabled models to describe semantic changes between static images, these approaches fail to capture motion continuity, event evolution, or editing consistency over time. We introduce the ViDiC (Video Difference Captioning) task and its corresponding ViDiC-1K dataset, designed to evaluate the ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to provide fine-grained descriptions of similarities and differences between video pairs. ViDiC-1K comprises 1,000 curated video pairs annotated with over 4,000 comparative checklist items, covering seven categories: subject, style, background, cinematography, motion, location, and playback techniques. To ensure reliable evaluation, we propose a dual-checklist framework that measures the accuracy of similarity and difference separately, based on the LLM-as-a-Judge protocol. Experiments on nineteen representative multimodal models reveal a significant performance gap in their comparative description and difference perception abilities. We hope ViDiC-1K can be a challenging benchmark that lays a solid foundation for advancing video understanding, edit awareness, and comparative reasoning in multimodal intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有功能学习方法仅关注“如何使用”对象，而忽略了“是什么”和“在哪里”的问题，或将对象检测和功能学习视为独立任务，缺乏有效交互和实时能力。

Method: YOLOA通过大型语言模型（LLM）适配器联合处理对象检测和功能学习任务，采用轻量级检测器，包括对象检测和功能学习分支，并通过LLM适配器进行细化。

Result: YOLOA在重新标记的ADG-Det和IIT-Heat基准测试中表现出色，实现了高准确率和实时性能。

Conclusion: YOLOA在ADG-Det和IIT-Heat基准测试中实现了最先进的准确率（52.8 / 73.1 mAP），同时保持实时性能（高达89.77 FPS，轻量级变体高达846.24 FPS），表明其在准确性和效率之间取得了出色的平衡。

Abstract: Affordance detection aims to jointly address the fundamental "what-where-how" challenge in embodied AI by understanding "what" an object is, "where" the object is located, and "how" it can be used. However, most affordance learning methods focus solely on "how" objects can be used while neglecting the "what" and "where" aspects. Other affordance detection methods treat object detection and affordance learning as two independent tasks, lacking effective interaction and real-time capability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce YOLO Affordance (YOLOA), a real-time affordance detection model that jointly handles these two tasks via a large language model (LLM) adapter. Specifically, YOLOA employs a lightweight detector consisting of object detection and affordance learning branches refined through the LLM Adapter. During training, the LLM Adapter interacts with object and affordance preliminary predictions to refine both branches by generating more accurate class priors, box offsets, and affordance gates. Experiments on our relabeled ADG-Det and IIT-Heat benchmarks demonstrate that YOLOA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (52.8 / 73.1 mAP on ADG-Det / IIT-Heat) while maintaining real-time performance (up to 89.77 FPS, and up to 846.24 FPS for the lightweight variant). This indicates that YOLOA achieves an excellent trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

TL;DR: DM3D是一种自适应点云序列化的状态空间模型，通过高斯排序和重采样机制，显著提升了点云理解的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的状态空间模型（SSMs）依赖于输入顺序，与点云的不规则性相冲突。预定义的序列化策略无法适应多样化的几何结构，因此需要一种自适应的方法来优化点云理解。

Method: DM3D引入了偏移引导的高斯排序机制，结合高斯KNN重采样（GKR）和高斯可微重排序（GDR），实现了点云的结构自适应序列化。此外，Tri-Path Frequency Fusion模块增强了特征互补性并减少了混叠效应。

Result: 在分类、少样本学习和部件分割等任务中，DM3D在基准数据集上表现出色，验证了自适应序列化策略的有效性。

Conclusion: DM3D通过自适应序列化策略，成功释放了状态空间模型在点云理解中的潜力，并在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) demonstrate significant potential for long-sequence modeling, but their reliance on input order conflicts with the irregular nature of point clouds. Existing approaches often rely on predefined serialization strategies, which cannot adjust based on diverse geometric structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose \textbf{DM3D}, a deformable Mamba architecture for point cloud understanding. Specifically, DM3D introduces an offset-guided Gaussian sequencing mechanism that unifies local resampling and global reordering within a deformable scan. The Gaussian-based KNN Resampling (GKR) enhances structural awareness by adaptively reorganizing neighboring points, while the Gaussian-based Differentiable Reordering (GDR) enables end-to-end optimization of serialization order. Furthermore, a Tri-Path Frequency Fusion module enhances feature complementarity and reduces aliasing. Together, these components enable structure-adaptive serialization of point clouds. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that DM3D achieves state-of-the-art performance in classification, few-shot learning, and part segmentation, demonstrating that adaptive serialization effectively unlocks the potential of SSMs for point cloud understanding.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的VLP框架结合MAGEN和O-MAKE方法，显著提升了医学图像分析的性能，尤其在皮肤病学领域取得了零样本分类和跨模态检索任务的领先成果。

Abstract: Vision-language pretraining (VLP) has emerged as a powerful paradigm in medical image analysis, enabling representation learning from large-scale image-text pairs without relying on expensive manual annotations. However, existing methods often struggle with the noise inherent in web-collected data and the complexity of unstructured long medical texts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel VLP framework integrating a Multi-Agent data GENeration (MAGEN) system and Ontology-based Multi-Aspect Knowledge-Enhanced (O-MAKE) pretraining. First, MAGEN enhances data quality by synthesizing knowledge-enriched descriptions via a foundation model-assisted captioning and retrieval-based verification pipeline. Second, O-MAKE addresses the difficulty of learning from long, unstructured texts by decomposing them into distinct knowledge aspects. This facilitates fine-grained alignment at both global and patch levels, while explicitly modeling medical concept relationships through ontology-guided mechanisms. We validate our framework in the field of dermatology, where comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on disease classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks across eight datasets. Our code and the augmented dataset Derm1M-AgentAug, comprising over 400k skin-image-text pairs, will be released at https://github.com/SiyuanYan1/Derm1M.

TL;DR: 首次系统性评估八种立体深度估计方法在林业环境中的表现，DEFOM因深度平滑性和跨域一致性成为最佳选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主无人机林业操作需要具有强大跨域泛化能力的深度估计方法，但现有评估主要集中在城市和室内场景，缺乏针对植被密集环境的专门评估。

Method: 研究对八种最先进的立体方法进行了首次系统性零样本评估，包括RAFT-Stereo、IGEV、IGEV++、BridgeDepth、StereoAnywhere、DEFOM等，涵盖了迭代优化、基础模型和零样本适应范式。

Result: 基础模型在结构化场景中表现优异（如BridgeDepth在ETH3D上的误差为0.23像素），而迭代方法在跨域鲁棒性上表现更佳（如IGEV++的误差范围为0.36-6.77像素）。RAFT-Stereo在ETH3D上表现极差（误差26.23像素），但在KITTI上表现正常（误差0.90-1.11像素）。

Conclusion: DEFOM被确定为植被深度估计的最佳基准方法，因其在深度平滑性、遮挡处理和跨域一致性方面表现优于其他方法。

Abstract: Autonomous UAV forestry operations require robust depth estimation methods with strong cross-domain generalization. However, existing evaluations focus on urban and indoor scenarios, leaving a critical gap for specialized vegetation-dense environments. We present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of eight state-of-the-art stereo methods--RAFT-Stereo, IGEV, IGEV++, BridgeDepth, StereoAnywhere, DEFOM (plus baseline methods ACVNet, PSMNet, TCstereo)--spanning iterative refinement, foundation model, and zero-shot adaptation paradigms. All methods are trained exclusively on Scene Flow and evaluated without fine-tuning on four standard benchmarks (ETH3D, KITTI 2012/2015, Middlebury) plus a novel 5,313-pair Canterbury forestry dataset captured with ZED Mini camera (1920x1080). Performance reveals scene-dependent patterns: foundation models excel on structured scenes (BridgeDepth: 0.23 px on ETH3D, 0.83-1.07 px on KITTI; DEFOM: 0.35-4.65 px across benchmarks), while iterative methods maintain cross-domain robustness (IGEV++: 0.36-6.77 px; IGEV: 0.33-21.91 px). Critical finding: RAFT-Stereo exhibits catastrophic ETH3D failure (26.23 px EPE, 98 percent error rate) due to negative disparity predictions, while performing normally on KITTI (0.90-1.11 px). Qualitative evaluation on Canterbury forestry dataset identifies DEFOM as the optimal gold-standard baseline for vegetation depth estimation, exhibiting superior depth smoothness, occlusion handling, and cross-domain consistency compared to IGEV++, despite IGEV++'s finer detail preservation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管扩散模型在视频生成中表现出色，但其高计算需求限制了广泛应用。

Method: 通过秩相关分析确定每个视频模型的最佳代理，确保计算重用的最优性。

Result: 在 Wan2.1-1.3B 和 Wan2.1-14B 上分别实现了 1.87 倍和 2.37 倍的加速，VBench-2.0 基准测试中仅下降 0.97% 和 0.72%。

Conclusion: GalaxyDiT 是一种无需训练的方法，通过指导对齐和系统代理选择来加速视频生成，显著提升了计算效率，同时保持了高保真度。

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized video generation, becoming essential tools in creative content generation and physical simulation. Transformer-based architectures (DiTs) and classifier-free guidance (CFG) are two cornerstones of this success, enabling strong prompt adherence and realistic video quality. Despite their versatility and superior performance, these models require intensive computation. Each video generation requires dozens of iterative steps, and CFG doubles the required compute. This inefficiency hinders broader adoption in downstream applications.
  We introduce GalaxyDiT, a training-free method to accelerate video generation with guidance alignment and systematic proxy selection for reuse metrics. Through rank-order correlation analysis, our technique identifies the optimal proxy for each video model, across model families and parameter scales, thereby ensuring optimal computational reuse. We achieve $1.87\times$ and $2.37\times$ speedup on Wan2.1-1.3B and Wan2.1-14B with only 0.97% and 0.72% drops on the VBench-2.0 benchmark. At high speedup rates, our approach maintains superior fidelity to the base model, exceeding prior state-of-the-art approaches by 5 to 10 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) enables detailed land cover classification, yet low spatial resolution and sparse annotations pose significant challenges. We present a label-efficient framework that leverages spatial features from a frozen diffusion model pretrained on natural images. Our approach extracts low-level representations from high-resolution decoder layers at early denoising timesteps, which transfer effectively to the low-texture structure of HSI. To integrate spectral and spatial information, we introduce a lightweight FiLM-based fusion module that adaptively modulates frozen spatial features using spectral cues, enabling robust multimodal learning under sparse supervision. Experiments on two recent hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches using only the provided sparse training labels. Ablation studies further highlight the benefits of diffusion-derived features and spectral-aware fusion. Overall, our results indicate that pretrained diffusion models can support domain-agnostic, label-efficient representation learning for remote sensing and broader scientific imaging tasks.

Motivation: 现有自动驾驶视觉定位方法难以处理模糊、上下文依赖的指令，缺乏对3D空间关系和场景演变的推理能力。

Method: 提出了ThinkDeeper框架，包含SA-WM模型和超图引导解码器，通过预测未来空间状态和多模态输入融合实现精准定位。

Result: ThinkDeeper在多个基准测试中排名第一，表现出强大的鲁棒性和效率，甚至在数据量减半时仍保持优异性能。

Conclusion: ThinkDeeper框架通过空间感知世界模型（SA-WM）和超图引导解码器，显著提升了自动驾驶中自然语言命令的视觉定位能力，尤其在处理模糊、上下文依赖的指令时表现出色。

Abstract: Interpreting natural-language commands to localize target objects is critical for autonomous driving (AD). Existing visual grounding (VG) methods for autonomous vehicles (AVs) typically struggle with ambiguous, context-dependent instructions, as they lack reasoning over 3D spatial relations and anticipated scene evolution. Grounded in the principles of world models, we propose ThinkDeeper, a framework that reasons about future spatial states before making grounding decisions. At its core is a Spatial-Aware World Model (SA-WM) that learns to reason ahead by distilling the current scene into a command-aware latent state and rolling out a sequence of future latent states, providing forward-looking cues for disambiguation. Complementing this, a hypergraph-guided decoder then hierarchically fuses these states with the multimodal input, capturing higher-order spatial dependencies for robust localization. In addition, we present DrivePilot, a multi-source VG dataset in AD, featuring semantic annotations generated by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-prompted LLM pipeline. Extensive evaluations on six benchmarks, ThinkDeeper ranks #1 on the Talk2Car leaderboard and surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on DrivePilot, MoCAD, and RefCOCO/+/g benchmarks. Notably, it shows strong robustness and efficiency in challenging scenes (long-text, multi-agent, ambiguity) and retains superior performance even when trained on 50% of the data.

TL;DR: TPI方法通过将文本渲染为图像，低成本地提升LVLMs在文本中心训练中的表现，优于扩散模型生成的图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要大量图像-文本对进行任务特定微调，成本高且受隐私和领域稀缺性限制。文本数据广泛可用且易于编辑，但仅用原始文本训练效果有限。

Method: 提出Text-Printed Image (TPI)方法，通过将文本直接渲染到空白画布上生成合成图像，以弥合图像-文本模态差距。

Result: 在四个模型和七个基准测试中，TPI比扩散模型生成的合成图像更有效地支持文本中心训练，并可作为低成本数据增强策略。

Conclusion: 本文展示了文本中心训练的显著潜力，并为LVLMs的完全自动化数据生成开辟了路径。

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been applied to diverse VQA tasks. However, achieving practical performance typically requires task-specific fine-tuning with large numbers of image-text pairs, which are costly to collect. In this work, we study text-centric training, a setting where only textual descriptions are available and no real images are provided, as a paradigm for low-cost data scaling. Unlike images, whose collection is often restricted by privacy constraints and scarcity in niche domains, text is widely available. Moreover, text is easily editable, enabling automatic diversification and expansion with LLMs at minimal human effort. While this offers clear advantages over image collection in terms of scalability and cost, training on raw text without images still yields limited gains on VQA tasks because of the image-text modality gap. To address this issue, we propose a Text-Printed Image (TPI), which generates synthetic images by directly rendering the given textual description on a plain white canvas. This simple rendering projects text into the image modality and can be integrated into arbitrary existing LVLM training pipelines at low cost. Moreover, TPI preserves the semantics of the text, whereas text-to-image models often fail to do. Across four models and seven benchmarks, our systematic experiments show that TPI enables more effective text-centric training than synthetic images generated by a diffusion model. We further explore TPI as a low-cost data-augmentation strategy and demonstrate its practical utility. Overall, our findings highlight the significant potential of text-centric training and, more broadly, chart a path toward fully automated data generation for LVLMs.

TL;DR: LM-CartSeg是一种全自动膝关节MRI分割和分析流程，通过几何规则优化分割结果，显著提升了分割精度，并为OA研究提供了实用的放射组学特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 膝关节MRI的放射组学需要稳健且具有解剖学意义的ROI，以同时捕捉软骨和软骨下骨。现有工作多依赖手动ROI且很少报告质量控制（QC），因此提出了LM-CartSeg这一全自动流程。

Method: 训练了两个3D nnU-Net模型，分别基于SKM-TEA（138个膝盖）和OAIZIB-CM（404个膝盖）数据集。测试时，通过简单的几何规则（如连通组件清理、构建10毫米的软骨下骨带、基于PCA和k-means的胫骨内外侧分割）对零样本预测进行融合和优化。

Result: 后处理将OAIZIB-CM测试集上的宏观ASSD从2.63毫米提升至0.36毫米，HD95从25.2毫米降至3.35毫米，DSC为0.91；SKI-10上的零样本DSC为0.80。放射组学模型仅限于与尺寸相关的特征。

Conclusion: LM-CartSeg提供了一种自动化的、经过质量控制（QC）的ROI和放射组学特征，这些特征携带了超越简单形态测量的判别信息，为多中心膝关节骨关节炎（OA）放射组学研究提供了实用基础。

Abstract: Background and Objective: Radiomics of knee MRI requires robust, anatomically meaningful regions of interest (ROIs) that jointly capture cartilage and subchondral bone. Most existing work relies on manual ROIs and rarely reports quality control (QC). We present LM-CartSeg, a fully automatic pipeline for cartilage/bone segmentation, geometric lateral/medial (L/M) compartmentalisation and radiomics analysis. Methods: Two 3D nnU-Net models were trained on SKM-TEA (138 knees) and OAIZIB-CM (404 knees). At test time, zero-shot predictions were fused and refined by simple geometric rules: connected-component cleaning, construction of 10 mm subchondral bone bands in physical space, and a data-driven tibial L/M split based on PCA and k-means. Segmentation was evaluated on an OAIZIB-CM test set (103 knees) and on SKI-10 (100 knees). QC used volume and thickness signatures. From 10 ROIs we extracted 4 650 non-shape radiomic features to study inter-compartment similarity, dependence on ROI size, and OA vs. non-OA classification on OAIZIB-CM Results: Post-processing improved macro ASSD on OAIZIB-CM from 2.63 to 0.36 mm and HD95 from 25.2 to 3.35 mm, with DSC 0.91; zero-shot DSC on SKI-10 was 0.80. The geometric L/M rule produced stable compartments across datasets, whereas a direct L/M nnU-Net showed domain-dependent side swaps. Only 6 to 12 percent of features per ROI were strongly correlated with volume or thickness. Radiomics-based models models restricted to size-linked features. Conclusions: LM-CartSeg yields automatic, QCd ROIs and radiomic features that carry discriminative information beyond simple morphometry, providing a practical foundation for multi-centre knee OA radiomics studies.

Conclusion: NAS-LoRA作为一种新的参数高效微调方法，通过引入轻量级神经架构搜索块和分阶段优化策略，有效提升了SAM在特定下游任务中的适应性能，同时降低了训练成本。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has emerged as a powerful visual foundation model for image segmentation. However, adapting SAM to specific downstream tasks, such as medical and agricultural imaging, remains a significant challenge. To address this, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have been widely employed to enhancing SAM's adaptation performance on diverse domains. Despite advancements, a critical question arises: can we integrate inductive bias into the model? This is particularly relevant since the Transformer encoder in SAM inherently lacks spatial priors within image patches, potentially hindering the acquisition of high-level semantic information. In this paper, we propose NAS-LoRA, a new Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method designed to bridge the semantic gap between pre-trained SAM and specialized domains. Specifically, NAS-LoRA incorporates a lightweight Neural Architecture Search (NAS) block between the encoder and decoder components of LoRA to dynamically optimize the prior knowledge integrated into weight updates. Furthermore, we propose a stage-wise optimization strategy to help the ViT encoder balance weight updates and architectural adjustments, facilitating the gradual learning of high-level semantic information. Various Experiments demonstrate our NAS-LoRA improves existing PEFT methods, while reducing training cost by 24.14% without increasing inference cost, highlighting the potential of NAS in enhancing PEFT for visual foundation models.

Abstract: Understanding and representing the structure of 3D objects in an unsupervised manner remains a core challenge in computer vision and graphics. Most existing unsupervised keypoint methods are not designed for unconditional generative settings, restricting their use in modern 3D generative pipelines; our formulation explicitly bridges this gap. We present an unsupervised framework for learning spatially structured 3D keypoints from point cloud data. These keypoints serve as a compact and interpretable representation that conditions an Elucidated Diffusion Model (EDM) to reconstruct the full shape. The learned keypoints exhibit repeatable spatial structure across object instances and support smooth interpolation in keypoint space, indicating that they capture geometric variation. Our method achieves strong performance across diverse object categories, yielding a 6 percentage-point improvement in keypoint consistency compared to prior approaches.

Conclusion: PRIS框架通过动态调整提示词和视觉生成，显著提升了文本到视觉生成的对齐效果，验证了联合扩展提示词和视觉生成在推理时的重要性。

Abstract: Achieving precise alignment between user intent and generated visuals remains a central challenge in text-to-visual generation, as a single attempt often fails to produce the desired output. To handle this, prior approaches mainly scale the visual generation process (e.g., increasing sampling steps or seeds), but this quickly leads to a quality plateau. This limitation arises because the prompt, crucial for guiding generation, is kept fixed. To address this, we propose Prompt Redesign for Inference-time Scaling, coined PRIS, a framework that adaptively revises the prompt during inference in response to the scaled visual generations. The core idea of PRIS is to review the generated visuals, identify recurring failure patterns across visuals, and redesign the prompt accordingly before regenerating the visuals with the revised prompt. To provide precise alignment feedback for prompt revision, we introduce a new verifier, element-level factual correction, which evaluates the alignment between prompt attributes and generated visuals at a fine-grained level, achieving more accurate and interpretable assessments than holistic measures. Extensive experiments on both text-to-image and text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, including a 15% gain on VBench 2.0. These results highlight that jointly scaling prompts and visuals is key to fully leveraging scaling laws at inference-time.

Method: CookAnything框架包含三个关键组件：Step-wise Regional Control（SRC）、Flexible RoPE和Cross-Step Consistency Control（CSCC），用于从任意长度的文本烹饪指令生成连贯且语义独特的图像序列。

Result: 实验结果表明，CookAnything在基于训练和无训练设置下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CookAnything框架在食谱插图任务中表现优于现有方法，支持复杂多步骤指令的可扩展、高质量视觉合成，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Cooking is a sequential and visually grounded activity, where each step such as chopping, mixing, or frying carries both procedural logic and visual semantics. While recent diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in text-to-image generation, they struggle to handle structured multi-step scenarios like recipe illustration. Additionally, current recipe illustration methods are unable to adjust to the natural variability in recipe length, generating a fixed number of images regardless of the actual instructions structure. To address these limitations, we present CookAnything, a flexible and consistent diffusion-based framework that generates coherent, semantically distinct image sequences from textual cooking instructions of arbitrary length. The framework introduces three key components: (1) Step-wise Regional Control (SRC), which aligns textual steps with corresponding image regions within a single denoising process; (2) Flexible RoPE, a step-aware positional encoding mechanism that enhances both temporal coherence and spatial diversity; and (3) Cross-Step Consistency Control (CSCC), which maintains fine-grained ingredient consistency across steps. Experimental results on recipe illustration benchmarks show that CookAnything performs better than existing methods in training-based and training-free settings. The proposed framework supports scalable, high-quality visual synthesis of complex multi-step instructions and holds significant potential for broad applications in instructional media, and procedural content creation.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled the synthesis of high-quality and visually realistic clips using diffusion transformer models. However, most existing approaches operate purely in the 2D pixel space and lack explicit mechanisms for modeling 3D structures, often resulting in temporally inconsistent geometries, implausible motions, and structural artifacts. In this work, we introduce geometric regularization losses into video generation by augmenting latent diffusion models with per-frame depth prediction. We adopted depth as the geometric representation because of the great progress in depth prediction and its compatibility with image-based latent encoders. Specifically, to enforce structural consistency over time, we propose a multi-view geometric loss that aligns the predicted depth maps across frames within a shared 3D coordinate system. Our method bridges the gap between appearance generation and 3D structure modeling, leading to improved spatio-temporal coherence, shape consistency, and physical plausibility. Experiments across multiple datasets show that our approach produces significantly more stable and geometrically consistent results than existing baselines.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in numerous vision-language tasks yet suffer from hallucinations, producing content inconsistent with input visuals, that undermine reliability in precision-sensitive domains. This issue stems from a fundamental problem of visual neglect, where models fail to adequately prioritize input images. Existing methods typically alleviate hallucinations by intervening in the attention score or output logits, focusing on "how to intervene" but overlooking the prerequisite "when to intervene", which leads to the "over-intervention" problem and subsequently introduces new hallucinations and unnecessary computational overhead. To address this gap, we first investigate the mechanism of visual neglect and reveal it can be accurately detected via head-level activation patterns in MLLMs. We thus propose V-ITI, a lightweight visual inference-time intervention framework integrating a Visual Neglect Detector that identifies visual neglect via head-level discriminative probes and a Visual Recall Intervenor that modulates activations with prestored visual activation information only when the visual neglect is detected. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks and different MLLM families demonstrate that V-ITI consistently mitigates vision-related hallucinations while preserving general task performance.

Abstract: Content moderation remains a critical yet challenging task for large-scale user-generated video platforms, especially in livestreaming environments where moderation must be timely, multimodal, and robust to evolving forms of unwanted content. We present a hybrid moderation framework deployed at production scale that combines supervised classification for known violations with reference-based similarity matching for novel or subtle cases. This hybrid design enables robust detection of both explicit violations and novel edge cases that evade traditional classifiers. Multimodal inputs (text, audio, visual) are processed through both pipelines, with a multimodal large language model (MLLM) distilling knowledge into each to boost accuracy while keeping inference lightweight. In production, the classification pipeline achieves 67% recall at 80% precision, and the similarity pipeline achieves 76% recall at 80% precision. Large-scale A/B tests show a 6-8% reduction in user views of unwanted livestreams}. These results demonstrate a scalable and adaptable approach to multimodal content governance, capable of addressing both explicit violations and emerging adversarial behaviors.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) faces two major challenges: a lack of discernible target texture and severe background clutter, which results in the background obscuring the target. To enhance targets and suppress backgrounds, we propose the Basis Decomposition Module (BDM) as an extensible and lightweight module based on basis decomposition, which decomposes a complex feature into several basis features and enhances certain information while eliminating redundancy. Extending BDM leads to a series of modules, including the Spatial Difference Decomposition Module (SD$^\mathrm{2}$M), Spatial Difference Decomposition Downsampling Module (SD$^\mathrm{3}$M), and Temporal Difference Decomposition Module (TD$^\mathrm{2}$M). Based on these modules, we develop the Spatial Difference Decomposition Network (SD$^\mathrm{2}$Net) for single-frame ISTD (SISTD) and the Spatiotemporal Difference Decomposition Network (STD$^\mathrm{2}$Net) for multi-frame ISTD (MISTD). SD$^\mathrm{2}$Net integrates SD$^\mathrm{2}$M and SD$^\mathrm{3}$M within an adapted U-shaped architecture. We employ TD$^\mathrm{2}$M to introduce motion information, which transforms SD$^\mathrm{2}$Net into STD$^\mathrm{2}$Net. Extensive experiments on SISTD and MISTD datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. On the SISTD task, SD$^\mathrm{2}$Net performs well compared to most established networks. On the MISTD datasets, STD$^\mathrm{2}$Net achieves a mIoU of 87.68\%, outperforming SD$^\mathrm{2}$Net, which achieves a mIoU of 64.97\%.

Conclusion: Action Effect Modeling (AEM)通过联合建模动作执行和结果，显著提升了错误检测的可靠性，并展示了效果感知表征在更广泛下游应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Mistake detection in procedural tasks is essential for building intelligent systems that support learning and task execution. Existing approaches primarily analyze how an action is performed, while overlooking what it produces, i.e., the \textbf{action effect}. Yet many errors manifest not in the execution itself but in the resulting outcome, such as an unintended object state or incorrect spatial arrangement. To address this gap, we propose Action Effect Modeling (AEM), a unified framework that jointly captures action execution and its outcomes through a probabilistic formulation. AEM first identifies the outcome of an action by selecting the most informative effect frame based on semantic relevance and visual quality. It then extracts complementary cues from visual grounding and symbolic scene graphs, aligning them in a shared latent space to form robust effect-aware representations. To detect mistakes, we further design a prompt-based detector that incorporates task-specific prompts and aligns each action segment with its intended execution semantics. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the EgoPER and CaptainCook4D benchmarks under the challenging one-class classification (OCC) setting. These results demonstrate that modeling both execution and outcome yields more reliable mistake detection, and highlight the potential of effect-aware representations to benefit a broader range of downstream applications.

Abstract: Crowdsourcing enables scalable autonomous driving map construction, but low-cost sensor noise hinders quality from improving with data volume. We propose CSMapping, a system that produces accurate semantic maps and topological road centerlines whose quality consistently increases with more crowdsourced data. For semantic mapping, we train a latent diffusion model on HD maps (optionally conditioned on SD maps) to learn a generative prior of real-world map structure, without requiring paired crowdsourced/HD-map supervision. This prior is incorporated via constrained MAP optimization in latent space, ensuring robustness to severe noise and plausible completion in unobserved areas. Initialization uses a robust vectorized mapping module followed by diffusion inversion; optimization employs efficient Gaussian-basis reparameterization, projected gradient descent zobracket multi-start, and latent-space factor-graph for global consistency. For topological mapping, we apply confidence-weighted k-medoids clustering and kinematic refinement to trajectories, yielding smooth, human-like centerlines robust to trajectory variation. Experiments on nuScenes, Argoverse 2, and a large proprietary dataset achieve state-of-the-art semantic and topological mapping performance, with thorough ablation and scalability studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN在遥感图像的小目标检测中存在信息丢失和背景干扰问题，MKSNet旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: MKSNet采用多核选择机制（MKS）和双注意力机制，结合空间和通道注意力模块，动态处理并增强关键空间细节。

Conclusion: MKSNet在遥感图像中的小目标检测方面表现出色，显著超越了现有最先进模型，验证了其在处理多尺度和高分辨率图像数据方面的有效性和创新性。

Abstract: Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have substantially advanced object detection capabilities, particularly in remote sensing imagery. However, challenges persist, especially in detecting small objects where the high resolution of these images and the small size of target objects often result in a loss of critical information in the deeper layers of conventional CNNs. Additionally, the extensive spatial redundancy and intricate background details typical in remote-sensing images tend to obscure these small targets. To address these challenges, we introduce Multi-Kernel Selection Network (MKSNet), a novel network architecture featuring a novel Multi-Kernel Selection mechanism. The MKS mechanism utilizes large convolutional kernels to effectively capture an extensive range of contextual information. This innovative design allows for adaptive kernel size selection, significantly enhancing the network's ability to dynamically process and emphasize crucial spatial details for small object detection. Furthermore, MKSNet also incorporates a dual attention mechanism, merging spatial and channel attention modules. The spatial attention module adaptively fine-tunes the spatial weights of feature maps, focusing more intensively on relevant regions while mitigating background noise. Simultaneously, the channel attention module optimizes channel information selection, improving feature representation and detection accuracy. Empirical evaluations on the DOTA-v1.0 and HRSC2016 benchmark demonstrate that MKSNet substantially surpasses existing state-of-the-art models in detecting small objects in remote sensing images. These results highlight MKSNet's superior ability to manage the complexities associated with multi-scale and high-resolution image data, confirming its effectiveness and innovation in remote sensing object detection.

Motivation: 医疗视觉语言模型（VLMs）在医学影像任务中表现出专家级性能，但在不同人口群体中显示出显著的诊断准确性差异。本文旨在结合参数效率和显式公平优化，减少这些差异。

Method: 本文提出了三种方法：FR-LoRA将MaxAccGap正则化整合到训练目标中，GR-LoRA应用逆频率加权以平衡梯度贡献，Hybrid-LoRA结合了这两种机制。关键算法贡献是可微分的MaxAccGap损失，实现了跨人口群体准确性平等的端到端优化。

Conclusion: 本文提出的公平感知低秩适应方法（Fairness-aware Low-Rank Adaptation）通过结合参数效率和显式公平优化，显著减少了医疗视觉语言模型（VLMs）在诊断准确性上的群体差异。GR-LoRA方法在10,000张青光眼眼底图像上的评估显示，诊断准确性差异减少了69%，同时保持了53.15%的整体准确性。该方法仅需0.24%的可训练参数，适合在资源受限的医疗环境中部署。

Abstract: Vision-language models achieve expert-level performance on medical imaging tasks but exhibit significant diagnostic accuracy disparities across demographic groups. We introduce fairness-aware Low-Rank Adaptation for medical VLMs, combining parameter efficiency with explicit fairness optimization. Our key algorithmic contribution is a differentiable MaxAccGap loss that enables end-to-end optimization of accuracy parity across demographic groups. We propose three methods: FR-LoRA integrates MaxAccGap regularization into the training objective, GR-LoRA applies inverse frequency weighting to balance gradient contributions, and Hybrid-LoRA combines both mechanisms.Evaluated on 10,000 glaucoma fundus images, GR-LoRA reduces diagnostic accuracy disparities by 69% while maintaining 53.15% overall accuracy. Ablation studies reveal that strong regularization strength achieves optimal fairness with minimal accuracy trade-off, and race-specific optimization yields 60% disparity reduction. Our approach requires only 0.24% trainable parameters, enabling practical deployment of fair medical AI in resource-constrained healthcare settings.

Conclusion: ToG-Bench作为首个任务导向的时空视频定位基准，揭示了感知与交互在具身智能中的挑战，并展示了显式-隐式和多对象定位的性能差距。

Abstract: A core capability towards general embodied intelligence lies in localizing task-relevant objects from an egocentric perspective, formulated as Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG). Despite recent progress, existing STVG studies remain largely confined to object-centric and descriptive instructions, neglecting the task-oriented reasoning that is crucial for embodied agents to accomplish goal-directed interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{ToG-Bench}, the first task-oriented spatio-temporal video grounding benchmark for egocentric videos. ToG-Bench is characterized by three key features: (1) \textbf{Task-oriented Grounding}, which requires identifying and localizing objects based on intended tasks rather than straightforward descriptions; (2) \textbf{Explicit-Implicit Dual Grounding}, where target objects can be either explicitly mentioned or implicitly inferred by contextual reasoning; (3) \textbf{One-to-Many Grounding}, where a single instruction may correspond to multiple objects involved in task execution. Built upon videos sourced from ScanNet, ToG-Bench comprises 100 annotated clips with 2,704 task-oriented grounding instructions, constructed via a semi-automated pipeline that combines foundation model annotation and human refinement. In addition, we introduce a set of task-level evaluation metrics tailored for multi-object and explicit-implicit object grounding, and systematically benchmark seven state-of-the-art MLLMs. Extensive experiments reveal the intrinsic challenges of task-oriented STVG and substantial performance gaps across explicit-implicit and multi-object grounding, highlighting the difficulty of bridging perception and interaction in embodied scenarios.

Conclusion: 本文提出的对象中心框架在对象级识别和推理方面显著优于现有的大型视觉语言模型。

Abstract: Understanding procedural activities is crucial for developing future assistive AI that can reason about complex real-world tasks. Existing action-centric methods struggle with the flexibility of real procedures, where step order varies depending on object states. In this work, we propose to shift the focus to an object-centric paradigm by regarding actions as mechanisms that drive state transitions. To advance this direction, we introduce Object-IVQA, a long-form instructional video benchmark with 107 videos and 514 open-ended question-answer pairs annotated with temporally grounded evidence. The benchmark evaluates four dimensions of object-centric reasoning, including state evolution, precondition verification, counterfactual reasoning and mistake recognition. We further propose an agent framework that orchestrates object-centric planning, perception, analysis and generation tools, enabling explicit evidence retrieval and multi-hop reasoning across disjoint segments. Experiments show that existing large vision-language models struggle in object-level recognition and reasoning, whereas our framework achieves substantially improvement.

Conclusion: PosA-VLA框架通过姿态条件监督锚定视觉注意力，显著提高了目标导向动作的一致性和精确性，同时在多样化的机器人操作基准测试中表现出色，并具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: The Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable performance on embodied tasks and shown promising potential for real-world applications. However, current VLAs still struggle to produce consistent and precise target-oriented actions, as they often generate redundant or unstable motions along trajectories, limiting their applicability in time-sensitive scenarios.In this work, we attribute these redundant actions to the spatially uniform perception field of existing VLAs, which causes them to be distracted by target-irrelevant objects, especially in complex environments.To address this issue, we propose an efficient PosA-VLA framework that anchors visual attention via pose-conditioned supervision, consistently guiding the model's perception toward task-relevant regions. The pose-conditioned anchor attention mechanism enables the model to better align instruction semantics with actionable visual cues, thereby improving action generation precision and efficiency. Moreover, our framework adopts a lightweight architecture and requires no auxiliary perception modules (e.g., segmentation or grounding networks), ensuring efficient inference. Extensive experiments verify that our method executes embodied tasks with precise and time-efficient behavior across diverse robotic manipulation benchmarks and shows robust generalization in a variety of challenging environments.

Conclusion: MUT3R框架通过利用预训练transformer中隐含的运动线索，无需重新训练即可提升动态场景下的3D重建质量，显著改善了时间一致性和相机姿态鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent stateful recurrent neural networks have achieved remarkable progress on static 3D reconstruction but remain vulnerable to motion-induced artifacts, where non-rigid regions corrupt attention propagation between the spatial memory and image feature. By analyzing the internal behaviors of the state and image token updating mechanism, we find that aggregating self-attention maps across layers reveals a consistent pattern: dynamic regions are naturally down-weighted, exposing an implicit motion cue that the pretrained transformer already encodes but never explicitly uses. Motivated by this observation, we introduce MUT3R, a training-free framework that applies the attention-derived motion cue to suppress dynamic content in the early layers of the transformer during inference. Our attention-level gating module suppresses the influence of dynamic regions before their artifacts propagate through the feature hierarchy. Notably, we do not retrain or fine-tune the model; we let the pretrained transformer diagnose its own motion cues and correct itself. This early regulation stabilizes geometric reasoning in streaming scenarios and leads to improvements in temporal consistency and camera pose robustness across multiple dynamic benchmarks, offering a simple and training-free pathway toward motion-aware streaming reconstruction.

Conclusion: BlackCAtt通过识别因果像素，生成了更精准且不易察觉的攻击，展示了因果像素的强大能力。

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations are a useful way to expose vulnerabilities in object detectors. Existing perturbation methods are frequently white-box and architecture specific. More importantly, while they are often successful, it is rarely clear why they work. Insights into the mechanism of this success would allow developers to understand and analyze these attacks, as well as fine-tune the model to prevent them. This paper presents BlackCAtt, a black-box algorithm and a tool, which uses minimal, causally sufficient pixel sets to construct explainable, imperceptible, reproducible, architecture-agnostic attacks on object detectors. BlackCAtt combines causal pixels with bounding boxes produced by object detectors to create adversarial attacks that lead to the loss, modification or addition of a bounding box. BlackCAtt works across different object detectors of different sizes and architectures, treating the detector as a black box. We compare the performance of BlackCAtt with other black-box attack methods and show that identification of causal pixels leads to more precisely targeted and less perceptible attacks. On the COCO test dataset, our approach is 2.7 times better than the baseline in removing a detection, 3.86 times better in changing a detection, and 5.75 times better in triggering new, spurious, detections. The attacks generated by BlackCAtt are very close to the original image, and hence imperceptible, demonstrating the power of causal pixels.

Conclusion: EEA框架通过语义引导的层次树搜索过程，有效平衡了探索与利用，显著提升了长视频理解的性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding requires efficient navigation of extensive visual data to pinpoint sparse yet critical information. Current approaches to longform video understanding either suffer from severe computational overhead due to dense preprocessing, or fail to effectively balance exploration and exploitation, resulting in incomplete information coverage and inefficiency. In this work, we introduce EEA, a novel video agent framework that archives exploration-exploitation balance through semantic guidance with hierarchical tree search process. EEA autonomously discovers and dynamically updates task-relevant semantic queries, and collects video frames closely matched to these queries as semantic anchors. During the tree search process, instead of uniform expansion, EEA preferentially explores semantically relevant frames while ensuring sufficient coverage within unknown segments. Moreover, EEA adaptively combines intrinsic rewards from visionlanguage models (VLMs) with semantic priors by explicitly modeling uncertainty to achieve stable and precise evaluation of video segments. Experiments across various long-video benchmarks validate the superior performance and computational efficiency of our proposed method.

Conclusion: DIRL框架通过两阶段训练显著提升了VLMs在多工具协调中的空间推理能力，并在基准测试和实际机器人操作中表现出色。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong qualitative visual understanding, but struggle with metrically precise spatial reasoning required for embodied applications. The agentic paradigm promises that VLMs can use a wide variety of tools that could augment these capabilities, such as depth estimators, segmentation models, and pose estimators. Yet it remains an open challenge how to realize this vision without solely relying on handcrafted prompting strategies or enforcing fixed, predefined tool pipelines that limit VLMs' ability to discover optimal tool-use patterns. Reinforcement Learning could overcome this gap, but has so far been limited to reasoning with a single visual tool due to the large search space in multi-tool reasoning. We introduce Double Interactive Reinforcement Learning (DIRL), a two-phase training framework where VLMs learn to coordinate multiple tools through interactive exploration and feedback. In the teaching phase, we combine demonstrations from a single tool specialist trained via interactive RL with traces from a frontier model using all tools. In the exploration phase, the model further refines multi-tool coordination through continued RL. Our model, SpaceTools, with tool-augmented spatial reasoning ability, achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial understanding benchmarks (RoboSpatial-Home, BLINK, BOP-ASK) and demonstrates reliable real-world manipulation using a 7-DOF robot as a tool. DIRL provides substantial improvements over the vanilla SFT (+12% on RoboSpatial) and RL (+16% on RoboSpatial) baselines. Project page: https://spacetools.github.io/.

Conclusion: 改进的ResNet34网络模型在脑肿瘤图像分类中不仅提高了准确性，还减少了参数数量，实现了更高精度的分类效果。

Abstract: Previously, image interpretation in radiology relied heavily on manual methods. However, manual classification of brain tumor medical images is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Even with shallow convolutional neural network models, the accuracy is not ideal. To improve the efficiency and accuracy of brain tumor image classification, this paper proposes a brain tumor classification model based on an improved ResNet34 network. This model uses the ResNet34 residual network as the backbone network and incorporates multi-scale feature extraction. It uses a multi-scale input module as the first layer of the ResNet34 network and an Inception v2 module as the residual downsampling layer. Furthermore, a channel attention mechanism module assigns different weights to different channels of the image from a channel domain perspective, obtaining more important feature information. The results after a five-fold crossover experiment show that the average classification accuracy of the improved network model is approximately 98.8%, which is not only 1% higher than ResNet34, but also only 80% of the number of parameters of the original model. Therefore, the improved network model not only improves accuracy but also reduces clutter, achieving a classification effect with fewer parameters and higher accuracy.

Abstract: Recent domain generalized semantic segmentation (DGSS) studies have achieved notable improvements by distilling semantic knowledge from Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, they overlook the semantic misalignment between visual and textual contexts, which arises due to the rigidity of a fixed context prompt learned on a single source domain. To this end, we present a novel domain generalization framework for semantic segmentation, namely Domain-aware Prompt-driven Masked Transformer (DPMFormer). Firstly, we introduce domain-aware prompt learning to facilitate semantic alignment between visual and textual cues. To capture various domain-specific properties with a single source dataset, we propose domain-aware contrastive learning along with the texture perturbation that diversifies the observable domains. Lastly, to establish a framework resilient against diverse environmental changes, we have proposed the domain-robust consistency learning which guides the model to minimize discrepancies of prediction from original and the augmented images. Through experiments and analyses, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework, which establishes a new state-of-the-art on various DGSS benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper presents a preliminary investigation into automated dance movement analysis using contemporary computer vision techniques. We propose a proof-of-concept framework that integrates YOLOv8 and v11 for dancer detection with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for precise segmentation, enabling the tracking and quantification of dancer movements in video recordings without specialized equipment or markers. Our approach identifies dancers within video frames, counts discrete dance steps, calculates spatial coverage patterns, and measures rhythm consistency across performance sequences. Testing this framework on a single 49-second recording of Ghanaian AfroBeats dance demonstrates technical feasibility, with the system achieving approximately 94% detection precision and 89% recall on manually inspected samples. The pixel-level segmentation provided by SAM, achieving approximately 83% intersection-over-union with visual inspection, enables motion quantification that captures body configuration changes beyond what bounding-box approaches can represent. Analysis of this preliminary case study indicates that the dancer classified as primary by our system executed 23% more steps with 37% higher motion intensity and utilized 42% more performance space compared to dancers classified as secondary. However, this work represents an early-stage investigation with substantial limitations including single-video validation, absence of systematic ground truth annotations, and lack of comparison with existing pose estimation methods. We present this framework to demonstrate technical feasibility, identify promising directions for quantitative dance metrics, and establish a foundation for future systematic validation studies.

Conclusion: AdaptVision通过自适应视觉令牌获取和DTPO优化方法，在多个VQA基准测试中实现了卓越性能，同时显著减少了视觉令牌的使用量。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in visual question answering tasks, but their reliance on large numbers of visual tokens introduces significant computational overhead. While existing efficient VLM approaches reduce visual tokens through fixed-ratio compression, they operate passively and lack the ability to adapt to varying task requirements. This motivates a fundamental question: Can VLMs autonomously determine the minimum number of visual tokens required for each sample? Inspired by human active vision mechanisms, we introduce AdaptVision, an efficient VLM paradigm that enables adaptive visual token acquisition through a coarse-to-fine approach. Our model initially processes compressed visual tokens from low-resolution images and selectively acquires additional visual information by invoking a bounding box tool to crop key regions when necessary. We train AdaptVision using a reinforcement learning framework that carefully balances accuracy and efficiency. Central to our approach is Decoupled Turn Policy Optimization (DTPO), which decouples the learning objective into two components: (1) tool learning, which optimizes correct tool utilization, and (2) accuracy improvement, which refines the generated responses to improve answer correctness. Based on this formulation, we further decouple advantage estimation by computing separate advantages for tokens associated with each objective. This formulation enables more effective optimization for AdaptVision compared to vanilla GRPO. Comprehensive experiments across multiple VQA benchmarks demonstrate that AdaptVision achieves superior performance while consuming substantially fewer visual tokens than state-of-the-art efficient VLM methods.

Conclusion: FloodDiffusion框架通过改进的扩散强迫方法，首次在流式运动生成任务中实现了最先进的性能，HumanML3D基准测试FID达到0.057。

Abstract: We present FloodDiffusion, a new framework for text-driven, streaming human motion generation. Given time-varying text prompts, FloodDiffusion generates text-aligned, seamless motion sequences with real-time latency. Unlike existing methods that rely on chunk-by-chunk or auto-regressive model with diffusion head, we adopt a diffusion forcing framework to model this time-series generation task under time-varying control events. We find that a straightforward implementation of vanilla diffusion forcing (as proposed for video models) fails to model real motion distributions. We demonstrate that to guarantee modeling the output distribution, the vanilla diffusion forcing must be tailored to: (i) train with a bi-directional attention instead of casual attention; (ii) implement a lower triangular time scheduler instead of a random one; (iii) utilize a continues time-varying way to introduce text conditioning. With these improvements, we demonstrate in the first time that the diffusion forcing-based framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the streaming motion generation task, reaching an FID of 0.057 on the HumanML3D benchmark. Models, code, and weights are available. https://shandaai.github.io/FloodDiffusion/

TL;DR: PULSE 是一个统一心脏图像分析多任务（分割、分类、报告生成）的框架，基于自监督表示和复合监督策略，具备跨模态泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏图像分析目前分散在不同任务中（如解剖分割、疾病分类、临床报告生成），缺乏统一框架且难以跨模态泛化。PULSE 旨在通过单一架构整合这些任务并提升泛化能力。

Method: PULSE 是一个基于自监督表示的多任务视觉语言框架，通过复合监督策略优化，结合区域重叠学习、像素级分类和边界感知 IoU 细化。多尺度标记重建解码器支持解剖分割，共享全局表示支持疾病分类和临床文本生成。

Result: PULSE 能够学习任务不变的心脏先验知识，跨数据集和模态表现稳健，且仅需少量监督即可适应新成像模态。

Conclusion: PULSE 框架通过多任务学习和自监督表示，成功统一了心脏图像分析的多个任务，并展现出跨数据集和成像模态的强泛化能力，为可扩展的心脏分析基础框架迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Cardiac image analysis remains fragmented across tasks: anatomical segmentation, disease classification, and grounded clinical report generation are typically handled by separate networks trained under different data regimes. No existing framework unifies these objectives within a single architecture while retaining generalization across imaging modalities and datasets. We introduce PULSE, a multi-task vision-language framework built on self-supervised representations and optimized through a composite supervision strategy that balances region overlap learning, pixel wise classification fidelity, and boundary aware IoU refinement. A multi-scale token reconstruction decoder enables anatomical segmentation, while shared global representations support disease classification and clinically grounded text output allowing the model to transition from pixels to structures and finally clinical reasoning within one architecture. Unlike prior task-specific pipelines, PULSE learns task-invariant cardiac priors, generalizes robustly across datasets, and can be adapted to new imaging modalities with minimal supervision. This moves the field closer to a scalable, foundation style cardiac analysis framework.

Conclusion: OpenTrack3D通过视觉-空间跟踪器和多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）的结合，显著提升了3D实例分割的泛化能力和准确性，尤其在处理复杂用户查询时表现优异。

Abstract: Generalizing open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) to diverse, unstructured, and mesh-free environments is crucial for robotics and AR/VR, yet remains a significant challenge. We attribute this to two key limitations of existing methods: (1) proposal generation relies on dataset-specific proposal networks or mesh-based superpoints, rendering them inapplicable in mesh-free scenarios and limiting generalization to novel scenes; and (2) the weak textual reasoning of CLIP-based classifiers, which struggle to recognize compositional and functional user queries. To address these issues, we introduce OpenTrack3D, a generalizable and accurate framework. Unlike methods that rely on pre-generated proposals, OpenTrack3D employs a novel visual-spatial tracker to construct cross-view consistent object proposals online. Given an RGB-D stream, our pipeline first leverages a 2D open-vocabulary segmenter to generate masks, which are lifted to 3D point clouds using depth. Mask-guided instance features are then extracted using DINO feature maps, and our tracker fuses visual and spatial cues to maintain instance consistency. The core pipeline is entirely mesh-free, yet we also provide an optional superpoints refinement module to further enhance performance when scene mesh is available. Finally, we replace CLIP with a multi-modal large language model (MLLM), significantly enhancing compositional reasoning for complex user queries. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks, including ScanNet200, Replica, ScanNet++, and SceneFun3D, demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization capabilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未能充分利用扩散模型中模糊过程的本质，限制了其潜力，因此提出了BlurDM以解决这一问题。

Method: BlurDM通过双扩散前向方案隐式建模模糊形成过程，并在反向生成过程中推导出双重去噪和去模糊公式，从而在潜在空间中执行BlurDM，形成灵活的先验生成网络。

Result: BlurDM在四个基准数据集上显著且持续地提升了现有去模糊方法的性能。

Conclusion: BlurDM通过将模糊形成过程无缝整合到扩散模型中，显著提升了现有去模糊方法的性能，并在四个基准数据集上取得了持续且显著的改进。

Abstract: Diffusion models show promise for dynamic scene deblurring; however, existing studies often fail to leverage the intrinsic nature of the blurring process within diffusion models, limiting their full potential. To address it, we present a Blur Diffusion Model (BlurDM), which seamlessly integrates the blur formation process into diffusion for image deblurring. Observing that motion blur stems from continuous exposure, BlurDM implicitly models the blur formation process through a dual-diffusion forward scheme, diffusing both noise and blur onto a sharp image. During the reverse generation process, we derive a dual denoising and deblurring formulation, enabling BlurDM to recover the sharp image by simultaneously denoising and deblurring, given pure Gaussian noise conditioned on the blurred image as input. Additionally, to efficiently integrate BlurDM into deblurring networks, we perform BlurDM in the latent space, forming a flexible prior generation network for deblurring. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BlurDM significantly and consistently enhances existing deblurring methods on four benchmark datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIQ-H 是首个评估 VLM 在动态视觉退化条件下鲁棒性的基准，揭示了现有模型在时间一致性和错误恢复方面的不足，并提出了一种高效的伪地面真值生成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 VLM 基准测试集中在静态、高质量图像上，忽略了时间退化和错误传播这一关键故障模式，而瞬态视觉损坏会导致幻觉在后续帧中持续存在。

Method: 提出了 DIQ-H 基准，应用基于物理的视觉退化（如运动模糊、传感器噪声和压缩伪影），并通过多轮问答任务测量幻觉持续性、错误恢复和时间一致性。此外，提出了 Uncertainty-Guided Iterative Refinement (UIR) 方法，利用轻量级 VLM 和不确定性过滤生成可靠的伪地面真值。

Result: 实验表明，16 种最先进的 VLM 存在显著的鲁棒性差距：即使是 GPT-4o 这样的先进模型，恢复率仅为 78.5%，而开源模型的时间一致性表现低于 60%。UIR 方法实现了 15.3% 的准确率提升。

Conclusion: DIQ-H 提供了一个全面的平台，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLM）在现实世界部署中的可靠性，揭示了现有模型在动态视觉退化条件下的显著鲁棒性差距。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) deployed in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving must handle continuous visual streams under imperfect conditions. However, existing benchmarks focus on static, high-quality images and ignore temporal degradation and error propagation, which are critical failure modes where transient visual corruption induces hallucinations that persist across subsequent frames. We introduce DIQ-H, the first benchmark for evaluating VLM robustness under dynamic visual degradation in temporal sequences. DIQ-H applies physics-based corruptions including motion blur, sensor noise, and compression artifacts, and measures hallucination persistence, error recovery, and temporal consistency through multi-turn question-answering tasks. To enable scalable annotation, we propose Uncertainty-Guided Iterative Refinement (UIR), which generates reliable pseudo-ground-truth using lightweight VLMs with uncertainty filtering, achieving a 15.3 percent accuracy improvement. Experiments on 16 state-of-the-art VLMs reveal substantial robustness gaps: even advanced models such as GPT-4o achieve only a 78.5 percent recovery rate, while open-source models struggle with temporal consistency at less than 60 percent. DIQ-H provides a comprehensive platform for evaluating VLM reliability in real-world deployments.

TL;DR: 本研究分析T2I扩散模型中随机性的影响，提出文本嵌入扰动方法，通过频率域分析优化生成多样性与质量，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索T2I扩散模型中随机性（如噪声）对方法性能的影响，并研究一种新的随机性形式——文本嵌入扰动，以补充现有随机性的局限性。

Method: 提出两步关键设计：(1) 引入基于步骤的文本嵌入扰动，结合频率引导的噪声调度与空间噪声扰动；(2) 根据频率特定贡献和扰动容忍度选择性调整扰动强度。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现出显著改进，且几乎不增加计算负担。

Conclusion: 通过结合文本嵌入扰动与空间噪声，本研究显著提升了生成多样性和质量，且无需额外计算成本。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) aims to achieve better results by increasing random sampling and evaluating samples based on rules and metrics. However, in text-to-image(T2I) diffusion models, most related works focus on search strategies and reward models, yet the impact of the stochastic characteristic of noise in T2I diffusion models on the method's performance remains unexplored. In this work, we analyze the effects of randomness in T2I diffusion models and explore a new format of randomness for TTS: text embedding perturbation, which couples with existing randomness like SDE-injected noise to enhance generative diversity and quality. We start with a frequency-domain analysis of these formats of randomness and their impact on generation, and find that these two randomness exhibit complementary behavior in the frequency domain: spatial noise favors low-frequency components (early steps), while text embedding perturbation enhances high-frequency details (later steps), thereby compensating for the potential limitations of spatial noise randomness in high-frequency manipulation. Concurrently, text embedding demonstrates varying levels of tolerance to perturbation across different dimensions of the generation process. Specifically, our method consists of two key designs: (1) Introducing step-based text embedding perturbation, combining frequency-guided noise schedules with spatial noise perturbation. (2) Adapting the perturbation intensity selectively based on their frequency-specific contributions to generation and tolerance to perturbation. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into existing TTS methods and demonstrates significant improvements on multiple benchmarks with almost no additional computation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在视觉和文本信息整合方面展现了潜力，但其在地图解读方面的能力尚未被充分探索，而地图理解在导航、地理搜索和城市规划等实际应用中至关重要。

Method: 研究团队创建了包含2000多个样本的CartoMapQA数据集，每个样本包括地图、问题（开放式或多选）和真实答案，覆盖了地图解读的低、中、高三个层次技能。

Result: 对开源和专有LVLMs的评估显示，模型在地图特定语义理解、地理空间推理和OCR相关错误方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: CartoMapQA作为一个专门设计的基准测试，为评估视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在地图理解方面的能力提供了有价值的工具，揭示了模型在地图特定语义、地理空间推理和OCR相关错误方面的挑战，为未来模型改进提供了方向。

Abstract: The rise of Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) has unlocked new possibilities for seamlessly integrating visual and textual information. However, their ability to interpret cartographic maps remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce CartoMapQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LVLMs' understanding of cartographic maps through question-answering tasks. The dataset includes over 2000 samples, each composed of a cartographic map, a question (with open-ended or multiple-choice answers), and a ground-truth answer. These tasks span key low-, mid- and high-level map interpretation skills, including symbol recognition, embedded information extraction, scale interpretation, and route-based reasoning. Our evaluation of both open-source and proprietary LVLMs reveals persistent challenges: models frequently struggle with map-specific semantics, exhibit limited geospatial reasoning, and are prone to Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-related errors. By isolating these weaknesses, CartoMapQA offers a valuable tool for guiding future improvements in LVLM architectures. Ultimately, it supports the development of models better equipped for real-world applications that depend on robust and reliable map understanding, such as navigation, geographic search, and urban planning.

Method: DIG框架采用训练无关的帧选择策略，对全局查询使用高效均匀采样，对局部查询激活专用管道提取相关帧。

Conclusion: DIG框架通过根据查询类型自适应选择帧策略，显著提升了长视频理解的性能，尤其是在处理局部查询时表现优异。

Abstract: The application of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to long-form video understanding is constrained by limited context lengths and the computationally prohibitive cost of processing dense video tokens. Consequently, recent research has focused on query-aware frame selection, methods that often incur significant computational overhead. This paper challenges the assumption that such complex search mechanisms are universally necessary. We first identify and validate a query typology distinguishing between global query and localized query. We demonstrate that while uniform sampling is both effective and efficient for global queries, localized queries indeed necessitate query-aware selection for optimal performance. Building on this insight, we propose DIG, a training-free frame selection framework that adapts its strategy based on the query type. Specifically,DIG employs efficient uniform sampling for global queries while activating a specialized pipeline to extract query-relevant frames for localized queries. Experiments on three long-form video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that DIG consistently outperforms existing baselines and robustly improves LMM performance, even when scaling the input frame count to 256.

Conclusion: GAOT框架通过结合扩散模型和超图学习，成功实现了从文本提示生成3D可动关节对象，并在PartNet-Mobility数据集上展现了优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Articulated object generation has seen increasing advancements, yet existing models often lack the ability to be conditioned on text prompts. To address the significant gap between textual descriptions and 3D articulated object representations, we propose GAOT, a three-phase framework that generates articulated objects from text prompts, leveraging diffusion models and hypergraph learning in a three-step process. First, we fine-tune a point cloud generation model to produce a coarse representation of objects from text prompts. Given the inherent connection between articulated objects and graph structures, we design a hypergraph-based learning method to refine these coarse representations, representing object parts as graph vertices. Finally, leveraging a diffusion model, the joints of articulated objects-represented as graph edges-are generated based on the object parts. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on the PartNet-Mobility dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving superior performance over previous methods.

Conclusion: 研究表明，尽管可以将草图视为序列并使用传统的位置编码进行建模，但绝对坐标始终优于相对坐标。此外，非自回归解码器优于自回归解码器。时间的重要性取决于所考虑的顺序和评估的任务。

Abstract: Sketches are simple human hand-drawn abstractions of complex scenes and real-world objects. Although the field of sketch representation learning has advanced significantly, there is still a gap in understanding the true relevance of the temporal aspect to the quality of these representations. This work investigates whether it is indeed justifiable to treat sketches as sequences, as well as which internal orders play a more relevant role. The results indicate that, although the use of traditional positional encodings is valid for modeling sketches as sequences, absolute coordinates consistently outperform relative ones. Furthermore, non-autoregressive decoders outperform their autoregressive counterparts. Finally, the importance of temporality was shown to depend on both the order considered and the task evaluated.

Conclusion: GLASTE模型通过结合全局和局部信息，有效解决了STE任务中的不一致性和长度不敏感问题，实验证明其在定量和定性结果上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Scene Text Editing (STE) involves replacing text in a scene image with new target text while preserving both the original text style and background texture. Existing methods suffer from two major challenges: inconsistency and length-insensitivity. They often fail to maintain coherence between the edited local patch and the surrounding area, and they struggle to handle significant differences in text length before and after editing. To tackle these challenges, we propose an end-to-end framework called Global-Local Aware Scene Text Editing (GLASTE), which simultaneously incorporates high-level global contextual information along with delicate local features. Specifically, we design a global-local combination structure, joint global and local losses, and enhance text image features to ensure consistency in text style within local patches while maintaining harmony between local and global areas. Additionally, we express the text style as a vector independent of the image size, which can be transferred to target text images of various sizes. We use an affine fusion to fill target text images into the editing patch while maintaining their aspect ratio unchanged. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that our GLASTE model outperforms previous methods in both quantitative metrics and qualitative results and effectively mitigates the two challenges.

Conclusion: PSA通过引入多级池化的KV表示，有效减少了高稀疏性下的信息损失，同时在计算效率和质量之间取得了优越的平衡。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms are the core of foundation models, but their quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for scaling. This challenge has driven the development of efficient attention mechanisms, with sparsity emerging as the dominant paradigm. Current methods typically retain or discard entire key-value blocks with binary masks, resulting in substantial information loss under high sparsity. To mitigate this gap, we present Pyramid Sparse Attention (PSA), a versatile module applicable to both video understanding and generation tasks. Instead of binary masking, PSA introduces multi-level pooled KV representations, enabling finer mask granularity. Specifically, each query block dynamically allocates lower pooling levels to critical KV blocks and higher levels to less important ones, creating an informative interpolation between full retention and complete pruning. This design, analogous to fixed-point quantization and classical feature pyramid networks in computer vision, effectively mitigates information loss while preserving computational efficiency under a low compute budget. It works with a native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages decoupled block-tile design to ensure efficient execution. Across video understanding and generation benchmarks, PSA preserves contextual information and visual fidelity, consistently outperforming or achieving comparable performance over existing sparse attention baselines with superior efficiency-quality trade-offs.

Conclusion: UniComp框架通过信息唯一性驱动的压缩方法，在有限计算预算下显著提升了视频表示的信息保真度，优于现有压缩方法。

Abstract: Distinct from attention-based compression methods, this paper presents an information uniqueness driven video compression framework, termed UniComp, which aims to maximize the information fidelity of video representations under constrained computational budgets. Starting from the information-theoretic perspective, we formulate the vision compression as an optimization problem that minimizes conditional entropy (reconstruction error) between retained and full tokens. To achieve this, we introduce the notion of information uniqueness to measure intrinsic redundancy among tokens to link with reconstruction error. Based on uniqueness, we design three modules-Frame Group Fusion, Token Allocation, and Spatial Dynamic Compression-that progressively perform semantic frame grouping, adaptive resource allocation, and fine-grained spatial compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniComp consistently outperforms existing compression methods in preserving essential visual tokens under limited computational budgets, highlighting the pivotal role of information uniqueness in token compression efficacy.

Method: 论文采用了跨染色对比学习（CSCL）框架，包括两个阶段：1）通过轻量级适配器进行补丁级别的对比对齐，提升H&E特征与IHC特征的兼容性；2）通过多实例学习（MIL）进行切片级别的表征学习，结合跨染色注意力融合模块和全局对齐模块，整合不同染色的特征并保持切片级别表征的一致性。

Result: 实验结果表明，CSCL框架在癌症亚型分类、IHC生物标志物状态分类和生存预测等任务中均取得了显著性能提升，生成了高质量且可迁移的H&E切片级别表征。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种名为CSCL的两阶段预训练框架，通过跨染色对比学习和全局对齐模块，显著提升了H&E切片图像的表征质量，并在癌症亚型分类、IHC生物标志物状态分类和生存预测等任务中取得了稳定的性能提升。

Abstract: Universal, transferable whole-slide image (WSI) representations are central to computational pathology. Incorporating multiple markers (e.g., immunohistochemistry, IHC) alongside H&E enriches H&E-based features with diverse, biologically meaningful information. However, progress is limited by the scarcity of well-aligned multi-stain datasets. Inter-stain misalignment shifts corresponding tissue across slides, hindering consistent patch-level features and degrading slide-level embeddings. To address this, we curated a slide-level aligned, five-stain dataset (H&E, HER2, KI67, ER, PGR) to enable paired H&E-IHC learning and robust cross-stain representation. Leveraging this dataset, we propose Cross-Stain Contrastive Learning (CSCL), a two-stage pretraining framework with a lightweight adapter trained using patch-wise contrastive alignment to improve the compatibility of H&E features with corresponding IHC-derived contextual cues, and slide-level representation learning with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), which uses a cross-stain attention fusion module to integrate stain-specific patch features and a cross-stain global alignment module to enforce consistency among slide-level embeddings across different stains. Experiments on cancer subtype classification, IHC biomarker status classification, and survival prediction show consistent gains, yielding high-quality, transferable H&E slide-level representations.

Motivation: 解决在线调查和流程中区分人类与自动化系统的需求。

Method: 利用随机黑白像素纹理背景中隐藏的数字，通过运动和尺度的差异使数字对人类可见，但对算法无效。

Result: 初步评估显示，先进的多模态模型无法识别隐藏数字，而人类参与者成功率高（99.5%），且完成时间短（平均10.7秒）。

Conclusion: DOT-BI是一种有效区分人类和自动化系统的快速方法，通过人类对运动的感知实现，且对用户体验无负面影响。

Abstract: We propose the Dynamic Optical Test for Bot Identification (DOT-BI): a quick and easy method that uses human perception of motion to differentiate between human respondents and automated systems in surveys and online processes. In DOT-BI, a 'hidden' number is displayed with the same random black-and-white pixel texture as its background. Only the difference in motion and scale between the number and the background makes the number perceptible to humans across frames, while frame-by-frame algorithmic processing yields no meaningful signal. We conducted two preliminary assessments. Firstly, state-of-the-art, video-capable, multimodal models (GPT-5-Thinking and Gemini 2.5 Pro) fail to extract the correct value, even when given explicit instructions about the mechanism. Secondly, in an online survey (n=182), 99.5% (181/182) of participants solved the task, with an average end-to-end completion time of 10.7 seconds; a supervised lab study (n=39) found no negative effects on perceived ease-of-use or completion time relative to a control. We release code to generate tests and 100+ pre-rendered variants to facilitate adoption in surveys and online processes.

Method: BBF框架通过增强输入设计以灵活处理多模态条件（如文本、音频、图像和视频），采用解耦的多模态融合机制逐步注入条件信号到DiT主干，并通过渐进式多阶段训练范式动态调整数据采样和损失权重。

Conclusion: BBF提出了一种统一的视频帧插值框架，能够在多通道条件下（如音频/视觉语义）实现卓越的插值效果，并在通用插值和音频视觉同步插值任务中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Handling fast, complex, and highly non-linear motion patterns has long posed challenges for video frame interpolation. Although recent diffusion-based approaches improve upon traditional optical-flow-based methods, they still struggle to cover diverse application scenarios and often fail to produce sharp, temporally consistent frames in fine-grained motion tasks such as audio-visual synchronized interpolation. To address these limitations, we introduce BBF (Beyond Boundary Frames), a context-aware video frame interpolation framework, which could be guided by audio/visual semantics. First, we enhance the input design of the interpolation model so that it can flexibly handle multiple conditional modalities, including text, audio, images, and video. Second, we propose a decoupled multimodal fusion mechanism that sequentially injects different conditional signals into a DiT backbone. Finally, to maintain the generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt a progressive multi-stage training paradigm, where the start-end frame difference embedding is used to dynamically adjust both the data sampling and the loss weighting. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BBF outperforms specialized state-of-the-art methods on both generic interpolation and audio-visual synchronized interpolation tasks, establishing a unified framework for video frame interpolation under coordinated multi-channel conditioning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RNA反向折叠问题是RNA设计中的关键挑战，其复杂性源于序列与结构之间的复杂关系。本文旨在提出一种新框架，利用超图来解决这一挑战。

Method: HyperRNA模型采用编码器-解码器架构，包含预处理、编码和解码三个阶段。预处理阶段基于3-bead粗粒度表示构建RNA骨架的图结构；编码阶段通过注意力嵌入模块和基于超图的编码器捕获高阶依赖和复杂生物分子相互作用；解码阶段以自回归方式生成RNA序列。

Result: 在PDBBind和RNAsolo数据集上的实验表明，HyperRNA在RNA序列生成和RNA-蛋白质复合物序列生成任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HyperRNA框架通过利用超图在RNA工程中的潜力，显著优于现有的RNA设计方法，展示了其在RNA序列生成和RNA-蛋白质复合物序列生成任务中的高效性。

Abstract: The RNA inverse folding problem, a key challenge in RNA design, involves identifying nucleotide sequences that can fold into desired secondary structures, which are critical for ensuring molecular stability and function. The inherent complexity of this task stems from the intricate relationship between sequence and structure, making it particularly challenging. In this paper, we propose a framework, named HyperRNA, a generative model with an encoder-decoder architecture that leverages hypergraphs to design RNA sequences. Specifically, our HyperRNA model consists of three main components: preprocessing, encoding and decoding.
  In the preprocessing stage, graph structures are constructed by extracting the atom coordinates of RNA backbone based on 3-bead coarse-grained representation. The encoding stage processes these graphs, capturing higher order dependencies and complex biomolecular interactions using an attention embedding module and a hypergraph-based encoder. Finally, the decoding stage generates the RNA sequence in an autoregressive manner. We conducted quantitative and qualitative experiments on the PDBBind and RNAsolo datasets to evaluate the inverse folding task for RNA sequence generation and RNA-protein complex sequence generation. The experimental results demonstrate that HyperRNA not only outperforms existing RNA design methods but also highlights the potential of leveraging hypergraphs in RNA engineering.

TL;DR: CloseUpAvatar通过动态纹理切换，在广角相机运动下保持高质量渲染，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在广角相机运动时难以保持近景渲染质量，因此需要一种能适应不同相机距离的渲染方法。

Method: CloseUpAvatar使用两组可学习纹理（低频和高频细节），根据相机距离自动切换纹理细节，以优化渲染质量。

Result: 在ActorsHQ数据集上的实验表明，CloseUpAvatar在广角相机位置下渲染质量更高，且保持高帧率。

Conclusion: CloseUpAvatar通过动态调整纹理细节，在保持高帧率的同时，实现了在更广泛相机视角下的高质量渲染，优于现有方法。

Abstract: We present a CloseUpAvatar - a novel approach for articulated human avatar representation dealing with more general camera motions, while preserving rendering quality for close-up views. CloseUpAvatar represents an avatar as a set of textured planes with two sets of learnable textures for low and high-frequency detail. The method automatically switches to high-frequency textures only for cameras positioned close to the avatar's surface and gradually reduces their impact as the camera moves farther away. Such parametrization of the avatar enables CloseUpAvatar to adjust rendering quality based on camera distance ensuring realistic rendering across a wider range of camera orientations than previous approaches. We provide experiments using the ActorsHQ dataset with high-resolution input images. CloseUpAvatar demonstrates both qualitative and quantitative improvements over existing methods in rendering from novel wide range camera positions, while maintaining high FPS by limiting the number of required primitives.

Motivation: 现有的基于移位窗口自注意力的Vision Transformers在医学图像分割中难以有效融合局部细节与全局上下文，影响了微肿瘤和微型器官分割的效果。

Conclusion: HBFormer通过其独特的混合桥接机制和MFF解码器，在医学图像分割任务中实现了最先进的性能，特别是在微肿瘤和微型器官分割方面表现出色。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a cornerstone of modern clinical diagnostics. While Vision Transformers that leverage shifted window-based self-attention have established new benchmarks in this field, they are often hampered by a critical limitation: their localized attention mechanism struggles to effectively fuse local details with global context. This deficiency is particularly detrimental to challenging tasks such as the segmentation of microtumors and miniature organs, where both fine-grained boundary definition and broad contextual understanding are paramount. To address this gap, we propose HBFormer, a novel Hybrid-Bridge Transformer architecture. The 'Hybrid' design of HBFormer synergizes a classic U-shaped encoder-decoder framework with a powerful Swin Transformer backbone for robust hierarchical feature extraction. The core innovation lies in its 'Bridge' mechanism, a sophisticated nexus for multi-scale feature integration. This bridge is architecturally embodied by our novel Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MFF) decoder. Departing from conventional symmetric designs, the MFF decoder is engineered to fuse multi-scale features from the encoder with global contextual information. It achieves this through a synergistic combination of channel and spatial attention modules, which are constructed from a series of dilated and depth-wise convolutions. These components work in concert to create a powerful feature bridge that explicitly captures long-range dependencies and refines object boundaries with exceptional precision. Comprehensive experiments on challenging medical image segmentation datasets, including multi-organ, liver tumor, and bladder tumor benchmarks, demonstrate that HBFormer achieves state-of-the-art results, showcasing its outstanding capabilities in microtumor and miniature organ segmentation.

Motivation: 部分牙科点云常因遮挡和有限扫描视角导致大范围缺失，影响全局特征编码并迫使解码器虚构结构。

Method: 提出了一种检索增强的框架，将原型记忆库集成到标准的编码器-解码器流程中，通过置信度加权融合查询特征和检索到的原型。

Result: 在自建的Teeth3DS基准测试中，Chamfer Distance持续改善，可视化结果显示更锐利的牙尖、脊和邻接过渡。

Conclusion: 该方法通过引入可学习的原型记忆库，有效利用跨样本规律性，提高了牙科点云补全的准确性和真实性。

Abstract: Partial dental point clouds often suffer from large missing regions caused by occlusion and limited scanning views, which bias encoder-only global features and force decoders to hallucinate structures. We propose a retrieval-augmented framework for tooth completion that integrates a prototype memory into standard encoder--decoder pipelines. After encoding a partial input into a global descriptor, the model retrieves the nearest manifold prototype from a learnable memory and fuses it with the query feature through confidence-gated weighting before decoding. The memory is optimized end-to-end and self-organizes into reusable tooth-shape prototypes without requiring tooth-position labels, thereby providing structural priors that stabilize missing-region inference and free decoder capacity for detail recovery. The module is plug-and-play and compatible with common completion backbones, while keeping the same training losses. Experiments on a self-processed Teeth3DS benchmark demonstrate consistent improvements in Chamfer Distance, with visualizations showing sharper cusps, ridges, and interproximal transitions. Our approach provides a simple yet effective way to exploit cross-sample regularities for more accurate and faithful dental point-cloud completion.

Method: 采用两部分迭代优化框架：1）顺序优化，分阶段更新运动和语义字段以保持局部一致性；2）全局优化，联合优化所有属性以实现长期一致性。引入3D置信度图和自适应重采样过程以提升运动准确性，并通过迭代细化过程增强语义一致性。

Conclusion: Motion4D通过将2D先验整合到统一的4D高斯泼溅表示中，显著提升了动态场景的3D一致性和理解能力，在多种场景理解任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models for 2D vision have substantially improved the analysis of dynamic scenes from monocular videos. However, despite their strong generalization capabilities, these models often lack 3D consistency, a fundamental requirement for understanding scene geometry and motion, thereby causing severe spatial misalignment and temporal flickering in complex 3D environments. In this paper, we present Motion4D, a novel framework that addresses these challenges by integrating 2D priors from foundation models into a unified 4D Gaussian Splatting representation. Our method features a two-part iterative optimization framework: 1) Sequential optimization, which updates motion and semantic fields in consecutive stages to maintain local consistency, and 2) Global optimization, which jointly refines all attributes for long-term coherence. To enhance motion accuracy, we introduce a 3D confidence map that dynamically adjusts the motion priors, and an adaptive resampling process that inserts new Gaussians into under-represented regions based on per-pixel RGB and semantic errors. Furthermore, we enhance semantic coherence through an iterative refinement process that resolves semantic inconsistencies by alternately optimizing the semantic fields and updating prompts of SAM2. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our Motion4D significantly outperforms both 2D foundation models and existing 3D-based approaches across diverse scene understanding tasks, including point-based tracking, video object segmentation, and novel view synthesis.

TL;DR: LAMP利用LLMs将自然语言描述转化为3D轨迹，提升了视频生成的运动可控性，并构建了大规模数据集支持其方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 运动控制（指定对象动态和相机轨迹）对于构建复杂的电影场景至关重要，但现有接口仍有限。因此，需要一种能够将自然语言描述转化为明确3D轨迹的方法。

Method: LAMP定义了一个受电影摄影惯例启发的运动领域特定语言（DSL），利用LLMs的程序合成能力，从自然语言生成结构化运动程序，并确定性地映射到3D轨迹。此外，构建了一个大规模的程序化数据集，将自然文本描述与相应的运动程序和3D轨迹配对。

Conclusion: LAMP通过利用大型语言模型（LLMs）作为运动规划器，将自然语言描述转化为明确的3D轨迹，显著提升了视频生成的运动可控性和用户意图对齐，为直接从自然语言生成对象和相机运动提供了首个框架。

Abstract: Video generation has achieved remarkable progress in visual fidelity and controllability, enabling conditioning on text, layout, or motion. Among these, motion control - specifying object dynamics and camera trajectories - is essential for composing complex, cinematic scenes, yet existing interfaces remain limited. We introduce LAMP that leverages large language models (LLMs) as motion planners to translate natural language descriptions into explicit 3D trajectories for dynamic objects and (relatively defined) cameras. LAMP defines a motion domain-specific language (DSL), inspired by cinematography conventions. By harnessing program synthesis capabilities of LLMs, LAMP generates structured motion programs from natural language, which are deterministically mapped to 3D trajectories. We construct a large-scale procedural dataset pairing natural text descriptions with corresponding motion programs and 3D trajectories. Experiments demonstrate LAMP's improved performance in motion controllability and alignment with user intent compared to state-of-the-art alternatives establishing the first framework for generating both object and camera motions directly from natural language specifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 修复方法难以处理复杂伪影，LiDAR方法依赖稀疏且不完整的线索，因此需要一种基于密集且场景完整的3DGS渲染的解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：第一阶段使用相机姿态进行粗控制，第二阶段引入3DGS渲染进行细粒度视角和几何引导。此外，提出基于3DGS的跨轨迹数据整理策略，构建了ParaDrive数据集。

Result: ReCamDriving在相机可控性和结构一致性方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ReCamDriving通过两阶段训练范式和3DGS渲染的几何引导，实现了高精度的相机可控视频生成，并在ParaDrive数据集上验证了其优越性。

Abstract: We propose ReCamDriving, a purely vision-based, camera-controlled novel-trajectory video generation framework. While repair-based methods fail to restore complex artifacts and LiDAR-based approaches rely on sparse and incomplete cues, ReCamDriving leverages dense and scene-complete 3DGS renderings for explicit geometric guidance, achieving precise camera-controllable generation. To mitigate overfitting to restoration behaviors when conditioned on 3DGS renderings, ReCamDriving adopts a two-stage training paradigm: the first stage uses camera poses for coarse control, while the second stage incorporates 3DGS renderings for fine-grained viewpoint and geometric guidance. Furthermore, we present a 3DGS-based cross-trajectory data curation strategy to eliminate the train-test gap in camera transformation patterns, enabling scalable multi-trajectory supervision from monocular videos. Based on this strategy, we construct the ParaDrive dataset, containing over 110K parallel-trajectory video pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReCamDriving achieves state-of-the-art camera controllability and structural consistency.

Abstract: Although the remarkable performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) in image classification, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a critical challenge. Most existing detection methods rely on complex and poorly interpretable architectures, which compromise interpretability and generalization. To address this, we propose FeatureLens, a lightweight framework that acts as a lens to scrutinize anomalies in image features. Comprising an Image Feature Extractor (IFE) and shallow classifiers (e.g., SVM, MLP, or XGBoost) with model sizes ranging from 1,000 to 30,000 parameters, FeatureLens achieves high detection accuracy ranging from 97.8% to 99.75% in closed-set evaluation and 86.17% to 99.6% in generalization evaluation across FGSM, PGD, CW, and DAmageNet attacks, using only 51 dimensional features. By combining strong detection performance with excellent generalization, interpretability, and computational efficiency, FeatureLens offers a practical pathway toward transparent and effective adversarial defense.

Motivation: 验证视觉压缩在语言建模中的实际效用，挑战DeepSeek-OCR在光学压缩叙事中的隐含假设。

Method: 通过比较DeepSeek-OCR的视觉编码器与简单的替代方法（参数无关的均值池化和学习的分层编码器），评估其在文本重建和语言建模中的表现。

Result: 简单的替代方法在文本重建中与视觉压缩相当或更优，且在语言建模中表现优于视觉压缩，后者甚至无法超越截断方法。

Conclusion: DeepSeek-OCR的视觉压缩方法在语言建模中并未表现出优势，简单的替代方法（如均值池化和分层编码器）在相同压缩比下表现相当或更好，甚至超越视觉压缩。

Abstract: DeepSeek-OCR demonstrates that rendered text can be reconstructed with high fidelity from a small number of vision tokens. This finding has sparked excitement about vision-based context compression for language models. But the evaluation stops at reconstruction; whether these representations help language modeling remains untested. We test two assumptions implicit in the optical-compression narrative: that vision-based compression provides unique advantages for text reconstruction from compressed representations, and that DeepSeek-OCR's reconstruction results are evidence that vision-based compression will be useful for language modeling. Comparing their vision encoder against simple alternatives--parameter-free mean pooling and a learned hierarchical encoder--we find that these simple approaches match or surpass vision for reconstruction at matched compression ratios, and outperform it for language modeling--where vision-based compression fails to beat truncation. The excitement around optical context compression outpaces the evidence. Code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/ivnle/bad-autoencoding

Motivation: 尽管小图像基准（如MNIST、Fashion-MNIST和CIFAR-10）在教育、原型设计和研究中广泛使用，但在提示领域的关注较少，因此需要一种高效的适配方法。

Method: 提出了一种名为Multi-Scale Visual Prompting (MSVP)的模块，通过轻量级的1×1卷积将全局、中尺度和局部提示图与输入图像融合。

Result: MSVP在多种骨干网络（CNN和Vision Transformer）上均表现出性能提升，且参数增加不到0.02%。

Conclusion: 多尺度视觉提示（MSVP）为低分辨率图像提供了有效的归纳偏差，显著提升了CNN和Vision Transformer的性能，且计算开销极低。

Abstract: Visual prompting has recently emerged as an efficient strategy to adapt vision models using lightweight, learnable parameters injected into the input space. However, prior work mainly targets large Vision Transformers and high-resolution datasets such as ImageNet. In contrast, small-image benchmarks like MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 remain widely used in education, prototyping, and research, yet have received little attention in the context of prompting. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{Multi-Scale Visual Prompting (MSVP)}, a simple and generic module that learns a set of global, mid-scale, and local prompt maps fused with the input image via a lightweight $1 \times 1$ convolution. MSVP is backbone-agnostic, adds less than $0.02\%$ parameters, and significantly improves performance across CNN and Vision Transformer backbones.
  We provide a unified benchmark on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 using a simple CNN, ResNet-18, and a small Vision Transformer. Our method yields consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. We further include ablations on prompt scales, fusion strategies, and backbone architectures, along with qualitative analyzes using prompt visualizations and Grad-CAM. Our results demonstrate that multi-scale prompting provides an effective inductive bias even on low-resolution images.

Abstract: In this study, we present Colon-X, an open initiative aimed at advancing multimodal intelligence in colonoscopy. We begin by constructing ColonVQA, the most comprehensive multimodal dataset ever built for colonoscopy, featuring over 1.1M+ visual question answering entries across 76 clinical findings and 18 multimodal tasks. Beyond serving as a community-wide data foundation, we further investigate a critical yet underexplored transition in colonoscopy - evolving from multimodal understanding to clinical reasoning: (a) To capture the current landscape of multimodal understanding behaviors, we systematically assess the generalizability of 22 multimodal large language models and examine their reliability under human-induced perturbations. The results reveal that clinical outputs from leading MLLMs remain far from robust and trustworthy. (b) To narrow this gap, we further explore reasoning-centric intelligence tailored for colonoscopy. Specifically, we curate ColonReason, a clinically grounded reasoning dataset annotated through a multi-expert debating pipeline, and develop ColonR1, the first R1-styled model incorporating task-adaptive rewarding and gradient-stable optimization techniques. Under data-scarce conditions, our ColonR1 achieves 56.61% overall accuracy, outperforming supervised fine-tuning by 25.22%, and sets a new reasoning-enabled baseline for multimodal colonoscopy analysis.

Motivation: 扩散变换器在生成高质量图像方面表现优异，但随着模型规模增大，内存占用和推理延迟成为实际部署的挑战。现有旋转技术在扩散变换器中处理行异常值效果不佳且开销较大。

Method: 提出了ConvRot，一种基于分组旋转的量化方法，利用正则Hadamard变换（RHT）抑制行列异常值，并将复杂度从二次降至线性。在此基础上设计了ConvLinear4bit模块，集成旋转、量化、GEMM和反量化，实现无需重新训练的W4A4推理。

Conclusion: ConvRot和ConvLinear4bit方法成功解决了扩散变换器中内存占用和推理延迟的问题，实现了W4A4推理，且在保持图像质量的同时显著提升了速度和内存效率。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating high-quality images. However, as model size increases, the growing memory footprint and inference latency pose significant challenges for practical deployment. Recent studies in large language models (LLMs) show that rotation-based techniques can smooth outliers and enable 4-bit quantization, but these approaches often incur substantial overhead and struggle with row-wise outliers in diffusion transformers. To address these challenges, we propose ConvRot, a group-wise rotation-based quantization method that leverages regular Hadamard transform (RHT) to suppress both row-wise and column-wise outliers while reducing complexity from quadratic to linear. Building on this, we design ConvLinear4bit, a plug-and-play module that integrates rotation, quantization, GEMM, and dequantization, enabling W4A4 inference without retraining and preserving visual quality. Experiments on FLUX.1-dev demonstrate a 2.26$\times$ speedup and 4.05$\times$ memory reduction while maintaining image fidelity. To our knowledge, this is the first application of rotation-based quantization for plug-and-play W4A4 inference in diffusion transformers.

Motivation: 解决现有文本到3D风格化方法因依赖2D图像编辑器而导致的逐资产优化耗时和多视角不一致问题，满足大规模生产需求。

Method: 通过从空间分组的3D高斯中学习解耦的几何和外观潜在空间，并结合潜在扩散模型进行文本驱动的编辑。

Result: GaussianBlender 在评估中表现出即时、高保真、几何保持且多视角一致的风格化效果，超越了需要测试时优化的方法。

Conclusion: GaussianBlender 提供了一种即时、高保真、几何保持且多视角一致的3D风格化方法，超越了需要逐实例优化的现有方法，实现了大规模、实用的3D风格化。

Abstract: 3D stylization is central to game development, virtual reality, and digital arts, where the demand for diverse assets calls for scalable methods that support fast, high-fidelity manipulation. Existing text-to-3D stylization methods typically distill from 2D image editors, requiring time-intensive per-asset optimization and exhibiting multi-view inconsistency due to the limitations of current text-to-image models, which makes them impractical for large-scale production. In this paper, we introduce GaussianBlender, a pioneering feed-forward framework for text-driven 3D stylization that performs edits instantly at inference. Our method learns structured, disentangled latent spaces with controlled information sharing for geometry and appearance from spatially-grouped 3D Gaussians. A latent diffusion model then applies text-conditioned edits on these learned representations. Comprehensive evaluations show that GaussianBlender not only delivers instant, high-fidelity, geometry-preserving, multi-view consistent stylization, but also surpasses methods that require per-instance test-time optimization - unlocking practical, democratized 3D stylization at scale.

Result: 文章概述了主动视觉感知的潜力、当前研究进展以及需要解决的问题。

Conclusion: 本文总结了主动视觉感知的潜力和当前研究进展，同时指出了实现更广泛采用所需克服的障碍。

Abstract: Active visual perception refers to the ability of a system to dynamically engage with its environment through sensing and action, allowing it to modify its behavior in response to specific goals or uncertainties. Unlike passive systems that rely solely on visual data, active visual perception systems can direct attention, move sensors, or interact with objects to acquire more informative data. This approach is particularly powerful in complex environments where static sensing methods may not provide sufficient information. Active visual perception plays a critical role in numerous applications, including robotics, autonomous vehicles, human-computer interaction, and surveillance systems. However, despite its significant promise, there are several challenges that need to be addressed, including real-time processing of complex visual data, decision-making in dynamic environments, and integrating multimodal sensory inputs. This paper explores both the opportunities and challenges inherent in active visual perception, providing a comprehensive overview of its potential, current research, and the obstacles that must be overcome for broader adoption.

TL;DR: SUSS是一种新型感知相似性评分方法，通过结构化多元正态分布建模图像，结合生成式自监督训练，实现了与人类感知判断的高度一致性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有深度感知损失（如LPIPS）依赖复杂非线性特征且缺乏可解释性，以及手工设计方法（如SSIM）无法捕捉关键感知属性的问题。

Method: SUSS通过一组感知组件建模图像，每个组件由结构化多元正态分布表示，并以生成式自监督方式训练，赋予人类不可察觉的增强高似然。最终评分是组件对数概率的加权和，权重从人类感知数据集中学习。

Result: SUSS与人类感知判断高度一致，对不同失真类型表现出强大的感知校准能力，并能提供局部可解释的相似性评估。

Conclusion: SUSS作为一种新型的感知相似性评分方法，不仅在人类感知判断上表现出高度一致性，还能提供可解释的局部相似性评估，同时在成像任务中展现出稳定的优化行为和竞争性表现。

Abstract: Perceptual similarity scores that align with human vision are critical for both training and evaluating computer vision models. Deep perceptual losses, such as LPIPS, achieve good alignment but rely on complex, highly non-linear discriminative features with unknown invariances, while hand-crafted measures like SSIM are interpretable but miss key perceptual properties.
  We introduce the Structured Uncertainty Similarity Score (SUSS); it models each image through a set of perceptual components, each represented by a structured multivariate Normal distribution. These are trained in a generative, self-supervised manner to assign high likelihood to human-imperceptible augmentations. The final score is a weighted sum of component log-probabilities with weights learned from human perceptual datasets. Unlike feature-based methods, SUSS learns image-specific linear transformations of residuals in pixel space, enabling transparent inspection through decorrelated residuals and sampling.
  SUSS aligns closely with human perceptual judgments, shows strong perceptual calibration across diverse distortion types, and provides localized, interpretable explanations of its similarity assessments. We further demonstrate stable optimization behavior and competitive performance when using SUSS as a perceptual loss for downstream imaging tasks.

Result: 在基准数据集上的大量实验表明，DMDL能够实现模态不变特征学习和更通用的模型。

Conclusion: DMDL框架通过模型和优化层面的双重去偏学习，有效减少了模态偏差，实现了模态不变特征学习和更通用的模型。

Abstract: Two-stage learning pipeline has achieved promising results in unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (USL-VI-ReID). It first performs single-modality learning and then operates cross-modality learning to tackle the modality discrepancy. Although promising, this pipeline inevitably introduces modality bias: modality-specific cues learned in the single-modality training naturally propagate into the following cross-modality learning, impairing identity discrimination and generalization. To address this issue, we propose a Dual-level Modality Debiasing Learning (DMDL) framework that implements debiasing at both the model and optimization levels. At the model level, we propose a Causality-inspired Adjustment Intervention (CAI) module that replaces likelihood-based modeling with causal modeling, preventing modality-induced spurious patterns from being introduced, leading to a low-biased model. At the optimization level, a Collaborative Bias-free Training (CBT) strategy is introduced to interrupt the propagation of modality bias across data, labels, and features by integrating modality-specific augmentation, label refinement, and feature alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DMDL could enable modality-invariant feature learning and a more generalized model.

Motivation: 当前MLLMs在图像方向变化或自然损坏时表现脆弱，需更鲁棒的工具推理方法。

Method: 采用两阶段训练方法：首先通过监督微调（SFT）在高质量数据集上进行训练，随后通过强化学习（RL）结合密集过程奖励函数优化工具使用策略。

Conclusion: CodeVision框架通过代码作为通用接口，显著提升了MLLMs在图像操作中的性能和鲁棒性，并展现出灵活的工具组合和错误恢复能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that think with images can interactively use tools to reason about visual inputs, but current approaches often rely on a narrow set of tools with limited real-world necessity and scalability. In this work, we first reveal a critical and previously overlooked weakness: even state-of-the-art MLLMs are surprisingly brittle, showing significant performance degradation on images with simple orientation changes or natural corruptions, underscoring the need for more robust tool-based reasoning. To address this, we propose CodeVision, a flexible and scalable code-as-tool framework where the model generates code as a universal interface to invoke any image operation, moving beyond fixed tool registries. We train our model using a two-stage methodology, beginning with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on a high-quality dataset curated for complex, multi-turn tool composition and error recovery, followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a novel and dense process reward function to encourage strategic and efficient tool use. To facilitate this research, we construct new SFT and RL datasets and introduce a challenging new benchmark suite designed to rigorously evaluate robustness to orientation changes and multi-tool reasoning. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series show that our approach significantly improves model performance and fosters emergent capabilities such as flexible tool composition, efficient chained execution, and robust error recovery from runtime feedback.

TL;DR: SelfDebias是一种无监督测试时去偏方法，通过语义聚类引导扩散过程，有效减少T2I扩散模型中的偏见，保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的T2I扩散模型由于训练数据中的偏见，会生成刻板印象的输出。SelfDebias旨在无需人工标注数据或外部分类器的情况下自动识别并减少这些偏见。

Method: SelfDebias通过识别图像编码器嵌入空间中的语义聚类，并在推理过程中使用这些聚类来引导扩散过程，最小化输出分布与均匀分布之间的KL散度。

Result: 实验表明，SelfDebias能够泛化到不同的提示和扩散模型架构，有效减少关键人口统计维度的偏见，并处理抽象概念的偏见问题。

Conclusion: SelfDebias是一种有效的无监督测试时去偏方法，适用于任何使用UNet作为噪声预测器的扩散模型，能够在不牺牲生成图像视觉保真度的情况下减少偏见。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved widespread success due to their ability to generate high-resolution, photorealistic images. These models are trained on large-scale datasets, like LAION-5B, often scraped from the internet. However, since this data contains numerous biases, the models inherently learn and reproduce them, resulting in stereotypical outputs. We introduce SelfDebias, a fully unsupervised test-time debiasing method applicable to any diffusion model that uses a UNet as its noise predictor. SelfDebias identifies semantic clusters in an image encoder's embedding space and uses these clusters to guide the diffusion process during inference, minimizing the KL divergence between the output distribution and the uniform distribution. Unlike supervised approaches, SelfDebias does not require human-annotated datasets or external classifiers trained for each generated concept. Instead, it is designed to automatically identify semantic modes. Extensive experiments show that SelfDebias generalizes across prompts and diffusion model architectures, including both conditional and unconditional models. It not only effectively debiases images along key demographic dimensions while maintaining the visual fidelity of the generated images, but also more abstract concepts for which identifying biases is also challenging.

Motivation: 解决VAR模型中并行令牌采样可能导致的结构错误，优化生成图像质量。

Method: 提出了Latent Scale Rejection Sampling (LSRS)，通过在推理过程中逐步细化潜在尺度中的令牌图，并使用轻量级评分模型评估候选令牌图，选择高质量图指导后续尺度生成。

Result: LSRS显著提升了VAR的生成质量，仅增加1%推理时间即可将FID分数从1.95降至1.78；增加15%推理时间可进一步降至1.66。

Conclusion: LSRS为VAR模型提供了一种高效的测试时扩展解决方案，显著提升了生成质量，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) modeling approach for image generation proposes autoregressive processing across hierarchical scales, decoding multiple tokens per scale in parallel. This method achieves high-quality generation while accelerating synthesis. However, parallel token sampling within a scale may lead to structural errors, resulting in suboptimal generated images. To mitigate this, we propose Latent Scale Rejection Sampling (LSRS), a method that progressively refines token maps in the latent scale during inference to enhance VAR models. Our method uses a lightweight scoring model to evaluate multiple candidate token maps sampled at each scale, selecting the high-quality map to guide subsequent scale generation. By prioritizing early scales critical for structural coherence, LSRS effectively mitigates autoregressive error accumulation while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that LSRS significantly improves VAR's generation quality with minimal additional computational overhead. For the VAR-d30 model, LSRS increases the inference time by merely 1% while reducing its FID score from 1.95 to 1.78. When the inference time is increased by 15%, the FID score can be further reduced to 1.66. LSRS offers an efficient test-time scaling solution for enhancing VAR-based generation.

Method: 结合数学变换，提出了一种更稳健的方法，硬件需求最小化，相对地面真实值的偏差小于5%。

Result: 在14名志愿者的视频（总时长超过2小时30分钟）上测试，平均绝对误差为每分钟0.57次呼吸，优于先前工作。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的呼吸率测量方法在受试者运动引起的失真方面表现更稳健，能够在不受受试者行为显著限制的情况下远程测量呼吸率。

Abstract: Proliferation of cheap and accessible cameras makes it possible to measure a subject's breath rate from video footage alone. Recent works on this topic have proposed a variety of approaches for accurately measuring human breath rate, however they are either tested in near-ideal conditions, or produce results that are not sufficiently accurate. The present study proposes a more robust method to measure breath rate in humans with minimal hardware requirements using a combination of mathematical transforms with a relative deviation from the ground truth of less than 5%. The method was tested on videos taken from 14 volunteers with a total duration of over 2 hours 30 minutes. The obtained results were compared to reference data and the average mean absolute error was found to be at 0.57 respirations per minute, which is noticeably better than the results from previous works. The breath rate measurement method proposed in the present article is more resistant to distortions caused by subject movement and thus allows one to remotely measure the subject's breath rate without any significant limitations on the subject's behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Unet架构在空间分辨率下采样时倍增通道数，导致内存占用大、训练批次小和推理延迟高。通道剪枝虽能压缩Unet，但优化耗时且泛化性差。研究发现最终结构是关键因素，而非剪枝的通道选择策略。

Method: 提出了一种精简的Unet架构（LUnet），采用紧凑的扁平层次结构，通道数不随分辨率减半而倍增。通过评估公开MRI数据集和两个内部CT数据集，验证了其有效性。

Result: LUnet在参数数量大幅减少的情况下，性能与传统Unet和剪枝网络相当。跳过连接允许大幅减少Unet瓶颈通道，而标准编码器-解码器架构需增加瓶颈通道以传播信息。

Conclusion: LUnet，一种具有固定架构且参数数量减少30倍以上的精简Unet，在性能上与传统Unet和数据自适应剪枝网络相当，甚至优于标准Unet。

Abstract: Unet and its variations have been standard in semantic image segmentation, especially for computer assisted radiology. Current Unet architectures iteratively downsample spatial resolution while increasing channel dimensions to preserve information content. Such a structure demands a large memory footprint, limiting training batch sizes and increasing inference latency. Channel pruning compresses Unet architecture without accuracy loss, but requires lengthy optimization and may not generalize across tasks and datasets. By investigating Unet pruning, we hypothesize that the final structure is the crucial factor, not the channel selection strategy of pruning. Based on our observations, we propose a lean Unet architecture (LUnet) with a compact, flat hierarchy where channels are not doubled as resolution is halved. We evaluate on a public MRI dataset allowing comparable reporting, as well as on two internal CT datasets. We show that a state-of-the-art pruning solution (STAMP) mainly prunes from the layers with the highest number of channels. Comparatively, simply eliminating a random channel at the pruning-identified layer or at the largest layer achieves similar or better performance. Our proposed LUnet with fixed architectures and over 30 times fewer parameters achieves performance comparable to both conventional Unet counterparts and data-adaptively pruned networks. The proposed lean Unet with constant channel count across layers requires far fewer parameters while achieving performance superior to standard Unet for the same total number of parameters. Skip connections allow Unet bottleneck channels to be largely reduced, unlike standard encoder-decoder architectures requiring increased bottleneck channels for information propagation.

Abstract: Human action recognition (HAR) in videos has garnered widespread attention due to the rich information in RGB videos. Nevertheless, existing methods for extracting deep features from RGB videos face challenges such as information redundancy, susceptibility to noise and high storage costs. To address these issues and fully harness the useful information in videos, we propose a novel heatmap pooling network (HP-Net) for action recognition from videos, which extracts information-rich, robust and concise pooled features of the human body in videos through a feedback pooling module. The extracted pooled features demonstrate obvious performance advantages over the previously obtained pose data and heatmap features from videos. In addition, we design a spatial-motion co-learning module and a text refinement modulation module to integrate the extracted pooled features with other multimodal data, enabling more robust action recognition. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks namely NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, Toyota-Smarthome and UAV-Human consistently verify the effectiveness of our HP-Net, which outperforms the existing human action recognition methods.

Abstract: Prevailing Dataset Distillation (DD) methods leveraging generative models confront two fundamental limitations. First, despite pioneering the use of diffusion models in DD and delivering impressive performance, the vast majority of approaches paradoxically require a diffusion model pre-trained on the full target dataset, undermining the very purpose of DD and incurring prohibitive training costs. Second, although some methods turn to general text-to-image models without relying on such target-specific training, they suffer from a significant distributional mismatch, as the web-scale priors encapsulated in these foundation models fail to faithfully capture the target-specific semantics, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose Core Distribution Alignment (CoDA), a framework that enables effective DD using only an off-the-shelf text-to-image model. Our key idea is to first identify the "intrinsic core distribution" of the target dataset using a robust density-based discovery mechanism. We then steer the generative process to align the generated samples with this core distribution. By doing so, CoDA effectively bridges the gap between general-purpose generative priors and target semantics, yielding highly representative distilled datasets. Extensive experiments suggest that, without relying on a generative model specifically trained on the target dataset, CoDA achieves performance on par with or even superior to previous methods with such reliance across all benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K and its subsets. Notably, it establishes a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 60.4% at the 50-images-per-class (IPC) setup on ImageNet-1K. Our code is available on the project webpage: https://github.com/zzzlt422/CoDA

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注空间域建模，忽视了频率域先验，而Mamba架构在频率域特征提取方面的潜力尚未被探索。

Result: 大量实验证明了FAMamba的高效性和有效性。

Conclusion: FAMamba框架通过整合频率引导和序列建模，有效提升了恶劣天气条件下交通图像恢复的质量和效率。

Abstract: Traffic image restoration under adverse weather conditions remains a critical challenge for intelligent transportation systems. Existing methods primarily focus on spatial-domain modeling but neglect frequency-domain priors. Although the emerging Mamba architecture excels at long-range dependency modeling through patch-wise correlation analysis, its potential for frequency-domain feature extraction remains unexplored. To address this, we propose Frequency-Aware Mamba (FAMamba), a novel framework that integrates frequency guidance with sequence modeling for efficient image restoration. Our architecture consists of two key components: (1) a Dual-Branch Feature Extraction Block (DFEB) that enhances local-global interaction via bidirectional 2D frequency-adaptive scanning, dynamically adjusting traversal paths based on sub-band texture distributions; and (2) a Prior-Guided Block (PGB) that refines texture details through wavelet-based high-frequency residual learning, enabling high-quality image reconstruction with precise details. Meanwhile, we design a novel Adaptive Frequency Scanning Mechanism (AFSM) for the Mamba architecture, which enables the Mamba to achieve frequency-domain scanning across distinct subgraphs, thereby fully leveraging the texture distribution characteristics inherent in subgraph structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of FAMamba.

Conclusion: 该数据集旨在支持全球多样化人群中病理AI模型的开发和验证，填补了中东地区数据的空白。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in digital pathology. Publicly available histopathology datasets remain scarce, and those that do exist predominantly represent Western populations. Consequently, the generalizability of AI models to populations from less digitized regions, such as the Middle East, is largely unknown. This motivates the public release of our dataset to support the development and validation of pathology AI models across globally diverse populations. We present 339 whole-slide images of prostate core needle biopsies from a consecutive series of 185 patients collected in Erbil, Iraq. The slides are associated with Gleason scores and International Society of Urological Pathology grades assigned independently by three pathologists. Scanning was performed using two high-throughput scanners (Leica and Hamamatsu) and one compact scanner (Grundium). All slides were de-identified and are provided in their native formats without further conversion. The dataset enables grading concordance analyses, color normalization, and cross-scanner robustness evaluations. Data will be deposited in the Bioimage Archive (BIA) under accession code: to be announced (TBA), and released under a CC BY 4.0 license.

Motivation: 尽管基于变换器的架构在计算机视觉和NLP领域表现出色，但它们通常需要大量参数和训练数据才能达到强劲性能。本研究旨在探索小型ViT在不同训练阶段的效益。

Method: 实验了三种不同的预训练、中间微调和下游数据集及训练目标，探索它们对500万参数的小型视觉变换器的边际效益。

Result: 预训练和微调始终有助于模型性能，但效益递减；中间微调可能因任务机制差异对下游性能产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 小型视觉变换器（ViT）最适合有针对性的预训练和谨慎的数据选择，而无差别堆叠中间任务可能会浪费计算资源甚至降低性能。

Abstract: While transformer-based architectures have taken computer vision and NLP by storm, they often require a vast amount of parameters and training data to attain strong performance. In this work, we experiment with three distinct pre-training, intermediate fine-tuning, and downstream datasets and training objectives to explore their marginal benefits on a small 5M-parameter vision transformer. We find that while pre-training and fine-tuning always help our model but have diminishing returns, intermediate fine-tuning can actually show harmful impact on downstream performance, potentially due to dissimilarity in task mechanics. Taken together, our results suggest that small-scale ViTs benefit most from targeted pre-training and careful data selection, while indiscriminate stacking of intermediate tasks can waste compute and even degrade performance.

TL;DR: SSDCA模型通过结合纵向内窥镜图像，有效区分直肠癌患者的临床完全缓解和局部复发，具有高准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在直肠癌患者的观察等待（WW）随访中，通过内窥镜图像早期准确检测局部复发（LR），从而优化治疗管理并预防远处转移。

Method: 研究开发了Siamese Swin Transformer with Dual Cross-Attention (SSDCA)模型，结合纵向内窥镜图像，利用预训练的Swin transformer提取领域无关特征，并通过双交叉注意力机制增强特征提取，无需图像空间对齐。

Result: SSDCA在测试集上表现出最佳平衡准确度（81.76% ± 0.04）、敏感性（90.07% ± 0.08）和特异性（72.86% ± 0.05），且对图像干扰因素（如血液、粪便等）具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SSDCA模型在区分直肠癌患者的临床完全缓解（cCR）和局部复发（LR）方面表现出色，具有较高的平衡准确度、敏感性和特异性，且对图像质量变化具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Increasing evidence supports watch-and-wait (WW) surveillance for patients with rectal cancer who show clinical complete response (cCR) at restaging following total neoadjuvant treatment (TNT). However, objectively accurate methods to early detect local regrowth (LR) from follow-up endoscopy images during WW are essential to manage care and prevent distant metastases. Hence, we developed a Siamese Swin Transformer with Dual Cross-Attention (SSDCA) to combine longitudinal endoscopic images at restaging and follow-up and distinguish cCR from LR. SSDCA leverages pretrained Swin transformers to extract domain agnostic features and enhance robustness to imaging variations. Dual cross attention is implemented to emphasize features from the two scans without requiring any spatial alignment of images to predict response. SSDCA as well as Swin-based baselines were trained using image pairs from 135 patients and evaluated on a held-out set of image pairs from 62 patients. SSDCA produced the best balanced accuracy (81.76\% $\pm$ 0.04), sensitivity (90.07\% $\pm$ 0.08), and specificity (72.86\% $\pm$ 0.05). Robustness analysis showed stable performance irrespective of artifacts including blood, stool, telangiectasia, and poor image quality. UMAP clustering of extracted features showed maximal inter-cluster separation (1.45 $\pm$ 0.18) and minimal intra-cluster dispersion (1.07 $\pm$ 0.19) with SSDCA, confirming discriminative representation learning.

Conclusion: FRESCO通过整合帧内和帧间对应关系，显著提升了零样本视频处理任务中的时空一致性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: The remarkable success in text-to-image diffusion models has motivated extensive investigation of their potential for video applications. Zero-shot techniques aim to adapt image diffusion models for videos without requiring further model training. Recent methods largely emphasize integrating inter-frame correspondence into attention mechanisms. However, the soft constraint applied to identify the valid features to attend is insufficient, which could lead to temporal inconsistency. In this paper, we present FRESCO, which integrates intra-frame correspondence with inter-frame correspondence to formulate a more robust spatial-temporal constraint. This enhancement ensures a consistent transformation of semantically similar content between frames. Our method goes beyond attention guidance to explicitly optimize features, achieving high spatial-temporal consistency with the input video, significantly enhancing the visual coherence of manipulated videos. We verify FRESCO adaptations on two zero-shot tasks of video-to-video translation and text-guided video editing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in generating high-quality, coherent videos, highlighting a significant advance over current zero-shot methods.

Conclusion: UniMo通过统一建模2D视频和3D动作，展示了LLM在多模态融合中的潜力，为整合人本信息到现有模型开辟了新途径。

Abstract: We propose UniMo, an innovative autoregressive model for joint modeling of 2D human videos and 3D human motions within a unified framework, enabling simultaneous generation and understanding of these two modalities for the first time. Current methods predominantly focus on generating one modality given another as the condition or integrating either of them with other modalities such as text and audio. Unifying 2D videos and 3D motions for simultaneous optimization and generation remains largely unexplored, presenting significant challenges due to their substantial structural and distributional differences. Inspired by the LLM's ability to unify different modalities, our method models videos and 3D motions as a unified tokens sequence, utilizing separate embedding layers to mitigate distribution gaps. Additionally, we devise a sequence modeling strategy that integrates two distinct tasks within a single framework, proving the effectiveness of unified modeling. Moreover, to efficiently align with visual tokens and preserve 3D spatial information, we design a novel 3D motion tokenizer with a temporal expansion strategy, using a single VQ-VAE to produce quantized motion tokens. It features multiple expert decoders that handle body shapes, translation, global orientation, and body poses for reliable 3D motion reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method simultaneously generates corresponding videos and motions while performing accurate motion capture. This work taps into the capacity of LLMs to fuse diverse data types, paving the way for integrating human-centric information into existing models and potentially enabling multimodal, controllable joint modeling of humans, objects, and scenes.

Abstract: Deep learning-based image restoration has achieved significant success. However, when addressing real-world degradations, model performance is limited by the quality of ground-truth images in datasets due to practical constraints in data acquisition. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that enhances existing ground truth images to provide higher-quality supervision for real-world restoration. Our framework generates perceptually enhanced ground truth images using super-resolution by incorporating adaptive frequency masks, which are learned by a conditional frequency mask generator. These masks guide the optimal fusion of frequency components from the original ground truth and its super-resolved variants, yielding enhanced ground truth images. This frequency-domain mixup preserves the semantic consistency of the original content while selectively enriching perceptual details, preventing hallucinated artifacts that could compromise fidelity. The enhanced ground truth images are used to train a lightweight output refinement network that can be seamlessly integrated with existing restoration models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently improves the quality of restored images. We further validate the effectiveness of both supervision enhancement and output refinement through user studies. Code is available at https://github.com/dhryougit/Beyond-the-Ground-Truth.

Conclusion: TempR1通过多任务强化学习框架显著提升了MLLMs的时序理解能力，并在多个基准测试中达到最优性能，为时序推理提供了可扩展且原则性的范式。

Abstract: Enhancing the temporal understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is essential for advancing long-form video analysis, enabling tasks such as temporal localization, action detection, and time-sensitive question answering. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been explored for improving temporal reasoning, existing approaches are often confined to limited task types and data, restricting their generalization across diverse temporal understanding scenarios. To address this challenge, we present TempR1, a temporal-aware multi-task reinforcement learning framework that systematically strengthens MLLMs' temporal comprehension. We curate a multi-task corpus that exposes the model to diverse temporal structures and semantics, and build upon the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to achieve stable and effective cross-task optimization. Specifically, we categorize temporal tasks into three correspondence types between predicted intervals and ground-truth instances, and design tailored localization rewards for each, enabling TempR1 to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies and adapt to different temporal patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TempR1 attains state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, its joint optimization over complementary tasks yields a strong synergistic effect, enhancing both generalization and single-task performance, establishing a scalable and principled paradigm for temporal reasoning in MLLMs.

Conclusion: UniID通过整合文本嵌入和基于适配器的方法，成功实现了高保真人脸个性化与灵活文本控制的双重目标，实验证明其在身份保留和文本可控性上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Tuning-free face personalization methods have developed along two distinct paradigms: text embedding approaches that map facial features into the text embedding space, and adapter-based methods that inject features through auxiliary cross-attention layers. While both paradigms have shown promise, existing methods struggle to simultaneously achieve high identity fidelity and flexible text controllability. We introduce UniID, a unified tuning-free framework that synergistically integrates both paradigms. Our key insight is that when merging these approaches, they should mutually reinforce only identity-relevant information while preserving the original diffusion prior for non-identity attributes. We realize this through a principled training-inference strategy: during training, we employ an identity-focused learning scheme that guides both branches to capture identity features exclusively; at inference, we introduce a normalized rescaling mechanism that recovers the text controllability of the base diffusion model while enabling complementary identity signals to enhance each other. This principled design enables UniID to achieve high-fidelity face personalization with flexible text controllability. Extensive experiments against six state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that UniID achieves superior performance in both identity preservation and text controllability.

Conclusion: DirectDrag在无需手动提供掩码和文本提示的情况下，实现了高质量的图像编辑，表现出卓越的图像质量和拖拽精度。

Abstract: Drag-based image editing using generative models provides intuitive control over image structures. However, existing methods rely heavily on manually provided masks and textual prompts to preserve semantic fidelity and motion precision. Removing these constraints creates a fundamental trade-off: visual artifacts without masks and poor spatial control without prompts. To address these limitations, we propose DirectDrag, a novel mask- and prompt-free editing framework. DirectDrag enables precise and efficient manipulation with minimal user input while maintaining high image fidelity and accurate point alignment. DirectDrag introduces two key innovations. First, we design an Auto Soft Mask Generation module that intelligently infers editable regions from point displacement, automatically localizing deformation along movement paths while preserving contextual integrity through the generative model's inherent capacity. Second, we develop a Readout-Guided Feature Alignment mechanism that leverages intermediate diffusion activations to maintain structural consistency during point-based edits, substantially improving visual fidelity. Despite operating without manual mask or prompt, DirectDrag achieves superior image quality compared to existing methods while maintaining competitive drag accuracy. Extensive experiments on DragBench and real-world scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of DirectDrag for high-quality, interactive image manipulation.

Abstract: Reliable 3D reconstruction from in-the-wild image collections is often hindered by "noisy" images-irrelevant inputs with little or no view overlap with others. While traditional Structure-from-Motion pipelines handle such cases through geometric verification and outlier rejection, feed-forward 3D reconstruction models lack these explicit mechanisms, leading to degraded performance under in-the-wild conditions. In this paper, we discover that the existing feed-forward reconstruction model, e.g., VGGT, despite lacking explicit outlier-rejection mechanisms or noise-aware training, can inherently distinguish distractor images. Through an in-depth analysis under varying proportions of synthetic distractors, we identify a specific layer that naturally exhibits outlier-suppressing behavior. Further probing reveals that this layer encodes discriminative internal representations that enable an effective noise-filtering capability, which we simply leverage to perform outlier-view rejection in feed-forward 3D reconstruction without any additional fine-tuning or supervision. Extensive experiments on both controlled and in-the-wild datasets demonstrate that this implicit filtering mechanism is consistent and generalizes well across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Modeling group actions on latent representations enables controllable transformations of high-dimensional image data. Prior works applying group-theoretic priors or modeling transformations typically operate in the high-dimensional data space, where group actions apply uniformly across the entire input, making it difficult to disentangle the subspace that varies under transformations. While latent-space methods offer greater flexibility, they still require manual partitioning of latent variables into equivariant and invariant subspaces, limiting the ability to robustly learn and operate group actions within the representation space. To address this, we introduce a novel end-to-end framework that for the first time learns group actions on latent image manifolds, automatically discovering transformation-relevant structures without manual intervention. Our method uses learnable binary masks with straight-through estimation to dynamically partition latent representations into transformation-sensitive and invariant components. We formulate this within a unified optimization framework that jointly learns latent disentanglement and group transformation mappings. The framework can be seamlessly integrated with any standard encoder-decoder architecture. We validate our approach on five 2D/3D image datasets, demonstrating its ability to automatically learn disentangled latent factors for group actions in diverse data, while downstream classification tasks confirm the effectiveness of the learned representations. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/farhanaswarnali/Learning-Group-Actions-In-Disentangled-Latent-Image-Representations .

Conclusion: NVRC-Lite通过整合多尺度特征网格和基于八叉树的上下文模型，显著提升了轻量级神经表示的性能和编码速度，超越了现有最佳轻量级INR视频编解码器C3。

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the viability of utilizing over-fitted implicit neural representations (INRs) as alternatives to autoencoder-based models for neural video compression. Among these INR-based video codecs, Neural Video Representation Compression (NVRC) was the first to adopt a fully end-to-end compression framework that compresses INRs, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, some recently proposed lightweight INRs have shown comparable performance to their baseline codecs with computational complexity lower than 10kMACs/pixel. In this work, we extend NVRC toward lightweight representations, and propose NVRC-Lite, which incorporates two key changes. Firstly, we integrated multi-scale feature grids into our lightweight neural representation, and the use of higher resolution grids significantly improves the performance of INRs at low complexity. Secondly, we address the issue that existing INRs typically leverage autoregressive models for entropy coding: these are effective but impractical due to their slow coding speed. In this work, we propose an octree-based context model for entropy coding high-dimensional feature grids, which accelerates the entropy coding module of the model. Our experimental results demonstrate that NVRC-Lite outperforms C3, one of the best lightweight INR-based video codecs, with up to 21.03% and 23.06% BD-rate savings when measured in PSNR and MS-SSIM, respectively, while achieving 8.4x encoding and 2.5x decoding speedup.

Abstract: Reconstructing and understanding 3D scenes from unposed sparse views in a feed-forward manner remains as a challenging task in 3D computer vision. Recent approaches use per-pixel 3D Gaussian Splatting for reconstruction, followed by a 2D-to-3D feature lifting stage for scene understanding. However, they generate excessive redundant Gaussians, causing high memory overhead and sub-optimal multi-view feature aggregation, leading to degraded novel view synthesis and scene understanding performance. We propose C3G, a novel feed-forward framework that estimates compact 3D Gaussians only at essential spatial locations, minimizing redundancy while enabling effective feature lifting. We introduce learnable tokens that aggregate multi-view features through self-attention to guide Gaussian generation, ensuring each Gaussian integrates relevant visual features across views. We then exploit the learned attention patterns for Gaussian decoding to efficiently lift features. Extensive experiments on pose-free novel view synthesis, 3D open-vocabulary segmentation, and view-invariant feature aggregation demonstrate our approach's effectiveness. Results show that a compact yet geometrically meaningful representation is sufficient for high-quality scene reconstruction and understanding, achieving superior memory efficiency and feature fidelity compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: RELIC是一个统一的交互式世界建模框架，通过创新的记忆结构和蒸馏技术，同时实现了实时长时流、一致空间记忆和精确用户控制，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常仅孤立地解决实时长时流、一致空间记忆或精确用户控制中的一个方面，而同时实现这三个方面极具挑战性。RELIC旨在统一解决这三个挑战。

Method: RELIC基于自回归视频扩散蒸馏技术，采用高度压缩的历史潜在令牌表示长时记忆，并结合相对动作和绝对相机位姿进行编码。同时，通过微调双向教师视频模型并采用新的内存高效自强制范式，实现了长时教师和学生自展开的完整上下文蒸馏。

Result: RELIC作为一个14B参数模型，在16 FPS下实现实时生成，相比先前工作表现出更准确的动作跟随、更稳定的长时流和更鲁棒的空间记忆检索能力。

Conclusion: RELIC作为一个统一的框架，成功解决了实时长时流、一致空间记忆和精确用户控制这三个关键挑战，为下一代交互式世界建模奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: A truly interactive world model requires three key ingredients: real-time long-horizon streaming, consistent spatial memory, and precise user control. However, most existing approaches address only one of these aspects in isolation, as achieving all three simultaneously is highly challenging-for example, long-term memory mechanisms often degrade real-time performance. In this work, we present RELIC, a unified framework that tackles these three challenges altogether. Given a single image and a text description, RELIC enables memory-aware, long-duration exploration of arbitrary scenes in real time. Built upon recent autoregressive video-diffusion distillation techniques, our model represents long-horizon memory using highly compressed historical latent tokens encoded with both relative actions and absolute camera poses within the KV cache. This compact, camera-aware memory structure supports implicit 3D-consistent content retrieval and enforces long-term coherence with minimal computational overhead. In parallel, we fine-tune a bidirectional teacher video model to generate sequences beyond its original 5-second training horizon, and transform it into a causal student generator using a new memory-efficient self-forcing paradigm that enables full-context distillation over long-duration teacher as well as long student self-rollouts. Implemented as a 14B-parameter model and trained on a curated Unreal Engine-rendered dataset, RELIC achieves real-time generation at 16 FPS while demonstrating more accurate action following, more stable long-horizon streaming, and more robust spatial-memory retrieval compared with prior work. These capabilities establish RELIC as a strong foundation for the next generation of interactive world modeling.

Motivation: 由于传统手语生成过程中文本转换、姿势生成及姿势渲染为真实视频的准确性不足，导致误差逐渐累积，进展缓慢。因此，本文旨在简化传统冗余结构，优化任务目标，提升生成质量。

Method: 本文设计了Stable Signer模型，通过SLUL执行文本理解，并使用SLP-MoE手势渲染专家块生成手势。SLUL采用新开发的Semantic-Aware Gloss Masking Loss（SAGM Loss）进行训练。

Result: Stable Signer模型的性能比当前最先进方法提升了48.6%，能够端到端生成高质量、多风格的手语视频。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为Stable Signer的新型手语生成模型，通过简化传统冗余结构并优化任务目标，将手语生成任务重新定义为包含文本理解（Prompt2Gloss、Text2Gloss）和Pose2Vid的端到端分层生成任务。通过新提出的SLUL（手语理解链接器）和SLP-MoE手势渲染专家块，实现了高质量、多风格手语视频的端到端生成。实验结果表明，其性能比当前最先进方法提升了48.6%。

Abstract: Sign Language Production (SLP) is the process of converting the complex input text into a real video. Most previous works focused on the Text2Gloss, Gloss2Pose, Pose2Vid stages, and some concentrated on Prompt2Gloss and Text2Avatar stages. However, this field has made slow progress due to the inaccuracy of text conversion, pose generation, and the rendering of poses into real human videos in these stages, resulting in gradually accumulating errors. Therefore, in this paper, we streamline the traditional redundant structure, simplify and optimize the task objective, and design a new sign language generative model called Stable Signer. It redefines the SLP task as a hierarchical generation end-to-end task that only includes text understanding (Prompt2Gloss, Text2Gloss) and Pose2Vid, and executes text understanding through our proposed new Sign Language Understanding Linker called SLUL, and generates hand gestures through the named SLP-MoE hand gesture rendering expert block to end-to-end generate high-quality and multi-style sign language videos. SLUL is trained using the newly developed Semantic-Aware Gloss Masking Loss (SAGM Loss). Its performance has improved by 48.6% compared to the current SOTA generation methods.

Motivation: 解决现有大型多模态模型在图形设计中几何布局不准确和缺乏专业工作流程所需的迭代、分层编辑能力的问题。

Method: 采用渐进式三阶段训练策略：扰动监督微调、视觉-现实对齐的强化学习以及美学反馈的强化学习，并结合生成模型实现层可控的迭代编辑。

Result: 实验表明，PosterCopilot能够生成几何准确且美学优越的布局，为专业设计提供了高度可控的迭代编辑功能。

Conclusion: PosterCopilot框架通过三阶段训练策略和完整的工作流程，显著提升了LMM在图形设计中的几何准确性和美学推理能力，为专业设计提供了前所未有的可控性和迭代编辑能力。

Abstract: Graphic design forms the cornerstone of modern visual communication, serving as a vital medium for promoting cultural and commercial events. Recent advances have explored automating this process using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), yet existing methods often produce geometrically inaccurate layouts and lack the iterative, layer-specific editing required in professional workflows. To address these limitations, we present PosterCopilot, a framework that advances layout reasoning and controllable editing for professional graphic design. Specifically, we introduce a progressive three-stage training strategy that equips LMMs with geometric understanding and aesthetic reasoning for layout design, consisting of Perturbed Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning for Visual-Reality Alignment, and Reinforcement Learning from Aesthetic Feedback. Furthermore, we develop a complete workflow that couples the trained LMM-based design model with generative models, enabling layer-controllable, iterative editing for precise element refinement while maintaining global visual consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PosterCopilot achieves geometrically accurate and aesthetically superior layouts, offering unprecedented controllability for professional iterative design.

Motivation: 解决现有NF方法因添加随机噪声或使用冻结VAE编码器导致的复杂流程和生成质量下降问题。

Method: 提出固定VAE编码器输出的方差为常数（如0.5），简化了VAE的证据下界，使NF与VAE能联合训练。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256生成任务中，SimFlow的gFID得分为2.15，优于STARFlow（2.40）；结合REPA-E后gFID进一步降至1.91。

Conclusion: SimFlow通过固定VAE编码器的方差为常数，简化了训练流程并提升了生成质量，同时与REPA-E方法结合后进一步提升了性能，成为NF领域的新标杆。

Abstract: Normalizing Flows (NFs) learn invertible mappings between the data and a Gaussian distribution. Prior works usually suffer from two limitations. First, they add random noise to training samples or VAE latents as data augmentation, introducing complex pipelines including extra noising and denoising steps. Second, they use a pretrained and frozen VAE encoder, resulting in suboptimal reconstruction and generation quality. In this paper, we find that the two issues can be solved in a very simple way: just fixing the variance (which would otherwise be predicted by the VAE encoder) to a constant (e.g., 0.5). On the one hand, this method allows the encoder to output a broader distribution of tokens and the decoder to learn to reconstruct clean images from the augmented token distribution, avoiding additional noise or denoising design. On the other hand, fixed variance simplifies the VAE evidence lower bound, making it stable to train an NF with a VAE jointly. On the ImageNet $256 \times 256$ generation task, our model SimFlow obtains a gFID score of 2.15, outperforming the state-of-the-art method STARFlow (gFID 2.40). Moreover, SimFlow can be seamlessly integrated with the end-to-end representation alignment (REPA-E) method and achieves an improved gFID of 1.91, setting a new state of the art among NFs.

Abstract: We introduce the "single-life" learning paradigm, where we train a distinct vision model exclusively on egocentric videos captured by one individual. We leverage the multiple viewpoints naturally captured within a single life to learn a visual encoder in a self-supervised manner. Our experiments demonstrate three key findings. First, models trained independently on different lives develop a highly aligned geometric understanding. We demonstrate this by training visual encoders on distinct datasets each capturing a different life, both indoors and outdoors, as well as introducing a novel cross-attention-based metric to quantify the functional alignment of the internal representations developed by different models. Second, we show that single-life models learn generalizable geometric representations that effectively transfer to downstream tasks, such as depth estimation, in unseen environments. Third, we demonstrate that training on up to 30 hours from one week of the same person's life leads to comparable performance to training on 30 hours of diverse web data, highlighting the strength of single-life representation learning. Overall, our results establish that the shared structure of the world, both leads to consistency in models trained on individual lives, and provides a powerful signal for visual representation learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCP问题在DMDGP背景下出现，其中修剪边的排序对SBBU算法的性能有显著影响。虽然已有启发式方法表现优异，但最优解的计算复杂度尚未明确。

Method: 通过从强NP完全的3-Partition问题进行多项式时间归约，证明了OCP的NP完全性。归约构造了一个严格的预算，迫使最优解恰好对应于有效的3-分区。

Result: 证明OCP是NP完全的，归约构造展示了最优解与有效3-分区的对应关系。

Conclusion: 本文证明了OCP问题是NP完全的，为最优边排序设立了计算障碍，并为当前实践中使用的启发式方法提供了理论依据。

Abstract: The Ordered Covering Problem (OCP) arises in the context of the Discretizable Molecular Distance Geometry Problem (DMDGP), where the ordering of pruning edges significantly impacts the performance of the SBBU algorithm for protein structure determination. In recent work, Souza et al. (2023) formalized OCP as a hypergraph covering problem with ordered, exponential costs, and proposed a greedy heuristic that outperforms the original SBBU ordering by orders of magnitude. However, the computational complexity of finding optimal solutions remained open. In this paper, we prove that OCP is NP-complete through a polynomial-time reduction from the strongly NP-complete 3-Partition problem. Our reduction constructs a tight budget that forces optimal solutions to correspond exactly to valid 3-partitions. This result establishes a computational barrier for optimal edge ordering and provides theoretical justification for the heuristic approaches currently used in practice.

Conclusion: 本文对布尔字母对称约束满足问题（CSPs）的参数化复杂性进行了完整分类，扩展了局部搜索模型的应用范围。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the parameterized complexity of local search, whose goal is to find a good nearby solution from the given current solution. Formally, given an optimization problem where the goal is to find the largest feasible subset $S$ of a universe $U$, the new input consists of a current solution $P$ (not necessarily feasible) as well as an ordinary input for the problem.
  Given the existence of a feasible solution $S^*$, the goal is to find a feasible solution as good as $S^*$ in parameterized time $f(k) \cdot n^{O(1)}$, where $k$ denotes the distance $|PΔS^*|$. This model generalizes numerous classical parameterized optimization problems whose parameter $k$ is the minimum number of elements removed from $U$ to make it feasible, which corresponds to the case $P = U$.
  We apply this model to widely studied Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs), where $U$ is the set of constraints, and a subset $U'$ of constraints is feasible if there is an assignment to the variables satisfying all constraints in $U'$. We give a complete characterization of the parameterized complexity of all boolean-alphabet symmetric CSPs, where the predicate's acceptance depends on the number of true literals.

Abstract: We study the design of efficient approximation algorithms for the
  $\ell$-center clustering and minimum-diameter $\ell$-clustering
  problems in high dimensional Euclidean and Hamming spaces. Our main
  tool is randomized dimension reduction. First, we present a general
  method of reducing the dependency of the running time of a
  hypothetical algorithm for the $\ell$-center problem in a high
  dimensional Euclidean space on the dimension size. Utilizing in
  part this method, we provide $(2+ε)$- approximation
  algorithms for the $\ell$-center clustering and minimum-diameter
  $\ell$-clustering problems in Euclidean and Hamming spaces that are
  substantially faster than the known $2$-approximation ones when both
  $\ell$ and the dimension are super-logarithmic. Next, we apply the
  general method to the recent fast approximation algorithms with
  higher approximation guarantees for the $\ell$-center clustering
  problem in a high dimensional Euclidean space. Finally, we provide a
  speed-up of the known $O(1)$-approximation method for the
  generalization of the $\ell$-center clustering problem to include
  $z$ outliers (i.e., $z$ input points can be ignored while computing
  the maximum distance of an input point to a center) in high

Conclusion: 该协议首次在动态网络的无网络意识模型中，以对数时间收敛至MIS（最大独立集）。

Abstract: We introduce a broadcast model called the singing model, where agents are oblivious of the size and structure of the communication network, even their immediate neighborhood. Agents can sing multiple notes which are heard by their neighbors. The model is a generalization of the beeping model, where agents can only emit sound at a single frequency. We give a simple and natural protocol where agents compete with their neighbors and their strength is reflected in the number of notes they sing. It converges in $O(log(n))$ time with high probability, where $n$ is the number of agents in the network. The protocol works in an asynchronous model where rounds vary in length and have different start times. It works with completely dynamic networks where agents can be faulty. The protocol is the first to converge to an MIS in logarithmic time for dynamic networks in a network oblivious model.

Abstract: The maximum clique problem, a well-known graph-based combinatorial optimization problem, has been addressed through various algorithmic approaches, though systematic analyses of the problem instances remain sparse. This study employs the instance space analysis (ISA) methodology to systematically analyze the instance space of this problem and assess & predict the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms, including exact, heuristic, and graph neural network (GNN)-based methods. A dataset was compiled using graph instances from TWITTER, COLLAB and IMDB-BINARY benchmarks commonly used in graph machine learning research. A set of 33 generic and 2 problem-specific polynomial-time-computable graph-based features, including several spectral properties, was employed for the ISA. A composite performance mea- sure incorporating both solution quality and algorithm runtime was utilized. The comparative analysis demonstrated that the exact algorithm Mixed Order Maximum Clique (MOMC) exhib- ited superior performance across approximately 74.7% of the instance space constituted by the compiled dataset. Gurobi & CliSAT accounted for superior performance in 13.8% and 11% of the instance space, respectively. The ISA-based algorithm performance prediction model run on 34 challenging test instances compiled from the BHOSLIB and DIMACS datasets yielded top-1 and top-2 best performing algorithm prediction accuracies of 88% and 97%, respectively.

Abstract: We study the computational problem of computing a fair means clustering of discrete vectors, which admits an equivalent formulation as editing a colored matrix into one with few distinct color-balanced rows by changing at most $k$ values. While NP-hard in both the fairness-oblivious and the fair settings, the problem is well-known to admit a fixed-parameter algorithm in the former ``vanilla'' setting. As our first contribution, we exclude an analogous algorithm even for highly restricted fair means clustering instances. We then proceed to obtain a full complexity landscape of the problem, and establish tractability results which capture three means of circumventing our obtained lower bound: placing additional constraints on the problem instances, fixed-parameter approximation, or using an alternative parameterization targeting tree-like matrices.

Conclusion: 该论文解决了de Berg等人提出的开放性问题，完成了从ETH紧确算法角度对几何交集图中路径和循环问题的研究，并首次在固定维度d中为长路径问题设计了鲁棒的亚指数参数化算法。

Abstract: We study the design of robust subexponential algorithms for classical connectivity problems on intersection graphs of similarly sized fat objects in $\mathbb{R}^d$. In this setting, each vertex corresponds to a geometric object, and two vertices are adjacent if and only if their objects intersect. We introduce a new tool for designing such algorithms, which we call a $λ$-linked partition. This is a partition of the vertex set into groups of highly connected vertices. Crucially, such a partition can be computed in polynomial time and does not require access to the geometric representation of the graph. We apply this framework to problems related to paths and cycles in graphs. First, we obtain the first robust ETH-tight algorithms for Hamiltonian Path and Hamiltonian Cycle, running in time $2^{O(n^{1-1/d})}$ on intersection graphs of similarly sized fat objects in $\mathbb{R}^d$. This resolves an open problem of de Berg et al. [STOC 2018] and completes the study of these problems on geometric intersection graphs from the viewpoint of ETH-tight exact algorithms. We further extend our approach to the parameterized setting and design the first robust subexponential parameterized algorithm for Long Path in any fixed dimension $d$. More precisely, we obtain a randomized robust algorithm running in time $2^{O(k^{1-1/d}\log^2 k)}\, n^{O(1)}$ on intersection graphs of similarly sized fat objects in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where $k$ is the natural parameter. Besides $λ$-linked partitions, our algorithm also relies on a low-treewidth pattern covering theorem that we establish for geometric intersection graphs, which may be viewed as a refinement of a result of Marx-Pilipczuk [ESA 2017]. This structural result may be of independent interest.

Motivation: 最大团枚举是基础图挖掘任务，但其计算复杂性和输出冗余限制了实用性。论文旨在通过更高效的结构摘要方法解决这些问题。

Method: 论文引入了$ρ$-dense aggregators，通过识别边缘密度至少为$ρ$的小规模聚类集合来捕捉最大团结构，避免了枚举所有团。算法在子指数时间内完成，对于有界退化图（典型现实网络特征）则能在近线性时间内运行。

Result: 理论和实验结果表明，$ρ$-dense aggregators在子指数规模内存在，算法在现实网络中实现了显著加速（中位数提速超过6倍，极端情况下超过300倍），同时提供了更简洁的结构摘要。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种名为$ρ$-dense aggregators的新方法，有效解决了最大团枚举的计算复杂性和输出冗余问题。通过理论和实证验证，该方法在多种实际网络中都表现出显著优势。

Abstract: Maximal clique enumeration is a fundamental graph mining task, but its utility is often limited by computational intractability and highly redundant output. To address these challenges, we introduce \emph{$ρ$-dense aggregators}, a novel approach that succinctly captures maximal clique structure. Instead of listing all cliques, we identify a small collection of clusters with edge density at least $ρ$ that collectively contain every maximal clique.
  In contrast to maximal clique enumeration, we prove that for all $ρ< 1$, every graph admits a $ρ$-dense aggregator of \emph{sub-exponential} size, $n^{O(\log_{1/ρ}n)}$, and provide an algorithm achieving this bound. For graphs with bounded degeneracy, a typical characteristic of real-world networks, our algorithm runs in near-linear time and produces near-linear size aggregators. We also establish a matching lower bound on aggregator size, proving our results are essentially tight. In an empirical evaluation on real-world networks, we demonstrate significant practical benefits for the use of aggregators: our algorithm is consistently faster than the state-of-the-art clique enumeration algorithm, with median speedups over $6\times$ for $ρ=0.1$ (and over $300\times$ in an extreme case), while delivering a much more concise structural summary.

Motivation: 重新思考AI对齐问题，避免因固定价值编码带来的结构性不稳定问题，如‘是-应该’鸿沟、价值多元化和扩展框架问题。

Method: 论文通过哲学论证提出了三个主要贡献：一是阐述了‘规范陷阱’论点，二是提出了‘熵减’作为多智能体对齐动态的信息理论框架，三是建立了基于兼容主义理论的真实与模拟道德能力的功能区分。

Result: 提出了一个信息理论框架和操作标准，用于理解多智能体对齐动态，并区分真实与模拟道德能力。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的AI对齐框架，强调通过过程性、多智能体、发展性机制来构建具有响应能力的智能体，而非固定的人类价值内容编码。虽然框架生成了关于人工系统中价值涌现和道德代理的具体、可证伪预测，但实证验证仍在进行中。

Abstract: I argue that AI alignment should be reconceived as architecting syntropic, reasons-responsive agents through process-based, multi-agent, developmental mechanisms rather than encoding fixed human value content. The paper makes three philosophical contributions. First, I articulate the ``specification trap'' argument demonstrating why content-based value specification appears structurally unstable due to the conjunction of the is-ought gap, value pluralism, and the extended frame problem. Second, I propose syntropy -- the recursive reduction of mutual uncertainty between agents through state alignment -- as an information-theoretic framework for understanding multi-agent alignment dynamics. Third, I establish a functional distinction between genuine and simulated moral capacity grounded in compatibilist theories of guidance control, coupled with an embodied experimental paradigm and verification regime providing operational criteria independent of phenomenological claims. This paper represents the philosophical component of a broader research program whose empirical validation is being developed in a separate project currently in preparation. While the framework generates specific, falsifiable predictions about value emergence and moral agency in artificial systems, empirical validation remains pending.

Motivation: 当前AI范式在可解释性和价值对齐方面存在根本性挑战，需要一种基于第一性原理的新认知架构来推动AGI发展。

Method: 通过将认知解构为不可分割的逻辑原子和两个基本操作（指向与比较），并基于可解释的权重计算模型（权重=收益*概率）形式化决策过程，实现了基于图算法的计算引擎和全局工作流。

Result: 架构在初步代码实现和场景验证中表现出透明、类人推理及在新场景中的稳健学习能力。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的Weight-Calculatism架构为构建可信且对齐的通用人工智能（AGI）提供了理论和实践基础，展示了透明、类人推理及在新场景中的稳健学习能力。

Abstract: Current AI paradigms, as "architects of experience," face fundamental challenges in explainability and value alignment. This paper introduces "Weight-Calculatism," a novel cognitive architecture grounded in first principles, and demonstrates its potential as a viable pathway toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The architecture deconstructs cognition into indivisible Logical Atoms and two fundamental operations: Pointing and Comparison. Decision-making is formalized through an interpretable Weight-Calculation model (Weight = Benefit * Probability), where all values are traceable to an auditable set of Initial Weights. This atomic decomposition enables radical explainability, intrinsic generality for novel situations, and traceable value alignment. We detail its implementation via a graph-algorithm-based computational engine and a global workspace workflow, supported by a preliminary code implementation and scenario validation. Results indicate that the architecture achieves transparent, human-like reasoning and robust learning in unprecedented scenarios, establishing a practical and theoretical foundation for building trustworthy and aligned AGI.

TL;DR: 符号求解器集成方法在特定条件下（如有限隐式推理+充足搜索空间）优于传统长链式思维，尤其在约束满足问题中表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统长链式思维（CoT）可能导致模型‘过度思考’，产生冗长推理链甚至错误答案，因此研究符号求解器集成方法的适用条件。

Method: 探索符号求解器集成方法何时能增强传统长链式思维（CoT），通过将推理任务转化为可执行代码并利用符号求解器解决。

Result: 符号求解器集成方法显著提升LLM在需要重复回溯的约束满足问题中的表现，且在提供声明性示例时，CodeLlama-13B甚至能在复杂Zebra谜题中超越GPT-4o。

Conclusion: 符号求解器集成方法仅在问题需要有限隐式推理但涉及充足搜索空间时有效，而最新LLM（如GPT-4o）在推理深度较浅的演绎问题上表现更好。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on complex reasoning tasks by generating long Chains of Thought (CoTs). However, this paradigm might incur substantial token overhead, especially when models "overthink" by producing lengthy reasoning chains, which can even lead to incorrect answers. A promising direction is the symbolic-solver-integrated approach, which leverages the code generation capabilities of LLMs to translate reasoning tasks into executable code and then solve them with a symbolic solver. In this paper, we explore an open question of when the conventional long-CoT can be enhanced by symbolic solvers. Our experimental results show that the symbolic-solver-integrated method only helps when the problem requires limited implicit reasoning but involves an ample search space. The latest LLMs, like GPT-4o, show better performance on deductive problems with shallow reasoning depth, while the symbolic-solver-integrated method significantly improves the LLMs' performance in constraint satisfaction problems that require repeated backtracks. When a declarative exemplar is provided, even CodeLlama-13B can outperform GPT-4o in difficult Zebra puzzles.

*Filippo Torresan,Ryota Kanai,Manuel Baltieri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Active inference agents perform best with goal shaping (promotes exploitation) but learn less about environment dynamics (hampers exploration).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of attention in the literature on how preference distribution specifications impact inference and learning in active inference agents.

Method: Comparison of four agents with different preference distributions (hard/soft goals, with/without goal shaping) in a grid world navigation task.

Result: Goal shaping promotes exploitation but hampers exploration.

Conclusion: Goal shaping enables the best performance overall (promotes exploitation) but hampers exploration by sacrificing learning about the environment's transition dynamics.

Abstract: Active inference proposes expected free energy as an objective for planning and decision-making to adequately balance exploitative and explorative drives in learning agents. The exploitative drive, or what an agent wants to achieve, is formalised as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a variational probability distribution, updated at each inference step, and a preference probability distribution that indicates what states or observations are more likely for the agent, hence determining the agent's goal in a certain environment. In the literature, the questions of how the preference distribution should be specified and of how a certain specification impacts inference and learning in an active inference agent have been given hardly any attention. In this work, we consider four possible ways of defining the preference distribution, either providing the agents with hard or soft goals and either involving or not goal shaping (i.e., intermediate goals). We compare the performances of four agents, each given one of the possible preference distributions, in a grid world navigation task. Our results show that goal shaping enables the best performance overall (i.e., it promotes exploitation) while sacrificing learning about the environment's transition dynamics (i.e., it hampers exploration).

Conclusion: 研究发现，当前LLM代理在需要说服和规范执行的场景中，其合作能力的泛化性存在显著不足，距离实现可靠合作所需的鲁棒性还有较大差距。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities for social interaction and are increasingly being deployed in situations where they might engage with both human and artificial agents. These interactions represent a critical frontier for LLM-based agents, yet existing evaluation methods fail to measure how well these capabilities generalize to novel social situations. In this paper, we introduce a method for evaluating the ability of LLM-based agents to cooperate in zero-shot, mixed-motive environments using Concordia, a natural language multi-agent simulation environment. Our method measures general cooperative intelligence by testing an agent's ability to identify and exploit opportunities for mutual gain across diverse partners and contexts. We present empirical results from the NeurIPS 2024 Concordia Contest, where agents were evaluated on their ability to achieve mutual gains across a suite of diverse scenarios ranging from negotiation to collective action problems. Our findings reveal significant gaps between current agent capabilities and the robust generalization required for reliable cooperation, particularly in scenarios demanding persuasion and norm enforcement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMRL模型普遍依赖稀疏的基于结果的奖励，而更丰富的推理标记奖励能提供更细粒度的指导，但计算更具信息量的奖励具有挑战性。

Method: Argos从教师模型和基于规则的评分函数池中选择，同时评估最终响应准确性、时空定位质量及推理过程质量。

Result: Argos在多个代理任务中达到最先进水平，并证明仅依赖高度优化的SFT数据后训练不足，需在线验证避免模型崩溃。

Conclusion: Argos通过多模态强化学习中的精细化奖励机制，显著提升了代理模型在空间推理、视觉幻觉及机器人任务中的性能，并减少了奖励欺骗行为。

Abstract: Agentic reasoning models trained with multimodal reinforcement learning (MMRL) have become increasingly capable, yet they are almost universally optimized using sparse, outcome-based rewards computed based on the final answers. Richer rewards computed from the reasoning tokens can improve learning significantly by providing more fine-grained guidance. However, it is challenging to compute more informative rewards in MMRL beyond those based on outcomes since different samples may require different scoring functions and teacher models may provide noisy reward signals too. In this paper, we introduce the Argos (Agentic Reward for Grounded & Objective Scoring), a principled reward agent to train multimodal reasoning models for agentic tasks. For each sample, Argos selects from a pool of teacher-model derived and rule-based scoring functions to simultaneously evaluate: (i) final response accuracy, (ii) spatiotemporal localization of referred entities and actions, and (iii) the quality of the reasoning process. We find that by leveraging our agentic verifier across both SFT data curation and RL training, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple agentic tasks such as spatial reasoning, visual hallucination as well as robotics and embodied AI benchmarks. Critically, we demonstrate that just relying on SFT post-training on highly curated reasoning data is insufficient, as agents invariably collapse to ungrounded solutions during RL without our online verification. We also show that our agentic verifier can help to reduce reward-hacking in MMRL. Finally, we also provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of Argos through the concept of pareto-optimality.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种通用的通信约束模型，能够有效区分不同场景下的丢包和无损消息，并通过双互信息估计器解耦它们对分布式决策的影响，最终在多个通信约束基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Communication is one of the effective means to improve the learning of cooperative policy in multi-agent systems. However, in most real-world scenarios, lossy communication is a prevalent issue. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning with communication, due to their limited scalability and robustness, struggles to apply to complex and dynamic real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose a generalized communication-constrained model to uniformly characterize communication conditions across different scenarios. Based on this, we utilize it as a learning prior to distinguish between lossy and lossless messages for specific scenarios. Additionally, we decouple the impact of lossy and lossless messages on distributed decision-making, drawing on a dual mutual information estimatior, and introduce a communication-constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, quantifying the impact of communication messages into the global reward. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach across several communication-constrained benchmarks.

Conclusion: PARC展示了通过分层多智能体架构结合自我评估和自我反馈机制，能够实现AI系统在无需人工干预的情况下完成大规模科学和分析工作的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce PARC, a coding agent for the autonomous and robust execution of long-horizon computational tasks. PARC is built on a hierarchical multi-agent architecture incorporating task planning, execution, and a mechanism that evaluates its own actions and their outcomes from an independent context and provides feedback, namely self-assessment and self-feedback. This design enables PARC to detect and correct high-level strategic errors and sustain progress without human intervention. We evaluate PARC across computational science and data science tasks. In materials science, it autonomously reproduces key results from studies on lithium-ion conduction and alloy segregation. In particular, it coordinates dozens of parallel simulation tasks, each requiring roughly 43 hours of computation, managing orchestration, monitoring, and error correction end-to-end. In Kaggle-based experiments, starting from minimal natural-language instructions, PARC conducts data analysis and implements search strategies, producing solutions competitive with human-engineered baselines. These results highlight the potential of integrating a hierarchical multi-agent system with self-assessment and self-feedback to enable AI systems capable of independent, large-scale scientific and analytical work.

Conclusion: RP-ReAct通过解耦战略规划与低级执行，结合上下文保存策略，显著提升了复杂任务处理的可靠性和效率，并在多领域基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, autonomous agents often struggle to solve complex tasks in enterprise domains that require coordinating multiple tools and processing diverse data sources. This struggle is driven by two main limitations. First, single-agent architectures enforce a monolithic plan-execute loop, which directly causes trajectory instability. Second, the requirement to use local open-weight models for data privacy introduces smaller context windows leading to the rapid consumption of context from large tool outputs. To solve this problem we introduce RP-ReAct (Reasoner Planner-ReAct), a novel multi-agent approach that fundamentally decouples strategic planning from low-level execution to achieve superior reliability and efficiency. RP-ReAct consists of a Reasoner Planner Agent (RPA), responsible for planning each sub-step, continuously analysing the execution results using the strong reasoning capabilities of a Large Reasoning Model, and one or multiple Proxy-Execution Agent (PEA) that translates sub-steps into concrete tool interactions using a ReAct approach. Crucially, we incorporate a context-saving strategy within the PEA to mitigate context window overflow by managing large tool outputs via external storage and on-demand access. We evaluate RP-ReAct, on the challenging, multi-domain ToolQA benchmark using a diverse set of six open-weight reasoning models. Our empirical results show that RP-ReAct achieves superior performance and improved generalization ability over state-of-the-art baselines when addressing diverse complex tasks across the evaluated domains. Furthermore we establish the enhanced robustness and stability of our approach across different model scales, paving the way for effective and deployable agentic solutions for enterprises.

Conclusion: PAN编程模型通过解耦核心工作流逻辑和推理时策略，显著提升了代理编程的灵活性和可靠性，且EnCompass框架的实现验证了其有效性。

Abstract: We introduce a new approach to agent programming, the development of LLM-based agents. Current approaches to agent programming often entangle two aspects of agent design: the core workflow logic and the inference-time strategy (e.g., tree search). We introduce "probabilistic angelic nondeterminism" ("PAN"), a programming model that disentangles these two concerns, allowing the programmer to describe the agent workflow and independently experiment with different inference-time strategies by simply changing a few inputs. We provide an implementation of PAN in Python as the EnCompass framework, which uses a Python decorator to compile agent workflow programs into a search space. We present three case studies that demonstrate how the framework lets the programmer quickly improve the reliability of an agent and easily switch between different inference-time strategies, all with little additional coding.

Conclusion: DeepRule 框架通过整合非结构化知识注入、多智能体优化和可解释策略合成，实现了零售环境中的闭环自动化业务规则生成，显著提升了利润并确保了操作可行性。

Abstract: This paper proposes DeepRule, an integrated framework for automated business rule generation in retail assortment and pricing optimization. Addressing the systematic misalignment between existing theoretical models and real-world economic complexities, we identify three critical gaps: (1) data modality mismatch where unstructured textual sources (e.g. negotiation records, approval documents) impede accurate customer profiling; (2) dynamic feature entanglement challenges in modeling nonlinear price elasticity and time-varying attributes; (3) operational infeasibility caused by multi-tier business constraints.
  Our framework introduces a tri-level architecture for above challenges. We design a hybrid knowledge fusion engine employing large language models (LLMs) for deep semantic parsing of unstructured text, transforming distributor agreements and sales assessments into structured features while integrating managerial expertise. Then a game-theoretic constrained optimization mechanism is employed to dynamically reconcile supply chain interests through bilateral utility functions, encoding manufacturer-distributor profit redistribution as endogenous objectives under hierarchical constraints. Finally an interpretable decision distillation interface leveraging LLM-guided symbolic regression to find and optimize pricing strategies and auditable business rules embeds economic priors (e.g. non-negative elasticity) as hard constraints during mathematical expression search. We validate the framework in real retail environments achieving higher profits versus systematic B2C baselines while ensuring operational feasibility. This establishes a close-loop pipeline unifying unstructured knowledge injection, multi-agent optimization, and interpretable strategy synthesis for real economic intelligence.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in large-scale language and vision models, AI agents still suffer from a fundamental limitation: they cannot remember. Without reliable memory, agents catastrophically forget past experiences, struggle with long-horizon reasoning, and fail to operate coherently in multimodal or interactive environments. We introduce MemVerse, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play memory framework that bridges fast parametric recall with hierarchical retrieval-based memory, enabling scalable and adaptive multimodal intelligence. MemVerse maintains short-term memory for recent context while transforming raw multimodal experiences into structured long-term memories organized as hierarchical knowledge graphs. This design supports continual consolidation, adaptive forgetting, and bounded memory growth. To handle real-time demands, MemVerse introduces a periodic distillation mechanism that compresses essential knowledge from long-term memory into the parametric model, allowing fast, differentiable recall while preserving interpretability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MemVerse significantly improves multimodal reasoning and continual learning efficiency, empowering agents to remember, adapt, and reason coherently across extended interactions.

Motivation: 当前基于LLM的AHD研究通常仅考虑单一角色，限制了启发式的多样性和质量。RoCo旨在通过多角色协作提升AHD的多样性和性能。

Method: RoCo协调四个专门化的LLM引导代理（探索者、开发者、批评者和整合者），通过多轮反馈、精炼和精英突变的结构化过程，生成高质量启发式。

Result: 在五种不同COPs的白盒和黑盒设置下，RoCo生成的启发式优于现有方法（如ReEvo和HSEvo），表现卓越。

Conclusion: RoCo通过多角色协作的范式，为自动启发式设计（AHD）建立了新的标准，展示了在组合优化问题（COPs）中的卓越性能。

Abstract: Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) has gained traction as a promising solution for solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged and become a promising approach to achieving AHD, but current LLM-based AHD research often only considers a single role. This paper proposes RoCo, a novel Multi-Agent Role-Based System, to enhance the diversity and quality of AHD through multi-role collaboration. RoCo coordinates four specialized LLM-guided agents-explorer, exploiter, critic, and integrator-to collaboratively generate high-quality heuristics. The explorer promotes long-term potential through creative, diversity-driven thinking, while the exploiter focuses on short-term improvements via conservative, efficiency-oriented refinements. The critic evaluates the effectiveness of each evolution step and provides targeted feedback and reflection. The integrator synthesizes proposals from the explorer and exploiter, balancing innovation and exploitation to drive overall progress. These agents interact in a structured multi-round process involving feedback, refinement, and elite mutations guided by both short-term and accumulated long-term reflections. We evaluate RoCo on five different COPs under both white-box and black-box settings. Experimental results demonstrate that RoCo achieves superior performance, consistently generating competitive heuristics that outperform existing methods including ReEvo and HSEvo, both in white-box and black-box scenarios. This role-based collaborative paradigm establishes a new standard for robust and high-performing AHD.

Abstract: Recent advances in Omni models have enabled unified multimodal perception and generation. However, most existing systems still exhibit rigid reasoning behaviors, either overthinking simple problems or failing to reason when necessary. To address this limitation, we propose Omni-AutoThink, a novel adaptive reasoning framework that dynamically adjusts the model's reasoning depth according to task difficulty. Our framework comprises two stages: (1) an Adaptive Supervised Fine-Tuning (Adaptive SFT) stage, which endows the Omni model with fundamental reasoning capability using large-scale reasoning-augmented data, and (2) an Adaptive Reinforcement Learning (Adaptive GRPO) stage, which optimizes reasoning behaviors based on task complexity and reward feedback. We further construct a comprehensive adaptive reasoning benchmark that spans text-only, text-audio, text-visual, and text-audio-visual modalities, providing both training and evaluation splits for multimodal reasoning assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly improves adaptive reasoning performance compared to previous baselines. All benchmark data and code will be publicly released.

Result: 在DeepResearch Bench上使用RACE框架评估，配置Depth=2、Breadth=5时，总体得分为34.72，实验显示增加Depth和Breadth可提升研究深度和评分。

Conclusion: Static-DRA通过用户可调的Depth和Breadth参数，提供了对研究深度和广度的精细控制，平衡了研究质量与计算成本，并通过实验验证了参数增加对研究深度和评分的正向影响。

Abstract: The advancement in Large Language Models has driven the creation of complex agentic systems, such as Deep Research Agents (DRAs), to overcome the limitations of static Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines in handling complex, multi-turn research tasks. This paper introduces the Static Deep Research Agent (Static-DRA), a novel solution built upon a configurable and hierarchical Tree-based static workflow.
  The core contribution is the integration of two user-tunable parameters, Depth and Breadth, which provide granular control over the research intensity. This design allows end-users to consciously balance the desired quality and comprehensiveness of the research report against the associated computational cost of Large Language Model (LLM) interactions. The agent's architecture, comprising Supervisor, Independent, and Worker agents, facilitates effective multi-hop information retrieval and parallel sub-topic investigation.
  We evaluate the Static-DRA against the established DeepResearch Bench using the RACE (Reference-based Adaptive Criteria-driven Evaluation) framework. Configured with a depth of 2 and a breadth of 5, and powered by the gemini-2.5-pro model, the agent achieved an overall score of 34.72. Our experiments validate that increasing the configured Depth and Breadth parameters results in a more in-depth research process and a correspondingly higher evaluation score. The Static-DRA offers a pragmatic and resource-aware solution, empowering users with transparent control over the deep research process.

### [140] [Autonomous Agents and Policy Compliance: A Framework for Reasoning About Penalties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03931)
*Vineel Tummala,Daniela Inclezan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于逻辑编程的框架，用于政策感知自主代理，通过惩罚机制和ASP推理，生成高质量计划并模拟非合规行为，实验结果显示了其在决策和政策改进中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注确保合规性，而该论文探讨了在实现高风险目标时可能需要偏离策略的情况，并模拟非合规行为以辅助政策制定者理解现实决策。

Method: 该框架扩展了Gelfond和Lobo的授权和义务策略语言（AOPL），以纳入惩罚机制，并集成了答案集编程（ASP）进行推理。此外，还开发了从扩展AOPL到ASP的自动翻译，并改进了基于ASP的规划算法以考虑惩罚。

Conclusion: 该论文的框架通过引入基于惩罚的推理，能够生成更高质量的计划，避免有害行为，并在某些情况下提高计算效率，展现了其在增强自主决策和指导政策改进方面的潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a logic programming-based framework for policy-aware autonomous agents that can reason about potential penalties for non-compliance and act accordingly. While prior work has primarily focused on ensuring compliance, our approach considers scenarios where deviating from policies may be necessary to achieve high-stakes goals. Additionally, modeling non-compliant behavior can assist policymakers by simulating realistic human decision-making. Our framework extends Gelfond and Lobo's Authorization and Obligation Policy Language (AOPL) to incorporate penalties and integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) for reasoning. Compared to previous approaches, our method ensures well-formed policies, accounts for policy priorities, and enhances explainability by explicitly identifying rule violations and their consequences. Building on the work of Harders and Inclezan, we introduce penalty-based reasoning to distinguish between non-compliant plans, prioritizing those with minimal repercussions. To support this, we develop an automated translation from the extended AOPL into ASP and refine ASP-based planning algorithms to account for incurred penalties. Experiments in two domains demonstrate that our framework generates higher-quality plans that avoid harmful actions while, in some cases, also improving computational efficiency. These findings underscore its potential for enhancing autonomous decision-making and informing policy refinement. Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).

TL;DR: TokenScale是一种新型自动扩展框架，通过Token Velocity和Convertible Decoders优化LLM服务性能，显著提升SLO达标率并降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动扩展策略无法有效应对现代工作负载的突发性，导致性能下降和资源浪费。

Method: TokenScale框架引入了两个创新：Token Velocity作为系统背压的领先指标，以及Convertible Decoders实现动态任务执行。

Result: 在GPU集群上的生产环境测试中，TokenScale将SLO达标率从50-88%提升至80-96%，并降低成本4-14%。

Conclusion: TokenScale通过结合预测性指标和灵活的系统设计，显著提升了分解式LLM服务基础设施的性能和效率。

Abstract: The architectural shift to prefill/decode (PD) disaggregation in LLM serving improves resource utilization but struggles with the bursty nature of modern workloads. Existing autoscaling policies, often retrofitted from monolithic systems like those in AIBrix and DistServe, rely on lagging indicators such as GPU utilization or coarse-grained request counts. This results in slow reactions to load spikes, leading to significant Time-to First-Token (TTFT) and Time-Per-Output-Token (TPOT) SLO violations and costly over-provisioning. We introduce TokenScale, an autoscaling framework that resolves this performance mismatch through two innovations. First, we propose Token Velocity, a novel metric that unifies the prefill, network, and decode stages by quantifying their rate of work. As a leading indicator of system backpressure, it enables proactive scaling. Second, Convertible Decoders allow decoder GPUs to dynamically execute prefill tasks during traffic spikes, creating a rapid-response buffer that absorbs bursts and eliminates the initialization latency of new prefillers. Our evaluation on a GPU cluster with production traces shows TokenScale improves SLO attainment from 50-88% to 80-96% and reduces costs by 4-14% over state-of-the-art systems, including DistServe, BlitzScale, and AIBrix. By uniting a predictive metric with a flexible system design, TokenScale significantly boosts the performance and efficiency of disaggregated LLM serving infrastructure.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a double-edge-assisted computation offloading and resource allocation scheme tailored for space-air-marine integrated networks (SAMINs). Specifically, we consider a scenario where both unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and a low earth orbit (LEO) satellite are equipped with edge servers, providing computing services for maritime autonomous surface ships (MASSs). Partial computation workloads of MASSs can be offloaded to both UAVs and the LEO satellite, concurrently, for processing via a multi-access approach. To minimize the energy consumption of SAMINs under latency constraints, we formulate an optimization problem and propose energy efficient algorithms to jointly optimize offloading mode, offloading volume, and computing resource allocation of the LEO satellite and the UAVs, respectively. We further exploit an alternating optimization (AO) method and a layered approach to decompose the original problem to attain the optimal solutions. Finally, we conduct simulations to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme in comparison with benchmark algorithms.

Result: 基准测试表明，考虑不同的粒子交互顺序在运行时可以显著提升力计算的性能。

Abstract: Molecular Dynamics simulations can help scientists to gather valuable insights for physical processes on an atomic scale. This work explores various techniques for SIMD vectorization to improve the pairwise force calculation between molecules in the scope of the particle simulation library AutoPas. The focus lies on the order in which particle values are loaded into vector registers to achieve the most optimal performance regarding execution time or energy consumption.
  As previous work indicates that the optimal MD algorithm can change during runtime, this paper investigates simulation-specific parameters like particle density and the impact of the neighbor identification algorithms, which distinguishes this work from related projects. Furthermore, AutoPas' dynamic tuning mechanism is extended to choose the optimal vectorization order during runtime.
  The benchmarks show that considering different particle interaction orders during runtime can lead to a considerable performance improvement for the force calculation compared to AutoPas' previous approach.

Abstract: Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have introduced new requirements for efficient and robust training. As LLM clusters scale, node failures, lengthy recoveries, and bulky checkpoints erode efficiency. Infrequent asynchronous checkpoints trigger costly rollbacks, yet higher frequencies add prohibitive overhead. To address these challenges, we propose FFTrainer, a system designed for robust LLM training. FFTrainer leverages surplus network capacity to quickly save and load states, thereby preventing rollbacks and accelerating recovery. Compared with prior checkpointing approaches, FFTrainer reduces recovery time by up to 98% and mitigates GPU utilization loss by up to 68% without hindering normal training.

Abstract: Network Interface Cards (NICs) are one of the key enablers of the modern Internet. They serve as gateways for connecting computing devices to networks for the exchange of data with other devices. Recently, the pervasive nature of Internet-enabled devices coupled with the growing demands for faster network access have necessitated the enhancement of NICs to Smart NICs (SNICs), capable of processing enormous volumes of data at near real-time speed. However, despite their popularity, the exact use and applicability of SNICs remains an ongoing debate. These debates are exacerbated by the incorporation of accelerators into SNIC, allowing them to relieve their host's CPUs of various tasks. In this work, we carry out a chronological analysis of SNICs, using 370 articles published in the past 15 years, from 2010 to 2024, to gain some insight into SNICs; and shed some light on their evolution, manufacturers, use cases, and application domains.

Motivation: 传统MCMC方法在复杂构型空间采样精度不足，Parallel Tempering虽提高精度但计算成本高，需通过并行化解决。

Method: 使用OpenMP和CUDA分别在现代CPU和GPU上并行化Metropolis-Hastings与Parallel Tempering算法。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于OpenMP和CUDA的并行Metropolis-Hastings与Parallel Tempering实现，展示了在48核CPU上最高52倍加速和在GPU上986倍加速的效果，为未来量子算法实现提供了基准。

Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods are algorithms used to sample probability distributions, commonly used to sample the Boltzmann distribution of physical/chemical models (e.g., protein folding, Ising model, etc.). This allows us to study their properties by sampling the most probable states of those systems. However, the sampling capabilities of these methods are not sufficiently accurate when handling complex configuration spaces. This has resulted in the development of new techniques that improve sampling accuracy, usually at the expense of increasing the computational cost. One of such techniques is Parallel Tempering which improves accuracy by running several replicas which periodically exchange their states. Computationally, this imposes a significant slow-down, which can be counteracted by means of parallelization. These schemes enable MCMC/PT techniques to be run more effectively and allow larger models to be studied. In this work, we present a parallel implementation of Metropolis-Hastings with Parallel Tempering, using OpenMP and CUDA for the parallelization in modern CPUs and GPUs, respectively. The results show a maximum speed-up of 52x using OpenMP with 48 cores, and of 986x speed-up with the CUDA version. Furthermore, the results serve as a basic benchmark to compare a future quantum implementation of the same algorithm.

TL;DR: OD-MoE 是一种分布式MoE推理框架，通过动态加载专家和准确预测，显著提升边缘设备的GPU内存利用率，支持低内存设备运行MoE模型。


<details>

Motivation: 解决Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)在低内存边缘设备上部署时面临的GPU内存利用率不足问题。

Method: OD-MoE 是一个分布式MoE推理框架，基于两个关键机制：1) 在分布式边缘节点上并行化专家加载与计算；2) 使用超准确的模拟预测器提前多层预测专家激活。

Result: OD-MoE 实现了99.94%的专家激活预测准确率，解码速度达到完全GPU缓存部署的75%，同时仅使用1/3的GPU内存。

Conclusion: OD-MoE 通过消除专家缓存的需求，使得在GPU内存不足1GB的边缘节点上运行MoE推理成为可能，为低成本物联网设备在LLM时代的实际部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), while offering significant advantages as a Large Language Model (LLM) architecture, faces substantial challenges when deployed on low-cost edge devices with tight memory constraints. Expert offloading mitigates this issue by storing expert parameters in CPU memory and caching a subset of popular experts in GPU memory. Although this approach improves GPU memory utilization by caching only the likely-used experts, the GPU memory reserved for expert caching is underutilized compared with dense LLMs. This paper presents OD-MoE, a distributed MoE inference framework that obviates the need for expert caches via fully on-demand expert loading. OD-MoE is built upon two key mechanisms: 1) parallelizing expert loading and expert computation across distributed edge nodes, and 2) an ultra-accurate emulative predictor that forecasts expert activations multiple layers ahead while expert computation is ongoing. With these innovations, OD-MoE dynamically loads each target expert to one of the distributed nodes just-in-time before its activation and promptly evicts it afterward, freeing GPU memory for subsequent experts. We comprehensively benchmark OD-MoE against state-of-the-art MoE offloading systems on a ten-node testbed. Experimental results show that: 1) OD-MoE achieves 99.94% expert activation prediction accuracy, substantially surpassing all existing methods; and 2) OD-MoE delivers approximately 75% of the decoding speed of a fully GPU-cached MoE deployment while using only 1/3 of the GPU memory. More importantly, by eliminating the need for expert caches, OD-MoE enables MoE inference on edge nodes with less-than-1GB GPU memory, paving the way for practical MoE deployment of low-cost IoT devices at the edge in the LLM era.

Conclusion: LATTICE框架通过VoxSet表示和两阶段生成流程，显著提升了3D资产生成的质量和可扩展性，为高质量、可扩展的3D资产创建提供了重要进展。

Abstract: We present LATTICE, a new framework for high-fidelity 3D asset generation that bridges the quality and scalability gap between 3D and 2D generative models. While 2D image synthesis benefits from fixed spatial grids and well-established transformer architectures, 3D generation remains fundamentally more challenging due to the need to predict both spatial structure and detailed geometric surfaces from scratch. These challenges are exacerbated by the computational complexity of existing 3D representations and the lack of structured and scalable 3D asset encoding schemes. To address this, we propose VoxSet, a semi-structured representation that compresses 3D assets into a compact set of latent vectors anchored to a coarse voxel grid, enabling efficient and position-aware generation. VoxSet retains the simplicity and compression advantages of prior VecSet methods while introducing explicit structure into the latent space, allowing positional embeddings to guide generation and enabling strong token-level test-time scaling. Built upon this representation, LATTICE adopts a two-stage pipeline: first generating a sparse voxelized geometry anchor, then producing detailed geometry using a rectified flow transformer. Our method is simple at its core, but supports arbitrary resolution decoding, low-cost training, and flexible inference schemes, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various aspects, and offering a significant step toward scalable, high-quality 3D asset creation.

Abstract: We introduce radiance meshes, a technique for representing radiance fields with constant density tetrahedral cells produced with a Delaunay tetrahedralization. Unlike a Voronoi diagram, a Delaunay tetrahedralization yields simple triangles that are natively supported by existing hardware. As such, our model is able to perform exact and fast volume rendering using both rasterization and ray-tracing. We introduce a new rasterization method that achieves faster rendering speeds than all prior radiance field representations (assuming an equivalent number of primitives and resolution) across a variety of platforms. Optimizing the positions of Delaunay vertices introduces topological discontinuities (edge flips). To solve this, we use a Zip-NeRF-style backbone which allows us to express a smoothly varying field even when the topology changes. Our rendering method exactly evaluates the volume rendering equation and enables high quality, real-time view synthesis on standard consumer hardware. Our tetrahedral meshes also lend themselves to a variety of exciting applications including fisheye lens distortion, physics-based simulation, editing, and mesh extraction.

Abstract: The deployment of multi-agent systems in dynamic, adversarial environments like robotic soccer necessitates real-time decision-making, sophisticated cooperation, and scalable algorithms to avoid the curse of dimensionality. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising framework, existing methods often struggle with the multi-granularity of tasks (long-term strategy vs. instant actions) and the complexity of large-scale agent interactions. This paper presents a unified Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework that addresses these challenges. First, we establish a baseline using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) within a client-server architecture for real-time action scheduling, with PPO demonstrating superior performance (4.32 avg. goals, 82.9% ball control). Second, we introduce a Hierarchical RL (HRL) structure based on the options framework to decompose the problem into a high-level trajectory planning layer (modeled as a Semi-Markov Decision Process) and a low-level action execution layer, improving global strategy (avg. goals increased to 5.26). Finally, to ensure scalability, we integrate mean-field theory into the HRL framework, simplifying many-agent interactions into a single agent vs. the population average. Our mean-field actor-critic method achieves a significant performance boost (5.93 avg. goals, 89.1% ball control, 92.3% passing accuracy) and enhanced training stability. Extensive simulations of 4v4 matches in the Webots environment validate our approach, demonstrating its potential for robust, scalable, and cooperative behavior in complex multi-agent domains.

Abstract: Large robot fleets are now common in warehouses and other logistics settings, where small control gains translate into large operational impacts. In this article, we address task scheduling for lifelong Multi-Agent Pickup-and-Delivery (MAPD) and propose a hybrid method that couples learning-based global guidance with lightweight optimization. A graph neural network policy trained via reinforcement learning outputs a desired distribution of free agents over an aggregated warehouse graph. This signal is converted into region-to-region rebalancing through a minimum-cost flow, and finalized by small, local assignment problems, preserving accuracy while keeping per-step latency within a 1 s compute budget. On congested warehouse benchmarks from the League of Robot Runners (LRR) with up to 500 agents, our approach improves throughput by up to 10% over the 2024 winning scheduler while maintaining real-time execution. The results indicate that coupling graph-structured learned guidance with tractable solvers reduces congestion and yields a practical, scalable blueprint for high-throughput scheduling in large fleets.

Abstract: Long-horizon dynamical prediction is fundamental in robotics and control, underpinning canonical methods like model predictive control. Yet, many systems and disturbance phenomena are difficult to model due to effects like nonlinearity, chaos, and high-dimensionality. Koopman theory addresses this by modeling the linear evolution of embeddings of the state under an infinite-dimensional linear operator that can be approximated with a suitable finite basis of embedding functions, effectively trading model nonlinearity for representational complexity. However, explicitly computing a good choice of basis is nontrivial, and poor choices may cause inaccurate forecasts or overfitting. To address this, we present Kalman-Implicit Koopman Operator (KALIKO) Learning, a method that leverages the Kalman filter to implicitly learn embeddings corresponding to latent dynamics without requiring an explicit encoder. KALIKO produces interpretable representations consistent with both theory and prior works, yielding high-quality reconstructions and inducing a globally linear latent dynamics. Evaluated on wave data generated by a high-dimensional PDE, KALIKO surpasses several baselines in open-loop prediction and in a demanding closed-loop simulated control task: stabilizing an underactuated manipulator's payload by predicting and compensating for strong wave disturbances.

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) holds great potential for learning repetitive manipulation tasks, such as those in industrial assembly. However, its effectiveness is often limited by insufficient trajectory precision due to compounding errors. In this paper, we introduce Grasped Object Manifold Projection (GOMP), an interactive method that mitigates these errors by constraining a non-rigidly grasped object to a lower-dimensional manifold. GOMP assumes a precise task in which a manipulator holds an object that may shift within the grasp in an observable manner and must be mated with a grounded part. Crucially, all GOMP enhancements are learned from the same expert dataset used to train the base IL policy, and are adjusted with an n-arm bandit-based interactive component. We propose a theoretical basis for GOMP's improvement upon the well-known compounding error bound in IL literature. We demonstrate the framework on four precise assembly tasks using tactile feedback, and note that the approach remains modality-agnostic.

Conclusion: Surfel-LIO通过预计算surfel表示和层次化体素结构（hVox），实现了O(1)的对应关系检索，显著提升了处理速度，同时保持了与现有方法相当的姿态估计精度。

Abstract: LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) is an active research area, as it enables accurate real-time state estimation in GPS-denied environments. Recent advances in map data structures and spatial indexing have significantly improved the efficiency of LIO systems. Nevertheless, we observe that two aspects may still leave room for improvement: (1) nearest neighbor search often requires examining multiple spatial units to gather sufficient points for plane fitting, and (2) plane parameters are typically recomputed at every iteration despite unchanged map geometry. Motivated by these observations, we propose Surfel-LIO, which employs a hierarchical voxel structure (hVox) with pre-computed surfel representation. This design enables O(1) correspondence retrieval without runtime neighbor enumeration or plane fitting, combined with Z-order curve encoding for cache-friendly spatial indexing. Experimental results on the M3DGR dataset demonstrate that our method achieves significantly faster processing speed compared to recent state-of-the-art methods while maintaining comparable state estimation accuracy. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/93won/lidar_inertial_odometry.

Conclusion: 本文总结了机器人领域现有的场景表示方法，并探讨了未来发展趋势，特别是3D基础模型作为统一解决方案的潜力。同时，指出了实现这一模型的剩余挑战，并提供了开源项目以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of existing scene representation methods for robotics, covering traditional representations such as point clouds, voxels, signed distance functions (SDF), and scene graphs, as well as more recent neural representations like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), and the emerging Foundation Models. While current SLAM and localization systems predominantly rely on sparse representations like point clouds and voxels, dense scene representations are expected to play a critical role in downstream tasks such as navigation and obstacle avoidance. Moreover, neural representations such as NeRF, 3DGS, and foundation models are well-suited for integrating high-level semantic features and language-based priors, enabling more comprehensive 3D scene understanding and embodied intelligence. In this paper, we categorized the core modules of robotics into five parts (Perception, Mapping, Localization, Navigation, Manipulation). We start by presenting the standard formulation of different scene representation methods and comparing the advantages and disadvantages of scene representation across different modules. This survey is centered around the question: What is the best 3D scene representation for robotics? We then discuss the future development trends of 3D scene representations, with a particular focus on how the 3D Foundation Model could replace current methods as the unified solution for future robotic applications. The remaining challenges in fully realizing this model are also explored. We aim to offer a valuable resource for both newcomers and experienced researchers to explore the future of 3D scene representations and their application in robotics. We have published an open-source project on GitHub and will continue to add new works and technologies to this project.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于DreamerV3和MLP-VAE的模型强化学习框架，有效编码高维LIDAR数据，显著提升了地面机器人的导航效率和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地面机器人使用强化学习从LIDAR观测中实现自主导航仍具挑战性，主要由于传感器数据的高维性和模型无关方法的样本效率低下。传统策略网络难以处理全分辨率LIDAR输入，迫使先前研究依赖简化观测，降低了空间意识和导航鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 整合预测性世界模型与学习的潜在表征，能够从高维感官数据中实现更高效和鲁棒的导航。

Abstract: Autonomous navigation of terrestrial robots using Reinforcement Learning (RL) from LIDAR observations remains challenging due to the high dimensionality of sensor data and the sample inefficiency of model-free approaches. Conventional policy networks struggle to process full-resolution LIDAR inputs, forcing prior works to rely on simplified observations that reduce spatial awareness and navigation robustness. This paper presents a novel model-based RL framework built on top of the DreamerV3 algorithm, integrating a Multi-Layer Perceptron Variational Autoencoder (MLP-VAE) within a world model to encode high-dimensional LIDAR readings into compact latent representations. These latent features, combined with a learned dynamics predictor, enable efficient imagination-based policy optimization. Experiments on simulated TurtleBot3 navigation tasks demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves faster convergence and higher success rate compared to model-free baselines such as SAC, DDPG, and TD3. It is worth emphasizing that the DreamerV3-based agent attains a 100% success rate across all evaluated environments when using the full dataset of the Turtlebot3 LIDAR (360 readings), while model-free methods plateaued below 85%. These findings demonstrate that integrating predictive world models with learned latent representations enables more efficient and robust navigation from high-dimensional sensory data.

Conclusion: 提出的MpiNetsFusion通过融合动作分块变换器显著提升了运动规划效率，并在大规模数据集上验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Deep learning methods have significantly enhanced motion planning for robotic manipulators by leveraging prior experiences within planning datasets. However, state-of-the-art neural motion planners are primarily trained on small datasets collected in manually generated workspaces, limiting their generalizability to out-of-distribution scenarios. Additionally, these planners often rely on monolithic network architectures that struggle to encode critical planning information. To address these challenges, we introduce Motion Policy with Dataset Synthesis powered by large language models (LLMs) and Fusion Action-Chunking Transformers (PerFACT), which incorporates two key components. Firstly, a novel LLM-powered workspace generation method, MotionGeneralizer, enables large-scale planning data collection by producing a diverse set of semantically feasible workspaces. Secondly, we introduce Fusion Motion Policy Networks (MpiNetsFusion), a generalist neural motion planner that uses a fusion action-chunking transformer to better encode planning signals and attend to multiple feature modalities. Leveraging MotionGeneralizer, we collect 3.5M trajectories to train and evaluate MpiNetsFusion against state-of-the-art planners, which shows that the proposed MpiNetsFusion can plan several times faster on the evaluated tasks.

TL;DR: A multi-label graph framework improves robot localization by leveraging semantic context and likelihood propagation, tested in varied environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate the errors in robot localization caused by high semantic ambiguity and object misclassification.

Method: A multi-label graph representation is used to capture semantic context, combined with context-aware likelihood propagation to enhance semantic correspondence.

Result: The approach shows improved performance in both closed-set and open-set detection configurations and scales well to large-vocabulary object categories in real-world and synthetic environments.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-label likelihood-based semantic graph matching framework effectively addresses semantic ambiguity in robot localization, improving both data association and pose estimation accuracy.

Abstract: Robots are often required to localize in environments with unknown object classes and semantic ambiguity. However, when performing global localization using semantic objects, high semantic ambiguity intensifies object misclassification and increases the likelihood of incorrect associations, which in turn can cause significant errors in the estimated pose. Thus, in this letter, we propose a multi-label likelihood-based semantic graph matching framework for object-level global localization. The key idea is to exploit multi-label graph representations, rather than single-label alternatives, to capture and leverage the inherent semantic context of object observations. Based on these representations, our approach enhances semantic correspondence across graphs by combining the likelihood of each node with the maximum likelihood of its neighbors via context-aware likelihood propagation. For rigorous validation, data association and pose estimation performance are evaluated under both closed-set and open-set detection configurations. In addition, we demonstrate the scalability of our approach to large-vocabulary object categories in both real-world indoor scenes and synthetic environments.

Abstract: World Foundation Models (WFMs) offer remarkable visual dynamics simulation capabilities, yet their application to precise robotic control remains limited by the gap between generative realism and control-oriented precision. While existing approaches use WFMs as synthetic data generators, they suffer from high computational costs and underutilization of pre-trained VLA policies. We introduce \textbf{AdaPower} (\textbf{Ada}pt and Em\textbf{power}), a lightweight adaptation framework that transforms general-purpose WFMs into specialist world models through two novel components: Temporal-Spatial Test-Time Training (TS-TTT) for inference-time adaptation and Memory Persistence (MP) for long-horizon consistency. Integrated within a Model Predictive Control framework, our adapted world model empowers pre-trained VLAs, achieving over 41\% improvement in task success rates on LIBERO benchmarks without policy retraining, while preserving computational efficiency and generalist capabilities.

Abstract: Transition control poses a critical challenge in Vertical Take-Off and Landing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (VTOL UAV) development due to the tilting rotor mechanism, which shifts the center of gravity and thrust direction during transitions. Current control methods' decoupled control of altitude and position leads to significant vibration, and limits interaction consideration and adaptability. In this study, we propose a novel coupled transition control methodology based on reinforcement learning (RL) driven controller. Besides, contrasting to the conventional phase-transition approach, the ST3M method demonstrates a new perspective by treating cruise mode as a special case of hover. We validate the feasibility of applying our method in simulation and real-world environments, demonstrating efficient controller development and migration while accurately controlling UAV position and attitude, exhibiting outstanding trajectory tracking and reduced vibrations during the transition process.

Conclusion: RoboScape-R框架通过引入基于世界模型的内生奖励机制，显著提升了具身策略的泛化能力，并在跨域场景中平均性能提升37.5%。

Abstract: Achieving generalizable embodied policies remains a key challenge. Traditional policy learning paradigms, including both Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), struggle to cultivate generalizability across diverse scenarios. While IL policies often overfit to specific expert trajectories, RL suffers from the inherent lack of a unified and general reward signal necessary for effective multi-scene generalization. We posit that the world model is uniquely capable of serving as a universal environment proxy to address this limitation. However, current world models primarily focus on their ability to predict observations and still rely on task-specific, handcrafted reward functions, thereby failing to provide a truly general training environment. Toward this problem, we propose RoboScape-R, a framework leveraging the world model to serve as a versatile, general-purpose proxy for the embodied environment within the RL paradigm. We introduce a novel world model-based general reward mechanism that generates ''endogenous'' rewards derived from the model's intrinsic understanding of real-world state transition dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboScape-R effectively addresses the limitations of traditional RL methods by providing an efficient and general training environment that substantially enhances the generalization capability of embodied policies. Our approach offers critical insights into utilizing the world model as an online training strategy and achieves an average 37.5% performance improvement over baselines under out-of-domain scenarios.

Abstract: Motion planning schemes are used for planning motions of a manipulator from an initial pose to a final pose during a task execution. A motion planning scheme generally comprises of a trajectory planning method and an inverse kinematic solver to determine trajectories and joints solutions respectively. In this paper, 3 motion planning schemes developed based on Jacobian methods are implemented to traverse a redundant manipulator with a coupled finger gripper through given trajectories. RRT* algorithm is used for planning trajectories and screw theory based forward kinematic equations are solved for determining joint solutions of the manipulator and gripper. Inverse solutions are computed separately using 3 Jacobian based methods such as Jacobian Transpose (JT), Pseudo Inverse (PI), and Damped Least Square (DLS) methods. Space Jacobian and manipulability measurements of the manipulator and gripper are obtained using screw theory formulations. Smoothness and RMSE error of generated trajectories and velocity continuity, acceleration profile, jerk, and snap values of joint motions are analysed for determining an efficient motion planning method for a given task. Advantages and disadvantages of the proposed motion planning schemes mentioned above are analysed using simulation studies to determine a suitable inverse solution technique for the tasks.

Motivation: To achieve gentle, cage-like grasping of tomatoes for autonomous harvesting, addressing challenges like occlusion and variable illumination.

Method: The system combines a hybrid gripper with soft auxetic fingers and a rigid exoskeleton, driven by a servo-actuated Scotch-yoke mechanism. It uses an RGB-D camera and Detectron2-based pipeline for perception, and closed-loop grasp-force regulation with PID control. Trajectory planning is done via PSO for a 5-DOF manipulator.

Result: The system achieves an average cycle time of 24.34 seconds and an 80% success rate, with grasp forces maintained between 0.20-0.50 N.

Conclusion: The paper validates the hybrid robotic gripper and integrated vision-control pipeline for reliable tomato harvesting in cluttered environments, demonstrating an 80% success rate and low grasp forces.

Abstract: This paper presents an autonomous tomato-harvesting system built around a hybrid robotic gripper that combines six soft auxetic fingers with a rigid exoskeleton and a latex basket to achieve gentle, cage-like grasping. The gripper is driven by a servo-actuated Scotch--yoke mechanism, and includes separator leaves that form a conical frustum for fruit isolation, with an integrated micro-servo cutter for pedicel cutting. For perception, an RGB--D camera and a Detectron2-based pipeline perform semantic segmentation of ripe/unripe tomatoes and keypoint localization of the pedicel and fruit center under occlusion and variable illumination. An analytical model derived using the principle of virtual work relates servo torque to grasp force, enabling design-level reasoning about actuation requirements. During execution, closed-loop grasp-force regulation is achieved using a proportional--integral--derivative controller with feedback from force-sensitive resistors mounted on selected fingers to prevent slip and bruising. Motion execution is supported by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)--based trajectory planning for a 5-DOF manipulator. Experiments demonstrate complete picking cycles (approach, separation, cutting, grasping, transport, release) with an average cycle time of 24.34~s and an overall success rate of approximately 80\%, while maintaining low grasp forces (0.20--0.50~N). These results validate the proposed hybrid gripper and integrated vision--control pipeline for reliable harvesting in cluttered environments.

Abstract: In collaborative human-robot tasks, safety requires not only avoiding collisions but also ensuring safe, intentional physical contact. We present ContactRL, a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework that directly incorporates contact safety into the reward function through force feedback. This enables a robot to learn adaptive motion profiles that minimize human-robot contact forces while maintaining task efficiency. In simulation, ContactRL achieves a low safety violation rate of 0.2\% with a high task success rate of 87.7\%, outperforming state-of-the-art constrained RL baselines. In order to guarantee deployment safety, we augment the learned policy with a kinetic energy based Control Barrier Function (eCBF) shield. Real-world experiments on an UR3e robotic platform performing small object handovers from a human hand across 360 trials confirm safe contact, with measured normal forces consistently below 10N. These results demonstrate that ContactRL enables safe and efficient physical collaboration, thereby advancing the deployment of collaborative robots in contact-rich tasks.

Abstract: The US Naval Research Laboratory's (NRL's) Autonomous Planning In-space Assembly Reinforcement-learning free-flYer (APIARY) experiment pioneers the use of reinforcement learning (RL) for control of free-flying robots in the zero-gravity (zero-G) environment of space. On Tuesday, May 27th 2025 the APIARY team conducted the first ever, to our knowledge, RL control of a free-flyer in space using the NASA Astrobee robot on-board the International Space Station (ISS). A robust 6-degrees of freedom (DOF) control policy was trained using an actor-critic Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) network within the NVIDIA Isaac Lab simulation environment, randomizing over goal poses and mass distributions to enhance robustness. This paper details the simulation testing, ground testing, and flight validation of this experiment. This on-orbit demonstration validates the transformative potential of RL for improving robotic autonomy, enabling rapid development and deployment (in minutes to hours) of tailored behaviors for space exploration, logistics, and real-time mission needs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) offers transformative potential for robotic control in space. We present the first on-orbit demonstration of RL-based autonomous control of a free-flying robot, the NASA Astrobee, aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Using NVIDIA's Omniverse physics simulator and curriculum learning, we trained a deep neural network to replace Astrobee's standard attitude and translation control, enabling it to navigate in microgravity. Our results validate a novel training pipeline that bridges the simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) gap, utilizing a GPU-accelerated, scientific-grade simulation environment for efficient Monte Carlo RL training.

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation is limited by both control and design, without consensus as to what makes manipulators best for performing dexterous tasks. This raises a fundamental challenge: how should we design and control robot manipulators that are optimized for dexterity? We present a co-design framework that learns task-specific hand morphology and complementary dexterous control policies. The framework supports 1) an expansive morphology search space including joint, finger, and palm generation, 2) scalable evaluation across the wide design space via morphology-conditioned cross-embodied control, and 3) real-world fabrication with accessible components. We evaluate the approach across multiple dexterous tasks, including in-hand rotation with simulation and real deployment. Our framework enables an end-to-end pipeline that can design, train, fabricate, and deploy a new robotic hand in under 24 hours. The full framework will be open-sourced and available on our website.

Addressing the former challenge, this paper investigates the extension of attention-based motion prediction models with navigation information. By integrating the ego vehicle's intended route and goal pose into the model architecture, we bridge the gap between multi-agent motion prediction and goal-based motion planning. We propose and evaluate several architectural navigation integration strategies to our model on the nuPlan dataset. Our results demonstrate the potential of prediction-driven motion planning, highlighting how navigation information can enhance both prediction and planning tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents an auto-tuning framework for torque-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (nMPC), where the MPC serves as a real-time controller for optimal joint torque commands. The MPC parameters, including cost function weights and low-level controller gains, are optimized using high-dimensional Bayesian Optimization (BO) techniques, specifically Sparse Axis-Aligned Subspace (SAASBO) with a digital twin (DT) to achieve precise end-effector trajectory real-time tracking on an UR10e robot arm. The simulation model allows efficient exploration of the high-dimensional parameter space, and it ensures safe transfer to hardware. Our simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in tracking performance (+41.9%) and reduction in solve times (-2.5%) compared to manually-tuned parameters. Moreover, experimental validation on the real robot follows the trend (with a +25.8% improvement), emphasizing the importance of digital twin-enabled automated parameter optimization for robotic operations.

Conclusion: 通过结合模型预测控制（MPC）和安全强化学习（SRL），本研究提出了一种在自动驾驶中实现更安全和高效运动规划的方法。实验证明，该方法在高速公路场景中优于单独的MPC和SRL。

Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is widely used for motion planning, particularly in autonomous driving. Real-time capability of the planner requires utilizing convex approximation of optimal control problems (OCPs) for the planner. However, such approximations confine the solution to a subspace, which might not contain the global optimum. To address this, we propose using safe reinforcement learning (SRL) to obtain a new and safe reference trajectory within MPC. By employing a learning-based approach, the MPC can explore solutions beyond the close neighborhood of the previous one, potentially finding global optima. We incorporate constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) to ensure safety in automated driving, using a handcrafted energy function-based safety index as the constraint objective to model safe and unsafe regions. Our approach utilizes a state-dependent Lagrangian multiplier, learned concurrently with the safe policy, to solve the CRL problem. Through experimentation in a highway scenario, we demonstrate the superiority of our approach over both MPC and SRL in terms of safety and performance measures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶车辆在动态交互场景中缺乏对社交互动机制的理解，导致行为不够人性化。MPCFormer旨在解决这一问题。

Method: MPCFormer采用离散空间状态表示，嵌入物理先验，并通过Transformer架构从自然驾驶数据中学习动态系数，结合MPC框架优化规划。

Result: 在NGSIM数据集上，MPCFormer实现了最低的轨迹预测误差（ADE 0.86米），在闭环实验中规划成功率94.67%，效率提升15.75%，碰撞率从21.25%降至0.5%。

Conclusion: MPCFormer通过结合物理先验和数据驱动的社交互动动态，显著提升了自动驾驶车辆在动态交互场景中的表现，实现了更人性化的行为规划和更高的安全性。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) vehicles still struggle to exhibit human-like behavior in highly dynamic and interactive traffic scenarios. The key challenge lies in AD's limited ability to interact with surrounding vehicles, largely due to a lack of understanding the underlying mechanisms of social interaction. To address this issue, we introduce MPCFormer, an explainable socially-aware autonomous driving approach with physics-informed and data-driven coupled social interaction dynamics. In this model, the dynamics are formulated into a discrete space-state representation, which embeds physics priors to enhance modeling explainability. The dynamics coefficients are learned from naturalistic driving data via a Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture. To the best of our knowledge, MPCFormer is the first approach to explicitly model the dynamics of multi-vehicle social interactions. The learned social interaction dynamics enable the planner to generate manifold, human-like behaviors when interacting with surrounding traffic. By leveraging the MPC framework, the approach mitigates the potential safety risks typically associated with purely learning-based methods. Open-looped evaluation on NGSIM dataset demonstrates that MPCFormer achieves superior social interaction awareness, yielding the lowest trajectory prediction errors compared with other state-of-the-art approach. The prediction achieves an ADE as low as 0.86 m over a long prediction horizon of 5 seconds. Close-looped experiments in highly intense interaction scenarios, where consecutive lane changes are required to exit an off-ramp, further validate the effectiveness of MPCFormer. Results show that MPCFormer achieves the highest planning success rate of 94.67%, improves driving efficiency by 15.75%, and reduces the collision rate from 21.25% to 0.5%, outperforming a frontier Reinforcement Learning (RL) based planner.

Conclusion: 本文提出了IM HERE框架，有效建模了人机、人人和机机交互中的参与度，通过双边关系的努力描述，简化了关系模式，并提供了社交行为自动分析、建模和描述的方法。

Abstract: The effectiveness of human-robot interaction often hinges on the ability to cultivate engagement - a dynamic process of cognitive involvement that supports meaningful exchanges. Many existing definitions and models of engagement are either too vague or lack the ability to generalize across different contexts. We introduce IM HERE, a novel framework that models engagement effectively in human-human, human-robot, and robot-robot interactions. By employing an effort-based description of bilateral relationships between entities, we provide an accurate breakdown of relationship patterns, simplifying them to focus placement and four key states. This framework captures mutual relationships, group behaviors, and actions conforming to social norms, translating them into specific directives for autonomous systems. By integrating both subjective perceptions and objective states, the model precisely identifies and describes miscommunication. The primary objective of this paper is to automate the analysis, modeling, and description of social behavior, and to determine how autonomous systems can behave in accordance with social norms for full social integration while simultaneously pursuing their own social goals.

Abstract: Dexterous grasp generation aims to produce grasp poses that align with task requirements and human interpretable grasp semantics. However, achieving semantically controllable dexterous grasp synthesis remains highly challenging due to the lack of unified modeling of multiple semantic dimensions, including grasp taxonomy, contact semantics, and functional affordance. To address these limitations, we present OmniDexVLG, a multimodal, semantics aware grasp generation framework capable of producing structurally diverse and semantically coherent dexterous grasps under joint language and visual guidance. Our approach begins with OmniDexDataGen, a semantic rich dexterous grasp dataset generation pipeline that integrates grasp taxonomy guided configuration sampling, functional affordance contact point sampling, taxonomy aware differential force closure grasp sampling, and physics based optimization and validation, enabling systematic coverage of diverse grasp types. We further introduce OmniDexReasoner, a multimodal grasp type semantic reasoning module that leverages multi agent collaboration, retrieval augmented generation, and chain of thought reasoning to infer grasp related semantics and generate high quality annotations that align language instructions with task specific grasp intent. Building upon these components, we develop a unified Vision Language Grasping generation model that explicitly incorporates grasp taxonomy, contact structure, and functional affordance semantics, enabling fine grained control over grasp synthesis from natural language instructions. Extensive experiments in simulation and real world object grasping and ablation studies demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms state of the art approaches in terms of grasp diversity, contact semantic diversity, functional affordance diversity, and semantic consistency.

Abstract: Active suspension systems are critical for enhancing vehicle comfort, safety, and stability, yet their performance is often limited by fixed hardware designs and control strategies that cannot adapt to uncertain and dynamic operating conditions. Recent advances in digital twins (DTs) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offer new opportunities for real-time, data-driven optimization across a vehicle's lifecycle. However, integrating these technologies into a unified framework remains an open challenge. This work presents a DT-based control co-design (CCD) framework for full-vehicle active suspensions using multi-generation design concepts. By integrating automatic differentiation into DRL, we jointly optimize physical suspension components and control policies under varying driver behaviors and environmental uncertainties. DRL also addresses the challenge of partial observability, where only limited states can be sensed and fed back to the controller, by learning optimal control actions directly from available sensor information. The framework incorporates model updating with quantile learning to capture data uncertainty, enabling real-time decision-making and adaptive learning from digital-physical interactions. The approach demonstrates personalized optimization of suspension systems under two distinct driving settings (mild and aggressive). Results show that the optimized systems achieve smoother trajectories and reduce control efforts by approximately 43% and 52% for mild and aggressive, respectively, while maintaining ride comfort and stability. Contributions include: developing a DT-enabled CCD framework integrating DRL and uncertainty-aware model updating for full-vehicle active suspensions, introducing a multi-generation design strategy for self-improving systems, and demonstrating personalized optimization of active suspension systems for distinct driver types.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end pipeline for deploying reinforcement learning (RL) trained Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) on neuromorphic hardware by converting them into spiking Sigma-Delta Neural Networks (SDNNs). We demonstrate that an ANN policy trained entirely in simulation can be transformed into an SDNN compatible with Intel's Loihi 2 architecture, enabling low-latency and energy-efficient inference. As a test case, we use an RL policy for controlling the Astrobee free-flying robot, similar to a previously hardware in space-validated controller. The policy, trained with Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs), is converted to an SDNN and deployed on Intel's Loihi 2, then evaluated in NVIDIA's Omniverse Isaac Lab simulation environment for closed-loop control of Astrobee's motion. We compare execution performance between GPU and Loihi 2.

Motivation: 现有的VLA模型仅使用成功的演示数据，忽略了失败尝试中包含的脆弱性信息。这些信息可用于提升模型的鲁棒性。

Method: VINE采用分层强化学习框架，将高级推理（System 2）与低级控制（System 1）分离。System 2通过可行性引导的树搜索在2D场景图抽象上操作，预测成功概率并修剪脆弱分支，而System 1执行低级动作。

Conclusion: VINE模型通过利用失败数据作为结构化学习信号，显著提高了视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型的成功率和鲁棒性，证明了失败数据是提升VLA模型执行能力的关键资源。

Abstract: Prior Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are typically trained on teleoperated successful demonstrations, while discarding numerous failed attempts that occur naturally during data collection. However, these failures encode where and how policies can be fragile, information that can be exploited to improve robustness. We address this problem by leveraging mixed-quality datasets to learn failure-aware reasoning at planning time. We introduce VINE, a hierarchical vision-language-action model that separates high-level reasoning (System 2) from low-level control (System 1) under a hierarchical reinforcement learning formalism, making failures usable as a structured learning signal rather than noisy supervision. System 2 performs feasibility-guided tree search over a 2D scene-graph abstraction: it proposes subgoal transitions, predicts success probabilities from both successes and failures, and prunes brittle branches before execution, effectively casting plan evaluation as feasibility scoring. The selected subgoal sequence is then passed to System 1, which executes low-level actions without modifying the agent's core skills. Trained entirely from offline teleoperation data, VINE integrates negative experience directly into the decision loop. Across challenging manipulation tasks, this approach consistently improves success rates and robustness, demonstrating that failure data is an essential resource for converting the broad competence of VLAs into robust execution.

Conclusion: BIBeR框架通过将先进的运动预测与博弈论规划结合，显著提升了自动驾驶在密集城市交通中的交互能力，并在实验中表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Autonomous driving planning systems perform nearly perfectly in routine scenarios using lightweight, rule-based methods but still struggle in dense urban traffic, where lane changes and merges require anticipating and influencing other agents. Modern motion predictors offer highly accurate forecasts, yet their integration into planning is mostly rudimental: discarding unsafe plans. Similarly, end-to-end models offer a one-way integration that avoids the challenges of joint prediction and planning modeling under uncertainty. In contrast, game-theoretic formulations offer a principled alternative but have seen limited adoption in autonomous driving. We present Bayesian Iterative Best Response (BIBeR), a framework that unifies motion prediction and game-theoretic planning into a single interaction-aware process. BIBeR is the first to integrate a state-of-the-art predictor into an Iterative Best Response (IBR) loop, repeatedly refining the strategies of the ego vehicle and surrounding agents. This repeated best-response process approximates a Nash equilibrium, enabling bidirectional adaptation where the ego both reacts to and shapes the behavior of others. In addition, our proposed Bayesian confidence estimation quantifies prediction reliability and modulates update strength, more conservative under low confidence and more decisive under high confidence. BIBeR is compatible with modern predictors and planners, combining the transparency of structured planning with the flexibility of learned models. Experiments show that BIBeR achieves an 11% improvement over state-of-the-art planners on highly interactive interPlan lane-change scenarios, while also outperforming existing approaches on standard nuPlan benchmarks.

Abstract: Agricultural robots are serving as powerful assistants across a wide range of agricultural tasks, nevertheless, still heavily relying on manual operations or railway systems for movement. The AgriVLN method and the A2A benchmark pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the agricultural domain, enabling a robot to navigate to a target position following a natural language instruction. Unlike human binocular vision, most agricultural robots are only given a single camera for monocular vision, which results in limited spatial perception. To bridge this gap, we present the method of Agricultural Vision-and-Language Navigation with Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE-AgriVLN), in which we propose the MDE module generating depth features from RGB images, to assist the decision-maker on reasoning. When evaluated on the A2A benchmark, our MDE-AgriVLN method successfully increases Success Rate from 0.23 to 0.32 and decreases Navigation Error from 4.43m to 4.08m, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural VLN domain.

It can stabilize video captured by a tailless ornithopter that has resisted attempts to use camera-based sensing because it shakes at 12-20 Hz. Our approach minimizes changes in image intensity by optimizing over 3D rotation represented in SO(3). This results in a stabilized video, computed in real time, suitable for human viewing, and free from distortion. When adapted to hold a fixed viewing orientation, up to occasional saccades, it can dramatically reduce inter-frame motion while also benefiting from an efficient recursive update. When compared to Adobe Premier Pro's warp stabilizer, which is widely regarded as the best commercial video stabilization software available, our method achieves higher quality results while also running in real time.

TL;DR: 研究发现vibe-coding生成的代码在安全方面表现差，仅10.5%安全，引发对其在安全敏感应用中广泛采用的担忧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨vibe-coding的输出是否安全可用于生产环境，尤其是在安全敏感的应用中。

Method: 提出了SU S VI B E S基准，包含200个真实开源项目中的功能请求任务，评估了多种广泛使用的编码代理在前沿模型上的表现。

Result: 所有编码代理在软件安全方面表现不佳，仅10.5%的解决方案是安全的。初步安全策略（如增加漏洞提示）无法缓解安全问题。

Conclusion: 研究对vibe-coding在安全敏感应用中的广泛采用提出了严重关切，指出现有编码代理在软件安全方面表现不佳。

Abstract: Vibe coding is a new programming paradigm in which human engineers instruct large language model (LLM) agents to complete complex coding tasks with little supervision. Although it is increasingly adopted, are vibe coding outputs really safe to deploy in production? To answer this question, we propose SU S VI B E S, a benchmark consisting of 200 feature-request software engineering tasks from real-world open-source projects, which, when given to human programmers, led to vulnerable implementations. We evaluate multiple widely used coding agents with frontier models on this benchmark. Disturbingly, all agents perform poorly in terms of software security. Although 61% of the solutions from SWE-Agent with Claude 4 Sonnet are functionally correct, only 10.5% are secure. Further experiments demonstrate that preliminary security strategies, such as augmenting the feature request with vulnerability hints, cannot mitigate these security issues. Our findings raise serious concerns about the widespread adoption of vibe-coding, particularly in security-sensitive applications.

*Hexiang Xu,Hengyuan Liu,Yonghao Wu,Xiaolan Kang,Xiang Chen,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LLM在故障定位中优于传统方法，尤其对新手有帮助，但面临推理过度和计算成本高的挑战，需进一步优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新手程序员由于经验有限，在故障定位中常遇到困难，传统方法如SBFL和MBFL缺乏对代码上下文的理解能力，而LLM因其对程序语法和语义的理解能力显示出克服这些限制的潜力。

Method: 本研究评估了六种闭源和七种开源LLM，使用了Codeflaws、Condefects和BugT数据集，其中BugT是专为减少数据泄漏问题而构建的新数据集。

Result: 具备推理能力的高级模型（如OpenAI o3和DeepSeekR1）在最小化提示工程依赖下实现更高准确率；而缺乏推理能力的模型（如GPT-4）需精心设计提示以保持性能。LLM在简单故障定位中表现良好，但随着问题难度增加准确率下降，尽管在BugT数据集中顶级模型保持稳健表现。过度推理和计算成本是当前主要挑战。

Conclusion: LLMs展现出提升调试效率的潜力，但需进一步优化其推理能力和计算效率以实现实际应用。

Abstract: Novice programmers often face challenges in fault localization due to their limited experience and understanding of programming syntax and logic. Traditional methods like Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) and Mutation-Based Fault Localization (MBFL) help identify faults but often lack the ability to understand code context, making them less effective for beginners. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in overcoming these limitations by utilizing their ability to understand program syntax and semantics. LLM-based fault localization provides more accurate and context-aware results than traditional techniques. This study evaluates six closed-source and seven open-source LLMs using the Codeflaws, Condefects, and BugT datasets, with BugT being a newly constructed dataset specifically designed to mitigate data leakage concerns. Advanced models with reasoning capabilities, such as OpenAI o3 and DeepSeekR1, achieve superior accuracy with minimal reliance on prompt engineering. In contrast, models without reasoning capabilities, like GPT-4, require carefully designed prompts to maintain performance. While LLMs perform well in simple fault localization, their accuracy decreases as problem difficulty increases, though top models maintain robust performance in the BugT dataset. Over-reasoning is another challenge, where some models generate excessive explanations that hinder fault localization clarity. Additionally, the computational cost of deploying LLMs remains a significant barrier for real-time debugging. LLM's explanations demonstrate significant value for novice programmer assistance, with one-year experience participants consistently rating them highly. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to improve debugging efficiency while stressing the need for further refinement in their reasoning and computational efficiency for practical adoption.

TL;DR: Causify Dev是一种混合代码库组织方案，通过可运行目录结合monorepo和multi-repo的优点，解决传统策略的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统代码库组织策略（monorepo和multi-repo）在可扩展性、工具复杂性和依赖管理方面存在局限性，需要一种兼顾一致性和模块化的解决方案。

Method: 采用可运行目录作为自包含、独立可执行的单元，结合统一的轻量级环境、共享工具和基于Docker的工作流。

Result: Causify Dev系统实现了开发、测试和部署生命周期的一致性、依赖隔离以及高效的CI/CD流程。

Conclusion: Causify Dev系统提供了一种介于monorepo和multi-repo之间的实用中间方案，通过可运行目录的概念，提升了代码库的可靠性和可维护性。

Abstract: Modern software systems increasingly strain traditional codebase organization strategies. Monorepos offer consistency but often suffer from scalability issues and tooling complexity, while multi-repos provide modularity at the cost of coordination and dependency management challenges. As an answer to this trade-off, we present the Causify Dev system, a hybrid approach that integrates key benefits of both. Its central concept is the runnable directory -- a self-contained, independently executable unit with its own development, testing, and deployment lifecycles. Backed by a unified thin environment, shared helper utilities, and containerized Docker-based workflows, runnable directories enable consistent setups, isolated dependencies, and efficient CI/CD processes. The Causify Dev approach provides a practical middle ground between monorepo and multi-repo strategies, improving reliability and maintainability for growing, complex codebases.

TL;DR: 研究分析1,000+开源项目，发现依赖漏洞普遍且修复慢（关键漏洞平均持续1年+），SCA工具能有效提升供应链安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源库的广泛使用带来了安全风险（如Log4Shell事件），需深入理解依赖漏洞的严重性、持久性和分布，及其与项目指标（团队规模、发布周期等）的关联。

Method: 研究分析了超过1,000个开源项目（约50,000个版本），涵盖多种编程语言（如Java、Python、Rust等）。使用自研SCA工具VODA爬取项目版本历史（2013-2023年），追踪依赖版本、深度及已知漏洞的演变。

Result: 发现多数语言的漏洞是传递性的，关键漏洞平均持续一年以上才修复。数据集规模更大、多样性更高，提升了结果的普适性。

Conclusion: 开源库中的安全漏洞普遍存在且修复时间较长，尤其是关键漏洞平均需要一年多才能修复。研究强调了软件组成分析（SCA）工具的重要性，以及项目规模和活跃度对漏洞修复速度的影响。

Abstract: Open-source libraries are widely used by software developers to speed up the development of products, however, they can introduce security vulnerabilities, leading to incidents like Log4Shell. With the expanding usage of open-source libraries, it becomes even more imperative to comprehend and address these dependency vulnerabilities. The use of Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools does greatly help here as they provide a deep insight on what dependencies are used in a project, enhancing the security and integrity in the software supply chain. In order to learn how wide spread vulnerabilities are and how quickly they are being fixed, we conducted a study on over 1k open-source software projects with about 50k releases comprising several languages such as Java, Python, Rust, Go, Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript. Our objective is to investigate the severity, persistence, and distribution of these vulnerabilities, as well as their correlation with project metrics such as team and contributors size, activity and release cycles. In order to perform such analysis, we crawled over 1k projects from github including their version history ranging from 2013 to 2023 using VODA, our SCA tool. Using our approach, we can provide information such as library versions, dependency depth, and known vulnerabilities, and how they evolved over the software development cycle. Being larger and more diverse than datasets used in earlier works and studies, ours provides better insights and generalizability of the gained results. The data collected answers several research questions about the dependency depth and the average time a vulnerability persists. Among other findings, we observed that for most programming languages, vulnerable dependencies are transitive, and a critical vulnerability persists in average for over a year before being fixed.

TL;DR: 提出了一种细粒度控制量词实例化的机制，在Verus中实现，帮助开发者在自动化和性能之间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SMT求解器在量词实例化时面临的自动化与性能之间的基本矛盾，这是SMT验证工具不完整性和验证速度下降的主要原因。

Method: 在基于Rust的验证工具Verus中实现了一种细粒度控制量词事实可用性的机制，允许开发者选择性调整自动化级别。

Result: 在多个开源代码库上的实证分析展示了自动化与性能的权衡，选择性量词管理机制使开发者能够在不同上下文中选择合适的自动化级别。

Conclusion: 选择性量词管理机制允许开发者在不同上下文中选择合适的自动化级别，从而在自动化和性能之间取得平衡。

Abstract: Automated verification tools based on SMT solvers have made significant progress in verifying complex software systems. However, these tools face a fundamental tension between automation and performance when dealing with quantifier instantiation -- the primary source of incompleteness and verification slowdown in SMT-based verifiers. Tools choose between aggressive quantifier instantiation that provides more automation but longer verification times, or conservative instantiation that responds quickly but may require more manual proof hints.
  We present a mechanism that enables fine-grained control over the availability of quantified facts in verification contexts, allowing developers to selectively tune the level of automation. Our approach lets library authors provide different pre-defined automation levels while giving end-users the ability to further customize quantifier availability at the module, function, or proof context level.
  We implement our techniques in Verus, a Rust-based verification tool, and evaluate them on multiple openly available codebases. Our empirical analysis demonstrates the automation-performance tradeoff and that selective quantifier management enables developers to select the appropriate level of automation in different contexts.

Abstract: This work presents an experimental performance evaluation of a private 5G airfield network under controlled directional SDR jamming attacks targeting UAV-based UE nodes. Using a QualiPoc Android UE, mounted as a payload on a quadcopter UAV, we conducted a series of experiments to evaluate signal degradation, handover performance, and ser-vice stability in the presence of constant directional jamming. The conducted experiments aimed to examine the effects of varying travel speeds, altitudes, and moving patterns of a UAV-based UE to record and analyze the key physical-layer and network-layer metrics such as CQI, MCS, RSRP, SINR, BLER, Net PDSCH Throughput and RLF. The re-sults of this work describe the link stability and signal degradation dependencies, caused by the level of mobility of the UAV-based UE nodes during autonomous and automatic operation in private 5G Airfield networks

TL;DR: 论文评估了并行冗余在Wi-Fi工业应用中的效果，证明其能有效降低最坏情况延迟，适合实时控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wi-Fi在工业环境中因高性能和低成本被广泛使用，但其可靠性常被认为不适合实时控制系统，因此需要研究如何提升其可靠性。

Method: 通过分析从实际设置中获取的大数据集，评估并行冗余对软实时应用相关性能指标的影响。

Result: 延迟并行冗余在最坏情况传输延迟方面提供了明显优势，且频谱消耗有限。

Conclusion: 使用并行冗余技术可以显著改善无线通信在实时控制系统中的最坏情况传输延迟，且频谱消耗成本有限，适合在控制环路中应用。

Abstract: Wireless communication is increasingly used in industrial environments, since it supports mobility of interconnected devices. Among the transmission technologies operating in unlicensed bands available to this purpose, Wi-Fi is certainly one of the most interesting, because of its high performance and the relatively low deployment costs. Unfortunately, its dependability is often deemed unsuitable for real-time control systems. In this paper, the use of parallel redundancy is evaluated from a quantitative viewpoint, by considering a number of performance indices that are relevant for soft real-time applications. Analysis is carried out on a large dataset acquired from a real setup, to provide realistic insights on the advantages this kind of approaches can provide. As will be seen, deferred parallel redundancy provides clear advantages in terms of the worst-case transmission latency, at limited costs concerning the amount of consumed spectrum. Hence, it can be practically exploited every time a wireless connection is included in a control loop.

TL;DR: 利用机器学习预测TSCH网络流量模式，优化节点睡眠策略，显著降低工业WSN能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业无线传感器网络（WSNs）需在超低功耗与确定性操作间取得平衡，TSCH技术虽满足条件，但仍有进一步优化能耗的空间。

Method: 本研究采用机器学习算法分析基于TSCH协议的流量模式，并通过模拟无线传感器节点的精确建模验证算法的有效性。

Result: 模拟数据显示，机器学习算法能显著降低TSCH网络的功耗，尤其在非传输时段将节点转为深度睡眠状态。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型能够有效预测TSCH网络中的流量模式，从而显著降低网络能耗，尽管在接近树状网络根部时预测能力有所下降。

Abstract: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are employed across a wide range of industrial applications where ultra-low power consumption is a critical prerequisite. At the same time, these systems must maintain a certain level of determinism to ensure reliable and predictable operation. In this view, time slotted channel hopping (TSCH) is a communication technology that meets both conditions, making it an attractive option for its usage in industrial WSNs. This work proposes the use of machine learning to learn the traffic pattern generated in networks based on the TSCH protocol, in order to turn nodes into a deep sleep state when no transmission is planned and thus to improve the energy efficiency of the WSN. The ability of machine learning models to make good predictions at different network levels in a typical tree network topology was analyzed in depth, showing how their capabilities degrade while approaching the root of the tree. The application of these models on simulated data based on an accurate modeling of wireless sensor nodes indicates that the investigated algorithms can be suitably used to further and substantially reduce the power consumption of a TSCH network.

Result: 通过一系列案例研究展示了如何设计和应用LLM增强RL于低空经济网络、车载网络和空天地一体化网络。

Conclusion: 本文总结了LLM增强RL在无线网络中的潜在未来方向，并对其未来发展提供了见解。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in enabling adaptive and data-driven optimization for various applications in wireless networks. However, classical RL suffers from limitations in generalization, learning feedback, interpretability, and sample efficiency in dynamic wireless environments. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative Artificial Intelligence (AI) paradigm with exceptional capabilities in knowledge generalization, contextual reasoning, and interactive generation, which have demonstrated strong potential to enhance classical RL. This paper serves as a comprehensive tutorial on LLM-enhanced RL for wireless networks. We propose a taxonomy to categorize the roles of LLMs into four critical functions: state perceiver, reward designer, decision-maker, and generator. Then, we review existing studies exploring how each role of LLMs enhances different stages of the RL pipeline. Moreover, we provide a series of case studies to illustrate how to design and apply LLM-enhanced RL in low-altitude economy networking, vehicular networks, and space-air-ground integrated networks. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on potential future directions for LLM-enhanced RL and offer insights into its future development in wireless networks.

TL;DR: MOST是一种结合镜像和分层优势的存储分层方法，通过动态镜像热数据实现高效负载均衡，Cerberus实现验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代存储层次结构需要同时兼顾负载均衡和空间效率，传统的分层或镜像方法无法同时满足这两点。

Method: MOST动态地在存储层级间镜像少量热数据以平衡负载，避免昂贵的数据迁移，并在用户级存储管理层Cerberus中实现。

Result: 在静态和动态工作负载下，Cerberus比竞争方法在现代存储层次结构中实现了更高的吞吐量，特别是在I/O密集和动态工作负载下。

Conclusion: MOST结合了镜像和分层的优势，在现代存储层次结构中实现了高效的负载均衡和带宽利用，通过Cerberus实现并在多种工作负载下验证了其优越性。

Abstract: We present Mirror-Optimized Storage Tiering (MOST), a novel tiering-based approach optimized for modern storage hierarchies. The key idea of MOST is to combine the load balancing advantages of mirroring with the space-efficiency advantages of tiering. Specifically, MOST dynamically mirrors a small amount of hot data across storage tiers to efficiently balance load, avoiding costly migrations. As a result, MOST is as space-efficient as classic tiering while achieving better bandwidth utilization under I/O-intensive workloads. We implement MOST in Cerberus, a user-level storage management layer based on CacheLib. We show the efficacy of Cerberus through a comprehensive empirical study: across a range of static and dynamic workloads, Cerberus achieves better throughput than competing approaches on modern storage hierarchies especially under I/O-intensive and dynamic workloads.
