The key idea of MOST is to combine the load balancing advantages of mirroring with the space-efficiency advantages of tiering. Specifically, MOST dynamically mirrors a small amount of hot data across storage tiers to efficiently balance load, avoiding costly migrations. As a result, MOST is as space-efficient as classic tiering while achieving better bandwidth utilization under I/O-intensive workloads. We implement MOST in Cerberus, a user-level storage management layer based on CacheLib. We show the efficacy of Cerberus through a comprehensive empirical study: across a range of static and dynamic workloads, Cerberus achieves better throughput than competing approaches on modern storage hierarchies especially under I/O-intensive and dynamic workloads.", "AI": {"tldr": "MOST\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u955c\u50cf\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u5206\u5c42\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u955c\u50cf\u70ed\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\uff0cCerberus\u5b9e\u73b0\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5b58\u50a8\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u517c\u987e\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u6216\u955c\u50cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e24\u70b9\u3002", "method": "MOST\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u5728\u5b58\u50a8\u5c42\u7ea7\u95f4\u955c\u50cf\u5c11\u91cf\u70ed\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7528\u6237\u7ea7\u5b58\u50a8\u7ba1\u7406\u5c42Cerberus\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\uff0cCerberus\u6bd4\u7ade\u4e89\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u5b58\u50a8\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728I/O\u5bc6\u96c6\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u3002", "conclusion": "MOST\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u955c\u50cf\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u5b58\u50a8\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Cerberus\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing autoscaling policies, often retrofitted from monolithic systems like those in AIBrix and DistServe, rely on lagging indicators such as GPU utilization or coarse-grained request counts. This results in slow reactions to load spikes, leading to significant Time-to First-Token (TTFT) and Time-Per-Output-Token (TPOT) SLO violations and costly over-provisioning. We introduce TokenScale, an autoscaling framework that resolves this performance mismatch through two innovations. First, we propose Token Velocity, a novel metric that unifies the prefill, network, and decode stages by quantifying their rate of work. As a leading indicator of system backpressure, it enables proactive scaling. Second, Convertible Decoders allow decoder GPUs to dynamically execute prefill tasks during traffic spikes, creating a rapid-response buffer that absorbs bursts and eliminates the initialization latency of new prefillers. Our evaluation on a GPU cluster with production traces shows TokenScale improves SLO attainment from 50-88% to 80-96% and reduces costs by 4-14% over state-of-the-art systems, including DistServe, BlitzScale, and AIBrix.

While 2D image synthesis benefits from fixed spatial grids and well-established transformer architectures, 3D generation remains fundamentally more challenging due to the need to predict both spatial structure and detailed geometric surfaces from scratch. These challenges are exacerbated by the computational complexity of existing 3D representations and the lack of structured and scalable 3D asset encoding schemes. To address this, we propose VoxSet, a semi-structured representation that compresses 3D assets into a compact set of latent vectors anchored to a coarse voxel grid, enabling efficient and position-aware generation. VoxSet retains the simplicity and compression advantages of prior VecSet methods while introducing explicit structure into the latent space, allowing positional embeddings to guide generation and enabling strong token-level test-time scaling. Built upon this representation, LATTICE adopts a two-stage pipeline: first generating a sparse voxelized geometry anchor, then producing detailed geometry using a rectified flow transformer. Our method is simple at its core, but supports arbitrary resolution decoding, low-cost training, and flexible inference schemes, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various aspects, and offering a significant step toward scalable, high-quality 3D asset creation.", "AI": {"tldr": "LATTICE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b3D\u8d44\u4ea7\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7VoxSet\u8868\u793a\u548c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u67093D\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVoxSet\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5c063D\u8d44\u4ea7\u538b\u7f29\u5230\u7c97\u4f53\u7d20\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5411\u91cf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u751f\u6210\u7a00\u758f\u4f53\u7d20\u5316\u51e0\u4f55\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u751f\u6210\u8be6\u7ec6\u51e0\u4f55\u3002", "result": "LATTICE\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89e3\u7801\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "LATTICE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7VoxSet\u8868\u793a\u548c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u8d44\u4ea7\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u76843D\u8d44\u4ea7\u521b\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

In recent work, Souza et al. (2023) formalized OCP as a hypergraph covering problem with ordered, exponential costs, and proposed a greedy heuristic that outperforms the original SBBU ordering by orders of magnitude. However, the computational complexity of finding optimal solutions remained open. In this paper, we prove that OCP is NP-complete through a polynomial-time reduction from the strongly NP-complete 3-Partition problem. Our reduction constructs a tight budget that forces optimal solutions to correspond exactly to valid 3-partitions. This result establishes a computational barrier for optimal edge ordering and provides theoretical justification for the heuristic approaches currently used in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "OCP\u95ee\u9898\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u662fNP\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73-Partition\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5f52\u7ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "OCP\u95ee\u9898\u5728DMDGP\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4fee\u526a\u8fb9\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u5bf9SBBU\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5c1a\u672a\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u5f3aNP\u5b8c\u5168\u76843-Partition\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5f52\u7ea6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86OCP\u7684NP\u5b8c\u5168\u6027\u3002\u5f52\u7ea6\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u8feb\u4f7f\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u6070\u597d\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\u76843-\u5206\u533a\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660eOCP\u662fNP\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\uff0c\u5f52\u7ea6\u6784\u9020\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u4e0e\u6709\u65483-\u5206\u533a\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86OCP\u95ee\u9898\u662fNP\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\uff0c\u4e3a\u6700\u4f18\u8fb9\u6392\u5e8f\u8bbe\u7acb\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

While Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising framework, existing methods often struggle with the multi-granularity of tasks (long-term strategy vs. instant actions) and the complexity of large-scale agent interactions. This paper presents a unified Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework that addresses these challenges. First, we establish a baseline using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) within a client-server architecture for real-time action scheduling, with PPO demonstrating superior performance (4.32 avg. goals, 82.9% ball control). Second, we introduce a Hierarchical RL (HRL) structure based on the options framework to decompose the problem into a high-level trajectory planning layer (modeled as a Semi-Markov Decision Process) and a low-level action execution layer, improving global strategy (avg. goals increased to 5.26). Finally, to ensure scalability, we integrate mean-field theory into the HRL framework, simplifying many-agent interactions into a single agent vs. the population average. Our mean-field actor-critic method achieves a significant performance boost (5.93 avg. goals, 89.1% ball control, 92.3% passing accuracy) and enhanced training stability. Extensive simulations of 4v4 matches in the Webots environment validate our approach, demonstrating its potential for robust, scalable, and cooperative behavior in complex multi-agent domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5c42\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8db3\u7403\u7b49\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u6297\u73af\u5883\uff08\u5982\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8db3\u7403\uff09\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u3001\u590d\u6742\u5408\u4f5c\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528PPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef-\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5efa\u7acb\u5b9e\u65f6\u52a8\u4f5c\u8c03\u5ea6\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b2. \u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u9009\u9879\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5c42\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u4f4e\u5c42\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\uff1b3. \u5c06\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u7406\u8bba\u6574\u5408\u5230HRL\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "1.

Philosophical analysis of AI alignment (process-based / syntropy framework)", "summary": "I argue that AI alignment should be reconceived as architecting syntropic, reasons-responsive agents through process-based, multi-agent, developmental mechanisms rather than encoding fixed human value content. The paper makes three philosophical contributions. First, I articulate the ``specification trap'' argument demonstrating why content-based value specification appears structurally unstable due to the conjunction of the is-ought gap, value pluralism, and the extended frame problem. Second, I propose syntropy -- the recursive reduction of mutual uncertainty between agents through state alignment -- as an information-theoretic framework for understanding multi-agent alignment dynamics.

This requires fundamentally different learning paradigms from pixel-based visual models. Symbolic visual learners parse diagrams into geometric primitives-points, lines, and shapes-whereas pixel-based learners operate on textures and colors. We propose a novel self-supervised symbolic auto-encoder that encodes diagrams into structured primitives and their interrelationships within the latent space, and decodes them through our executable engine to reconstruct the input diagrams. Central to this architecture is Symbolic Hierarchical Process Reward Modeling, which applies hierarchical step-level parsing rewards to enforce point-on-line, line-on-shape, and shape-on-relation consistency. Since vanilla reinforcement learning exhibits poor exploration in the policy space during diagram reconstruction; we thus introduce stabilization mechanisms to balance exploration and exploitation. We fine-tune our symbolic encoder on downstream tasks, developing a neuro-symbolic system that integrates the reasoning capabilities of neural networks with the interpretability of symbolic models through reasoning-grounded visual rewards. Evaluations across reconstruction, perception, and reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: achieving a 98.2% reduction in MSE for geometric diagram reconstruction, surpassing GPT-4o by 0.6% with a 7B model on chart reconstruction, and improving by +13% on the MathGlance perception benchmark, and by +3% on MathVerse and GeoQA reasoning benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7b26\u53f7\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7b26\u53f7\u89c6\u89c9\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u7b26\u53f7\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u89c6\u89c9\u5b66\u4e60\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u6790\u56fe\u8868\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u5143\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7b26\u53f7\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u5c42\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u56fe\u8868\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u57fa\u5143\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u5f15\u64ce\u89e3\u7801\u91cd\u5efa\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u8868\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u56fe\u8868\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2dMSE\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8698.2%\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8aGPT-4o 0.6%\uff0c\u5728MathGlance\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e8613%\uff0c\u5728MathVerse\u548cGeoQA\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e863%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7b26\u53f7\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u5c42\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7b26\u53f7\u89c6\u89c9\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

LLM-based fault localization provides more accurate and context-aware results than traditional techniques.

Advanced models with reasoning capabilities, such as OpenAI o3 and DeepSeekR1, achieve superior accuracy with minimal reliance on prompt engineering. In contrast, models without reasoning capabilities, like GPT-4, require carefully designed prompts to maintain performance. While LLMs perform well in simple fault localization, their accuracy decreases as problem difficulty increases, though top models maintain robust performance in the BugT dataset. Over-reasoning is another challenge, where some models generate excessive explanations that hinder fault localization clarity. Additionally, the computational cost of deploying LLMs remains a significant barrier for real-time debugging. LLM's explanations demonstrate significant value for novice programmer assistance, with one-year experience participants consistently rating them highly. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to improve debugging efficiency while stressing the need for further refinement in their reasoning and computational efficiency for practical adoption.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\u5728\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u65b0\u624b\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u65b0\u624b\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u7531\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5728\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u5e38\u9047\u5230\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982SBFL\u548cMBFL\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800cLLM\u56e0\u5176\u5bf9\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u516d\u79cd\u95ed\u6e90\u548c\u4e03\u79cd\u5f00\u6e90LLM\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86Codeflaws\u3001Condefects\u548cBugT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dBugT\u662f\u4e13\u4e3a\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u6f0f\u95ee\u9898\u800c\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5177\u5907\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982OpenAI o3\u548cDeepSeekR1\uff09\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u800c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982GPT-4\uff09\u9700\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u793a\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002LLM\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728BugT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u9876\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u8fc7\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u63d0\u5347\u8c03\u8bd5\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Among the transmission technologies operating in unlicensed bands available to this purpose, Wi-Fi is certainly one of the most interesting, because of its high performance and the relatively low deployment costs. Unfortunately, its dependability is often deemed unsuitable for real-time control systems. In this paper, the use of parallel redundancy is evaluated from a quantitative viewpoint, by considering a number of performance indices that are relevant for soft real-time applications. Analysis is carried out on a large dataset acquired from a real setup, to provide realistic insights on the advantages this kind of approaches can provide. As will be seen, deferred parallel redundancy provides clear advantages in terms of the worst-case transmission latency, at limited costs concerning the amount of consumed spectrum.

Decision-making is formalized through an interpretable Weight-Calculation model (Weight = Benefit * Probability), where all values are traceable to an auditable set of Initial Weights.

In this work, we propose a unified framework based on the concept of a \"drainage node'' which we add at the output of the network. The node serves to reallocate probability mass toward uncertainty, while preserving desirable properties such as end-to-end training and differentiability. This mechanism provides a natural escape route for highly ambiguous, anomalous, or noisy samples, particularly relevant for instance-dependent and asymmetric label noise. In systematic experiments involving the addition of varying proportions of instance-dependent noise or asymmetric noise to CIFAR-10/100 labels, our drainage formulation achieves an accuracy increase of up to 9\\% over existing approaches in the high-noise regime. Our results on real-world datasets, such as mini-WebVision, mini-ImageNet and Clothing-1M, match or surpass existing state-of-the-art methods. Qualitative analysis reveals a denoising effect, where the drainage neuron consistently absorbs corrupt, mislabeled, or outlier data, leading to more stable decision boundaries.

The main contributions of this work are: (1) demonstrating that a deep learning model, trained on a mix of real and synthetic images, can accurately predict camera and lens parameters from a single image, and (2) developing a comprehensive synthetic dataset using the AILiveSim simulation platform. This dataset includes variations in focal length and lens distortion parameters, providing a robust foundation for model training and testing. The training process predominantly relied on these synthetic images, complemented by a small subset of real images, to explore how well models trained on synthetic data can perform calibration tasks on real-world images. Traditional calibration methods require multiple images of a calibration object from various orientations, which is often not feasible due to the lack of such images in publicly available datasets. A deep learning network based on the ResNet architecture was trained on this synthetic dataset to predict camera calibration parameters following the Brown-Conrady lens model. The ResNet architecture, adapted for regression tasks, is capable of predicting continuous values essential for accurate camera calibration in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality.\n  Keywords: Camera calibration, distortion, synthetic data, deep learning, residual networks (ResNet), AILiveSim, horizontal field-of-view, principal point, Brown-Conrady Model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u6d4b\u76f8\u673a\u6821\u51c6\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u9700\u6c42\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u591a\u5f20\u6821\u51c6\u5bf9\u8c61\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u6d4b\u6821\u51c6\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eResNet\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u9075\u5faaBrown-Conrady\u955c\u5934\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u6821\u51c6\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u76f8\u673a\u548c\u955c\u5934\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u6d4b\u76f8\u673a\u548c\u955c\u5934\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

This work proposes the use of machine learning to learn the traffic pattern generated in networks based on the TSCH protocol, in order to turn nodes into a deep sleep state when no transmission is planned and thus to improve the energy efficiency of the WSN. The ability of machine learning models to make good predictions at different network levels in a typical tree network topology was analyzed in depth, showing how their capabilities degrade while approaching the root of the tree.

Yet, many systems and disturbance phenomena are difficult to model due to effects like nonlinearity, chaos, and high-dimensionality. Koopman theory addresses this by modeling the linear evolution of embeddings of the state under an infinite-dimensional linear operator that can be approximated with a suitable finite basis of embedding functions, effectively trading model nonlinearity for representational complexity. However, explicitly computing a good choice of basis is nontrivial, and poor choices may cause inaccurate forecasts or overfitting. To address this, we present Kalman-Implicit Koopman Operator (KALIKO) Learning, a method that leverages the Kalman filter to implicitly learn embeddings corresponding to latent dynamics without requiring an explicit encoder. KALIKO produces interpretable representations consistent with both theory and prior works, yielding high-quality reconstructions and inducing a globally linear latent dynamics.

However, this paradigm might incur substantial token overhead, especially when models \"overthink\" by producing lengthy reasoning chains, which can even lead to incorrect answers. A promising direction is the symbolic-solver-integrated approach, which leverages the code generation capabilities of LLMs to translate reasoning tasks into executable code and then solve them with a symbolic solver. In this paper, we explore an open question of when the conventional long-CoT can be enhanced by symbolic solvers. Our experimental results show that the symbolic-solver-integrated method only helps when the problem requires limited implicit reasoning but involves an ample search space. The latest LLMs, like GPT-4o, show better performance on deductive problems with shallow reasoning depth, while the symbolic-solver-integrated method significantly improves the LLMs' performance in constraint satisfaction problems that require repeated backtracks.

We introduce a two-stage large language model (LLM) based method for inferring material composition directly from 3D point clouds with coarse segmentations. Our key insight is to decouple reasoning about what an object is from what it is made of. In the first stage, an LLM predicts the object's semantic; in the second stage, it assigns plausible materials to each geometric segment, conditioned on the inferred semantics. Both stages operate in a zero-shot manner, without task-specific training. Because existing datasets lack reliable material annotations, we evaluate our method using an LLM-as-a-Judge implemented in DeepEval. Across 1,000 shapes from Fusion/ABS and ShapeNet, our method achieves high semantic and material plausibility.

With the expanding usage of open-source libraries, it becomes even more imperative to comprehend and address these dependency vulnerabilities. The use of Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools does greatly help here as they provide a deep insight on what dependencies are used in a project, enhancing the security and integrity in the software supply chain. In order to learn how wide spread vulnerabilities are and how quickly they are being fixed, we conducted a study on over 1k open-source software projects with about 50k releases comprising several languages such as Java, Python, Rust, Go, Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript. Our objective is to investigate the severity, persistence, and distribution of these vulnerabilities, as well as their correlation with project metrics such as team and contributors size, activity and release cycles. In order to perform such analysis, we crawled over 1k projects from github including their version history ranging from 2013 to 2023 using VODA, our SCA tool. Using our approach, we can provide information such as library versions, dependency depth, and known vulnerabilities, and how they evolved over the software development cycle.

GOMP assumes a precise task in which a manipulator holds an object that may shift within the grasp in an observable manner and must be mated with a grounded part.

The exploitative drive, or what an agent wants to achieve, is formalised as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a variational probability distribution, updated at each inference step, and a preference probability distribution that indicates what states or observations are more likely for the agent, hence determining the agent's goal in a certain environment. In the literature, the questions of how the preference distribution should be specified and of how a certain specification impacts inference and learning in an active inference agent have been given hardly any attention. In this work, we consider four possible ways of defining the preference distribution, either providing the agents with hard or soft goals and either involving or not goal shaping (i.e., intermediate goals). We compare the performances of four agents, each given one of the possible preference distributions, in a grid world navigation task.

Project page: https://waabi.ai/flux4d/", "summary": "Reconstructing large-scale dynamic scenes from visual observations is a fundamental challenge in computer vision, with critical implications for robotics and autonomous systems. While recent differentiable rendering methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved impressive photorealistic reconstruction, they suffer from scalability limitations and require annotations to decouple actor motion. Existing self-supervised methods attempt to eliminate explicit annotations by leveraging motion cues and geometric priors, yet they remain constrained by per-scene optimization and sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we introduce Flux4D, a simple and scalable framework for 4D reconstruction of large-scale dynamic scenes. Flux4D directly predicts 3D Gaussians and their motion dynamics to reconstruct sensor observations in a fully unsupervised manner. By adopting only photometric losses and enforcing an \"as static as possible\" regularization, Flux4D learns to decompose dynamic elements directly from raw data without requiring pre-trained supervised models or foundational priors simply by training across many scenes. Our approach enables efficient reconstruction of dynamic scenes within seconds, scales effectively to large datasets, and generalizes well to unseen environments, including rare and unknown objects. Experiments on outdoor driving datasets show Flux4D significantly outperforms existing methods in scalability, generalization, and reconstruction quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "Flux4D\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u77634D\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b3D\u9ad8\u65af\u53ca\u5176\u8fd0\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u91cd\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982NeRF\u548c3DGS\uff09\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u800c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9010\u573a\u666f\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002Flux4D\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "Flux4D\u91c7\u7528\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u548c\u2018\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u9759\u6001\u2019\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5206\u89e3\u52a8\u6001\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u57fa\u7840\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6237\u5916\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFlux4D\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Flux4D\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u5f0f\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b3D\u9ad8\u65af\u53ca\u5176\u8fd0\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

However, these tools face a fundamental tension between automation and performance when dealing with quantifier instantiation -- the primary source of incompleteness and verification slowdown in SMT-based verifiers. Tools choose between aggressive quantifier instantiation that provides more automation but longer verification times, or conservative instantiation that responds quickly but may require more manual proof hints.\n  We present a mechanism that enables fine-grained control over the availability of quantified facts in verification contexts, allowing developers to selectively tune the level of automation. Our approach lets library authors provide different pre-defined automation levels while giving end-users the ability to further customize quantifier availability at the module, function, or proof context level.\n  We implement our techniques in Verus, a Rust-based verification tool, and evaluate them on multiple openly available codebases.

They serve as gateways for connecting computing devices to networks for the exchange of data with other devices. Recently, the pervasive nature of Internet-enabled devices coupled with the growing demands for faster network access have necessitated the enhancement of NICs to Smart NICs (SNICs), capable of processing enormous volumes of data at near real-time speed. However, despite their popularity, the exact use and applicability of SNICs remains an ongoing debate. These debates are exacerbated by the incorporation of accelerators into SNIC, allowing them to relieve their host's CPUs of various tasks. In this work, we carry out a chronological analysis of SNICs, using 370 articles published in the past 15 years, from 2010 to 2024, to gain some insight into SNICs; and shed some light on their evolution, manufacturers, use cases, and application domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u7f51\u5361\uff08SNICs\uff09\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u548c\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e15\u5e74\u7684370\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5176\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u548c\u5bf9\u66f4\u5feb\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbf\u95ee\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u7f51\u5361\uff08SNICs\uff09\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u6210\u4e3a\u5fc5\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5177\u4f53\u7528\u9014\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u4e89\u8bae\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf92010\u5e74\u81f32024\u5e74\u95f4\u53d1\u8868\u7684370\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u68b3\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0SNICs\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e3b\u673aCPU\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8fc7\u53bb15\u5e74370\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u7f51\u5361\uff08SNICs\uff09\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u3001\u5236\u9020\u5546\u3001\u7528\u4f8b\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4e3aSNICs\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Recent advances in map data structures and spatial indexing have significantly improved the efficiency of LIO systems. Nevertheless, we observe that two aspects may still leave room for improvement: (1) nearest neighbor search often requires examining multiple spatial units to gather sufficient points for plane fitting, and (2) plane parameters are typically recomputed at every iteration despite unchanged map geometry. Motivated by these observations, we propose Surfel-LIO, which employs a hierarchical voxel structure (hVox) with pre-computed surfel representation. This design enables O(1) correspondence retrieval without runtime neighbor enumeration or plane fitting, combined with Z-order curve encoding for cache-friendly spatial indexing. Experimental results on the M3DGR dataset demonstrate that our method achieves significantly faster processing speed compared to recent state-of-the-art methods while maintaining comparable state estimation accuracy.

In this paper, we introduce a method for evaluating the ability of LLM-based agents to cooperate in zero-shot, mixed-motive environments using Concordia, a natural language multi-agent simulation environment. Our method measures general cooperative intelligence by testing an agent's ability to identify and exploit opportunities for mutual gain across diverse partners and contexts. We present empirical results from the NeurIPS 2024 Concordia Contest, where agents were evaluated on their ability to achieve mutual gains across a suite of diverse scenarios ranging from negotiation to collective action problems.

This allows us to study their properties by sampling the most probable states of those systems. However, the sampling capabilities of these methods are not sufficiently accurate when handling complex configuration spaces. This has resulted in the development of new techniques that improve sampling accuracy, usually at the expense of increasing the computational cost. One of such techniques is Parallel Tempering which improves accuracy by running several replicas which periodically exchange their states. Computationally, this imposes a significant slow-down, which can be counteracted by means of parallelization. These schemes enable MCMC/PT techniques to be run more effectively and allow larger models to be studied. In this work, we present a parallel implementation of Metropolis-Hastings with Parallel Tempering, using OpenMP and CUDA for the parallelization in modern CPUs and GPUs, respectively. The results show a maximum speed-up of 52x using OpenMP with 48 cores, and of 986x speed-up with the CUDA version.

From Geometric to Foundation Models", "comment": null, "summary": "In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of existing scene representation methods for robotics, covering traditional representations such as point clouds, voxels, signed distance functions (SDF), and scene graphs, as well as more recent neural representations like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), and the emerging Foundation Models. While current SLAM and localization systems predominantly rely on sparse representations like point clouds and voxels, dense scene representations are expected to play a critical role in downstream tasks such as navigation and obstacle avoidance. Moreover, neural representations such as NeRF, 3DGS, and foundation models are well-suited for integrating high-level semantic features and language-based priors, enabling more comprehensive 3D scene understanding and embodied intelligence. In this paper, we categorized the core modules of robotics into five parts (Perception, Mapping, Localization, Navigation, Manipulation). We start by presenting the standard formulation of different scene representation methods and comparing the advantages and disadvantages of scene representation across different modules. This survey is centered around the question: What is the best 3D scene representation for robotics? We then discuss the future development trends of 3D scene representations, with a particular focus on how the 3D Foundation Model could replace current methods as the unified solution for future robotic applications. The remaining challenges in fully realizing this model are also explored. We aim to offer a valuable resource for both newcomers and experienced researchers to explore the future of 3D scene representations and their application in robotics.

Richer rewards computed from the reasoning tokens can improve learning significantly by providing more fine-grained guidance. However, it is challenging to compute more informative rewards in MMRL beyond those based on outcomes since different samples may require different scoring functions and teacher models may provide noisy reward signals too. In this paper, we introduce the Argos (Agentic Reward for Grounded & Objective Scoring), a principled reward agent to train multimodal reasoning models for agentic tasks. For each sample, Argos selects from a pool of teacher-model derived and rule-based scoring functions to simultaneously evaluate: (i) final response accuracy, (ii) spatiotemporal localization of referred entities and actions, and (iii) the quality of the reasoning process. We find that by leveraging our agentic verifier across both SFT data curation and RL training, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple agentic tasks such as spatial reasoning, visual hallucination as well as robotics and embodied AI benchmarks. Critically, we demonstrate that just relying on SFT post-training on highly curated reasoning data is insufficient, as agents invariably collapse to ungrounded solutions during RL without our online verification. We also show that our agentic verifier can help to reduce reward-hacking in MMRL.

Expert offloading mitigates this issue by storing expert parameters in CPU memory and caching a subset of popular experts in GPU memory. Although this approach improves GPU memory utilization by caching only the likely-used experts, the GPU memory reserved for expert caching is underutilized compared with dense LLMs. This paper presents OD-MoE, a distributed MoE inference framework that obviates the need for expert caches via fully on-demand expert loading. OD-MoE is built upon two key mechanisms: 1) parallelizing expert loading and expert computation across distributed edge nodes, and 2) an ultra-accurate emulative predictor that forecasts expert activations multiple layers ahead while expert computation is ongoing. With these innovations, OD-MoE dynamically loads each target expert to one of the distributed nodes just-in-time before its activation and promptly evicts it afterward, freeing GPU memory for subsequent experts. We comprehensively benchmark OD-MoE against state-of-the-art MoE offloading systems on a ten-node testbed. Experimental results show that: 1) OD-MoE achieves 99.94% expert activation prediction accuracy, substantially surpassing all existing methods; and 2) OD-MoE delivers approximately 75% of the decoding speed of a fully GPU-cached MoE deployment while using only 1/3 of the GPU memory. More importantly, by eliminating the need for expert caches, OD-MoE enables MoE inference on edge nodes with less-than-1GB GPU memory, paving the way for practical MoE deployment of low-cost IoT devices at the edge in the LLM era.", "AI": {"tldr": "OD-MoE \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fMoE\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u8f7d\u4e13\u5bb6\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u7684GPU\u5185\u5b58\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u8bbe\u5907\u8fd0\u884cMoE\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\u5728\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7684GPU\u5185\u5b58\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "OD-MoE \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fMoE\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\uff1a1) \u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8fb9\u7f18\u8282\u70b9\u4e0a\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u4e13\u5bb6\u52a0\u8f7d\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u8d85\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u63d0\u524d\u591a\u5c42\u9884\u6d4b\u4e13\u5bb6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u3002", "result": "OD-MoE \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8699.94%\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\u8fbe\u5230\u5b8c\u5168GPU\u7f13\u5b58\u90e8\u7f72\u768475%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75281/3\u7684GPU\u5185\u5b58\u3002", "conclusion": "OD-MoE \u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u4e13\u5bb6\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728GPU\u5185\u5b58\u4e0d\u8db31GB\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8282\u70b9\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884cMoE\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u5728LLM\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

In this setting, each vertex corresponds to a geometric object, and two vertices are adjacent if and only if their objects intersect. We introduce a new tool for designing such algorithms, which we call a $\u03bb$-linked partition. This is a partition of the vertex set into groups of highly connected vertices. Crucially, such a partition can be computed in polynomial time and does not require access to the geometric representation of the graph. We apply this framework to problems related to paths and cycles in graphs. First, we obtain the first robust ETH-tight algorithms for Hamiltonian Path and Hamiltonian Cycle, running in time $2^{O(n^{1-1/d})}$ on intersection graphs of similarly sized fat objects in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. This resolves an open problem of de Berg et al. [STOC 2018] and completes the study of these problems on geometric intersection graphs from the viewpoint of ETH-tight exact algorithms. We further extend our approach to the parameterized setting and design the first robust subexponential parameterized algorithm for Long Path in any fixed dimension $d$. More precisely, we obtain a randomized robust algorithm running in time $2^{O(k^{1-1/d}\\log^2 k)}\\, n^{O(1)}$ on intersection graphs of similarly sized fat objects in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, where $k$ is the natural parameter. Besides $\u03bb$-linked partitions, our algorithm also relies on a low-treewidth pattern covering theorem that we establish for geometric intersection graphs, which may be viewed as a refinement of a result of Marx-Pilipczuk [ESA 2017].

Conventional policy networks struggle to process full-resolution LIDAR inputs, forcing prior works to rely on simplified observations that reduce spatial awareness and navigation robustness. This paper presents a novel model-based RL framework built on top of the DreamerV3 algorithm, integrating a Multi-Layer Perceptron Variational Autoencoder (MLP-VAE) within a world model to encode high-dimensional LIDAR readings into compact latent representations. These latent features, combined with a learned dynamics predictor, enable efficient imagination-based policy optimization. Experiments on simulated TurtleBot3 navigation tasks demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves faster convergence and higher success rate compared to model-free baselines such as SAC, DDPG, and TD3. It is worth emphasizing that the DreamerV3-based agent attains a 100% success rate across all evaluated environments when using the full dataset of the Turtlebot3 LIDAR (360 readings), while model-free methods plateaued below 85%. These findings demonstrate that integrating predictive world models with learned latent representations enables more efficient and robust navigation from high-dimensional sensory data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eDreamerV3\u548cMLP-VAE\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f16\u7801\u9ad8\u7ef4LIDAR\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5730\u9762\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5730\u9762\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4eceLIDAR\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7b56\u7565\u7f51\u7edc\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5168\u5206\u8fa8\u7387LIDAR\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u8feb\u4f7f\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b80\u5316\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u610f\u8bc6\u548c\u5bfc\u822a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eDreamerV3\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u5668\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08MLP-VAE\uff09\u6765\u7f16\u7801\u9ad8\u7ef4LIDAR\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u60f3\u8c61\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62dfTurtleBot3\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u67b6\u6784\u76f8\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08\u5982SAC\u3001DDPG\u548cTD3\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002\u57fa\u4e8eDreamerV3\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u4f7f\u7528Turtlebot3 LIDAR\u5168\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08360\u4e2a\u8bfb\u6570\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86100%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\u5219\u505c\u6ede\u572885%\u4ee5\u4e0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6574\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u9ad8\u7ef4\u611f\u5b98\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u3002"}}

However, in most real-world scenarios, lossy communication is a prevalent issue. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning with communication, due to their limited scalability and robustness, struggles to apply to complex and dynamic real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose a generalized communication-constrained model to uniformly characterize communication conditions across different scenarios. Based on this, we utilize it as a learning prior to distinguish between lossy and lossless messages for specific scenarios.

Learning-based denoisers have the potential to reconstruct high-quality images. For training, however, these denoisers require large paired datasets of clean and noisy images, which are difficult to collect. Noise synthesis is an alternative to large-scale data acquisition: given a clean image, we can synthesize a realistic noisy counterpart. In this work, we propose a general and practical noise synthesis method that requires only one single noisy image and one single dark frame per ISO setting. We represent signal-dependent noise with a Poisson distribution and introduce a Fourier-domain spectral sampling algorithm to accurately model signal-independent noise. The latter generates diverse noise realizations that maintain the spatial and statistical properties of real sensor noise. As opposed to competing approaches, our method neither relies on simplified parametric models nor on large sets of clean-noisy image pairs.

To address these challenges, we introduce \\emph{$\u03c1$-dense aggregators}, a novel approach that succinctly captures maximal clique structure. Instead of listing all cliques, we identify a small collection of clusters with edge density at least $\u03c1$ that collectively contain every maximal clique.\n  In contrast to maximal clique enumeration, we prove that for all $\u03c1< 1$, every graph admits a $\u03c1$-dense aggregator of \\emph{sub-exponential} size, $n^{O(\\log_{1/\u03c1}n)}$, and provide an algorithm achieving this bound. For graphs with bounded degeneracy, a typical characteristic of real-world networks, our algorithm runs in near-linear time and produces near-linear size aggregators. We also establish a matching lower bound on aggregator size, proving our results are essentially tight. In an empirical evaluation on real-world networks, we demonstrate significant practical benefits for the use of aggregators: our algorithm is consistently faster than the state-of-the-art clique enumeration algorithm, with median speedups over $6\\times$ for $\u03c1=0.1$ (and over $300\\times$ in an extreme case), while delivering a much more concise structural summary.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa$\u03c1$-dense aggregators\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc6\u5ea6\u805a\u7c7b\u9ad8\u6548\u6355\u6349\u6700\u5927\u56e2\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6458\u8981\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6700\u5927\u56e2\u679a\u4e3e\u662f\u57fa\u7840\u56fe\u6316\u6398\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u5197\u4f59\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6458\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u4e86$\u03c1$-dense aggregators\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u8fb9\u7f18\u5bc6\u5ea6\u81f3\u5c11\u4e3a$\u03c1$\u7684\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u805a\u7c7b\u96c6\u5408\u6765\u6355\u6349\u6700\u5927\u56e2\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u679a\u4e3e\u6240\u6709\u56e2\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5b50\u6307\u6570\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6709\u754c\u9000\u5316\u56fe\uff08\u5178\u578b\u73b0\u5b9e\u7f51\u7edc\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u5219\u80fd\u5728\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c$\u03c1$-dense aggregators\u5728\u5b50\u6307\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u5185\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\uff08\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u63d0\u901f\u8d85\u8fc76\u500d\uff0c\u6781\u7aef\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8d85\u8fc7300\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6458\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a$\u03c1$-dense aggregators\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6700\u5927\u56e2\u679a\u4e3e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u5197\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5b9e\u9645\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

This design enables PARC to detect and correct high-level strategic errors and sustain progress without human intervention. We evaluate PARC across computational science and data science tasks. In materials science, it autonomously reproduces key results from studies on lithium-ion conduction and alloy segregation.

We introduce PixPerfect, a pixel-level refinement framework that delivers seamless, high-fidelity local edits across diverse LDM architectures and tasks. PixPerfect leverages (i) a differentiable discriminative pixel space that amplifies and suppresses subtle color and texture discrepancies, (ii) a comprehensive artifact simulation pipeline that exposes the refiner to realistic local editing artifacts during training, and (iii) a direct pixel-space refinement scheme that ensures broad applicability across diverse latent representations and tasks.

However, when performing global localization using semantic objects, high semantic ambiguity intensifies object misclassification and increases the likelihood of incorrect associations, which in turn can cause significant errors in the estimated pose. Thus, in this letter, we propose a multi-label likelihood-based semantic graph matching framework for object-level global localization. The key idea is to exploit multi-label graph representations, rather than single-label alternatives, to capture and leverage the inherent semantic context of object observations. Based on these representations, our approach enhances semantic correspondence across graphs by combining the likelihood of each node with the maximum likelihood of its neighbors via context-aware likelihood propagation. For rigorous validation, data association and pose estimation performance are evaluated under both closed-set and open-set detection configurations. In addition, we demonstrate the scalability of our approach to large-vocabulary object categories in both real-world indoor scenes and synthetic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "A multi-label graph framework improves robot localization by leveraging semantic context and likelihood propagation, tested in varied environments.", "motivation": "To mitigate the errors in robot localization caused by high semantic ambiguity and object misclassification.", "method": "A multi-label graph representation is used to capture semantic context, combined with context-aware likelihood propagation to enhance semantic correspondence.", "result": "The approach shows improved performance in both closed-set and open-set detection configurations and scales well to large-vocabulary object categories in real-world and synthetic environments.", "conclusion": "The proposed multi-label likelihood-based semantic graph matching framework effectively addresses semantic ambiguity in robot localization, improving both data association and pose estimation accuracy."}}

This struggle is driven by two main limitations. First, single-agent architectures enforce a monolithic plan-execute loop, which directly causes trajectory instability. Second, the requirement to use local open-weight models for data privacy introduces smaller context windows leading to the rapid consumption of context from large tool outputs. To solve this problem we introduce RP-ReAct (Reasoner Planner-ReAct), a novel multi-agent approach that fundamentally decouples strategic planning from low-level execution to achieve superior reliability and efficiency. RP-ReAct consists of a Reasoner Planner Agent (RPA), responsible for planning each sub-step, continuously analysing the execution results using the strong reasoning capabilities of a Large Reasoning Model, and one or multiple Proxy-Execution Agent (PEA) that translates sub-steps into concrete tool interactions using a ReAct approach. Crucially, we incorporate a context-saving strategy within the PEA to mitigate context window overflow by managing large tool outputs via external storage and on-demand access. We evaluate RP-ReAct, on the challenging, multi-domain ToolQA benchmark using a diverse set of six open-weight reasoning models. Our empirical results show that RP-ReAct achieves superior performance and improved generalization ability over state-of-the-art baselines when addressing diverse complex tasks across the evaluated domains.

We design a hybrid knowledge fusion engine employing large language models (LLMs) for deep semantic parsing of unstructured text, transforming distributor agreements and sales assessments into structured features while integrating managerial expertise. Then a game-theoretic constrained optimization mechanism is employed to dynamically reconcile supply chain interests through bilateral utility functions, encoding manufacturer-distributor profit redistribution as endogenous objectives under hierarchical constraints. Finally an interpretable decision distillation interface leveraging LLM-guided symbolic regression to find and optimize pricing strategies and auditable business rules embeds economic priors (e.g. non-negative elasticity) as hard constraints during mathematical expression search.

Traditionally, high-definition (HD) maps are providing this representation of the static road infrastructure to the autonomous system a priori. However, because the real world is constantly changing, such maps must be constructed online from on-board sensor data. Navigation-grade standard-definition (SD) maps are widely available, but their resolution is insufficient for direct deployment. Instead, they can be used as coarse prior to guide the online map construction process. We propose NavMapFusion, a diffusion-based framework that performs iterative denoising conditioned on high-fidelity sensor data and on low-fidelity navigation maps. This paper strives to answer: (1) How can coarse, potentially outdated navigation maps guide online map construction? (2) What advantages do diffusion models offer for map fusion? We demonstrate that diffusion-based map construction provides a robust framework for map fusion. Our key insight is that discrepancies between the prior map and online perception naturally correspond to noise within the diffusion process; consistent regions reinforce the map construction, whereas outdated segments are suppressed. On the nuScenes benchmark, NavMapFusion conditioned on coarse road lines from OpenStreetMap data reaches a 21.4% relative improvement on 100 m, and even stronger improvements on larger perception ranges, while maintaining real-time capabilities. By fusing low-fidelity priors with high-fidelity sensor data, the proposed method generates accurate and up-to-date environment representations, guiding towards safer and more reliable autonomous driving.

Traditional policy learning paradigms, including both Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), struggle to cultivate generalizability across diverse scenarios. While IL policies often overfit to specific expert trajectories, RL suffers from the inherent lack of a unified and general reward signal necessary for effective multi-scene generalization. We posit that the world model is uniquely capable of serving as a universal environment proxy to address this limitation. However, current world models primarily focus on their ability to predict observations and still rely on task-specific, handcrafted reward functions, thereby failing to provide a truly general training environment. Toward this problem, we propose RoboScape-R, a framework leveraging the world model to serve as a versatile, general-purpose proxy for the embodied environment within the RL paradigm. We introduce a novel world model-based general reward mechanism that generates ''endogenous'' rewards derived from the model's intrinsic understanding of real-world state transition dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboScape-R effectively addresses the limitations of traditional RL methods by providing an efficient and general training environment that substantially enhances the generalization capability of embodied policies.

We introduce MemVerse, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play memory framework that bridges fast parametric recall with hierarchical retrieval-based memory, enabling scalable and adaptive multimodal intelligence. MemVerse maintains short-term memory for recent context while transforming raw multimodal experiences into structured long-term memories organized as hierarchical knowledge graphs.

RoCo coordinates four specialized LLM-guided agents-explorer, exploiter, critic, and integrator-to collaboratively generate high-quality heuristics. The explorer promotes long-term potential through creative, diversity-driven thinking, while the exploiter focuses on short-term improvements via conservative, efficiency-oriented refinements. The critic evaluates the effectiveness of each evolution step and provides targeted feedback and reflection. The integrator synthesizes proposals from the explorer and exploiter, balancing innovation and exploitation to drive overall progress. These agents interact in a structured multi-round process involving feedback, refinement, and elite mutations guided by both short-term and accumulated long-term reflections. We evaluate RoCo on five different COPs under both white-box and black-box settings. Experimental results demonstrate that RoCo achieves superior performance, consistently generating competitive heuristics that outperform existing methods including ReEvo and HSEvo, both in white-box and black-box scenarios.

Traditionally, EF estimation requires manual tracing and domain expertise, making the process time-consuming and subject to interobserver variability. Most current deep learning methods for EF prediction are black-box models with limited transparency, which reduces clinical trust. Some post-hoc explainability methods have been proposed to interpret the decision-making process after the prediction is made. However, these explanations do not guide the model's internal reasoning and therefore offer limited reliability in clinical applications. To address this, we introduce ProtoEFNet, a novel video-based prototype learning model for continuous EF regression. The model learns dynamic spatiotemporal prototypes that capture clinically meaningful cardiac motion patterns. Additionally, the proposed Prototype Angular Separation (PAS) loss enforces discriminative representations across the continuous EF spectrum.

Our framework comprises two stages: (1) an Adaptive Supervised Fine-Tuning (Adaptive SFT) stage, which endows the Omni model with fundamental reasoning capability using large-scale reasoning-augmented data, and (2) an Adaptive Reinforcement Learning (Adaptive GRPO) stage, which optimizes reasoning behaviors based on task complexity and reward feedback. We further construct a comprehensive adaptive reasoning benchmark that spans text-only, text-audio, text-visual, and text-audio-visual modalities, providing both training and evaluation splits for multimodal reasoning assessment.

This issue is problematic in image restoration for safety-critical domains such as medical imaging, industrial inspection, and remote sensing, where such errors undermine reliability and trust. For example, in low-field MRI, widely used in resource-limited settings, restoration models are essential for enhancing low-quality scans, yet hallucinations can lead to serious diagnostic errors. Progress has been hindered by a circular dependency: evaluating hallucinations requires labeled data, yet such labels are costly and subjective. We introduce HalluGen, a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes realistic hallucinations with controllable type, location, and severity, producing perceptually realistic but semantically incorrect outputs (segmentation IoU drops from 0.86 to 0.36). Using HalluGen, we construct the first large-scale hallucination dataset comprising 4,350 annotated images derived from 1,450 brain MR images for low-field enhancement, enabling systematic evaluation of hallucination detection and mitigation. We demonstrate its utility in two applications: (1) benchmarking image quality metrics and developing Semantic Hallucination Assessment via Feature Evaluation (SHAFE), a feature-based metric with soft-attention pooling that improves hallucination sensitivity over traditional metrics; and (2) training reference-free hallucination detectors that generalize to real restoration failures.

This paper introduces the Static Deep Research Agent (Static-DRA), a novel solution built upon a configurable and hierarchical Tree-based static workflow.\n  The core contribution is the integration of two user-tunable parameters, Depth and Breadth, which provide granular control over the research intensity. This design allows end-users to consciously balance the desired quality and comprehensiveness of the research report against the associated computational cost of Large Language Model (LLM) interactions. The agent's architecture, comprising Supervisor, Independent, and Worker agents, facilitates effective multi-hop information retrieval and parallel sub-topic investigation.\n  We evaluate the Static-DRA against the established DeepResearch Bench using the RACE (Reference-based Adaptive Criteria-driven Evaluation) framework. Configured with a depth of 2 and a breadth of 5, and powered by the gemini-2.5-pro model, the agent achieved an overall score of 34.72.

The subtle, non-adjacent nature of early disease signals is often lost due to suboptimal architectural inductive biases: 2D/3D CNNs impose strong locality, while ViTs diffuse unconstrained global attention. This conflict leaves the optimal inductive structure for robust, sparse volumetric pattern recognition unresolved. This study presents a controlled comparison of sixteen modern deep learning architectures spanning 2D/3D convolutional, hybrid, and volumetric transformer families for subclinical keratoconus (SKC) detection from 3D anterior segment OCT volumes. We demonstrate that hierarchical attention models offer a superior and more parameter-efficient inductive bias, surpassing the performance of both 2D and 3D CNNs and ViTs. Our results show 21-23% higher sensitivity and specificity in the sparse anomaly (subclinical) regime. Mechanistic analyses reveal that this advantage stems from precise spatial scale alignment: hierarchical windowing produces effective receptive fields matched to the intermediate, multi-slice extent of subclinical abnormalities. This avoids excessive CNN locality and diffuse global attention. Attention-distance measurements confirm a key insight into architectural adaptation: the required spatial integration length shifts significantly based on the signal strength, with subclinical cases necessitating longer integration compared to both healthy and manifest disease states. Representational similarity and auxiliary age/sex prediction tasks further support the generalizability of these inductive principles. The findings provide design guidance for future volumetric anomaly detection systems, establishing hierarchical attention as a principled and effective approach for early pathological change analysis in 3D medical imaging.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u57283D\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e9a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5f02\u5e38\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf2D/3D CNN\u548cViT\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5339\u914d\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u68c0\u6d4b\u4f53\u79ef\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u5fae\u5f31\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u65e9\u671f\u75be\u75c5\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5fae\u5999\u3001\u975e\u76f8\u90bb\u6027\u8d28\u5e38\u56e0\u6b21\u4f18\u67b6\u6784\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u5dee\u800c\u4e22\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5bf916\u79cd\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u63a7\u5236\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5305\u62ec2D/3D\u5377\u79ef\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u4f53\u79ef\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece3D\u524d\u6bb5OCT\u4f53\u79ef\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e9a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5706\u9525\u89d2\u819c\uff08SKC\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5f02\u5e38\uff08\u4e9a\u4e34\u5e8a\uff09\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa21-23%\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u6e90\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a3D\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u75c5\u7406\u53d8\u5316\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u539f\u5219\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u4f53\u79ef\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

In simulation, ContactRL achieves a low safety violation rate of 0.2\\% with a high task success rate of 87.7\\%, outperforming state-of-the-art constrained RL baselines. In order to guarantee deployment safety, we augment the learned policy with a kinetic energy based Control Barrier Function (eCBF) shield.

While prior work has primarily focused on ensuring compliance, our approach considers scenarios where deviating from policies may be necessary to achieve high-stakes goals. Additionally, modeling non-compliant behavior can assist policymakers by simulating realistic human decision-making. Our framework extends Gelfond and Lobo's Authorization and Obligation Policy Language (AOPL) to incorporate penalties and integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) for reasoning. Compared to previous approaches, our method ensures well-formed policies, accounts for policy priorities, and enhances explainability by explicitly identifying rule violations and their consequences. Building on the work of Harders and Inclezan, we introduce penalty-based reasoning to distinguish between non-compliant plans, prioritizing those with minimal repercussions. To support this, we develop an automated translation from the extended AOPL into ASP and refine ASP-based planning algorithms to account for incurred penalties. Experiments in two domains demonstrate that our framework generates higher-quality plans that avoid harmful actions while, in some cases, also improving computational efficiency.

Computed tomography (CT) scans are widely used for lung cancer diagnosis as they can give detailed lung structures. However, manual interpretation is time-consuming and prone to human error. To surmount this challenge, the study proposes a deep learning-based automatic lung cancer classification system to enhance detection accuracy and interpretability. The IQOTHNCCD lung cancer dataset is utilized, which is a public CT scan dataset consisting of cases categorized into Normal, Benign, and Malignant and used DenseNet169, which includes Squeezeand-Excitation blocks for attention-based feature extraction, Focal Loss for handling class imbalance, and a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for multi-scale feature fusion. In addition, an SVM model was developed using MobileNetV2 for feature extraction, improving its classification performance. For model interpretability enhancement, the study integrated Grad-CAM for the visualization of decision-making regions in CT scans and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) for explanation of feature contributions within the SVM model. Intensive evaluation was performed, and it was found that both DenseNet169 and SVM models achieved 98% accuracy, suggesting their robustness for real-world medical practice.

However, existing research predominantly focuses on coarse spatiotemporal scales and relies on low-resolution satellite data, capturing only macroscopic fire states while fundamentally constraining high-precision localized fire dynamics modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we present FireSentry, a provincial-scale multi-modal wildfire dataset characterized by sub-meter spatial and sub-second temporal resolution. Collected using synchronized UAV platforms, FireSentry provides visible and infrared video streams, in-situ environmental measurements, and manually validated fire masks. Building on FireSentry, we establish a comprehensive benchmark encompassing physics-based, data-driven, and generative models, revealing the limitations of existing mask-only approaches. Our analysis proposes FiReDiff, a novel dual-modality paradigm that first predicts future video sequences in the infrared modality, and then precisely segments fire masks in the mask modality based on the generated dynamics. FiReDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, with video quality gains of 39.2% in PSNR, 36.1% in SSIM, 50.0% in LPIPS, 29.4% in FVD, and mask accuracy gains of 3.3% in AUPRC, 59.1% in F1 score, 42.9% in IoU, and 62.5% in MSE when applied to generative models.

Gaussian-based methods have demonstrated superior performance and computational efficiency across a wide range of scene understanding tasks. However, existing methods either model objects as closed-set semantic Gaussians supervised by annotated 3D labels, neglecting their rendering ability, or learn open-set Gaussian representations via purely 2D self-supervision, leading to degraded geometry and limited to camera-only settings. To fully exploit the potential of Gaussians, we propose a Multi-Modal Gaussian Transformer that enables Gaussians to query features from diverse sensor modalities, and a Shelf-Supervised Learning Paradigm that efficiently optimizes Gaussians with VFM features jointly at 2D image and 3D scene levels. We evaluate ShelfGaussian on various perception and planning tasks. Experiments on Occ3D-nuScenes demonstrate its state-of-the-art zero-shot semantic occupancy prediction performance. ShelfGaussian is further evaluated on an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to assess its in the-wild performance across diverse urban scenarios.

However, the substantial modality gap between optical and SAR images poses a major challenge for robust identification. To address this issue, we propose MOS, a novel framework designed to mitigate the optical-SAR modality gap and achieve modality-consistent feature learning for optical-SAR cross-modal ship ReID. MOS consists of two core components: (1) Modality-Consistent Representation Learning (MCRL) applies denoise SAR image procession and a class-wise modality alignment loss to align intra-identity feature distributions across modalities. (2) Cross-modal Data Generation and Feature fusion (CDGF) leverages a brownian bridge diffusion model to synthesize cross-modal samples, which are subsequently fused with original features during inference to enhance alignment and discriminability. Extensive experiments on the HOSS ReID dataset demonstrate that MOS significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation protocols, achieving notable improvements of +3.0%, +6.2%, and +16.4% in R1 accuracy under the ALL to ALL, Optical to SAR, and SAR to Optical settings, respectively.

While prior work on Image Difference Captioning (IDC) has enabled models to describe semantic changes between static images, these approaches fail to capture motion continuity, event evolution, or editing consistency over time. We introduce the ViDiC (Video Difference Captioning) task and its corresponding ViDiC-1K dataset, designed to evaluate the ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to provide fine-grained descriptions of similarities and differences between video pairs. ViDiC-1K comprises 1,000 curated video pairs annotated with over 4,000 comparative checklist items, covering seven categories: subject, style, background, cinematography, motion, location, and playback techniques.

To address this, we propose using safe reinforcement learning (SRL) to obtain a new and safe reference trajectory within MPC.

The key challenge lies in AD's limited ability to interact with surrounding vehicles, largely due to a lack of understanding the underlying mechanisms of social interaction. To address this issue, we introduce MPCFormer, an explainable socially-aware autonomous driving approach with physics-informed and data-driven coupled social interaction dynamics. In this model, the dynamics are formulated into a discrete space-state representation, which embeds physics priors to enhance modeling explainability. The dynamics coefficients are learned from naturalistic driving data via a Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture. To the best of our knowledge, MPCFormer is the first approach to explicitly model the dynamics of multi-vehicle social interactions. The learned social interaction dynamics enable the planner to generate manifold, human-like behaviors when interacting with surrounding traffic. By leveraging the MPC framework, the approach mitigates the potential safety risks typically associated with purely learning-based methods. Open-looped evaluation on NGSIM dataset demonstrates that MPCFormer achieves superior social interaction awareness, yielding the lowest trajectory prediction errors compared with other state-of-the-art approach. The prediction achieves an ADE as low as 0.86 m over a long prediction horizon of 5 seconds. Close-looped experiments in highly intense interaction scenarios, where consecutive lane changes are required to exit an off-ramp, further validate the effectiveness of MPCFormer.

By integrating both subjective perceptions and objective states, the model precisely identifies and describes miscommunication.

Under Review", "summary": "Vision-language pretraining (VLP) has emerged as a powerful paradigm in medical image analysis, enabling representation learning from large-scale image-text pairs without relying on expensive manual annotations. However, existing methods often struggle with the noise inherent in web-collected data and the complexity of unstructured long medical texts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel VLP framework integrating a Multi-Agent data GENeration (MAGEN) system and Ontology-based Multi-Aspect Knowledge-Enhanced (O-MAKE) pretraining. First, MAGEN enhances data quality by synthesizing knowledge-enriched descriptions via a foundation model-assisted captioning and retrieval-based verification pipeline. Second, O-MAKE addresses the difficulty of learning from long, unstructured texts by decomposing them into distinct knowledge aspects. This facilitates fine-grained alignment at both global and patch levels, while explicitly modeling medical concept relationships through ontology-guided mechanisms. We validate our framework in the field of dermatology, where comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component.

We further introduce OmniDexReasoner, a multimodal grasp type semantic reasoning module that leverages multi agent collaboration, retrieval augmented generation, and chain of thought reasoning to infer grasp related semantics and generate high quality annotations that align language instructions with task specific grasp intent. Building upon these components, we develop a unified Vision Language Grasping generation model that explicitly incorporates grasp taxonomy, contact structure, and functional affordance semantics, enabling fine grained control over grasp synthesis from natural language instructions. Extensive experiments in simulation and real world object grasping and ablation studies demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms state of the art approaches in terms of grasp diversity, contact semantic diversity, functional affordance diversity, and semantic consistency.", "AI": {"tldr": "OmniDexVLG \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7075\u5de7\u6293\u53d6\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u6293\u53d6\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6293\u53d6\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7075\u5de7\u6293\u53d6\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u8bed\u4e49\u5efa\u6a21\uff08\u5982\u6293\u53d6\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u63a5\u89e6\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u53ef\u7528\u6027\uff09\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 OmniDexDataGen \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u548c OmniDexReasoner \u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6307\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u7075\u5de7\u6293\u53d6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u7269\u4f53\u6293\u53d6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "OmniDexVLG \u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6293\u53d6\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u63a5\u89e6\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To integrate spectral and spatial information, we introduce a lightweight FiLM-based fusion module that adaptively modulates frozen spatial features using spectral cues, enabling robust multimodal learning under sparse supervision. Experiments on two recent hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches using only the provided sparse training labels.

Existing visual grounding (VG) methods for autonomous vehicles (AVs) typically struggle with ambiguous, context-dependent instructions, as they lack reasoning over 3D spatial relations and anticipated scene evolution. Grounded in the principles of world models, we propose ThinkDeeper, a framework that reasons about future spatial states before making grounding decisions. At its core is a Spatial-Aware World Model (SA-WM) that learns to reason ahead by distilling the current scene into a command-aware latent state and rolling out a sequence of future latent states, providing forward-looking cues for disambiguation. Complementing this, a hypergraph-guided decoder then hierarchically fuses these states with the multimodal input, capturing higher-order spatial dependencies for robust localization.

Recent advances in digital twins (DTs) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offer new opportunities for real-time, data-driven optimization across a vehicle's lifecycle. However, integrating these technologies into a unified framework remains an open challenge. This work presents a DT-based control co-design (CCD) framework for full-vehicle active suspensions using multi-generation design concepts. By integrating automatic differentiation into DRL, we jointly optimize physical suspension components and control policies under varying driver behaviors and environmental uncertainties. DRL also addresses the challenge of partial observability, where only limited states can be sensed and fed back to the controller, by learning optimal control actions directly from available sensor information. The framework incorporates model updating with quantile learning to capture data uncertainty, enabling real-time decision-making and adaptive learning from digital-physical interactions. The approach demonstrates personalized optimization of suspension systems under two distinct driving settings (mild and aggressive). Results show that the optimized systems achieve smoother trajectories and reduce control efforts by approximately 43% and 52% for mild and aggressive, respectively, while maintaining ride comfort and stability.

However, achieving practical performance typically requires task-specific fine-tuning with large numbers of image-text pairs, which are costly to collect. In this work, we study text-centric training, a setting where only textual descriptions are available and no real images are provided, as a paradigm for low-cost data scaling. Unlike images, whose collection is often restricted by privacy constraints and scarcity in niche domains, text is widely available. Moreover, text is easily editable, enabling automatic diversification and expansion with LLMs at minimal human effort. While this offers clear advantages over image collection in terms of scalability and cost, training on raw text without images still yields limited gains on VQA tasks because of the image-text modality gap. To address this issue, we propose a Text-Printed Image (TPI), which generates synthetic images by directly rendering the given textual description on a plain white canvas. This simple rendering projects text into the image modality and can be integrated into arbitrary existing LVLM training pipelines at low cost. Moreover, TPI preserves the semantics of the text, whereas text-to-image models often fail to do. Across four models and seven benchmarks, our systematic experiments show that TPI enables more effective text-centric training than synthetic images generated by a diffusion model. We further explore TPI as a low-cost data-augmentation strategy and demonstrate its practical utility.

Most existing work relies on manual ROIs and rarely reports quality control (QC). We present LM-CartSeg, a fully automatic pipeline for cartilage/bone segmentation, geometric lateral/medial (L/M) compartmentalisation and radiomics analysis. Methods: Two 3D nnU-Net models were trained on SKM-TEA (138 knees) and OAIZIB-CM (404 knees). At test time, zero-shot predictions were fused and refined by simple geometric rules: connected-component cleaning, construction of 10 mm subchondral bone bands in physical space, and a data-driven tibial L/M split based on PCA and k-means. Segmentation was evaluated on an OAIZIB-CM test set (103 knees) and on SKI-10 (100 knees). QC used volume and thickness signatures. From 10 ROIs we extracted 4 650 non-shape radiomic features to study inter-compartment similarity, dependence on ROI size, and OA vs. non-OA classification on OAIZIB-CM Results: Post-processing improved macro ASSD on OAIZIB-CM from 2.63 to 0.36 mm and HD95 from 25.2 to 3.35 mm, with DSC 0.91; zero-shot DSC on SKI-10 was 0.80.

However, adapting SAM to specific downstream tasks, such as medical and agricultural imaging, remains a significant challenge. To address this, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have been widely employed to enhancing SAM's adaptation performance on diverse domains. Despite advancements, a critical question arises: can we integrate inductive bias into the model? This is particularly relevant since the Transformer encoder in SAM inherently lacks spatial priors within image patches, potentially hindering the acquisition of high-level semantic information. In this paper, we propose NAS-LoRA, a new Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method designed to bridge the semantic gap between pre-trained SAM and specialized domains. Specifically, NAS-LoRA incorporates a lightweight Neural Architecture Search (NAS) block between the encoder and decoder components of LoRA to dynamically optimize the prior knowledge integrated into weight updates. Furthermore, we propose a stage-wise optimization strategy to help the ViT encoder balance weight updates and architectural adjustments, facilitating the gradual learning of high-level semantic information. Various Experiments demonstrate our NAS-LoRA improves existing PEFT methods, while reducing training cost by 24.14% without increasing inference cost, highlighting the potential of NAS in enhancing PEFT for visual foundation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "NAS-LoRA\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347SAM\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "SAM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u519c\u4e1a\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e14\u5176Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a7a\u95f4\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u963b\u788d\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u83b7\u53d6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNAS-LoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728LoRA\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u52a0\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u5757\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9ViT\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5e73\u8861\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cNAS-LoRA\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u73b0\u6709PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8624.14%\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "NAS-LoRA\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u5757\u548c\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86SAM\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

However, these failures encode where and how policies can be fragile, information that can be exploited to improve robustness. We address this problem by leveraging mixed-quality datasets to learn failure-aware reasoning at planning time. We introduce VINE, a hierarchical vision-language-action model that separates high-level reasoning (System 2) from low-level control (System 1) under a hierarchical reinforcement learning formalism, making failures usable as a structured learning signal rather than noisy supervision. System 2 performs feasibility-guided tree search over a 2D scene-graph abstraction: it proposes subgoal transitions, predicts success probabilities from both successes and failures, and prunes brittle branches before execution, effectively casting plan evaluation as feasibility scoring.

To handle this, prior approaches mainly scale the visual generation process (e.g., increasing sampling steps or seeds), but this quickly leads to a quality plateau. This limitation arises because the prompt, crucial for guiding generation, is kept fixed. To address this, we propose Prompt Redesign for Inference-time Scaling, coined PRIS, a framework that adaptively revises the prompt during inference in response to the scaled visual generations. The core idea of PRIS is to review the generated visuals, identify recurring failure patterns across visuals, and redesign the prompt accordingly before regenerating the visuals with the revised prompt. To provide precise alignment feedback for prompt revision, we introduce a new verifier, element-level factual correction, which evaluates the alignment between prompt attributes and generated visuals at a fine-grained level, achieving more accurate and interpretable assessments than holistic measures. Extensive experiments on both text-to-image and text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, including a 15% gain on VBench 2.0.

Modern motion predictors offer highly accurate forecasts, yet their integration into planning is mostly rudimental: discarding unsafe plans. Similarly, end-to-end models offer a one-way integration that avoids the challenges of joint prediction and planning modeling under uncertainty. In contrast, game-theoretic formulations offer a principled alternative but have seen limited adoption in autonomous driving. We present Bayesian Iterative Best Response (BIBeR), a framework that unifies motion prediction and game-theoretic planning into a single interaction-aware process. BIBeR is the first to integrate a state-of-the-art predictor into an Iterative Best Response (IBR) loop, repeatedly refining the strategies of the ego vehicle and surrounding agents. This repeated best-response process approximates a Nash equilibrium, enabling bidirectional adaptation where the ego both reacts to and shapes the behavior of others. In addition, our proposed Bayesian confidence estimation quantifies prediction reliability and modulates update strength, more conservative under low confidence and more decisive under high confidence. BIBeR is compatible with modern predictors and planners, combining the transparency of structured planning with the flexibility of learned models.

However, most existing approaches operate purely in the 2D pixel space and lack explicit mechanisms for modeling 3D structures, often resulting in temporally inconsistent geometries, implausible motions, and structural artifacts. In this work, we introduce geometric regularization losses into video generation by augmenting latent diffusion models with per-frame depth prediction. We adopted depth as the geometric representation because of the great progress in depth prediction and its compatibility with image-based latent encoders. Specifically, to enforce structural consistency over time, we propose a multi-view geometric loss that aligns the predicted depth maps across frames within a shared 3D coordinate system.

Unlike human binocular vision, most agricultural robots are only given a single camera for monocular vision, which results in limited spatial perception.

This issue stems from a fundamental problem of visual neglect, where models fail to adequately prioritize input images. Existing methods typically alleviate hallucinations by intervening in the attention score or output logits, focusing on \"how to intervene\" but overlooking the prerequisite \"when to intervene\", which leads to the \"over-intervention\" problem and subsequently introduces new hallucinations and unnecessary computational overhead. To address this gap, we first investigate the mechanism of visual neglect and reveal it can be accurately detected via head-level activation patterns in MLLMs. We thus propose V-ITI, a lightweight visual inference-time intervention framework integrating a Visual Neglect Detector that identifies visual neglect via head-level discriminative probes and a Visual Recall Intervenor that modulates activations with prestored visual activation information only when the visual neglect is detected.

We present a hybrid moderation framework deployed at production scale that combines supervised classification for known violations with reference-based similarity matching for novel or subtle cases. This hybrid design enables robust detection of both explicit violations and novel edge cases that evade traditional classifiers. Multimodal inputs (text, audio, visual) are processed through both pipelines, with a multimodal large language model (MLLM) distilling knowledge into each to boost accuracy while keeping inference lightweight.

Existing approaches primarily analyze how an action is performed, while overlooking what it produces, i.e., the \\textbf{action effect}. Yet many errors manifest not in the execution itself but in the resulting outcome, such as an unintended object state or incorrect spatial arrangement. To address this gap, we propose Action Effect Modeling (AEM), a unified framework that jointly captures action execution and its outcomes through a probabilistic formulation. AEM first identifies the outcome of an action by selecting the most informative effect frame based on semantic relevance and visual quality. It then extracts complementary cues from visual grounding and symbolic scene graphs, aligning them in a shared latent space to form robust effect-aware representations. To detect mistakes, we further design a prompt-based detector that incorporates task-specific prompts and aligns each action segment with its intended execution semantics. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the EgoPER and CaptainCook4D benchmarks under the challenging one-class classification (OCC) setting.

However, challenges persist, especially in detecting small objects where the high resolution of these images and the small size of target objects often result in a loss of critical information in the deeper layers of conventional CNNs. Additionally, the extensive spatial redundancy and intricate background details typical in remote-sensing images tend to obscure these small targets. To address these challenges, we introduce Multi-Kernel Selection Network (MKSNet), a novel network architecture featuring a novel Multi-Kernel Selection mechanism. The MKS mechanism utilizes large convolutional kernels to effectively capture an extensive range of contextual information. This innovative design allows for adaptive kernel size selection, significantly enhancing the network's ability to dynamically process and emphasize crucial spatial details for small object detection. Furthermore, MKSNet also incorporates a dual attention mechanism, merging spatial and channel attention modules. The spatial attention module adaptively fine-tunes the spatial weights of feature maps, focusing more intensively on relevant regions while mitigating background noise. Simultaneously, the channel attention module optimizes channel information selection, improving feature representation and detection accuracy. Empirical evaluations on the DOTA-v1.0 and HRSC2016 benchmark demonstrate that MKSNet substantially surpasses existing state-of-the-art models in detecting small objects in remote sensing images. These results highlight MKSNet's superior ability to manage the complexities associated with multi-scale and high-resolution image data, confirming its effectiveness and innovation in remote sensing object detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "MKSNet\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6838\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u53cc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfCNN\u5728\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0cMKSNet\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "MKSNet\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6838\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff08MKS\uff09\u548c\u53cc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5904\u7406\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u5173\u952e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "result": "\u5728DOTA-v1.0\u548cHRSC2016\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMKSNet\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "MKSNet\u5728\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u3002"}}

Despite recent progress, existing STVG studies remain largely confined to object-centric and descriptive instructions, neglecting the task-oriented reasoning that is crucial for embodied agents to accomplish goal-directed interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{ToG-Bench}, the first task-oriented spatio-temporal video grounding benchmark for egocentric videos. ToG-Bench is characterized by three key features: (1) \\textbf{Task-oriented Grounding}, which requires identifying and localizing objects based on intended tasks rather than straightforward descriptions; (2) \\textbf{Explicit-Implicit Dual Grounding}, where target objects can be either explicitly mentioned or implicitly inferred by contextual reasoning; (3) \\textbf{One-to-Many Grounding}, where a single instruction may correspond to multiple objects involved in task execution. Built upon videos sourced from ScanNet, ToG-Bench comprises 100 annotated clips with 2,704 task-oriented grounding instructions, constructed via a semi-automated pipeline that combines foundation model annotation and human refinement. In addition, we introduce a set of task-level evaluation metrics tailored for multi-object and explicit-implicit object grounding, and systematically benchmark seven state-of-the-art MLLMs. Extensive experiments reveal the intrinsic challenges of task-oriented STVG and substantial performance gaps across explicit-implicit and multi-object grounding, highlighting the difficulty of bridging perception and interaction in embodied scenarios.

The pose-conditioned anchor attention mechanism enables the model to better align instruction semantics with actionable visual cues, thereby improving action generation precision and efficiency. Moreover, our framework adopts a lightweight architecture and requires no auxiliary perception modules (e.g., segmentation or grounding networks), ensuring efficient inference.

By analyzing the internal behaviors of the state and image token updating mechanism, we find that aggregating self-attention maps across layers reveals a consistent pattern: dynamic regions are naturally down-weighted, exposing an implicit motion cue that the pretrained transformer already encodes but never explicitly uses. Motivated by this observation, we introduce MUT3R, a training-free framework that applies the attention-derived motion cue to suppress dynamic content in the early layers of the transformer during inference. Our attention-level gating module suppresses the influence of dynamic regions before their artifacts propagate through the feature hierarchy. Notably, we do not retrain or fine-tune the model; we let the pretrained transformer diagnose its own motion cues and correct itself.

Existing perturbation methods are frequently white-box and architecture specific. More importantly, while they are often successful, it is rarely clear why they work. Insights into the mechanism of this success would allow developers to understand and analyze these attacks, as well as fine-tune the model to prevent them. This paper presents BlackCAtt, a black-box algorithm and a tool, which uses minimal, causally sufficient pixel sets to construct explainable, imperceptible, reproducible, architecture-agnostic attacks on object detectors. BlackCAtt combines causal pixels with bounding boxes produced by object detectors to create adversarial attacks that lead to the loss, modification or addition of a bounding box. BlackCAtt works across different object detectors of different sizes and architectures, treating the detector as a black box. We compare the performance of BlackCAtt with other black-box attack methods and show that identification of causal pixels leads to more precisely targeted and less perceptible attacks. On the COCO test dataset, our approach is 2.7 times better than the baseline in removing a detection, 3.86 times better in changing a detection, and 5.75 times better in triggering new, spurious, detections.

The agentic paradigm promises that VLMs can use a wide variety of tools that could augment these capabilities, such as depth estimators, segmentation models, and pose estimators. Yet it remains an open challenge how to realize this vision without solely relying on handcrafted prompting strategies or enforcing fixed, predefined tool pipelines that limit VLMs' ability to discover optimal tool-use patterns. Reinforcement Learning could overcome this gap, but has so far been limited to reasoning with a single visual tool due to the large search space in multi-tool reasoning. We introduce Double Interactive Reinforcement Learning (DIRL), a two-phase training framework where VLMs learn to coordinate multiple tools through interactive exploration and feedback. In the teaching phase, we combine demonstrations from a single tool specialist trained via interactive RL with traces from a frontier model using all tools. In the exploration phase, the model further refines multi-tool coordination through continued RL.

However, manual classification of brain tumor medical images is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Even with shallow convolutional neural network models, the accuracy is not ideal. To improve the efficiency and accuracy of brain tumor image classification, this paper proposes a brain tumor classification model based on an improved ResNet34 network. This model uses the ResNet34 residual network as the backbone network and incorporates multi-scale feature extraction. It uses a multi-scale input module as the first layer of the ResNet34 network and an Inception v2 module as the residual downsampling layer. Furthermore, a channel attention mechanism module assigns different weights to different channels of the image from a channel domain perspective, obtaining more important feature information. The results after a five-fold crossover experiment show that the average classification accuracy of the improved network model is approximately 98.8%, which is not only 1% higher than ResNet34, but also only 80% of the number of parameters of the original model. Therefore, the improved network model not only improves accuracy but also reduces clutter, achieving a classification effect with fewer parameters and higher accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684ResNet34\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8017\u65f6\u8017\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u6d45\u5c42\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdbResNet34\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u3001Inception v2\u6a21\u5757\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b8b\u5dee\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u5c42\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u4e94\u6298\u4ea4\u53c9\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7ea6\u4e3a98.8%\uff0c\u6bd4\u539fResNet34\u9ad81%\uff0c\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u4ec5\u4e3a\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u768480%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6539\u8fdb\u7684ResNet34\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Testing this framework on a single 49-second recording of Ghanaian AfroBeats dance demonstrates technical feasibility, with the system achieving approximately 94% detection precision and 89% recall on manually inspected samples.

While existing efficient VLM approaches reduce visual tokens through fixed-ratio compression, they operate passively and lack the ability to adapt to varying task requirements. This motivates a fundamental question: Can VLMs autonomously determine the minimum number of visual tokens required for each sample? Inspired by human active vision mechanisms, we introduce AdaptVision, an efficient VLM paradigm that enables adaptive visual token acquisition through a coarse-to-fine approach. Our model initially processes compressed visual tokens from low-resolution images and selectively acquires additional visual information by invoking a bounding box tool to crop key regions when necessary. We train AdaptVision using a reinforcement learning framework that carefully balances accuracy and efficiency. Central to our approach is Decoupled Turn Policy Optimization (DTPO), which decouples the learning objective into two components: (1) tool learning, which optimizes correct tool utilization, and (2) accuracy improvement, which refines the generated responses to improve answer correctness.

Given time-varying text prompts, FloodDiffusion generates text-aligned, seamless motion sequences with real-time latency. Unlike existing methods that rely on chunk-by-chunk or auto-regressive model with diffusion head, we adopt a diffusion forcing framework to model this time-series generation task under time-varying control events. We find that a straightforward implementation of vanilla diffusion forcing (as proposed for video models) fails to model real motion distributions. We demonstrate that to guarantee modeling the output distribution, the vanilla diffusion forcing must be tailored to: (i) train with a bi-directional attention instead of casual attention; (ii) implement a lower triangular time scheduler instead of a random one; (iii) utilize a continues time-varying way to introduce text conditioning. With these improvements, we demonstrate in the first time that the diffusion forcing-based framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the streaming motion generation task, reaching an FID of 0.057 on the HumanML3D benchmark.

To address it, we present a Blur Diffusion Model (BlurDM), which seamlessly integrates the blur formation process into diffusion for image deblurring. Observing that motion blur stems from continuous exposure, BlurDM implicitly models the blur formation process through a dual-diffusion forward scheme, diffusing both noise and blur onto a sharp image. During the reverse generation process, we derive a dual denoising and deblurring formulation, enabling BlurDM to recover the sharp image by simultaneously denoising and deblurring, given pure Gaussian noise conditioned on the blurred image as input.

However, in text-to-image(T2I) diffusion models, most related works focus on search strategies and reward models, yet the impact of the stochastic characteristic of noise in T2I diffusion models on the method's performance remains unexplored. In this work, we analyze the effects of randomness in T2I diffusion models and explore a new format of randomness for TTS: text embedding perturbation, which couples with existing randomness like SDE-injected noise to enhance generative diversity and quality. We start with a frequency-domain analysis of these formats of randomness and their impact on generation, and find that these two randomness exhibit complementary behavior in the frequency domain: spatial noise favors low-frequency components (early steps), while text embedding perturbation enhances high-frequency details (later steps), thereby compensating for the potential limitations of spatial noise randomness in high-frequency manipulation. Concurrently, text embedding demonstrates varying levels of tolerance to perturbation across different dimensions of the generation process. Specifically, our method consists of two key designs: (1) Introducing step-based text embedding perturbation, combining frequency-guided noise schedules with spatial noise perturbation. (2) Adapting the perturbation intensity selectively based on their frequency-specific contributions to generation and tolerance to perturbation. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into existing TTS methods and demonstrates significant improvements on multiple benchmarks with almost no additional computation.

However, their ability to interpret cartographic maps remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce CartoMapQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LVLMs' understanding of cartographic maps through question-answering tasks. The dataset includes over 2000 samples, each composed of a cartographic map, a question (with open-ended or multiple-choice answers), and a ground-truth answer. These tasks span key low-, mid- and high-level map interpretation skills, including symbol recognition, embedded information extraction, scale interpretation, and route-based reasoning. Our evaluation of both open-source and proprietary LVLMs reveals persistent challenges: models frequently struggle with map-specific semantics, exhibit limited geospatial reasoning, and are prone to Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-related errors. By isolating these weaknesses, CartoMapQA offers a valuable tool for guiding future improvements in LVLM architectures. Ultimately, it supports the development of models better equipped for real-world applications that depend on robust and reliable map understanding, such as navigation, geographic search, and urban planning.

Consequently, recent research has focused on query-aware frame selection, methods that often incur significant computational overhead. This paper challenges the assumption that such complex search mechanisms are universally necessary. We first identify and validate a query typology distinguishing between global query and localized query. We demonstrate that while uniform sampling is both effective and efficient for global queries, localized queries indeed necessitate query-aware selection for optimal performance. Building on this insight, we propose DIG, a training-free frame selection framework that adapts its strategy based on the query type. Specifically,DIG employs efficient uniform sampling for global queries while activating a specialized pipeline to extract query-relevant frames for localized queries.

First, we fine-tune a point cloud generation model to produce a coarse representation of objects from text prompts.

Existing methods suffer from two major challenges: inconsistency and length-insensitivity. They often fail to maintain coherence between the edited local patch and the surrounding area, and they struggle to handle significant differences in text length before and after editing. To tackle these challenges, we propose an end-to-end framework called Global-Local Aware Scene Text Editing (GLASTE), which simultaneously incorporates high-level global contextual information along with delicate local features. Specifically, we design a global-local combination structure, joint global and local losses, and enhance text image features to ensure consistency in text style within local patches while maintaining harmony between local and global areas.

This challenge has driven the development of efficient attention mechanisms, with sparsity emerging as the dominant paradigm. Current methods typically retain or discard entire key-value blocks with binary masks, resulting in substantial information loss under high sparsity. To mitigate this gap, we present Pyramid Sparse Attention (PSA), a versatile module applicable to both video understanding and generation tasks. Instead of binary masking, PSA introduces multi-level pooled KV representations, enabling finer mask granularity. Specifically, each query block dynamically allocates lower pooling levels to critical KV blocks and higher levels to less important ones, creating an informative interpolation between full retention and complete pruning. This design, analogous to fixed-point quantization and classical feature pyramid networks in computer vision, effectively mitigates information loss while preserving computational efficiency under a low compute budget. It works with a native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages decoupled block-tile design to ensure efficient execution. Across video understanding and generation benchmarks, PSA preserves contextual information and visual fidelity, consistently outperforming or achieving comparable performance over existing sparse attention baselines with superior efficiency-quality trade-offs.

Camera-ready version accepted for IEEE BIBM 2025", "summary": "Universal, transferable whole-slide image (WSI) representations are central to computational pathology. Incorporating multiple markers (e.g., immunohistochemistry, IHC) alongside H&E enriches H&E-based features with diverse, biologically meaningful information. However, progress is limited by the scarcity of well-aligned multi-stain datasets. Inter-stain misalignment shifts corresponding tissue across slides, hindering consistent patch-level features and degrading slide-level embeddings. To address this, we curated a slide-level aligned, five-stain dataset (H&E, HER2, KI67, ER, PGR) to enable paired H&E-IHC learning and robust cross-stain representation. Leveraging this dataset, we propose Cross-Stain Contrastive Learning (CSCL), a two-stage pretraining framework with a lightweight adapter trained using patch-wise contrastive alignment to improve the compatibility of H&E features with corresponding IHC-derived contextual cues, and slide-level representation learning with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), which uses a cross-stain attention fusion module to integrate stain-specific patch features and a cross-stain global alignment module to enforce consistency among slide-level embeddings across different stains. Experiments on cancer subtype classification, IHC biomarker status classification, and survival prediction show consistent gains, yielding high-quality, transferable H&E slide-level representations.

Although recent diffusion-based approaches improve upon traditional optical-flow-based methods, they still struggle to cover diverse application scenarios and often fail to produce sharp, temporally consistent frames in fine-grained motion tasks such as audio-visual synchronized interpolation. To address these limitations, we introduce BBF (Beyond Boundary Frames), a context-aware video frame interpolation framework, which could be guided by audio/visual semantics. First, we enhance the input design of the interpolation model so that it can flexibly handle multiple conditional modalities, including text, audio, images, and video. Second, we propose a decoupled multimodal fusion mechanism that sequentially injects different conditional signals into a DiT backbone. Finally, to maintain the generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt a progressive multi-stage training paradigm, where the start-end frame difference embedding is used to dynamically adjust both the data sampling and the loss weighting.

The inherent complexity of this task stems from the intricate relationship between sequence and structure, making it particularly challenging. In this paper, we propose a framework, named HyperRNA, a generative model with an encoder-decoder architecture that leverages hypergraphs to design RNA sequences. Specifically, our HyperRNA model consists of three main components: preprocessing, encoding and decoding.\n  In the preprocessing stage, graph structures are constructed by extracting the atom coordinates of RNA backbone based on 3-bead coarse-grained representation. The encoding stage processes these graphs, capturing higher order dependencies and complex biomolecular interactions using an attention embedding module and a hypergraph-based encoder.

While Vision Transformers that leverage shifted window-based self-attention have established new benchmarks in this field, they are often hampered by a critical limitation: their localized attention mechanism struggles to effectively fuse local details with global context. This deficiency is particularly detrimental to challenging tasks such as the segmentation of microtumors and miniature organs, where both fine-grained boundary definition and broad contextual understanding are paramount. To address this gap, we propose HBFormer, a novel Hybrid-Bridge Transformer architecture. The 'Hybrid' design of HBFormer synergizes a classic U-shaped encoder-decoder framework with a powerful Swin Transformer backbone for robust hierarchical feature extraction. The core innovation lies in its 'Bridge' mechanism, a sophisticated nexus for multi-scale feature integration. This bridge is architecturally embodied by our novel Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MFF) decoder. Departing from conventional symmetric designs, the MFF decoder is engineered to fuse multi-scale features from the encoder with global contextual information. It achieves this through a synergistic combination of channel and spatial attention modules, which are constructed from a series of dilated and depth-wise convolutions. These components work in concert to create a powerful feature bridge that explicitly captures long-range dependencies and refines object boundaries with exceptional precision. Comprehensive experiments on challenging medical image segmentation datasets, including multi-organ, liver tumor, and bladder tumor benchmarks, demonstrate that HBFormer achieves state-of-the-art results, showcasing its outstanding capabilities in microtumor and miniature organ segmentation.

However, despite their strong generalization capabilities, these models often lack 3D consistency, a fundamental requirement for understanding scene geometry and motion, thereby causing severe spatial misalignment and temporal flickering in complex 3D environments. In this paper, we present Motion4D, a novel framework that addresses these challenges by integrating 2D priors from foundation models into a unified 4D Gaussian Splatting representation. Our method features a two-part iterative optimization framework: 1) Sequential optimization, which updates motion and semantic fields in consecutive stages to maintain local consistency, and 2) Global optimization, which jointly refines all attributes for long-term coherence. To enhance motion accuracy, we introduce a 3D confidence map that dynamically adjusts the motion priors, and an adaptive resampling process that inserts new Gaussians into under-represented regions based on per-pixel RGB and semantic errors. Furthermore, we enhance semantic coherence through an iterative refinement process that resolves semantic inconsistencies by alternately optimizing the semantic fields and updating prompts of SAM2. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our Motion4D significantly outperforms both 2D foundation models and existing 3D-based approaches across diverse scene understanding tasks, including point-based tracking, video object segmentation, and novel view synthesis.

We construct a large-scale procedural dataset pairing natural text descriptions with corresponding motion programs and 3D trajectories.

This finding has sparked excitement about vision-based context compression for language models. But the evaluation stops at reconstruction; whether these representations help language modeling remains untested. We test two assumptions implicit in the optical-compression narrative: that vision-based compression provides unique advantages for text reconstruction from compressed representations, and that DeepSeek-OCR's reconstruction results are evidence that vision-based compression will be useful for language modeling. Comparing their vision encoder against simple alternatives--parameter-free mean pooling and a learned hierarchical encoder--we find that these simple approaches match or surpass vision for reconstruction at matched compression ratios, and outperform it for language modeling--where vision-based compression fails to beat truncation. The excitement around optical context compression outpaces the evidence.

In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{Multi-Scale Visual Prompting (MSVP)}, a simple and generic module that learns a set of global, mid-scale, and local prompt maps fused with the input image via a lightweight $1 \\times 1$ convolution. MSVP is backbone-agnostic, adds less than $0.02\\%$ parameters, and significantly improves performance across CNN and Vision Transformer backbones.\n  We provide a unified benchmark on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 using a simple CNN, ResNet-18, and a small Vision Transformer. Our method yields consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead.

Beyond serving as a community-wide data foundation, we further investigate a critical yet underexplored transition in colonoscopy - evolving from multimodal understanding to clinical reasoning: (a) To capture the current landscape of multimodal understanding behaviors, we systematically assess the generalizability of 22 multimodal large language models and examine their reliability under human-induced perturbations. The results reveal that clinical outputs from leading MLLMs remain far from robust and trustworthy. (b) To narrow this gap, we further explore reasoning-centric intelligence tailored for colonoscopy. Specifically, we curate ColonReason, a clinically grounded reasoning dataset annotated through a multi-expert debating pipeline, and develop ColonR1, the first R1-styled model incorporating task-adaptive rewarding and gradient-stable optimization techniques. Under data-scarce conditions, our ColonR1 achieves 56.61% overall accuracy, outperforming supervised fine-tuning by 25.22%, and sets a new reasoning-enabled baseline for multimodal colonoscopy analysis.

However, as model size increases, the growing memory footprint and inference latency pose significant challenges for practical deployment. Recent studies in large language models (LLMs) show that rotation-based techniques can smooth outliers and enable 4-bit quantization, but these approaches often incur substantial overhead and struggle with row-wise outliers in diffusion transformers. To address these challenges, we propose ConvRot, a group-wise rotation-based quantization method that leverages regular Hadamard transform (RHT) to suppress both row-wise and column-wise outliers while reducing complexity from quadratic to linear. Building on this, we design ConvLinear4bit, a plug-and-play module that integrates rotation, quantization, GEMM, and dequantization, enabling W4A4 inference without retraining and preserving visual quality. Experiments on FLUX.1-dev demonstrate a 2.26$\\times$ speedup and 4.05$\\times$ memory reduction while maintaining image fidelity.

Existing text-to-3D stylization methods typically distill from 2D image editors, requiring time-intensive per-asset optimization and exhibiting multi-view inconsistency due to the limitations of current text-to-image models, which makes them impractical for large-scale production. In this paper, we introduce GaussianBlender, a pioneering feed-forward framework for text-driven 3D stylization that performs edits instantly at inference.

This approach is particularly powerful in complex environments where static sensing methods may not provide sufficient information. Active visual perception plays a critical role in numerous applications, including robotics, autonomous vehicles, human-computer interaction, and surveillance systems. However, despite its significant promise, there are several challenges that need to be addressed, including real-time processing of complex visual data, decision-making in dynamic environments, and integrating multimodal sensory inputs.

Deep perceptual losses, such as LPIPS, achieve good alignment but rely on complex, highly non-linear discriminative features with unknown invariances, while hand-crafted measures like SSIM are interpretable but miss key perceptual properties.\n  We introduce the Structured Uncertainty Similarity Score (SUSS); it models each image through a set of perceptual components, each represented by a structured multivariate Normal distribution. These are trained in a generative, self-supervised manner to assign high likelihood to human-imperceptible augmentations. The final score is a weighted sum of component log-probabilities with weights learned from human perceptual datasets. Unlike feature-based methods, SUSS learns image-specific linear transformations of residuals in pixel space, enabling transparent inspection through decorrelated residuals and sampling.\n  SUSS aligns closely with human perceptual judgments, shows strong perceptual calibration across diverse distortion types, and provides localized, interpretable explanations of its similarity assessments.

It first performs single-modality learning and then operates cross-modality learning to tackle the modality discrepancy. Although promising, this pipeline inevitably introduces modality bias: modality-specific cues learned in the single-modality training naturally propagate into the following cross-modality learning, impairing identity discrimination and generalization. To address this issue, we propose a Dual-level Modality Debiasing Learning (DMDL) framework that implements debiasing at both the model and optimization levels. At the model level, we propose a Causality-inspired Adjustment Intervention (CAI) module that replaces likelihood-based modeling with causal modeling, preventing modality-induced spurious patterns from being introduced, leading to a low-biased model. At the optimization level, a Collaborative Bias-free Training (CBT) strategy is introduced to interrupt the propagation of modality bias across data, labels, and features by integrating modality-specific augmentation, label refinement, and feature alignment.

In this work, we first reveal a critical and previously overlooked weakness: even state-of-the-art MLLMs are surprisingly brittle, showing significant performance degradation on images with simple orientation changes or natural corruptions, underscoring the need for more robust tool-based reasoning. To address this, we propose CodeVision, a flexible and scalable code-as-tool framework where the model generates code as a universal interface to invoke any image operation, moving beyond fixed tool registries. We train our model using a two-stage methodology, beginning with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on a high-quality dataset curated for complex, multi-turn tool composition and error recovery, followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a novel and dense process reward function to encourage strategic and efficient tool use. To facilitate this research, we construct new SFT and RL datasets and introduce a challenging new benchmark suite designed to rigorously evaluate robustness to orientation changes and multi-tool reasoning. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series show that our approach significantly improves model performance and fosters emergent capabilities such as flexible tool composition, efficient chained execution, and robust error recovery from runtime feedback.

We introduce SelfDebias, a fully unsupervised test-time debiasing method applicable to any diffusion model that uses a UNet as its noise predictor. SelfDebias identifies semantic clusters in an image encoder's embedding space and uses these clusters to guide the diffusion process during inference, minimizing the KL divergence between the output distribution and the uniform distribution. Unlike supervised approaches, SelfDebias does not require human-annotated datasets or external classifiers trained for each generated concept. Instead, it is designed to automatically identify semantic modes. Extensive experiments show that SelfDebias generalizes across prompts and diffusion model architectures, including both conditional and unconditional models.

To mitigate this, we propose Latent Scale Rejection Sampling (LSRS), a method that progressively refines token maps in the latent scale during inference to enhance VAR models. Our method uses a lightweight scoring model to evaluate multiple candidate token maps sampled at each scale, selecting the high-quality map to guide subsequent scale generation. By prioritizing early scales critical for structural coherence, LSRS effectively mitigates autoregressive error accumulation while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that LSRS significantly improves VAR's generation quality with minimal additional computational overhead. For the VAR-d30 model, LSRS increases the inference time by merely 1% while reducing its FID score from 1.95 to 1.78.

The present study proposes a more robust method to measure breath rate in humans with minimal hardware requirements using a combination of mathematical transforms with a relative deviation from the ground truth of less than 5%. The method was tested on videos taken from 14 volunteers with a total duration of over 2 hours 30 minutes. The obtained results were compared to reference data and the average mean absolute error was found to be at 0.57 respirations per minute, which is noticeably better than the results from previous works.

Current Unet architectures iteratively downsample spatial resolution while increasing channel dimensions to preserve information content. Such a structure demands a large memory footprint, limiting training batch sizes and increasing inference latency. Channel pruning compresses Unet architecture without accuracy loss, but requires lengthy optimization and may not generalize across tasks and datasets. By investigating Unet pruning, we hypothesize that the final structure is the crucial factor, not the channel selection strategy of pruning. Based on our observations, we propose a lean Unet architecture (LUnet) with a compact, flat hierarchy where channels are not doubled as resolution is halved. We evaluate on a public MRI dataset allowing comparable reporting, as well as on two internal CT datasets. We show that a state-of-the-art pruning solution (STAMP) mainly prunes from the layers with the highest number of channels. Comparatively, simply eliminating a random channel at the pruning-identified layer or at the largest layer achieves similar or better performance. Our proposed LUnet with fixed architectures and over 30 times fewer parameters achieves performance comparable to both conventional Unet counterparts and data-adaptively pruned networks. The proposed lean Unet with constant channel count across layers requires far fewer parameters while achieving performance superior to standard Unet for the same total number of parameters.

The extracted pooled features demonstrate obvious performance advantages over the previously obtained pose data and heatmap features from videos. In addition, we design a spatial-motion co-learning module and a text refinement modulation module to integrate the extracted pooled features with other multimodal data, enabling more robust action recognition. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks namely NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, Toyota-Smarthome and UAV-Human consistently verify the effectiveness of our HP-Net, which outperforms the existing human action recognition methods.

First, despite pioneering the use of diffusion models in DD and delivering impressive performance, the vast majority of approaches paradoxically require a diffusion model pre-trained on the full target dataset, undermining the very purpose of DD and incurring prohibitive training costs. Second, although some methods turn to general text-to-image models without relying on such target-specific training, they suffer from a significant distributional mismatch, as the web-scale priors encapsulated in these foundation models fail to faithfully capture the target-specific semantics, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose Core Distribution Alignment (CoDA), a framework that enables effective DD using only an off-the-shelf text-to-image model. Our key idea is to first identify the \"intrinsic core distribution\" of the target dataset using a robust density-based discovery mechanism. We then steer the generative process to align the generated samples with this core distribution. By doing so, CoDA effectively bridges the gap between general-purpose generative priors and target semantics, yielding highly representative distilled datasets. Extensive experiments suggest that, without relying on a generative model specifically trained on the target dataset, CoDA achieves performance on par with or even superior to previous methods with such reliance across all benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K and its subsets. Notably, it establishes a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 60.4% at the 50-images-per-class (IPC) setup on ImageNet-1K.

Existing methods primarily focus on spatial-domain modeling but neglect frequency-domain priors. Although the emerging Mamba architecture excels at long-range dependency modeling through patch-wise correlation analysis, its potential for frequency-domain feature extraction remains unexplored. To address this, we propose Frequency-Aware Mamba (FAMamba), a novel framework that integrates frequency guidance with sequence modeling for efficient image restoration. Our architecture consists of two key components: (1) a Dual-Branch Feature Extraction Block (DFEB) that enhances local-global interaction via bidirectional 2D frequency-adaptive scanning, dynamically adjusting traversal paths based on sub-band texture distributions; and (2) a Prior-Guided Block (PGB) that refines texture details through wavelet-based high-frequency residual learning, enabling high-quality image reconstruction with precise details. Meanwhile, we design a novel Adaptive Frequency Scanning Mechanism (AFSM) for the Mamba architecture, which enables the Mamba to achieve frequency-domain scanning across distinct subgraphs, thereby fully leveraging the texture distribution characteristics inherent in subgraph structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of FAMamba.", "AI": {"tldr": "FAMamba\u7ed3\u5408\u9891\u7387\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DFEB\u548cPGB\u63d0\u5347\u4ea4\u901a\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u8d28\u91cf\uff0cAFSM\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u9891\u7387\u57df\u626b\u63cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u9891\u7387\u57df\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u800cMamba\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u9891\u7387\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Frequency-Aware Mamba (FAMamba)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5757(DFEB)\u548c\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5757(PGB)\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9891\u7387\u626b\u63cf\u673a\u5236(AFSM)\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86FAMamba\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "FAMamba\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u9891\u7387\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4ea4\u901a\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Zero-shot techniques aim to adapt image diffusion models for videos without requiring further model training.

In this paper, we present FRESCO, which integrates intra-frame correspondence with inter-frame correspondence to formulate a more robust spatial-temporal constraint.

Unifying 2D videos and 3D motions for simultaneous optimization and generation remains largely unexplored, presenting significant challenges due to their substantial structural and distributional differences. Inspired by the LLM's ability to unify different modalities, our method models videos and 3D motions as a unified tokens sequence, utilizing separate embedding layers to mitigate distribution gaps. Additionally, we devise a sequence modeling strategy that integrates two distinct tasks within a single framework, proving the effectiveness of unified modeling. Moreover, to efficiently align with visual tokens and preserve 3D spatial information, we design a novel 3D motion tokenizer with a temporal expansion strategy, using a single VQ-VAE to produce quantized motion tokens. It features multiple expert decoders that handle body shapes, translation, global orientation, and body poses for reliable 3D motion reconstruction.

However, when addressing real-world degradations, model performance is limited by the quality of ground-truth images in datasets due to practical constraints in data acquisition. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that enhances existing ground truth images to provide higher-quality supervision for real-world restoration. Our framework generates perceptually enhanced ground truth images using super-resolution by incorporating adaptive frequency masks, which are learned by a conditional frequency mask generator. These masks guide the optimal fusion of frequency components from the original ground truth and its super-resolved variants, yielding enhanced ground truth images. This frequency-domain mixup preserves the semantic consistency of the original content while selectively enriching perceptual details, preventing hallucinated artifacts that could compromise fidelity. The enhanced ground truth images are used to train a lightweight output refinement network that can be seamlessly integrated with existing restoration models.

While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been explored for improving temporal reasoning, existing approaches are often confined to limited task types and data, restricting their generalization across diverse temporal understanding scenarios. To address this challenge, we present TempR1, a temporal-aware multi-task reinforcement learning framework that systematically strengthens MLLMs' temporal comprehension. We curate a multi-task corpus that exposes the model to diverse temporal structures and semantics, and build upon the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to achieve stable and effective cross-task optimization. Specifically, we categorize temporal tasks into three correspondence types between predicted intervals and ground-truth instances, and design tailored localization rewards for each, enabling TempR1 to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies and adapt to different temporal patterns.

While both paradigms have shown promise, existing methods struggle to simultaneously achieve high identity fidelity and flexible text controllability. We introduce UniID, a unified tuning-free framework that synergistically integrates both paradigms. Our key insight is that when merging these approaches, they should mutually reinforce only identity-relevant information while preserving the original diffusion prior for non-identity attributes. We realize this through a principled training-inference strategy: during training, we employ an identity-focused learning scheme that guides both branches to capture identity features exclusively; at inference, we introduce a normalized rescaling mechanism that recovers the text controllability of the base diffusion model while enabling complementary identity signals to enhance each other. This principled design enables UniID to achieve high-fidelity face personalization with flexible text controllability. Extensive experiments against six state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that UniID achieves superior performance in both identity preservation and text controllability.

However, existing methods rely heavily on manually provided masks and textual prompts to preserve semantic fidelity and motion precision. Removing these constraints creates a fundamental trade-off: visual artifacts without masks and poor spatial control without prompts. To address these limitations, we propose DirectDrag, a novel mask- and prompt-free editing framework. DirectDrag enables precise and efficient manipulation with minimal user input while maintaining high image fidelity and accurate point alignment. DirectDrag introduces two key innovations. First, we design an Auto Soft Mask Generation module that intelligently infers editable regions from point displacement, automatically localizing deformation along movement paths while preserving contextual integrity through the generative model's inherent capacity. Second, we develop a Readout-Guided Feature Alignment mechanism that leverages intermediate diffusion activations to maintain structural consistency during point-based edits, substantially improving visual fidelity. Despite operating without manual mask or prompt, DirectDrag achieves superior image quality compared to existing methods while maintaining competitive drag accuracy. Extensive experiments on DragBench and real-world scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of DirectDrag for high-quality, interactive image manipulation.

While traditional Structure-from-Motion pipelines handle such cases through geometric verification and outlier rejection, feed-forward 3D reconstruction models lack these explicit mechanisms, leading to degraded performance under in-the-wild conditions. In this paper, we discover that the existing feed-forward reconstruction model, e.g., VGGT, despite lacking explicit outlier-rejection mechanisms or noise-aware training, can inherently distinguish distractor images. Through an in-depth analysis under varying proportions of synthetic distractors, we identify a specific layer that naturally exhibits outlier-suppressing behavior. Further probing reveals that this layer encodes discriminative internal representations that enable an effective noise-filtering capability, which we simply leverage to perform outlier-view rejection in feed-forward 3D reconstruction without any additional fine-tuning or supervision. Extensive experiments on both controlled and in-the-wild datasets demonstrate that this implicit filtering mechanism is consistent and generalizes well across diverse scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u524d\u9988\u5f0f3D\u91cd\u5efa\u6a21\u578bVGGT\u80fd\u56fa\u6709\u5730\u533a\u5206\u5e72\u6270\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5b9a\u5c42\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u6291\u5236\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u566a\u58f0\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u91ce\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u96c6\u5408\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u97603D\u91cd\u5efa\u65f6\uff0c\u56e0\u65e0\u5173\u8f93\u5165\uff08\u566a\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u62d2\u7edd\u5904\u7406\u6b64\u7c7b\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u800c\u524d\u9988\u5f0f3D\u91cd\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u663e\u5f0f\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5e72\u6270\u7269\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u7136\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f02\u5e38\u6291\u5236\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u5c42\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u8be5\u5c42\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u5224\u522b\u6027\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u8fc7\u6ee4\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u548c\u91ce\u5916\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u9690\u5f0f\u8fc7\u6ee4\u673a\u5236\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u524d\u9988\u5f0f3D\u91cd\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982VGGT\uff09\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u62d2\u7edd\u673a\u5236\u6216\u566a\u58f0\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u591f\u56fa\u6709\u5730\u533a\u5206\u5e72\u6270\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u5c42\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u6291\u5236\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u76d1\u7763\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3002"}}

Prior works applying group-theoretic priors or modeling transformations typically operate in the high-dimensional data space, where group actions apply uniformly across the entire input, making it difficult to disentangle the subspace that varies under transformations. While latent-space methods offer greater flexibility, they still require manual partitioning of latent variables into equivariant and invariant subspaces, limiting the ability to robustly learn and operate group actions within the representation space. To address this, we introduce a novel end-to-end framework that for the first time learns group actions on latent image manifolds, automatically discovering transformation-relevant structures without manual intervention. Our method uses learnable binary masks with straight-through estimation to dynamically partition latent representations into transformation-sensitive and invariant components. We formulate this within a unified optimization framework that jointly learns latent disentanglement and group transformation mappings. The framework can be seamlessly integrated with any standard encoder-decoder architecture. We validate our approach on five 2D/3D image datasets, demonstrating its ability to automatically learn disentangled latent factors for group actions in diverse data, while downstream classification tasks confirm the effectiveness of the learned representations.

Moreover, some recently proposed lightweight INRs have shown comparable performance to their baseline codecs with computational complexity lower than 10kMACs/pixel. In this work, we extend NVRC toward lightweight representations, and propose NVRC-Lite, which incorporates two key changes. Firstly, we integrated multi-scale feature grids into our lightweight neural representation, and the use of higher resolution grids significantly improves the performance of INRs at low complexity. Secondly, we address the issue that existing INRs typically leverage autoregressive models for entropy coding: these are effective but impractical due to their slow coding speed. In this work, we propose an octree-based context model for entropy coding high-dimensional feature grids, which accelerates the entropy coding module of the model. Our experimental results demonstrate that NVRC-Lite outperforms C3, one of the best lightweight INR-based video codecs, with up to 21.03% and 23.06% BD-rate savings when measured in PSNR and MS-SSIM, respectively, while achieving 8.4x encoding and 2.5x decoding speedup.

Recent approaches use per-pixel 3D Gaussian Splatting for reconstruction, followed by a 2D-to-3D feature lifting stage for scene understanding. However, they generate excessive redundant Gaussians, causing high memory overhead and sub-optimal multi-view feature aggregation, leading to degraded novel view synthesis and scene understanding performance. We propose C3G, a novel feed-forward framework that estimates compact 3D Gaussians only at essential spatial locations, minimizing redundancy while enabling effective feature lifting. We introduce learnable tokens that aggregate multi-view features through self-attention to guide Gaussian generation, ensuring each Gaussian integrates relevant visual features across views. We then exploit the learned attention patterns for Gaussian decoding to efficiently lift features. Extensive experiments on pose-free novel view synthesis, 3D open-vocabulary segmentation, and view-invariant feature aggregation demonstrate our approach's effectiveness.

However, most existing approaches address only one of these aspects in isolation, as achieving all three simultaneously is highly challenging-for example, long-term memory mechanisms often degrade real-time performance. In this work, we present RELIC, a unified framework that tackles these three challenges altogether. Given a single image and a text description, RELIC enables memory-aware, long-duration exploration of arbitrary scenes in real time. Built upon recent autoregressive video-diffusion distillation techniques, our model represents long-horizon memory using highly compressed historical latent tokens encoded with both relative actions and absolute camera poses within the KV cache. This compact, camera-aware memory structure supports implicit 3D-consistent content retrieval and enforces long-term coherence with minimal computational overhead. In parallel, we fine-tune a bidirectional teacher video model to generate sequences beyond its original 5-second training horizon, and transform it into a causal student generator using a new memory-efficient self-forcing paradigm that enables full-context distillation over long-duration teacher as well as long student self-rollouts. Implemented as a 14B-parameter model and trained on a curated Unreal Engine-rendered dataset, RELIC achieves real-time generation at 16 FPS while demonstrating more accurate action following, more stable long-horizon streaming, and more robust spatial-memory retrieval compared with prior work. These capabilities establish RELIC as a strong foundation for the next generation of interactive world modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "RELIC\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u957f\u65f6\u6d41\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u7528\u6237\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4ec5\u5b64\u7acb\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u65f6\u957f\u65f6\u6d41\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6216\u7cbe\u786e\u7528\u6237\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u800c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u6781\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002RELIC\u65e8\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e09\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "RELIC\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u5ea6\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u6f5c\u5728\u4ee4\u724c\u8868\u793a\u957f\u65f6\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u76f8\u5bf9\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u7edd\u5bf9\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u8fdb\u884c\u7f16\u7801\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u53cc\u5411\u6559\u5e08\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u5f3a\u5236\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u957f\u65f6\u6559\u5e08\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u81ea\u5c55\u5f00\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u84b8\u998f\u3002", "result": "RELIC\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a14B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u572816 FPS\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u8ddf\u968f\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u6d41\u548c\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "RELIC\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u957f\u65f6\u6d41\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u7528\u6237\u63a7\u5236\u8fd9\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Most previous works focused on the Text2Gloss, Gloss2Pose, Pose2Vid stages, and some concentrated on Prompt2Gloss and Text2Avatar stages. However, this field has made slow progress due to the inaccuracy of text conversion, pose generation, and the rendering of poses into real human videos in these stages, resulting in gradually accumulating errors. Therefore, in this paper, we streamline the traditional redundant structure, simplify and optimize the task objective, and design a new sign language generative model called Stable Signer. It redefines the SLP task as a hierarchical generation end-to-end task that only includes text understanding (Prompt2Gloss, Text2Gloss) and Pose2Vid, and executes text understanding through our proposed new Sign Language Understanding Linker called SLUL, and generates hand gestures through the named SLP-MoE hand gesture rendering expert block to end-to-end generate high-quality and multi-style sign language videos.

Recent advances have explored automating this process using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), yet existing methods often produce geometrically inaccurate layouts and lack the iterative, layer-specific editing required in professional workflows. To address these limitations, we present PosterCopilot, a framework that advances layout reasoning and controllable editing for professional graphic design. Specifically, we introduce a progressive three-stage training strategy that equips LMMs with geometric understanding and aesthetic reasoning for layout design, consisting of Perturbed Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning for Visual-Reality Alignment, and Reinforcement Learning from Aesthetic Feedback. Furthermore, we develop a complete workflow that couples the trained LMM-based design model with generative models, enabling layer-controllable, iterative editing for precise element refinement while maintaining global visual consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PosterCopilot achieves geometrically accurate and aesthetically superior layouts, offering unprecedented controllability for professional iterative design.", "AI": {"tldr": "PosterCopilot\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LMM\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u56fe\u5f62\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u5f62\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u51e0\u4f55\u5e03\u5c40\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u4e1a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u6240\u9700\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u3001\u5206\u5c42\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u6270\u52a8\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u89c6\u89c9-\u73b0\u5b9e\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f8e\u5b66\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c42\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPosterCopilot\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u7f8e\u5b66\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e13\u4e1a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u7f16\u8f91\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "PosterCopilot\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LMM\u5728\u56fe\u5f62\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7f8e\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e13\u4e1a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Prior works usually suffer from two limitations. First, they add random noise to training samples or VAE latents as data augmentation, introducing complex pipelines including extra noising and denoising steps. Second, they use a pretrained and frozen VAE encoder, resulting in suboptimal reconstruction and generation quality. In this paper, we find that the two issues can be solved in a very simple way: just fixing the variance (which would otherwise be predicted by the VAE encoder) to a constant (e.g., 0.5). On the one hand, this method allows the encoder to output a broader distribution of tokens and the decoder to learn to reconstruct clean images from the augmented token distribution, avoiding additional noise or denoising design. On the other hand, fixed variance simplifies the VAE evidence lower bound, making it stable to train an NF with a VAE jointly. On the ImageNet $256 \\times 256$ generation task, our model SimFlow obtains a gFID score of 2.15, outperforming the state-of-the-art method STARFlow (gFID 2.40). Moreover, SimFlow can be seamlessly integrated with the end-to-end representation alignment (REPA-E) method and achieves an improved gFID of 1.91, setting a new state of the art among NFs.", "AI": {"tldr": "SimFlow\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9aVAE\u65b9\u5dee\u7b80\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u6210\u4e3aNF\u9886\u57df\u65b0\u6807\u6746\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709NF\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u6dfb\u52a0\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u4f7f\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3VAE\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56fa\u5b9aVAE\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u4e3a\u5e38\u6570\uff08\u59820.5\uff09\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86VAE\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u4f7fNF\u4e0eVAE\u80fd\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet 256\u00d7256\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSimFlow\u7684gFID\u5f97\u5206\u4e3a2.15\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eSTARFlow\uff082.40\uff09\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408REPA-E\u540egFID\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u964d\u81f31.91\u3002", "conclusion": "SimFlow\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9aVAE\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u4e3a\u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0eREPA-E\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u540e\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6210\u4e3aNF\u9886\u57df\u7684\u65b0\u6807\u6746\u3002"}}

We leverage the multiple viewpoints naturally captured within a single life to learn a visual encoder in a self-supervised manner. Our experiments demonstrate three key findings. First, models trained independently on different lives develop a highly aligned geometric understanding. We demonstrate this by training visual encoders on distinct datasets each capturing a different life, both indoors and outdoors, as well as introducing a novel cross-attention-based metric to quantify the functional alignment of the internal representations developed by different models. Second, we show that single-life models learn generalizable geometric representations that effectively transfer to downstream tasks, such as depth estimation, in unseen environments. Third, we demonstrate that training on up to 30 hours from one week of the same person's life leads to comparable performance to training on 30 hours of diverse web data, highlighting the strength of single-life representation learning. Overall, our results establish that the shared structure of the world, both leads to consistency in models trained on individual lives, and provides a powerful signal for visual representation learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5355\u4e00\u751f\u547d\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2a\u4f53\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u5ab2\u7f8e\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2a\u4f53\u89c6\u89d2\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u5426\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u901a\u7528\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u5176\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2a\u4f53\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5355\u4e00\u751f\u547d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u4e00\u546830\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5355\u4e00\u751f\u547d\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2a\u4f53\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}
