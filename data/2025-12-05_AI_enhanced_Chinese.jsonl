However, many libraries are not designed with composition in mind and assume they have exclusive access to all resources. Using such libraries concurrently can result in contention and degraded performance. Prior solutions involve modifying the libraries or the OS, which is often infeasible.\n  We propose Virtual Library Contexts (VLCs), which are process subunits that encapsulate sets of libraries and associated resource allocations. VLCs control the resource utilization of these libraries without modifying library code. This enables the user to partition resources between libraries to prevent contention, or load multiple copies of the same library to allow parallel execution of otherwise thread-unsafe code within the same process.\n  In this paper, we describe and evaluate C++ and Python prototypes of VLCs.

However, accurate channel estimation in THz frequencies presents significant challenges due to factors such as high propagation losses, sensitivity to environmental obstructions, and strong atmospheric absorption. These challenges are particularly pronounced in urban environments, where traditional channel estimation methods often fail to deliver reliable results, particularly in complex non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. This paper introduces a novel vision-based channel estimation technique that integrates causal reasoning into urban THz communication systems. The proposed method combines computer vision algorithms with variational causal dynamics (VCD) to analyze real-time images of the urban environment, allowing for a deeper understanding of the physical factors that influence THz signal propagation. By capturing the complex, dynamic interactions between physical objects (such as buildings, trees, and vehicles) and the transmitted signals, the model can predict the channel with up to twice the accuracy of conventional methods. This model improves estimation accuracy and demonstrates superior generalization performance. Hence, it can provide reliable predictions even in previously unseen urban environments. The effectiveness of the proposed method is particularly evident in NLoS conditions, where it significantly outperforms traditional methods such as by accounting for indirect signal paths, such as reflections and diffractions. Simulation results confirm that the proposed vision-based approach surpasses conventional artificial intelligence (AI)-based estimation techniques in accuracy and robustness, showing a substantial improvement across various dynamic urban scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u7684THz\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3THz\u9891\u6bb5\u57286G\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u56e0\u9ad8\u4f20\u64ad\u635f\u8017\u3001\u73af\u5883\u969c\u788d\u548c\u5927\u6c14\u5438\u6536\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u975e\u89c6\u8ddd\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u53d8\u5206\u56e0\u679c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff08VCD\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u9053\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u662f\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e24\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u6280\u672f\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86THz\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u975e\u89c6\u8ddd\uff08NLoS\uff09\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

In this work, we present SPLICE, a novel part-level neural implicit representation of 3D shapes that enables intuitive, structure-aware, and high-fidelity shape editing. By encoding each shape part independently and positioning them using parameterized Gaussian ellipsoids, SPLICE effectively isolates part-specific features while discarding global context that may hinder flexible manipulation. A global attention-based decoder is then employed to integrate parts coherently, further enhanced by an attention-guiding filtering mechanism that prevents information leakage across symmetric or adjacent components. Through this architecture, SPLICE supports various part-level editing operations, including translation, rotation, scaling, deletion, duplication, and cross-shape part mixing. These operations enable users to flexibly explore design variations while preserving semantic consistency and maintaining structural plausibility.

Although training is energy-intensive, the long-term environmental burden arises from inference, amplified by the massive global query volume. Cloud-based inference offers scalability but suffers from latency and bandwidth constraints due to centralized processing and continuous data transfer. Edge clusters instead can mitigate these limitations by enabling localized execution, yet they face trade-offs between performance, energy efficiency, and device constraints. This short paper presents a sustainability-aware LLM inference for edge clusters comprising NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX (8GB) and Nvidia Ada 2000 (16GB) devices. It aims to balance inference latency and carbon footprint through carbon- and latency-aware routing strategies, guided by empirical benchmarking of energy consumption and execution time across diverse prompts and batch (i.e., group of prompts) configurations. We compared baseline greedy strategies to carbon-aware and latency-aware strategies in prompt routing to specific hardware based on benchmarking information.

However, its effectiveness depends heavily on the selection and quality of in-context examples, particularly in complex domains. In this work, we examine retrieval-augmented prompting as a strategy to improve few-shot performance in code vulnerability detection, where the goal is to identify one or more security-relevant weaknesses present in a given code snippet from a predefined set of vulnerability categories. We perform a systematic evaluation using the Gemini-1.5-Flash model across three approaches: (1) standard few-shot prompting with randomly selected examples, (2) retrieval-augmented prompting using semantically similar examples, and (3) retrieval-based labeling, which assigns labels based on retrieved examples without model inference. Our results show that retrieval-augmented prompting consistently outperforms the other prompting strategies. At 20 shots, it achieves an F1 score of 74.05% and a partial match accuracy of 83.90%. We further compare this approach against zero-shot prompting and several fine-tuned models, including Gemini-1.5-Flash and smaller open-source models such as DistilBERT, DistilGPT2, and CodeBERT. Retrieval-augmented prompting outperforms both zero-shot (F1 score: 36.35%, partial match accuracy: 20.30%) and fine-tuned Gemini (F1 score: 59.31%, partial match accuracy: 53.10%), while avoiding the training time and cost associated with model fine-tuning.

We introduce CRAFT-E, a modular neuro-symbolic framework that composes a structured verb-property-object knowledge graph with visual-language alignment and energy-based grasp reasoning. The system generates interpretable grounding paths that expose the factors influencing object selection and incorporates grasp feasibility as an integral part of affordance inference. We further construct a benchmark dataset with unified annotations for verb-object compatibility, segmentation, and grasp candidates, and deploy the full pipeline on a physical robot. CRAFT-E achieves competitive performance in static scenes, ImageNet-based functional retrieval, and real-world trials involving 20 verbs and 39 objects. The framework remains robust under perceptual noise and provides transparent, component-level diagnostics.

The best known time-space tradeoff for the problem is $T S^3 = n^{6}$ (up to logarithmic factors), where $n$ is the number of input integers, $S$ is the length of the preprocessed data structure, and $T$ is the running time of the query algorithm. This tradeoff was achieved in [KP19, GGHPV20] using the Fiat-Naor generic algorithm for Function Inversion. Consequently, [GGHPV20] asked whether this algorithm can be improved by leveraging the structure of 3SUM-Indexing.\n  In this paper, we exploit the structure of 3SUM-Indexing to give a time-space tradeoff of $T S = n^{2.5}$, which is better than the best known one in the range $n^{3/2} \\ll S \\ll n^{7/4}$. We further extend this improvement to the $k$SUM-Indexing problem-a generalization of 3SUM-Indexing-and to the related $k$XOR-Indexing problem, where addition is replaced with XOR. Additionally, we improve the best known time-space tradeoffs for the Gapped String Indexing and Jumbled Indexing problems, which are well-known data structure problems related to 3SUM-Indexing.\n  Our improvement comes from an alternative way to apply the Fiat-Naor algorithm to 3SUM-Indexing. Specifically, we exploit the structure of the function to be inverted by decomposing it into \"sub-functions\" with certain properties. This allows us to apply an improvement to the Fiat-Naor algorithm (which is not directly applicable to 3SUM-Indexing), obtained in [GGPS23] in a much larger range of parameters.

While complete methods like backtracking guarantee a solution, their exponential time complexity makes them impractical for large-scale instances thus, stochastic approaches, such as Las Vegas algorithm, are preferred. While it offers faster approximate solutions, it suffers from significant performance variance due to random placement of queens on the board. This research introduces a hybrid algorithm built on top of the standard Las Vegas framework through iterative pruning, dynamically eliminating invalid placements during the random assignment phase, thus this method effectively reduces the search space. The analysis results that traditional backtracking scales poorly with increasing N. In contrast, the proposed technique consistently generates valid solutions more rapidly, establishing it as a superior alternative to use where a single, timely solution is preferred over completeness. Although large N causes some performance variability, the algorithm demonstrates a highly effective trade-off between computational cost and solution fidelity, making it particularly suited for resource-constrained computing environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u62c9\u65af\u7ef4\u52a0\u65af\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5728N\u7687\u540e\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5feb\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u89e3\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u56de\u6eaf\u65b9\u6cd5\u968f\u7740N\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u6027\u80fd\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u62c9\u65af\u7ef4\u52a0\u65af\u7b97\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u4f9b\u5feb\u901f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u653e\u7f6e\u7687\u540e\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u6ce2\u52a8\u8f83\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u62c9\u65af\u7ef4\u52a0\u65af\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u526a\u679d\u52a8\u6001\u6d88\u9664\u968f\u673a\u5206\u914d\u9636\u6bb5\u4e2d\u7684\u65e0\u6548\u653e\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u56de\u6eaf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u66f4\u5feb\u5730\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u89e3\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u5728\u504f\u597d\u53ca\u65f6\u5355\u4e00\u89e3\u800c\u975e\u5b8c\u6574\u89e3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

A recent approach to tackle this issue is to train a network with pristine face images that have been manipulated with hand-crafted artifacts to extract more generalizable clues. While effective for static images, extending this to the video domain is an open issue. Existing methods model temporal artifacts as frame-to-frame instabilities, overlooking a key vulnerability: the violation of natural motion dependencies between different facial regions. In this paper, we propose a synthetic video generation method that creates training data with subtle kinematic inconsistencies. We train an autoencoder to decompose facial landmark configurations into motion bases. By manipulating these bases, we selectively break the natural correlations in facial movements and introduce these artifacts into pristine videos via face morphing. A network trained on our data learns to spot these sophisticated biomechanical flaws, achieving state-of-the-art generalization results on several popular benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f51\u7edc\u8bc6\u522b\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u4f2a\u5f71\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u9762\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u95f4\u81ea\u7136\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7834\u574f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u64cd\u7eb5\u8fd0\u52a8\u57fa\u6765\u6253\u7834\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4eba\u5de5\u75d5\u8ff9\u5f15\u5165\u539f\u59cb\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u590d\u6742\u7684\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f51\u7edc\u8bc6\u522b\u5408\u6210\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5fae\u5999\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, its performance and stability depend heavily on factors such as startup overhead, runtime execution model (e.g., Ahead-of-Time (AOT) and Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation), and resource variability across deployment contexts. This paper evaluates a Wasm-based serverless workflow executed consistently from the browser to edge and cloud instances. The setup uses wasm32-wasi modules: in the browser, execution occurs within a web worker, while on Edge and Cloud, an HTTP shim streams frames to the Wasm runtime. We measure cold- and warm-start latency, per-step delays, workflow makespan, throughput, and CPU/memory utilization to capture the end-to-end behavior across environments. Results show that AOT compilation and instance warming substantially reduce startup latency. For workflows with small payloads, the browser achieves competitive performance owing to fully in-memory data exchanges.

However, existing evaluation systems, neither traditional tests for humans nor benchmarks for LLMs, fail to capture this shift. They remain focused on well-defined algorithmic problems, which excludes problems where success depends on human-AI collaboration. Such collaborative problems not only require human reasoning to interpret complex contexts and guide solution strategies, but also demand AI efficiency for implementation. To bridge this gap, we introduce HAI-Eval, a unified benchmark designed to measure the synergy of human-AI partnership in coding. HAI-Eval's core innovation is its \"Collaboration-Necessary\" problem templates, which are intractable for both standalone LLMs and unaided humans, but solvable through effective collaboration. Specifically, HAI-Eval uses 45 templates to dynamically create tasks. It also provides a standardized IDE for human participants and a reproducible toolkit with 450 task instances for LLMs, ensuring an ecologically valid evaluation. We conduct a within-subject study with 45 participants and benchmark their performance against 5 state-of-the-art LLMs under 4 different levels of human intervention. Results show that standalone LLMs and unaided participants achieve poor pass rates (0.67% and 18.89%), human-AI collaboration significantly improves performance to 31.11%.

With the ever-increasing amount of data collected and generated, locating specific patterns of relationships between objects in a graph is often required. Given a larger graph and a smaller graph, one may wish to identify instances of the smaller query graph in the larger target graph. This task is called subgraph identification or matching. Subgraph matching is helpful in areas such as bioinformatics, binary analysis, pattern recognition, and computer vision. In these applications, datasets frequently contain noise and errors, thus exact subgraph matching algorithms do not apply. In this paper we introduce a new customizable algorithm for inexact subgraph matching. Our algorithm utilizes node and edge attributes which are often present in real-world datasets to narrow down the search space. The algorithm is flexible in the type of subgraph matching it can perform and the types of datasets it can process by its use of a modifiable graph edit distance cost function for pairing nodes.

In this work, we present RippleBench-Maker, an automatic tool for generating Q&A datasets that allow for the measurement of ripple effects in any model-editing task. RippleBench-Maker builds on a Wikipedia-based RAG pipeline (WikiRAG) to generate multiple-choice questions at varying semantic distances from the target concept (e.g., the knowledge being unlearned). Using this framework, we construct RippleBench-Bio, a benchmark derived from the WMDP (Weapons of Mass Destruction Paper) dataset, a common unlearning benchmark. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art unlearning methods and find that all exhibit non-trivial accuracy drops on topics increasingly distant from the unlearned knowledge, each with distinct propagation profiles.

While emerging breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) offer promise for automated histological analysis, the growing number of proprietary digital pathology solutions has created barriers to real-world deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce OnSight Pathology, a platform-agnostic computer vision software that uses continuous custom screen captures to provide real-time AI inferences to users as they review digital slide images. Accessible as a single, self-contained executable file (https://onsightpathology.github.io/ ), OnSight Pathology operates locally on consumer-grade personal computers without complex software integration, enabling cost-effective and secure deployment in research and clinical workflows. Here we demonstrate the utility of OnSight Pathology using over 2,500 publicly available whole slide images across different slide viewers, as well as cases from our clinical digital pathology setup. The software's robustness is highlighted across routine histopathological tasks, including the classification of common brain tumor types, mitosis detection, and the quantification of immunohistochemical stains.

This paper presents a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art resource management strategies in microservices-based fog and edge computing, focusing on energy-efficient solutions.

Our categorization is based on optimization techniques, targeted objectives, and the strengths and limitations of each approach. In addition, we examine existing surveys and identify unresolved challenges and gaps in the literature. By highlighting the lack of synergy among fundamental resource management components, we outline promising research directions leveraging AI-driven optimization, quantum computing, and serverless computing.

Depending on the type of twinning occurring, it is either trivial, such as in dashboarding/visualizations that mirror the system with real-time data, or challenging, in case the digital twin is a simulation model that reflects the behavior of a physical twinned system. The challenge in this latter case comes from the fact that in contrast to software systems, physical systems are not immutable once deployed, but instead they evolve through processes like maintenance, wear and tear or user error. It is therefore important to detect when changes occur in the physical system to evolve the twin alongside it. We employ and reuse validation techniques from model-based design for this goal. Model validation is one of the steps used to gain trust in the representativeness of a simulation model. In this work, we provide two contributions: (i) we provide a generic approach that, through the use of validation metrics, is able to detect anomalies in twinned systems, and (ii) we demonstrate these techniques with the help of an academic yet industrially relevant case study of a gantry crane such as found in ports.

In realistic simulators such as CARLA, privileged state (e.g., lane geometry, infractions, time-to-collision) can be converted into dense rewards that stabilize and accelerate model-based reinforcement learning, but policies trained directly on these signals often overfit and fail to generalize when evaluated on sparse objectives such as route completion and collision-free overtaking. We propose reward-privileged world model distillation, a two-stage framework in which a teacher DreamerV3-style agent is first trained with a dense privileged reward, and only its latent dynamics are distilled into a student trained solely on sparse task rewards. Teacher and student share the same observation space (semantic bird's-eye-view images); privileged information enters only through the teacher's reward, and the student does not imitate the teacher's actions or value estimates. Instead, the student's world model is regularized to match the teacher's latent dynamics while its policy is learned from scratch on sparse success/failure signals. In CARLA lane-following and overtaking benchmarks, sparse-reward students outperform both dense-reward teachers and sparse-from-scratch baselines. On unseen lane-following routes, reward-privileged distillation improves success by about 23 percent relative to the dense teacher while maintaining comparable or better safety. On overtaking, students retain near-perfect performance on training routes and achieve up to a 27x improvement in success on unseen routes, with improved lane keeping. These results show that dense rewards can be leveraged to learn richer dynamics models while keeping the deployed policy optimized strictly for sparse, deployment-aligned objectives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u8bad\u7ec3\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u84b8\u998f\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u5230\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u81ea\u4e3b\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u800c\u4e0d\u7ee7\u627f\u5176\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5956\u52b1\u7279\u6743\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f7f\u7528\u5bc6\u96c6\u7279\u6743\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u4ee3\u7406\uff08DreamerV3\u98ce\u683c\uff09\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4ec5\u5c06\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u84b8\u998f\u5230\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u4efb\u52a1\u5956\u52b1\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728CARLA\u8f66\u9053\u8ddf\u968f\u548c\u8d85\u8f66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u8f66\u9053\u8ddf\u968f\u8def\u7ebf\u4e0a\uff0c\u5956\u52b1\u7279\u6743\u84b8\u998f\u5c06\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ea623%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002\u5728\u8d85\u8f66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8def\u7ebf\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8def\u7ebf\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe27\u500d\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5956\u52b1\u7279\u6743\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u90e8\u7f72\u7b56\u7565\u4e25\u683c\u9488\u5bf9\u7a00\u758f\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Prior to our work, such a result was only known for the capacitated $k$-median problem [CL, ICALP, 2019]. As a special case, our result yields an FPT-time $3$-approximation for capacitated $k$-center. The problem has not been studied in the FPT-time setting, with the previous best known polynomial-time approximation ratio being 9 [ABCG, MP, 2015].\n  In the uncapacitated setting, we consider the $top$-$cn$ norm $k$-clustering problem, where the goal of the problem is to minimize the $top$-$cn$ norm of the connection distance vector. Our main result is a tight $\\big(1 + \\frac 2{ec} + \u03b5\\big)$-approximation algorithm for the problem with $c \\in \\big(\\frac1e, 1\\big]$.

Clinical guidelines highlight several 'red flag' features, such as thunderclap onset, meningismus, papilledema, focal neurologic deficits, signs of temporal arteritis, systemic illness, and the 'worst headache of their life' presentation. Despite these guidelines, determining which patients require urgent evaluation remains challenging in primary care settings. Clinicians often work with limited time, incomplete information, and diverse symptom presentations, which can lead to under-recognition and inappropriate care. We present a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent clinical decision support system built on an orchestrator-specialist architecture, designed to perform explicit and interpretable secondary headache diagnosis from free-text clinical vignettes. The multi-agent system decomposes diagnosis into seven domain-specialized agents, each producing a structured and evidence-grounded rationale, while a central orchestrator performs task decomposition and coordinates agent routing. We evaluated the multi-agent system using 90 expert-validated secondary headache cases and compared its performance with a single-LLM baseline across two prompting strategies: question-based prompting (QPrompt) and clinical practice guideline-based prompting (GPrompt). We tested five open-source LLMs (Qwen-30B, GPT-OSS-20B, Qwen-14B, Qwen-8B, and Llama-3.1-8B), and found that the orchestrated multi-agent system with GPrompt consistently achieved the highest F1 scores, with larger gains in smaller models.

Traditional pipelines decouple detection, association, and tracking, leading to error propagation and temporal inconsistency in challenging scenarios. LAPA addresses these limitations by leveraging attention mechanisms to jointly reason across views and time, establishing soft correspondences through a cross-view attention mechanism enhanced with geometric priors. Instead of relying on classical triangulation, we construct 3D point representations via attention-weighted aggregation, inherently accommodating uncertainty and partial observations. Temporal consistency is further maintained through a transformer decoder that models long-range dependencies, preserving identities through extended occlusions. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including our newly created multi-camera (MC) versions of TAPVid-3D panoptic and PointOdyssey, demonstrate that our unified approach significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 37.5% APD on TAPVid-3D-MC and 90.3% APD on PointOdyssey-MC, particularly excelling in scenarios with complex motions and occlusions.

Task-oriented diffusion models have significantly advanced action-to-motion, text-to-motion, and audio-to-motion applications. In this paper, we investigate fundamental questions regarding motion representations and loss functions in a controlled study, and we enumerate the impacts of various decisions in the workflow of the generative motion diffusion model. To answer these questions, we conduct empirical studies based on a proxy motion diffusion model (MDM). We apply v loss as the prediction objective on MDM (vMDM), where v is the weighted sum of motion data and noise. We aim to enhance the understanding of latent data distributions and provide a foundation for improving the state of conditional motion diffusion models. First, we evaluate the six common motion representations in the literature and compare their performance in terms of quality and diversity metrics. Second, we compare the training time under various configurations to shed light on how to speed up the training process of motion diffusion models. Finally, we also conduct evaluation analysis on a large motion dataset. The results of our experiments indicate clear performance differences across motion representations in diverse datasets.

With the growing scale of computing, there can be several thousand consumers of the data.

The system must offer guarantees like ordering and at-least-once delivery while avoiding overload on consumers, allowing them to consume messages at their own pace.\n  This paper presents the design of Fast ACS (an abbreviation for Ads Copy Service), a file-based ordered message delivery system that leverages a combination of two-sided (inter-cluster) and one-sided (intra-cluster) communication primitives - namely, Remote Procedure Call and Remote Memory Access, respectively - to deliver messages. The system has been successfully deployed to dozens of production clusters and scales to accommodate several thousand consumers within each cluster, which amounts to Tbps-scale intra-cluster consumer traffic at peak.

These models have shown strong potential in generalization and reasoning, but achieving reliable and responsible robotic behavior in real-world settings remains an open challenge. In high-stakes environments, robotic agents must go beyond basic task execution to perform risk-aware reasoning, moral decision-making, and physically grounded planning. We introduce ResponsibleRobotBench, a systematic benchmark designed to evaluate and accelerate progress in responsible robotic manipulation from simulation to real world. This benchmark consists of 23 multi-stage tasks spanning diverse risk types, including electrical, chemical, and human-related hazards, and varying levels of physical and planning complexity. These tasks require agents to detect and mitigate risks, reason about safety, plan sequences of actions, and engage human assistance when necessary. Our benchmark includes a general-purpose evaluation framework that supports multimodal model-based agents with various action representation modalities. The framework integrates visual perception, context learning, prompt construction, hazard detection, reasoning and planning, and physical execution.

Conversational medical assistants must avoid unsafe compliance without over-refusing benign queries.

Using the CARES-18K benchmark for adversarial robustness, we evaluate four LLMs (Llama-3B/8B, Meditron-8B, Mistral-7B) across multiple cycles. Our results show up to 42% improvement in safety-related metrics for harmful query detection, alongside interesting trade-offs against erroneous refusals, thereby exposing architecture-dependent calibration biases.

Replicating this structure in computer vision requires models that can segment video not just retrospectively, but predictively and hierarchically. We introduce PARSE, a unified framework that learns multiscale event structure directly from streaming video without supervision. PARSE organizes perception into a hierarchy of recurrent predictors, each operating at its own temporal granularity: lower layers model short-term dynamics while higher layers integrate longer-term context through attention-based feedback. Event boundaries emerge naturally as transient peaks in prediction error, yielding temporally coherent, nested partonomies that mirror the containment relations observed in human event perception. Evaluated across three benchmarks, Breakfast Actions, 50 Salads, and Assembly 101, PARSE achieves state-of-the-art performance among streaming methods and rivals offline baselines in both temporal alignment (H-GEBD) and structural consistency (TED, hF1).

The rise of generative AI (GenAI) tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot has transformed how software is learned and written. In software engineering (SE) education, these tools offer new opportunities for support, but also raise concerns about over-reliance, ethical use, and impacts on learning. Objective. This study investigates how undergraduate SE students use GenAI tools, focusing on the benefits, challenges, ethical concerns, and instructional expectations that shape their experiences. Method. We conducted a survey with 130 undergraduate students from two universities. The survey combined structured Likert-scale items and open-ended questions to investigate five dimensions: usage context, perceived benefits, challenges, ethical and instructional perceptions. Results. Students most often use GenAI for incremental learning and advanced implementation, reporting benefits such as brainstorming support and confidence-building. At the same time, they face challenges including unclear rationales and difficulty adapting outputs. Students highlight ethical concerns around fairness and misconduct, and call for clearer instructional guidance. Conclusion. GenAI is reshaping SE education in nuanced ways.

These vehicles have limited processing capability and payload capacity, which makes advanced deep learning methods and heavy sensors impractical. Flying insects, such as bees, achieve remarkable landings with minimal neural and sensory resources, relying heavily on optical flow. By regulating flow divergence, a measure of vertical velocity divided by height, they perform smooth landings in which velocity and height decay exponentially together. However, adapting this bio-inspired strategy for spacecraft landings on sloped terrain presents two key challenges: global flow-divergence estimates obscure terrain inclination, and the nonlinear nature of divergence-based control can lead to instability when using conventional controllers. This paper proposes a nonlinear control strategy that leverages two distinct local flow divergence estimates to regulate both thrust and attitude during vertical landings. The control law is formulated based on Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion to handle the nonlinear flow divergence. The thrust control ensures a smooth vertical descent by keeping a constant average of the local flow divergence estimates, while the attitude control aligns the vehicle with the inclined surface at touchdown by exploiting their difference. The approach is evaluated in numerical simulations using a simplified 2D spacecraft model across varying slopes and divergence setpoints. Results show that regulating the average divergence yields stable landings with exponential decay of velocity and height, and using the divergence difference enables effective alignment with inclined terrain. Overall, the method offers a robust, low-resource landing strategy that enhances the feasibility of autonomous planetary missions with small spacecraft.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u6d41\u6563\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u578b\u822a\u5929\u5668\u5728\u503e\u659c\u5730\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u7740\u9646\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u529b\u548c\u59ff\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u578b\u822a\u5929\u5668\uff08\u5982\u65cb\u7ffc\u98de\u884c\u5668\u548c\u7740\u9646\u5668\uff09\u5728\u503e\u659c\u5730\u5f62\u4e0a\u81ea\u4e3b\u7740\u9646\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u91cd\u578b\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u3002\u53d7\u6606\u866b\uff08\u5982\u871c\u8702\uff09\u5229\u7528\u5149\u6d41\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u7a33\u7740\u9646\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6d41\u6563\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u589e\u91cf\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u53cd\u6f14\uff08INDI\uff09\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u6d41\u6563\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u63a8\u529b\u548c\u59ff\u6001\u3002\u63a8\u529b\u63a7\u5236\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u6301\u5c40\u90e8\u6d41\u6563\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u503c\u6052\u5b9a\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u5e73\u7a33\u5782\u76f4\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u59ff\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u5219\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6d41\u6563\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50\u503e\u659c\u8868\u9762\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5761\u5ea6\u548c\u6d41\u6563\u5ea6\u8bbe\u5b9a\u70b9\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7740\u9646\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5448\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u503e\u659c\u5730\u5f62\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6d41\u6563\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u5782\u76f4\u7740\u9646\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u63a8\u529b\u548c\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u503e\u659c\u5730\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u7740\u9646\u3002"}}

Although embedding vector spaces are widely used to represent semantic closeness and are promising for analyzing text difficulty, the abundance of embedding methods creates a challenge in selecting the most suitable method. This study proposes the Educational Cone Model, which is a geometric framework based on the assumption that easier texts are less diverse (focusing on fundamental concepts), whereas harder texts are more diverse. This assumption leads to a cone-shaped distribution in the embedding space regardless of the embedding method used.

To quantitatively assess physical validity, we propose object-trajectory correspondence as a direct evaluation metric and present MoReSet, a benchmark of 1,275 human-annotated videos spanning nine classes of Newtonian phenomena with scene descriptions, spatiotemporal relations, and ground-truth trajectories. Using MoReSet, we conduct experiments on existing T2V models, evaluating their physical validity through both our MoRe metrics and existing physics-based evaluators.

While effective for unconditional or text-to-image generation, corrupting phase components destroys spatial structure, making it ill-suited for tasks requiring geometric consistency, such as re-rendering, simulation enhancement, and image-to-image translation. We introduce Phase-Preserving Diffusion \u03c6-PD, a model-agnostic reformulation of the diffusion process that preserves input phase while randomizing magnitude, enabling structure-aligned generation without architectural changes or additional parameters. We further propose Frequency-Selective Structured (FSS) noise, which provides continuous control over structural rigidity via a single frequency-cutoff parameter. \u03c6-PD adds no inference-time cost and is compatible with any diffusion model for images or videos. Across photorealistic and stylized re-rendering, as well as sim-to-real enhancement for driving planners, \u03c6-PD produces controllable, spatially aligned results. When applied to the CARLA simulator, \u03c6-PD improves CARLA-to-Waymo planner performance by 50\\%. The method is complementary to existing conditioning approaches and broadly applicable to image-to-image and video-to-video generation.

The Aurora system is composed of over ten thousand nodes each of which contains six Intel Data Center Max Series GPUs, Intel's first data center-focused discrete GPU, and two Intel Xeon Max Series CPUs, Intel's first Xeon processor to contain HBM memory. To achieve Exascale performance the system utilizes the HPE Slingshot high-performance fabric interconnect to connect the nodes. Aurora is currently the largest deployment of the Slingshot fabric to date with nearly 85,000 Cassini NICs and 5,600 Rosetta switches connected in a dragonfly topology. The combination of the Intel powered nodes and the Slingshot network enabled Aurora to become the second fastest system on the Top500 list in June of 2024 and the fastest system on the HPL MxP benchmark. The system is one of the most powerful systems in the world dedicated to AI and HPC simulations for open science. This paper presents details of the Aurora system design with a particular focus on the network fabric and the approach taken to validating it. The performance of the systems is demonstrated through the presentation of the results of MPI benchmarks as well as performance benchmarks including HPL, HPL-MxP, Graph500, and HPCG run on a large fraction of the system.

DOI: 10.1109/VL-HCC65237.2025.00024", "summary": "Usability evaluations are essential for ensuring that modern interfaces meet user needs, yet traditional heuristic evaluations by human experts can be time-consuming and subjective, especially early in development. This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can provide reliable and consistent heuristic assessments at the development stage. By applying Jakob Nielsen's ten usability heuristics to thirty open-source websites, we generated over 850 heuristic evaluations in three independent evaluations per site using a pipeline of OpenAI's GPT-4o. For issue detection, the model demonstrated moderate consistency, with an average pairwise Cohen's Kappa of 0.50 and an exact agreement of 84%. Severity judgments showed more variability: weighted Cohen's Kappa averaged 0.63, but exact agreement was just 56%, and Krippendorff's Alpha was near zero. These results suggest that while GPT-4o can produce internally consistent evaluations, especially for identifying the presence of usability issues, its ability to judge severity varies and requires human oversight in practice. Our findings highlight the feasibility and limitations of using LLMs for early-stage, automated usability testing, and offer a foundation for improving consistency in automated User Experience (UX) evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, our work provides one of the first quantitative inter-rater reliability analyses of automated heuristic evaluation and highlights methods for improving model consistency.", "AI": {"tldr": "GPT-4o\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53ef\u4e00\u81f4\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u4e3b\u89c2\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u65e9\u671f\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u80fd\u5426\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u9636\u6bb5\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06Jakob Nielsen\u7684\u5341\u9879\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e30\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u7f51\u7ad9\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528OpenAI\u7684GPT-4o\u751f\u6210\u8d85\u8fc7850\u6b21\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e09\u6b21\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e2d\u7b49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08\u5e73\u5747Cohen's Kappa\u4e3a0.50\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u4e00\u81f4\u7387\u4e3a84%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u8f83\u5927\uff08\u52a0\u6743Cohen's Kappa\u5e73\u57470.63\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u4e00\u81f4\u7387\u4ec556%\uff0cKrippendorff's Alpha\u63a5\u8fd1\u96f6\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86GPT-4o\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u4e0a\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\u3002"}}

Our approach explicitly decouples locomotion and manipulation into two specialized visuomotor policies, allowing each subsystem to rely on its own observations. This mitigates the performance degradation that arise when a single policy is forced to fuse heterogeneous, potentially mismatched observations from locomotion and manipulation. Our key innovation lies in restoring coordination between these two independent policies through a vision-language foundation model, which encodes global observations and language instructions into a shared latent embedding conditioning both diffusion policies. On top of this backbone, we introduce a phase-progress head that uses textual descriptions of task stages to infer discrete phase and continuous progress estimates without manual phase labels. To further structure the latent space, we incorporate a coordination-aware contrastive loss that explicitly encodes cross-subsystem compatibility between arm and base actions.

The main innovation is a flexible sampling scheme in which two independent parameters are drawn from user defined domains and mapped to the polynomial coefficients through a generating function. This design allows the same mathematical foundation to support both scientific investigation and generative algorithmic art. The framework integrates two complementary numerical engines: NumPy companion matrix solver for fast, large scale computation and MPSolve for high precision, scientifically rigorous validation. This dual architecture enables efficient visualization for creative use and accurate computation for research and education. Numerical accuracy was verified using classical ensembles, including the Kac and Lucas polynomials. The method was applied to the cubic polynomial system to analyze its bifurcation structure, demonstrating its value as both a scientific tool for exploring root phenomena and an educational aid for visualizing fundamental concepts in algebra and dynamical systems. Beyond analysis, the Polynomiogram also demonstrated its potential as a tool for personalized generative art.

We highlight two recurring limitations in much of the current literature: (i) rule based (deontological) methods that encode duties as constraints or shields often struggle under ambiguity and nonstationarity and do not cultivate lasting habits, and (ii) many reward based approaches, especially single objective RL, implicitly compress diverse moral considerations into a single scalar signal, which can obscure trade offs and invite proxy gaming in practice. We instead treat ethics as policy level dispositions, that is, relatively stable habits that hold up when incentives, partners, or contexts change. This shifts evaluation beyond rule checks or scalar returns toward trait summaries, durability under interventions, and explicit reporting of moral trade offs. Our roadmap combines four components: (1) social learning in multi agent RL to acquire virtue like patterns from imperfect but normatively informed exemplars; (2) multi objective and constrained formulations that preserve value conflicts and incorporate risk aware criteria to guard against harm; (3) affinity based regularization toward updateable virtue priors that support trait like stability under distribution shift while allowing norms to evolve; and (4) operationalizing diverse ethical traditions as practical control signals, making explicit the value and cultural assumptions that shape ethical RL benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6279\u5224\u4e86\u5f53\u524dRL\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4f26\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee5\u7f8e\u5fb7\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u8be6\u7ec6\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u5176\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u5b9e\u65bd\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dRL\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4f26\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u63a9\u76d6\u9053\u5fb7\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff1a(1) \u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53RL\u4e2d\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c(2) \u591a\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u6027\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c(3) \u57fa\u4e8e\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c(4) \u5c06\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u4f20\u7edf\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u4f26\u7406\u89c6\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u7ea7\u503e\u5411\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e60\u60ef\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u6743\u8861\u7684\u660e\u786e\u62a5\u544a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee5\u7f8e\u5fb7\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4f26\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u6a21\u5f0f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5176\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u5b9e\u65bd\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

First, when queried with basic medical perception tasks, mean accuracy dropped from 74% on typical to 29% on atypical anatomy. Even the best-performing models, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Llama 4 Maverick, showed performance drops of 41-51%. Second, model errors closely mirrored expected anatomical biases. Third, neither model scaling nor interventions, including bias-aware prompting and test-time reasoning, resolved these issues. These findings highlight a critical and previously unquantified limitation in current VLM: their poor generalization to rare anatomical presentations. AdversarialAnatomyBench provides a foundation for systematically measuring and mitigating anatomical bias in multimodal medical AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "AdversarialAnatomyBench\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u7f55\u89c1\u89e3\u5256\u53d8\u5f02\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5f53\u524dVLM\u5728\u7f55\u89c1\u53d8\u5f02\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u5e72\u9884\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e3b\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e38\u89c1\u89e3\u5256\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7f55\u89c1\u53d8\u5f02\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86AdversarialAnatomyBench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u591a\u79cd\u6210\u50cf\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u89e3\u5256\u533a\u57df\u7684\u7f55\u89c1\u89e3\u5256\u53d8\u5f02\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf922\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684VLM\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7f55\u89c1\u89e3\u5256\u53d8\u5f02\u4e0a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece\u5178\u578b\u89e3\u5256\u768474%\u964d\u81f329%\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\uff08GPT-5\u3001Gemini 2.5 Pro\u3001Llama 4 Maverick\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d41-51%\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u9519\u8bef\u4e0e\u9884\u671f\u89e3\u5256\u504f\u89c1\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u6216\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff08\u5982\u504f\u89c1\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u5747\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "AdversarialAnatomyBench\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5728\u7f55\u89c1\u89e3\u5256\u53d8\u5f02\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8861\u91cf\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u533b\u5b66AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u504f\u89c1\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Yet despite rapid progress in code generation, today's Large Language Models (LLMs) are rarely tested on this kind of forward-looking reasoning. We close that gap with gpuFLOPBench, a benchmark that asks models to \"count without running\" by predicting single and double-precision FLOP counts for 577 CUDA kernels drawn from HeCBench, annotated with ground-truth profiles and eight execution attributes that distinguish trivially analyzable code from kernels whose FLOPs depend on hidden compiler or runtime behavior. Evaluating current closed-source reasoning models shows clear but uneven progress: the newest LLMs achieve perfect classification on straightforward kernels but still incur multiple order-of-magnitude errors whenever implicit FLOPs arise from division, intrinsic math functions, or common subexpressions. These results surface a core limitation of existing code assistants -- the inability to internalize hardware-specific microcode effects -- and position gpuFLOPBench as a focused testbed for developing LLM tooling that can reason about performance with the same rigor as experienced GPU developers.

We conducted a comparative pilot study of three state-of-the-art models (GPT-5.1, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, and Llama 3 8B) by prompting them to implement a standardized Book Lending Microservice under strict Hexagonal Architecture constraints. Utilizing Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing, we find that while proprietary models achieve high architectural conformance (0% violation rate for GPT-5.1), open-weights models exhibit critical divergence. Specifically, Llama 3 demonstrated an 80% Architectural Violation Rate, frequently bypassing interface adapters to create illegal circular dependencies between Domain and Infrastructure layers. Furthermore, we identified a phenomenon of \"Implementation Laziness,\" where open-weights models generated 60% fewer Logical Lines of Code (LLOC) than their proprietary counterparts, effectively omitting complex business logic to satisfy token constraints.

It remains fully compatible with standard BT architectures, allowing seamless integration into existing multi-robot control systems. Within this framework, multi-robot cooperation is formulated as a free-energy minimization process, where each robot dynamically updates its preference matrix based on perceptual inputs and peer intentions, thereby achieving adaptive coordination in partially observable and dynamic environments. The proposed approach is validated through both simulation and real-world experiments, including a multi-robot maze navigation and a collaborative manipulation task, compared against traditional BTs(https://youtu.be/KX_oT3IDTf4).

Here we introduce a geometric framework in which all psychometric batteries for AI agents are treated as points in a structured moduli space, and agent performance is described by capability functionals over this space. First, we define an Autonomous AI (AAI) Scale, a Kardashev-style hierarchy of autonomy grounded in measurable performance on batteries spanning families of tasks (for example reasoning, planning, tool use and long-horizon control). Second, we construct a moduli space of batteries, identifying equivalence classes of benchmarks that are indistinguishable at the level of agent orderings and capability inferences. This geometry yields determinacy results: dense families of batteries suffice to certify performance on entire regions of task space. Third, we introduce a general Generator-Verifier-Updater (GVU) operator that subsumes reinforcement learning, self-play, debate and verifier-based fine-tuning as special cases, and we define a self-improvement coefficient $\u03ba$ as the Lie derivative of a capability functional along the induced flow. A variance inequality on the combined noise of generation and verification provides sufficient conditions for $\u03ba> 0$.

However, regular 2D blocking on this non-uniform distribution structure may lead to workload imbalance across blocks. Besides, existing matrix features fail to guide us effectively in blocking. In this paper, we propose a structure-aware irregular blocking method for numerical factorization. A novel diagonal block-based feature is introduced to effectively characterize the local nonzero distribution of sparse matrices. Based on this, we further propose an irregular blocking method that adjusts block sizes according to the local distribution of nonzeros. The strategy utilizes fine-grained blocks in dense regions and coarse-grained blocks in sparse regions, adequately balancing the nonzeros of blocks both within the same level and across levels in the dependency tree. Experiments demonstrate that, on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU, our proposed irregular blocking method achieves average speedups of 1.50x and 3.32x over PanguLU and the latest SuperLU_DIST, respectively.

In this work, we propose MANTRA, a Multi-stage Adaptive Noise TReAtment framework that embeds noise diagnosis and mitigation directly into the fine-tuning process of code-Pretrained Language Models (PTM) and code-LLMs. We first investigate the effect of noise at varying levels on convergence and loss trajectories of the models. Then we apply an adaptive dropout strategy guided by per-sample loss dynamics and Gaussian Mixture Model clustering to exclude persistently noisy points while preserving clean data. Applying to code summarization and commit intent classification, our experiments reveal that some LLMs are more sensitive to noise than others.

With the growing adoption of industrial automation, online bin packing has gained increasing attention. However, inconsistencies in problem settings, test datasets, and evaluation metrics have hindered progress in the field, and there is a lack of a comprehensive benchmarking system. Direct testing on real hardware is costly, and building a realistic simulation environment is also challenging. To address these limitations, we introduce RoboBPP, a benchmarking system designed for robotic online bin packing. RoboBPP integrates a physics-based simulator to assess physical feasibility. In our simulation environment, we introduce a robotic arm and boxes at real-world scales to replicate real industrial packing workflows. By simulating conditions that arise in real industrial applications, we ensure that evaluated algorithms are practically deployable. In addition, prior studies often rely on synthetic datasets whose distributions differ from real-world industrial data. To address this issue, we collect three datasets from real industrial workflows, including assembly-line production, logistics packing, and furniture manufacturing.

First, most fuzzers use optimization pipelines (heuristics-based, fixed sequences of passes) as their harness. The phase-ordering problem can enable or preempt transformations, so pipelines inevitably miss optimization interactions; moreover, many optimizations are not scheduled, even at aggressive levels. Second, optimizations typically fire only when inputs satisfy specific structural relationships, which existing generators and mutations struggle to produce. We propose targeted fuzzing of individual optimizations to complement pipeline-based testing. Our key idea is to exploit composition styles - structural relations over program constructs (adjacency, nesting, repetition, ordering) - that optimizations look for. We build a general-purpose, grammar-based mutational fuzzer, TargetFuzz, that (i) mines composition styles from an optimization-relevant corpus, then (ii) rebuilds them inside different contexts offered by a larger, generic corpus via synthesized mutations to test variations of optimization logic. TargetFuzz is adaptable to a new programming language by lightweight, grammar-based, construct annotations - and it automatically synthesizes mutators and crossovers to rebuild composition styles. No need for hand-coded generators or language-specific mutators, which is particularly useful for modular frameworks such as MLIR, whose dialect-based, rapidly evolving ecosystem makes optimizations difficult to fuzz. Our evaluation on LLVM and MLIR shows that TargetFuzz improves coverage by 8% and 11% and triggers optimizations 2.8$\\times$ and 2.6$\\times$, compared to baseline fuzzers under the targeted fuzzing mode.

Moreover, their disassembly requires sequential, precise, and dexterous operations, further increasing the complexity of automation. Current robotic disassembly processes are typically divided into several stages: perception, sequence planning, task planning, motion planning, and manipulation. Each stage requires explicit modeling, which limits generalization to unfamiliar scenarios. Recent development of vision-language-action (VLA) models has presented an end-to-end approach for general robotic manipulation tasks. Although VLAs have demonstrated promising performance on simple tasks, the feasibility of applying such models to complex disassembly remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we collected a customized dataset for robotic RAM and CPU disassembly and used it to fine-tune two well-established VLA approaches, OpenVLA and OpenVLA-OFT, as a case study. We divided the whole disassembly task into several small steps, and our preliminary experimental results indicate that the fine-tuned VLA models can faithfully complete multiple early steps but struggle with certain critical subtasks, leading to task failure. However, we observed that a simple hybrid strategy that combines VLA with a rule-based controller can successfully perform the entire disassembly operation. These findings highlight the current limitations of VLA models in handling the dexterity and precision required for robotic EoL product disassembly. By offering a detailed analysis of the observed results, this study provides insights that may inform future research to address current challenges and advance end-to-end robotic automated disassembly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u62c6\u5378\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u62c6\u5378\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8eEoL\u4ea7\u54c1\u62c6\u5378\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u62c6\u5378\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u800cVLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u5728\u6b64\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6536\u96c6\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7684RAM\u548cCPU\u62c6\u5378\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5fae\u8c03\u4e24\u79cdVLA\u6a21\u578b\uff08OpenVLA\u548cOpenVLA-OFT\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u62c6\u5378\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u5c0f\u6b65\u9aa4\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5b8c\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u62c6\u5378\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u800c\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u5b8c\u6210\u6574\u4e2a\u62c6\u5378\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u62c6\u5378\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408VLA\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u62c6\u5378\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In traditional RL settings, agents learn optimal policies through interactions with an environment guided by reward signals. However, when these signals are sparse, delayed, or poorly aligned with the intended task objectives, agents often struggle to learn effectively. Dense reward functions, which provide informative feedback at every step or state transition, offer a potential solution by shaping agent behavior and accelerating learning. Despite their benefits, poorly crafted reward functions can lead to unintended behaviors, reward hacking, or inefficient exploration. This problem is particularly acute in complex or high-dimensional environments where handcrafted rewards are difficult to specify and validate. To address this, recent research has explored a variety of approaches, including inverse reinforcement learning, reward modeling from human preferences, and self-supervised learning of intrinsic rewards. While these methods offer promising directions, they often involve trade-offs between generality, scalability, and alignment with human intent. This proposal explores several approaches to dealing with these unsolved problems and enhancing the effectiveness and reliability of dense reward construction in different RL applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6216\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ee3\u7406\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u867d\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f46\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0d\u5f53\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u610f\u5916\u884c\u4e3a\u6216\u5956\u52b1\u6ee5\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5305\u62ec\u9006\u5411\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u4ee5\u53ca\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u5185\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u4e3a\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u6784\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u63d0\u6848\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u6784\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u540c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

To improve the diversity of such sequential forecasts we propose a novel inference-time refinement technique that combines Gated Recurrent Unit-Normalizing Flows (GRU-NF) with stochastic sampling methods. While GRU-NF can capture multimodal distributions through its integration of normalizing flows within a temporal forecasting framework, its deterministic transformation structure can limit expressivity. To address this, inspired by Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNF), we introduce Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) steps during GRU-NF inference, enabling the model to explore a richer output space and better approximate the true data distribution without retraining. We validate our approach in a keypoint-based video motion transfer pipeline, where capturing temporally coherent and perceptually diverse future trajectories is essential for realistic samples and low bandwidth communication. Experiments show that our inference framework, Gated Recurrent Unit- Stochastic Normalizing Flows (GRU-SNF) outperforms GRU-NF in generating diverse outputs without sacrificing accuracy, even under longer prediction horizons. By injecting stochasticity during inference, our approach captures multimodal behavior more effectively.

This paper bridges this gap by developing a multicarrier stochastic framework that explicitly couples local gradient updates with frequency-selective THz effects, including beam squint, molecular absorption, and jitter. Our analysis uncovers a critical diversity trap: under standard unbiased aggregation, the convergence error floor is driven by the harmonic mean of subcarrier SNRs. Consequently, a single spectral hole caused by severe beam squint can render the entire bandwidth useless for reliable model updates. We further identify a fundamental bandwidth limit, revealing that expanding the spectrum beyond a critical point degrades convergence due to the integration of thermal noise and gain collapse at band edges. Finally, we demonstrate that an SNR-weighted aggregation strategy is necessary to suppress the variance singularity at these spectral holes, effectively recovering convergence in high-squint regimes where standard averaging fails.

While prior agentic systems can execute isolated instructions, they struggle with automating multi-step, session-level workflows due to limited control over the operational process. To this end, we introduce AutoDW, a novel execution framework that enables stepwise, rollback-enabled operation orchestration. AutoDW incrementally plans API actions conditioned on user instructions, intent-filtered API candidates, and the evolving states of the document. It further employs robust rollback mechanisms at both the argument and API levels, enabling dynamic correction and fault tolerance. These designs together ensure that the execution trajectory of AutoDW remains aligned with user intent and document context across long-horizon workflows. To assess its effectiveness, we construct a comprehensive benchmark of 250 sessions and 1,708 human-annotated instructions, reflecting realistic document processing scenarios with interdependent instructions. AutoDW achieves 90% and 62% completion rates on instruction- and session-level tasks, respectively, outperforming strong baselines by 40% and 76%. Moreover, AutoDW also remains robust for the decision of backbone LLMs and on tasks with varying difficulty. Code and data will be open-sourced.

BALI combines language and action cues from the human, asks clarifying questions only when the expected information gain from the answer outweighs the cost of interruption, and selects supportive actions that align with inferred goals.

In this paper, we derive a continuous limit for PnP-Flow, resulting in a stochastic differential equation (SDE) surrogate model of PnP-Flow. The SDE model provides two particular insights to improve PnP-Flow for image restoration: (1) It enables us to quantify the error for image restoration, informing us to improve step scheduling and regularize the Lipschitz constant of the neural network-parameterized vector field for error reduction. (2) It informs us to accelerate off-the-shelf PnP-Flow models via extrapolation, resulting in a rescaled version of the proposed SDE model. We validate the efficacy of the SDE-informed improved PnP-Flow using several benchmark tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting.

It underpins anomaly detection, failure diagnosis, and other AIOps tasks. Current parsers are mostly reactive and log-centric. They only infer templates from logs, mostly overlooking the source code. This restricts their capacity to grasp dynamic log structures or adjust to evolving systems. Moreover, per-log LLM inference is too costly for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose LLM-SrcLog, a proactive and unified framework for log template parsing. It extracts templates directly from source code prior to deployment and supplements them with data-driven parsing for logs without available code. LLM-SrcLog integrates a cross-function static code analyzer to reconstruct meaningful logging contexts, an LLM-based white-box template extractor with post-processing to distinguish constants from variables, and a black-box template extractor that incorporates data-driven clustering for remaining unmatched logs. Experiments on two public benchmarks (Hadoop and Zookeeper) and a large-scale industrial system (Sunfire-Compute) show that, compared to two LLM-based baselines, LLM-SrcLog improves average F1-score by 2-17% and 8-35%. Meanwhile, its online parsing latency is comparable to data-driven methods and about 1,000 times faster than per-log LLM parsing. LLM-SrcLog achieves a near-ideal balance between speed and accuracy.

However, existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods typically treat code as plain natural language, relying primarily on shallow semantic matching while overlooking structural semantics and code-specific dependencies. This limits their ability to capture control flow and underlying intent, ultimately constraining the quality of generated code. Therefore, we propose CoCo, a novel framework that enables code Completion by Comprehension of multi-granularity context from large-scale code repositories. CoCo employs static code analysis to extract structured context at the function, file, and project levels, capturing execution logic and semantic dependencies. It then adopts an graph-based multi-granularity context selection mechanism to filter out redundant information and remove noise. Consequently, the information is converted into natural language in a consistent manner, thereby functioning as explicit contextual prompts to guide subsequent code completion.

Existing methods such as domain randomization, adaptation, and sim-real calibration often require extensive tuning or fail to generalize to unseen scenarios. To address this issue, we observe that if domain-invariant features are utilized during policy training in simulation, and the same features can be extracted and provided as the input to policy during real-world deployment, the domain gap can be effectively bridged, leading to significantly improved policy generalization. Accordingly, we propose Semantic 2D Gaussian Splatting (S2GS), a novel representation method that extracts object-centric, domain-invariant spatial features. S2GS constructs multi-view 2D semantic fields and projects them into a unified 3D space via feature-level Gaussian splatting. A semantic filtering mechanism removes irrelevant background content, ensuring clean and consistent inputs for policy learning. To evaluate the effectiveness of S2GS, we adopt Diffusion Policy as the downstream learning algorithm and conduct experiments in the ManiSkill simulation environment, followed by real-world deployment.

However, these agents remain brittle when faced with real-world exceptions, making Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) supervision essential for mission-critical applications. In this paper, we present AgentBay, a novel sandbox service designed from the ground up for hybrid interaction. AgentBay provides secure, isolated execution environments spanning Windows, Linux, Android, Web Browsers, and Code interpreters. Its core contribution is a unified session accessible via a hybrid control interface: An AI agent can interact programmatically via mainstream interfaces (MCP, Open Source SDK), while a human operator can, at any moment, seamlessly take over full manual control. This seamless intervention is enabled by Adaptive Streaming Protocol (ASP). Unlike traditional VNC/RDP, ASP is specifically engineered for this hybrid use case, delivering an ultra-low-latency, smoother user experience that remains resilient even in weak network environments. It achieves this by dynamically blending command-based and video-based streaming, adapting its encoding strategy based on network conditions and the current controller (AI or human). Our evaluation demonstrates strong results in security, performance, and task completion rates. In a benchmark of complex tasks, the AgentBay (Agent + Human) model achieved more than 48% success rate improvement. Furthermore, our ASP protocol reduces bandwidth consumption by up to 50% compared to standard RDP, and in end-to-end latency with around 5% reduction, especially under poor network conditions.

However, conventional monocular depth estimation often oversmooths these features, losing critical information for motion planning and stability. To address this, we introduce Gamma-from-Mono (GfM), a lightweight monocular geometry estimation method that resolves the projective ambiguity in single-camera reconstruction by decoupling global and local structure. GfM predicts a dominant road surface plane together with residual variations expressed by gamma, a dimensionless measure of vertical deviation from the plane, defined as the ratio of a point's height above it to its depth from the camera, and grounded in established planar parallax geometry. With only the camera's height above ground, this representation deterministically recovers metric depth via a closed form, avoiding full extrinsic calibration and naturally prioritizing near-road detail.

Inspired by this biological synergy, embodied co-design (ECD) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for creating intelligent agents-from virtual creatures to physical robots-by jointly optimizing their morphologies and controllers rather than treating control in isolation. This integrated approach facilitates richer environmental interactions and robust task performance. In this survey, we provide a systematic overview of recent advances in ECD. We first formalize the concept of ECD and position it within related fields. We then introduce a hierarchical taxonomy: a lower layer that breaks down agent design into three fundamental components-controlling brain, body morphology, and task environment-and an upper layer that integrates these components into four major ECD frameworks: bi-level, single-level, generative, and open-ended. This taxonomy allows us to synthesize insights from more than one hundred recent studies. We further review notable benchmarks, datasets, and applications in both simulated and real-world scenarios.

This manual step is slow, error-prone, difficult to scale, and often delays the use of safeguards in real-world deployments. To address this gap, we present Policy-to-Tests (P2T), a framework that converts natural-language policy documents into normalized, machine-readable rules. The framework comprises a pipeline and a compact domain-specific language (DSL) that encodes hazards, scope, conditions, exceptions, and required evidence, yielding a canonical representation of extracted rules. To test the framework beyond a single policy, we apply it across general frameworks, sector guidance, and enterprise standards, extracting obligation-bearing clauses and converting them into executable rules. These AI-generated rules closely match strong human baselines on span-level and rule-level metrics, with robust inter-annotator agreement on the gold set. To evaluate downstream behavioral and safety impact, we add HIPAA-derived safeguards to a generative agent and compare it with an otherwise identical agent without guardrails. An LLM-based judge, aligned with gold-standard criteria, measures violation rates and robustness to obfuscated and compositional prompts. Detailed results are provided in the appendix.

Although a few prior works have examined CLIP calibration in offline settings, the impact of fine-tuning CLIP in a federated learning (FL) setup remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate how FL affects CLIP calibration and propose strategies to improve reliability in this distributed setting. We first analyze Textual Prompt Tuning approaches and show that they degrade calibration metrics when operating under FL. We also evaluate existing in-training calibration techniques across four global aggregation methods, finding that they provide limited improvements. Our results suggest that the key challenge lies not only in how we aggregate or calibrate, but in which components we choose to fine-tune. Motivated by this insight, we propose $\\text{FL}^2\\text{oRA}$, a straightforward LoRA-based approach that naturally improves calibration in FL, and we analyze the factors behind its effectiveness. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that $\\text{FL}^2\\text{oRA}$ consistently produces well-calibrated models, reducing the need for explicit calibration procedures.

Recently, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), especially the area of large language models, has shown impressive performance in data comprehension and logical reasoning. These capabilities are highly aligned with the functionalities required in SASs, suggesting a strong potential to employ GenAI to enhance SASs. However, the specific benefits and challenges of employing GenAI in SASs remain unclear. Yet, providing a comprehensive understanding of these benefits and challenges is complex due to several reasons: limited publications in the SAS field, the technological and application diversity within SASs, and the rapid evolution of GenAI technologies. To that end, this paper aims to provide researchers and practitioners a comprehensive snapshot that outlines the potential benefits and challenges of employing GenAI's within SAS. Specifically, we gather, filter, and analyze literature from four distinct research fields and organize them into two main categories to potential benefits: (i) enhancements to the autonomy of SASs centered around the specific functions of the MAPE-K feedback loop, and (ii) improvements in the interaction between humans and SASs within human-on-the-loop settings. From our study, we outline a research roadmap that highlights the challenges of integrating GenAI into SASs. The roadmap starts with outlining key research challenges that need to be tackled to exploit the potential for applying GenAI in the field of SAS.

The absence of a realistic common benchmark represents a significant limitation for the diffusion of robust autonomous systems under real complex agricultural conditions. Vineyards pose significant challenges due to their dynamic nature, and they are increasingly drawing attention from both academic and industrial stakeholders interested in automation. In this context, we introduce the TEMPO-VINE dataset, a large-scale multi-temporal dataset specifically designed for evaluating sensor fusion, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and place recognition techniques within operational vineyard environments. TEMPO-VINE is the first multi-modal public dataset that brings together data from heterogeneous LiDARs of different price levels, AHRS, RTK-GPS, and cameras in real trellis and pergola vineyards, with multiple rows exceeding 100 m in length. In this work, we address a critical gap in the landscape of agricultural datasets by providing researchers with a comprehensive data collection and ground truth trajectories in different seasons, vegetation growth stages, terrain and weather conditions. The sequence paths with multiple runs and revisits will foster the development of sensor fusion, localization, mapping and place recognition solutions for agricultural fields.

Corresponding authors: Yuanfeng Song and Wentao Zhang", "summary": "Data governance ensures data quality, security, and compliance through policies and standards, a critical foundation for scaling modern AI development. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution for automating data governance by translating user intent into executable transformation code. However, existing benchmarks for automated data science often emphasize snippet-level coding or high-level analytics, failing to capture the unique challenge of data governance: ensuring the correctness and quality of the data itself. To bridge this gap, we introduce GovBench, a benchmark featuring 150 diverse tasks grounded in real-world scenarios, built on data from actual cases. GovBench employs a novel \"reversed-objective\" methodology to synthesize realistic noise and utilizes rigorous metrics to assess end-to-end pipeline reliability. Our analysis on GovBench reveals that current models struggle with complex, multi-step workflows and lack robust error-correction mechanisms. Consequently, we propose DataGovAgent, a framework utilizing a Planner-Executor-Evaluator architecture that integrates constraint-based planning, retrieval-augmented generation, and sandboxed feedback-driven debugging.

Aiming to reduce the reliance on curated data, several studies have explored image captioning without any humanly-annotated image-text pairs for training, although existing methods are still outperformed by fully supervised approaches. This paper proposes TOMCap, i.e., an improved text-only training method that performs captioning without the need for aligned image-caption pairs. The method is based on prompting a pre-trained language model decoder with information derived from a CLIP representation, after undergoing a process to reduce the modality gap.

Existing approaches, typically rule-driven controllers or isolated learning components, struggle to generalize to novel contexts or coordinate responses across distributed subsystems, leaving them ill-equipped for emergent unknown unknowns. Recent discussions on Self-Adaptation 2.0 emphasize an equal partnership between AI and adaptive systems, merging learning-driven intelligence with adaptive control for predictive and proactive behavior. Building on this foundation, we introduce POLARIS, a three-layer multi-agentic self-adaptation framework that advances beyond reactive adaptation. POLARIS integrates: (1) a low-latency Adapter layer for monitoring and safe execution, (2) a transparent Reasoning layer that generates and verifies plans using tool-aware, explainable agents, and (3) a Meta layer that records experiences and meta-learns improved adaptation policies over time. Through shared knowledge and predictive models, POLARIS handles uncertainty, learns from past actions, and evolves its strategies, enabling systems that anticipate change and maintain resilient, goal-directed behavior. Preliminary evaluation on two self-adaptive exemplars, SWIM and SWITCH, shows that POLARIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. We argue this marks a shift toward Self-Adaptation 3.0, akin to Software 3.0: a paradigm where systems not only learn from their environment but also reason about and evolve their own adaptation processes, continuously improving to meet novel challenges.", "AI": {"tldr": "POLARIS \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u5c42\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u81ea\u6211\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u900f\u660e\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u65b0\u6311\u6218\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u4e92\u8054\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u6211\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u6216\u534f\u8c03\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "POLARIS \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u5c42\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u81ea\u6211\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684 Adapter \u5c42\u3001\u900f\u660e\u7684 Reasoning \u5c42\u548c Meta \u5c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728 SWIM \u548c SWITCH \u4e24\u4e2a\u81ea\u6211\u9002\u5e94\u793a\u4f8b\u4e0a\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cPOLARIS \u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "POLARIS \u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u81ea\u6211\u9002\u5e94\u6280\u672f\u5411 Self-Adaptation 3.0 \u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u4ece\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8fdb\u5316\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b0\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

In data-driven missions, besides sensing, the drone must process the collected data at runtime to decide whether additional action must be taken on the spot, before moving to the next point of interest. If processing does not reveal an event or situation that requires such an action, the drone has waited in vain instead of moving to the next point. If, however, the drone starts moving to the next point and it turns out that a follow-up action is needed at the previous point, it must spend time to fly-back. To take this decision, we propose different machine-learning methods based on branch prediction and reinforcement learning. We evaluate these methods for a wide range of scenarios where the probability of event occurrence changes with time. Our results show that the proposed methods consistently outperform the regression-based method proposed in the literature and can significantly improve the worst-case mission time by up to 4.1x.

Through rigorous theoretical analysis based on Markov models, we establish that the root cause lies in greedy decoding's inability to escape repetitive loops, exacerbated by self-reinforcement effects.\n  Our comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates three viable solutions: (1) Beam Search decoding with early_stopping=True serves as a universal post-hoc mechanism that effectively resolves all three repetition patterns; (2) presence_penalty hyperparameter provides an effective solution specifically for BadCase 1; and (3) Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) fine-tuning offers a universal model-level solution for all three BadCases.\n  The primary value of this work lies in combining first-hand production experience with extensive experimental validation.

Unfortunately, configuring Kubernetes is prone to errors. Configuration defects are not uncommon and can result in serious consequences. This paper reports an empirical study about configuration defects in Kubernetes with the goal of helping practitioners detect and prevent these defects. We study 719 defects that we extract from 2,260 Kubernetes configuration scripts using open source repositories. Using qualitative analysis, we identify 15 categories of defects. We find 8 publicly available static analysis tools to be capable of detecting 8 of the 15 defect categories. We find that the highest precision and recall of those tools are for defects related to data fields. We develop a linter to detect two categories of defects that cause serious consequences, which none of the studied tools are able to detect. Our linter revealed 26 previously-unknown defects that have been confirmed by practitioners, 19 of which have already been fixed. We conclude our paper by providing recommendations on how defect detection and repair techniques can be used for Kubernetes configuration scripts.

Despite prior work on collecting large-scale datasets, there still remains a significant gap to robust spatial generalization. We identify a key limitation: individual trajectories, regardless of their length, are typically collected from a \\emph{single, static spatial configuration} of the environment. This includes fixed object and target spatial positions as well as unchanging camera viewpoints, which significantly restricts the diversity of spatial information available for learning. To address this critical bottleneck in data efficiency, we propose \\textbf{MOtion-Based Variability Enhancement} (\\emph{MOVE}), a simple yet effective data collection paradigm that enables the acquisition of richer spatial information from dynamic demonstrations. Our core contribution is an augmentation strategy that injects motion into any movable objects within the environment for each demonstration. This process implicitly generates a dense and diverse set of spatial configurations within a single trajectory. We conduct extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world environments to validate our approach. For example, in simulation tasks requiring strong spatial generalization, \\emph{MOVE} achieves an average success rate of 39.1\\%, a 76.1\\% relative improvement over the static data collection paradigm (22.2\\%), and yields up to 2--5$\\times$ gains in data efficiency on certain tasks.

We present Mind-to-Face, the first framework that decodes non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG) signals directly into high-fidelity facial expressions. We build a dual-modality recording setup to obtain synchronized EEG and multi-view facial video during emotion-eliciting stimuli, enabling precise supervision for neural-to-visual learning. Our model uses a CNN-Transformer encoder to map EEG signals into dense 3D position maps, capable of sampling over 65k vertices, capturing fine-scale geometry and subtle emotional dynamics, and renders them through a modified 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline for photorealistic, view-consistent results. Through extensive evaluation, we show that EEG alone can reliably predict dynamic, subject-specific facial expressions, including subtle emotional responses, demonstrating that neural signals contain far richer affective and geometric information than previously assumed.

We introduce NN-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation system that converts large, heterogeneous PyTorch codebases into a searchable and executable library of validated neural modules. Unlike conventional code search or clone-detection tools, NN-RAG performs scope-aware dependency resolution, import-preserving reconstruction, and validator-gated promotion -- ensuring that every retrieved block is scope-closed, compilable, and runnable. Applied to 19 major repositories, the pipeline extracted 1,289 candidate blocks, validated 941 (73.0%), and demonstrated that over 80% are structurally unique. Through multi-level de-duplication (exact, lexical, structural), we find that NN-RAG contributes the overwhelming majority of unique architectures to the LEMUR dataset, supplying approximately 72% of all novel network structures. Beyond quantity, NN-RAG uniquely enables cross-repository migration of architectural patterns, automatically identifying reusable modules in one project and regenerating them, dependency-complete, in another context. To our knowledge, no other open-source system provides this capability at scale. The framework's neutral specifications further allow optional integration with language models for synthesis or dataset registration without redistributing third-party code.

This problem is especially pronounced in hyperspectral imaging, from satellite hyperspectral remote sensing to infrared pathology imaging, where channels capture distinct biophysical or biochemical cues. We propose DisentangleFormer, an architecture that achieves robust multi-channel vision representation through principled spatial-channel decoupling. Motivated by information-theoretic principles of decorrelated representation learning, our parallel design enables independent modeling of structural and semantic cues while minimizing redundancy between spatial and channel streams. Our design integrates three core components: (1) Parallel Disentanglement: Independently processes spatial-token and channel-token streams, enabling decorrelated feature learning across spatial and spectral dimensions, (2) Squeezed Token Enhancer: An adaptive calibration module that dynamically fuses spatial and channel streams, and (3) Multi-Scale FFN: complementing global attention with multi-scale local context to capture fine-grained structural and semantic dependencies.

Three planned reference trajectories are compared against a free-driving baseline (NOREF) to assess trade-offs between lap time (LT) and steering effort (SE): NOM, the nominal time-optimal trajectory; TLC, a track-limit-robust trajectory obtained by tightening margins to the track edges; and FLC, a friction-limit-robust trajectory obtained by tightening against axle and tire saturation. All trajectories share the same minimum lap-time objective with a small steering-smoothness regularizer and are evaluated by two professional drivers using a high-performance car on a virtual track. The trajectories derive from a disturbance-aware minimum-lap-time framework recently proposed by the authors, where worst-case disturbance growth is propagated over a finite horizon and used to tighten tire-friction and track-limit constraints, preserving performance while providing probabilistic safety margins. LT and SE are used as performance indicators, while RMS lateral deviation, speed error, and drift angle characterize driving style. Results show a Pareto-like LT-SE trade-off: NOM yields the shortest LT but highest SE; TLC minimizes SE at the cost of longer LT; FLC lies near the efficient frontier, substantially reducing SE relative to NOM with only a small LT increase. Removing trajectory guidance (NOREF) increases both LT and SE, confirming that reference trajectories improve pace and control efficiency. Overall, the findings highlight reference-based and disturbance-aware planning, especially FLC, as effective tools for training and for achieving fast yet stable trajectories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53c2\u8003\u8f68\u8ff9\uff08NOM\u3001TLC\u3001FLC\uff09\u4e0e\u81ea\u7531\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0FLC\u5728\u5708\u65f6\u548c\u8f6c\u5411\u52aa\u529b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5e72\u6270\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u8f68\u8ff9\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u7531\u4e13\u4e1a\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u89c4\u5212\u53c2\u8003\u8f68\u8ff9\uff08NOM\u3001TLC\u3001FLC\uff09\u4e0e\u81ea\u7531\u9a7e\u9a76\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08NOREF\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5708\u65f6\uff08LT\uff09\u548c\u8f6c\u5411\u52aa\u529b\uff08SE\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u7684LT-SE\u6743\u8861\uff1aNOM\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u77ed\u5708\u65f6\u4f46\u8f6c\u5411\u52aa\u529b\u6700\u9ad8\uff1bTLC\u4ee5\u5708\u65f6\u589e\u52a0\u4e3a\u4ee3\u4ef7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8f6c\u5411\u52aa\u529b\uff1bFLC\u63a5\u8fd1\u6548\u7387\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8f6c\u5411\u52aa\u529b\u4e14\u4ec5\u5c0f\u5e45\u589e\u52a0\u5708\u65f6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89c4\u5212\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662fFLC\uff09\u662f\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u7a33\u5b9a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

We present a novel multi-video 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) approach designed to handle real-world, unsynchronized video sets. Our approach, SyncTrack4D, directly leverages dense 4D track representation of dynamic scene parts as cues for simultaneous cross-video synchronization and 4DGS reconstruction. We first compute dense per-video 4D feature tracks and cross-video track correspondences by Fused Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport approach. Next, we perform global frame-level temporal alignment to maximize overlapping motion of matched 4D tracks. Finally, we achieve sub-frame synchronization through our multi-video 4D Gaussian splatting built upon a motion-spline scaffold representation. The final output is a synchronized 4DGS representation with dense, explicit 3D trajectories, and temporal offsets for each video. We evaluate our approach on the Panoptic Studio and SyncNeRF Blender, demonstrating sub-frame synchronization accuracy with an average temporal error below 0.26 frames, and high-fidelity 4D reconstruction reaching 26.3 PSNR scores on the Panoptic Studio dataset.

This paper introduces a Fuzzy Logic based Decision Support System (DSS) designed for real time, prescriptive game management. Unlike traditional Machine Learning approaches that encounter a predictive ceiling by attempting to replicate human behavior, our system audits performance through an objective, rule based inference engine. We propose a methodological advancement by reformulating the PlayeRank metric into a Cumulative Mean with Role Aware Normalization, eliminating the play time exposure bias inherent in cumulative sum models to enable accurate intra match comparison. The system integrates this refined metric with physiological proxies (fatigue) and contextual variables (disciplinary risk modulated by tactical role) to calculate a dynamic Substitution Priority (P final). Validation via a case study of the 2018 FIFA World Cup match between Brazil and Belgium demonstrates the system's ecological validity: it not only aligned with expert consensus on executed substitutions (for example Gabriel Jesus) but, crucially, identified high risk scenarios ignored by human decision makers. Specifically, the model flagged the \"FAGNER Paradox\" - a maximum priority defensive risk - minutes before a critical yellow card, and detected the \"Lukaku Paradox\", where an isolated assist masked a severe drop in participation. These results confirm that Fuzzy Logic offers a transparent, explainable, and superior alternative to black box models for optimizing real time tactical decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u7cca\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u7684\u6bd4\u8d5b\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6307\u6807\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53d8\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a8\u6001\u66ff\u6362\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7cbe\u82f1\u8db3\u7403\u4e2d\uff0c\u66ff\u8865\u51b3\u7b56\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u5927\u7684\u8d22\u52a1\u548c\u4f53\u80b2\u540e\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u7136\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u76f4\u89c9\u6216\u4ec5\u6a21\u4eff\u5386\u53f2\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06PlayeRank\u6307\u6807\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u89d2\u8272\u611f\u77e5\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u5747\u503c\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u7d2f\u79ef\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u6bd4\u8d5b\u65f6\u95f4\u66b4\u9732\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u7406\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u75b2\u52b3\uff09\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u6218\u672f\u89d2\u8272\u8c03\u5236\u7684\u7eaa\u5f8b\u98ce\u9669\uff09\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a8\u6001\u66ff\u6362\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\uff08P final\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc72018\u5e74\u4e16\u754c\u676f\u5df4\u897f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5229\u65f6\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u751f\u6001\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1a\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u5171\u8bc6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8fd8\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u60c5\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u7cca\u903b\u8f91\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u6218\u672f\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

By randomly generating control point coordinates, we construct displacement fields that encompass a variety of realistic displacement scenarios, which are subsequently used to generate speckle pattern datasets. This approach enables the generation of a large-scale dataset that capture real-world displacement field situations, thereby enhancing the training and generalization capabilities of deep learning-based DIC algorithms. Additionally, we propose a novel network architecture, termed Bayes-DIC Net, which extracts information at multiple levels during the down-sampling phase and facilitates the aggregation of information across various levels through a single skip connection during the up-sampling phase. Bayes-DIC Net incorporates a series of lightweight convolutional blocks designed to expand the receptive field and capture rich contextual information while minimizing computational costs. Furthermore, by integrating appropriate dropout modules into Bayes-DIC Net and activating them during the network inference stage, Bayes-DIC Net is transformed into a Bayesian neural network. This transformation allows the network to provide not only predictive results but also confidence levels in these predictions when processing real unlabeled datasets.

Our results show that (1) persona choice shapes idea domains, (2) collaboration mode shifts diversity of idea generation, and (3) multi-agent persona-driven brainstorming produces idea depth and cross-domain coverage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u8272\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u89d2\u8272\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bf9\u521b\u610f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4e3b\u9898\u548c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6784\u601d\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u7528\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u534f\u4f5c\u901a\u5e38\u6bd4\u5355\u4e00\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u89d2\u8272\u9886\u57df\u5b9a\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u5934\u8111\u98ce\u66b4\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff08\u5982\u4e0d\u540c\u89d2\u8272\u914d\u5bf9\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u5934\u8111\u98ce\u66b4\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff1a(1) \u89d2\u8272\u9009\u62e9\u5f71\u54cd\u521b\u610f\u9886\u57df\uff0c(2) \u534f\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u6539\u53d8\u521b\u610f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c(3) \u57fa\u4e8e\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u5934\u8111\u98ce\u66b4\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u6df1\u5ea6\u521b\u610f\u548c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u8986\u76d6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u5934\u8111\u98ce\u66b4\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4e3b\u9898\u548c\u9886\u57df\u6784\u601d\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u89d2\u8272\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bf9\u521b\u610f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

However, they fall short of replicating the natural movement and interaction capabilities of the human arm. In contrast, human limbs leverage intrinsic compliance and actively modulate joint stiffness, enabling adaptive responses to varying tasks, impact absorption, and efficient energy transfer during dynamic actions. Inspired by this adaptability, we developed a transhumeral prosthesis with Variable Stiffness Actuators (VSAs) to replicate the controllable compliance found in biological joints. The proposed prosthesis features a modular design, allowing customization for different residual limb shapes and accommodating a range of independent control signals derived from users' biological cues. Integrated elastic elements passively support more natural movements, facilitate safe interactions with the environment, and adapt to diverse task requirements.

Given the rapid development of face forgery generation algorithms, new fake categories are likely to keep appearing, posing a major challenge to existing face forgery detection methods. Despite recent advances in face forgery detection, existing methods are typically limited to binary Real-vs-Fake classification or the identification of known fake categories, and are incapable of detecting the emergence of novel types of forgeries. In this work, we study the Open Set Face Forgery Detection (OSFFD) problem, which demands that the detection model recognize novel fake categories. We reformulate the OSFFD problem and address it through uncertainty estimation, enhancing its applicability to real-world scenarios. Specifically, we propose the Dual-Level Evidential face forgery Detection (DLED) approach, which collects and fuses category-specific evidence on the spatial and frequency levels to estimate prediction uncertainty. Extensive evaluations conducted across diverse experimental settings demonstrate that the proposed DLED method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming various baseline models by an average of 20% in detecting forgeries from novel fake categories.

A contact-implicit formulation is used to model distributed frictional interactions during sidewinding, and validated through MATLAB Simscape simulations and physical experiments on rigid ground and loose sand. To capture terrain deformation effects, Project Chrono's Soil Contact Model (SCM) is integrated with the articulated multibody dynamics, enabling prediction of slip, sinkage, and load redistribution that reduce stride efficiency on deformable substrates. For high-energy rolling locomotion on steep slopes, the Chrono DEM Engine is used to simulate particle-resolved granular interactions, revealing soil failure, intermittent lift-off, and energy dissipation mechanisms not captured by rigid models.

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer strong semantic priors and cross-modal generalization, while world models (WMs) provide actionable latent dynamics for prediction and control. Their combination holds promise for open-ended embodied intelligence, yet introduces two key challenges: (1) establishing a tight coupling between the semantic intent from MLLMs and the dynamic state representations within the WM's latent space, and (2) achieving task-aware adaptability that supports multi-task learning and cross-environment generalization. To address these limitations, we propose BiTAgent, a task-aware dynamic joint framework that enables bidirectional coupling between MLLMs and WMs. BiTAgent establishes two complementary pathways: a forward path that injects MLLM representations into the WM's latent space for semantically guided imagination, and a backward path where WM-generated feedback refines the MLLM's semantic space via dense text-conditioned rewards. This bidirectional interaction is realized through three synergistic components: Task-Aware Dynamic Joint Learning, Task-Aware Behavior Learning, and MLLM-WM Joint Optimization, which together harmonize semantic reasoning and dynamic prediction.

However, these models suffer from factual inaccuracies in the generated descriptions, causing severe hallucination issues. While prior works have explored alleviating hallucinations for static images, jointly mitigating visual object and temporal action hallucinations for dynamic videos remains a challenging and unsolved task. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Self-Augmented Contrastive Alignment (SANTA) framework for enabling object and action faithfulness by exempting the spurious correlations and enforcing the emphasis on visual facts. SANTA employs a hallucinative self-augmentation scheme to identify the potential hallucinations that lie in the MLLM and transform the original captions to the contrasted negatives. Furthermore, we develop a tracklet-phrase contrastive alignment to match the regional objects and relation-guided actions with their corresponding visual and temporal phrases.

To realize this potential, a key research question remains open: how can a humanoid execute the human actions from generated videos in a zero-shot manner? This challenge arises because generated videos are often noisy and exhibit morphological distortions that make direct imitation difficult compared to real video. To address this, we introduce a two-stage pipeline. First, we lift video pixels into a 4D human representation and then retarget to the humanoid morphology. Second, we propose GenMimic-a physics-aware reinforcement learning policy conditioned on 3D keypoints, and trained with symmetry regularization and keypoint-weighted tracking rewards. As a result, GenMimic can mimic human actions from noisy, generated videos. We curate GenMimicBench, a synthetic human-motion dataset generated using two video generation models across a spectrum of actions and contexts, establishing a benchmark for assessing zero-shot generalization and policy robustness.

Existing methods often treat long-horizon actions as linguistic sequences and apply trajectory-level optimization methods such as Trajectory-wise Preference Optimization (TPO) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), leading to coarse credit assignment and unstable training. However, unlike language, where a unified semantic meaning is preserved despite flexible sentence order, action trajectories progress through causally chained stages with different learning difficulties. This motivates progressive stage optimization. Thereby, we present Stage-Aware Reinforcement (STARE), a module that decomposes a long-horizon action trajectory into semantically meaningful stages and provides dense, interpretable, and stage-aligned reinforcement signals. Integrating STARE into TPO and PPO, we yield Stage-Aware TPO (STA-TPO) and Stage-Aware PPO (STA-PPO) for offline stage-wise preference and online intra-stage interaction, respectively. Further building on supervised fine-tuning as initialization, we propose the Imitation -> Preference -> Interaction (IPI), a serial fine-tuning pipeline for improving action accuracy in VLA models.

With only prompt-level configuration, GTM accesses tool functionalities along with input arguments and generates outputs that faithfully mimic real tool execution, providing a fast and cost-effective solution that eliminates development overhead. To build GTM, we propose the Context-Aware Response Generation (CARG) pipeline, which synthesizes comprehensive training data covering over 20,000 tools across 300 domains including physics, medicine, robotics, and finance. Through this pipeline, GTM learns to produce not only syntactically correct outputs but also logically coherent and contextually appropriate responses. Experiments demonstrate that GTM produces high-quality outputs with strong consistency and reliability. Besides when used in real reinforcement learning scenarios for agent training, GTM exhibits significantly faster simulation speed compared to real tools while maintaining comparable output quality, along with remarkable generalization and domain adaptability.

Project Page: https://kaist-viclab.github.io/fmanetpp_site/", "summary": "Real-world video restoration is plagued by complex degradations from motion coupled with dynamically varying exposure - a key challenge largely overlooked by prior works and a common artifact of auto-exposure or low-light capture. We present FMA-Net++, a framework for joint video super-resolution and deblurring that explicitly models this coupled effect of motion and dynamically varying exposure. FMA-Net++ adopts a sequence-level architecture built from Hierarchical Refinement with Bidirectional Propagation blocks, enabling parallel, long-range temporal modeling. Within each block, an Exposure Time-aware Modulation layer conditions features on per-frame exposure, which in turn drives an exposure-aware Flow-Guided Dynamic Filtering module to infer motion- and exposure-aware degradation kernels.

In this paper, we propose Fourier-Attentive Representation Learning (FARL), a novel framework that addresses this by explicitly disentangling visual representations using Fourier analysis. The core of our method is a dual cross-attention mechanism, where learnable representation tokens separately query an image's structural features (from the phase spectrum) and stylistic features (from the amplitude spectrum). This process yields enriched, disentangled tokens that are then injected deep into the VLM encoders to guide adaptation.

From an initial study of 500 human queries, we find that 32.4% contain missing or underspecified context. Drawing on this initial study and cognitive theories of human communication errors, we derive five representative categories requiring abstention: actionability limitation, referential underspecification, preference dependence, information unavailability, and false presupposition. We augment OpenEQA by having annotators transform well-posed questions into ambiguous variants outlined by these categories. The resulting dataset, AbstainEQA, comprises 1,636 annotated abstention cases paired with 1,636 original OpenEQA instances for balanced evaluation. Evaluating on AbstainEQA, we find that even the best frontier model only attains 42.79% abstention recall, while humans achieve 91.17%.

A current challenge is to reconstruct speech in a streaming mode by directly regressing cortical signals into acoustic speech. While this has been achieved recently using intracortical data, further work is needed to obtain comparable results with surface ECoG recordings.

In recent years, deep learning techniques have attracted significant attention in medical image classification. However, it is usually infeasible to train an entire large deep learning model from scratch. To address this issue, one of the solutions is the transfer learning (TL) technique, where a pre-trained model is reused for a new task. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of TL techniques for medical image classification using deep convolutional neural networks. We evaluate six pre-trained models (AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, and InceptionV3) on a custom chest X-ray dataset for disease detection. The experimental results demonstrate that InceptionV3 consistently outperforms other models across all the standard metrics. The ResNet family shows progressively better performance with increasing depth, whereas VGG16 and AlexNet perform reasonably well but with lower accuracy. In addition, we also conduct uncertainty analysis and runtime comparison to assess the robustness and computational efficiency of these models. Our findings reveal that TL is beneficial in most cases, especially with limited data, but the extent of improvement depends on several factors such as model architecture, dataset size, and domain similarity between source and target tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that with a well-trained feature extractor, only a lightweight feedforward model is enough to provide efficient prediction.

However, existing distillation methods often encounter the issue of mixed features in remote sensing images (RSIs), and neglect the discrepancies caused by subtle feature variations, leading to entangled knowledge confusion. To address these challenges, we propose an architecture-agnostic distillation method named Dual-Stream Spectral Decoupling Distillation (DS2D2) for universal remote sensing object detection tasks. Specifically, DS2D2 integrates explicit and implicit distillation grounded in spectral decomposition. Firstly, the first-order wavelet transform is applied for spectral decomposition to preserve the critical spatial characteristics of RSIs. Leveraging this spatial preservation, a Density-Independent Scale Weight (DISW) is designed to address the challenges of dense and small object detection common in RSIs. Secondly, we show implicit knowledge hidden in subtle student-teacher feature discrepancies, which significantly influence predictions when activated by detection heads. This implicit knowledge is extracted via full-frequency and high-frequency amplifiers, which map feature differences to prediction deviations. Extensive experiments on DIOR and DOTA datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, on DIOR dataset, DS2D2 achieves improvements of 4.2% in AP50 for RetinaNet and 3.8% in AP50 for Faster R-CNN, outperforming existing distillation approaches.

However, these methods rely on a costly gradient orthogonalization step. Even efficient iterative approximations such as Newton-Schulz remain expensive, typically requiring dozens of matrix multiplications to converge. We introduce a preconditioning procedure that accelerates Newton-Schulz convergence and reduces its computational cost. We evaluate its impact and show that the overhead of our preconditioning can be made negligible. Furthermore, the faster convergence it enables allows us to remove one iteration out of the usual five without degrading approximation quality. Our publicly available implementation achieves up to a 2.8x speedup in the Newton-Schulz approximation. We also show that this has a direct impact on end-to-end training runtime with 5-10% improvement in realistic training scenarios across two efficiency-focused tasks. On challenging language or vision tasks, we validate that our method maintains equal or superior model performance while improving runtime. Crucially, these improvements require no hyperparameter tuning and can be adopted as a simple drop-in replacement.

Second, contact information, which can be obtained from videos and physical interactions, provides sparse constraints on the boundary of the geometry.

This paper presents an explainable multimodal framework that integrates RGB and Depth (RGB-D) data to recognize Parkinsonian gait patterns under realistic conditions. The proposed system employs dual YOLOv11-based encoders for modality-specific feature extraction, followed by a Multi-Scale Local-Global Extraction (MLGE) module and a Cross-Spatial Neck Fusion mechanism to enhance spatial-temporal representation. This design captures both fine-grained limb motion (e.g., reduced arm swing) and overall gait dynamics (e.g., short stride or turning difficulty), even in challenging scenarios such as low lighting or occlusion caused by clothing. To ensure interpretability, a frozen Large Language Model (LLM) is incorporated to translate fused visual embeddings and structured metadata into clinically meaningful textual explanations. Experimental evaluations on multimodal gait datasets demonstrate that the proposed RGB-D fusion framework achieves higher recognition accuracy, improved robustness to environmental variations, and clear visual-linguistic reasoning compared with single-input baselines. By combining multimodal feature learning with language-based interpretability, this study bridges the gap between visual recognition and clinical understanding, offering a novel vision-language paradigm for reliable and explainable Parkinsons disease gait analysis.

Currently, most existing automatic trailer generation methods employ a \"selection-then-ranking\" paradigm (i.e., first selecting key shots and then ranking them), which suffers from inevitable error propagation and limits the quality of the generated trailers. Beyond this paradigm, we propose a new self-paced and self-corrective masked prediction method called SSMP, which achieves state-of-the-art results in automatic trailer generation via bi-directional contextual modeling and progressive self-correction. In particular, SSMP trains a Transformer encoder that takes the movie shot sequences as prompts and generates corresponding trailer shot sequences accordingly. The model is trained via masked prediction, reconstructing each trailer shot sequence from its randomly masked counterpart. The mask ratio is self-paced, allowing the task difficulty to adapt to the model and thereby improving model performance. When generating a movie trailer, the model fills the shot positions with high confidence at each step and re-masks the remaining positions for the next prediction, forming a progressive self-correction mechanism that is analogous to how human editors work. Both quantitative results and user studies demonstrate the superiority of SSMP in comparison to existing automatic movie trailer generation methods.

Indeed, although this capability is readily handled by rule-based symbolic systems based on serial computation, learning to systematically deploy counting procedures is difficult for neural models, which should acquire these skills through learning. Previous research has demonstrated that recurrent architectures can only approximately track and enumerate sequences of events, and it remains unclear whether modern deep learning systems, including LLMs, can deploy systematic counting procedures over sequences of discrete symbols. This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating the sequential enumeration abilities of five state-of-the-art LLMs, including proprietary, open-source, and reasoning models. We probe LLMs in sequential naming and production tasks involving lists of letters and words, adopting a variety of prompting instructions to explore the role of chain-of-thought in the spontaneous emerging of counting strategies. We also evaluate open-source models with the same architecture but increasing size to see whether the mastering of counting principles follows scaling laws, and we analyze the embedding dynamics during sequential enumeration to investigate the emergent encoding of numerosity. We find that some LLMs are indeed capable of deploying counting procedures when explicitly prompted to do so, but none of them spontaneously engage in counting when simply asked to enumerate the number of items in a sequence. Our results suggest that, despite their impressive emergent abilities, LLMs cannot yet robustly and systematically deploy counting procedures, highlighting a persistent gap between neural and symbolic approaches to compositional generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u9700\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u793a\u624d\u80fd\u8ba1\u6570\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u81ea\u53d1\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8ba1\u6570\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662fLLMs\uff09\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6267\u884c\u8ba1\u6570\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LLMs\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4e13\u6709\u3001\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u679a\u4e3e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5d4c\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u90e8\u5206LLMs\u5728\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u80fd\u591f\u6267\u884c\u8ba1\u6570\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f46\u5747\u65e0\u6cd5\u81ea\u53d1\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u6570\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u6570\u80fd\u529b\u672a\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLMs\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u80fd\u591f\u6267\u884c\u8ba1\u6570\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u65e0\u6cd5\u81ea\u53d1\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u6570\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

Existing studies mainly follow two directions: trajectory generation oriented, which focuses on producing high-quality trajectories with simple decision mechanisms, and trajectory selection oriented, which performs multi-dimensional evaluation to select the best trajectory yet lacks sufficient generative capability. In this work, we propose MindDrive, a harmonized framework that integrates high-quality trajectory generation with comprehensive decision reasoning. It establishes a structured reasoning paradigm of \"context simulation - candidate generation - multi-objective trade-off\". In particular, the proposed Future-aware Trajectory Generator (FaTG), based on a World Action Model (WaM), performs ego-conditioned \"what-if\" simulations to predict potential future scenes and generate foresighted trajectory candidates.

In a nutshell, XIL algorithms select a number of items on which an AI model made a decision (e.g. images and their tags) and present them to users, together with corresponding explanations (e.g. image regions that drive the model's decision). Then, users supply corrective feedback for the explanations, which the algorithm uses to improve the model. Despite showing promise in debugging tasks, recent studies have raised concerns that explanatory interaction may trigger order effects, a well-known cognitive bias in which the sequence of presented items influences users' trust and, critically, the quality of their feedback. We argue that these studies are not entirely conclusive, as the experimental designs and tasks employed differ substantially from common XIL use cases, complicating interpretation. To clarify the interplay between order effects and explanatory interaction, we ran two larger-scale user studies (n = 713 total) designed to mimic common XIL tasks. Specifically, we assessed order effects both within and between debugging sessions by manipulating the order in which correct and wrong explanations are presented to participants. Order effects had a limited, through significant impact on users' agreement with the model (i.e., a behavioral measure of their trust), and only when examined withing debugging sessions, not between them. The quality of users' feedback was generally satisfactory, with order effects exerting only a small and inconsistent influence in both experiments.

To facilitate progress in this direction, we introduce StreamEQA, the first benchmark designed for streaming video question answering in embodied scenarios. StreamEQA evaluates existing MLLMs along two orthogonal dimensions: Embodied and Streaming. Along the embodied dimension, we categorize the questions into three levels: perception, interaction, and planning, which progressively assess a model's ability to recognize fine-grained visual details, reason about agent-object interactions, and perform high-level goal-directed reasoning. For the streaming dimension, questions are divided into backward, real-time, and forward reasoning, with each mode relying on a distinct temporal context. Built upon 156 independent long videos, StreamEQA defines 42 tasks and generates approximately 21K question-answer pairs with precise timestamps through a hybrid pipeline combining automated generation and human refinement. Evaluations of 13 state-of-the-art video-LLMs reveal that, despite strong performance on conventional benchmarks, these models still struggle with streaming video understanding in embodied scenarios.

In this paper, we introduce ASTRIDE, an automated threat modeling platform purpose-built for AI agent-based systems. ASTRIDE extends the classical STRIDE framework by introducing a new threat category, A for AI Agent-Specific Attacks, which encompasses emerging vulnerabilities such as prompt injection, unsafe tool invocation, and reasoning subversion, unique to agent-based applications. To automate threat modeling, ASTRIDE combines a consortium of fine-tuned vision-language models (VLMs) with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM to perform end-to-end analysis directly from visual agent architecture diagrams, such as data flow diagrams(DFDs). LLM agents orchestrate the end-to-end threat modeling automation process by coordinating interactions between the VLM consortium and the reasoning LLM. Our evaluations demonstrate that ASTRIDE provides accurate, scalable, and explainable threat modeling for next-generation intelligent systems.

However, these generative models typically require camera metadata and extensive target-specific noisy-clean image pairs, often showing limited generalization between settings. In this paper, to mitigate the prerequisites, we propose a Single-Pair Guided Diffusion for generalized noise synthesis GuidNoise, which uses a single noisy/clean pair as the guidance, often easily obtained by itself within a training set. To train GuidNoise, which generates synthetic noisy images from the guidance, we introduce a guidance-aware affine feature modification (GAFM) and a noise-aware refine loss to leverage the inherent potential of diffusion models. This loss function refines the diffusion model's backward process, making the model more adept at generating realistic noise distributions. The GuidNoise synthesizes high-quality noisy images under diverse noise environments without additional metadata during both training and inference. Additionally, GuidNoise enables the efficient generation of noisy-clean image pairs at inference time, making synthetic noise readily applicable for augmenting training data. This self-augmentation significantly improves denoising performance, especially in practical scenarios with lightweight models and limited training data.

A dominant research trend seeks to enhance end-to-end (E2E) driving systems by integrating vision-language models (VLMs), leveraging their rich world knowledge and reasoning abilities to improve generalization across diverse environments. However, most existing VLMs or vision-language agents (VLAs) are built upon autoregressive (AR) models. In this paper, we observe that existing AR-based VLMs -- limited by causal attention and sequential token generation -- often fail to maintain consistency and controllability between high-level reasoning and low-level planning. In contrast, recent discrete diffusion VLMs equipped with bidirectional attention exhibit superior controllability and reliability through iterative denoising. Building on these observations, we introduce dVLM-AD, a diffusion-based vision-language model that unifies perception, structured reasoning, and low-level planning for end-to-end driving. Evaluated on nuScenes and WOD-E2E, dVLM-AD yields more consistent reasoning-action pairs and achieves planning performance comparable to existing driving VLM/VLA systems despite a modest backbone, outperforming AR-based baselines with a 9 percent improvement in behavior-trajectory consistency and a 6 percent increase in RFS on long-tail WOD-E2E scenarios.

However, existing methods typically require specialized models tailored to different tasks, lacking unified modeling of spatiotemporal features across multiple time series tasks. In this paper, we propose a Unified Time Series Generative Model (UniTS), a general framework applicable to various time series tasks, including time series reconstruction, time series cloud removal, time series semantic change detection, and time series forecasting. Based on the flow matching generative paradigm, UniTS constructs a deterministic evolution path from noise to targets under the guidance of task-specific conditions, achieving unified modeling of spatiotemporal representations for multiple tasks. The UniTS architecture consists of a diffusion transformer with spatio-temporal blocks, where we design an Adaptive Condition Injector (ACor) to enhance the model's conditional perception of multimodal inputs, enabling high-quality controllable generation. Additionally, we design a Spatiotemporal-aware Modulator (STM) to improve the ability of spatio-temporal blocks to capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, we construct two high-quality multimodal time series datasets, TS-S12 and TS-S12CR, filling the gap of benchmark datasets for time series cloud removal and forecasting tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniTS exhibits exceptional generative and cognitive capabilities in both low-level and high-level time series tasks.

Although relevant to areas such as cryptography, crystallography, and medical imaging, the problem remains unresolved: beyond a few special dimensions, neither optimal packings nor tight upper bounds are known. Even a major breakthrough in dimension $n=8$, later recognised with a Fields Medal, underscores its difficulty. A leading technique for upper bounds, the three-point method, reduces the problem to solving large, high-precision semidefinite programs (SDPs). Because each candidate SDP may take days to evaluate, standard data-intensive AI approaches are infeasible. We address this challenge by formulating SDP construction as a sequential decision process, the SDP game, in which a policy assembles SDP formulations from a set of admissible components. Using a sample-efficient model-based framework that combines Bayesian optimisation with Monte Carlo Tree Search, we obtain new state-of-the-art upper bounds in dimensions $4-16$, showing that model-based search can advance computational progress in longstanding geometric problems. Together, these results demonstrate that sample-efficient, model-based search can make tangible progress on mathematically rigid, evaluation limited problems, pointing towards a complementary direction for AI-assisted discovery beyond large-scale LLM-driven exploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u641c\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316+\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff09\u5c06SDP\u6784\u9020\u89c6\u4e3a\u987a\u5e8f\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea64-16\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u65b0\u6700\u4f18\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86AI\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7403\u4f53\u586b\u5145\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u3001\u6676\u4f53\u5b66\u3001\u533b\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\uff09\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u9664\u5c11\u6570\u7279\u6b8a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5916\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u586b\u5145\u6216\u7d27\u4e0a\u754c\u4ecd\u672a\u77e5\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u578bAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0SDP\u8bc4\u4f30\u8017\u65f6\u8fc7\u957f\u800c\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5c06SDP\u6784\u9020\u89c6\u4e3a\u987a\u5e8f\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08SDP\u6e38\u620f\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea64-16\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u521a\u6027\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d7\u9650\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06SDP\u6784\u9020\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u987a\u5e8f\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08SDP\u6e38\u620f\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea64-16\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u641c\u7d22\u5728\u957f\u671f\u51e0\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

Specifically, DeRA maintains a compact 1D latent space while factorizing video encoding into appearance and motion streams, which are aligned with pretrained vision foundation models to capture the spatial semantics and temporal dynamics in videos separately. To address the gradient conflicts introduced by the heterogeneous supervision, we further propose the Symmetric Alignment-Conflict Projection (SACP) module that proactively reformulates gradients by suppressing the components along conflicting directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeRA outperforms LARP, the previous state-of-the-art video tokenizer by 25% on UCF-101 in terms of rFVD.

Information extraction from clinical records is a crucial task in digital healthcare. Although traditional NLP techniques have been used for this in the past, they often fall short due to the complexity, variability of clinical language, and high inner semantics in the free clinical text. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a powerful tool for better understanding and generating human-like text, making them highly effective in this area. In this paper, we explore the ability of open-source multilingual LLMs to understand EHRs (Electronic Health Records) in Italian and help extract information from them in real-time.

Zero-shot, identity-preserving models such as Insert Anything and OminiControl now support applications like virtual try-on without requiring additional fine-tuning. While these models may be fitting for humans and rigid everyday objects, they still have limitations for non-rigid or fine-grained categories. These domains often lack accessible, high-quality data -- especially videos or multi-view observations of the same subject -- making them difficult both to evaluate and to improve upon. Yet, such domains are essential for moving beyond content creation toward applications that demand accuracy and fine detail. Birds are an excellent domain for this task: they exhibit high diversity, require fine-grained cues for identification, and come in a wide variety of poses. We introduce the NABirds Look-Alikes (NABLA) dataset, consisting of 4,759 expert-curated image pairs.

This rapid review examines benchmarking practices for AI systems in preclinical biomedical research. Three major databases and two preprint servers were searched from January 1, 2018 to October 31, 2025, identifying 14 benchmarks that assess AI capabilities in literature understanding, experimental design, and hypothesis generation. The results revealed that all current benchmarks assess isolated component capabilities, including data analysis quality, hypothesis validity, and experimental protocol design. However, authentic research collaboration requires integrated workflows spanning multiple sessions, with contextual memory, adaptive dialogue, and constraint propagation. This gap implies that systems excelling on component benchmarks may fail as practical research co-pilots.

Although there exist considerable methods that focus on local information from convolutional neural network models or global information from transformer models, the single-type model falls into a modeling dilemma between local fine-grained details and global long-range dependencies, thus deteriorating for specular highlights with different scales. Therefore, to accommodate specular highlights of all scales, we propose a multi-model architecture for specular highlight removal (MM-SHR) that effectively captures fine-grained features in highlight regions and models long-range dependencies between highlight and highlight-free areas. Specifically, we employ convolution operations to extract local details in the shallow layers of MM-SHR, and utilize the attention mechanism to capture global features in the deep layers, ensuring both operation efficiency and removal accuracy. To model long-range dependencies without compromising computational complexity, we utilize a coarse-to-fine manner and propose Omni-Directional Attention Integration Block(OAIBlock) and Adaptive Region-Aware Hybrid-Domain Dual Attention Convolutional Network(HDDAConv) , which leverage omni-directiona pixel-shifting and window-dividing operations at the raw features to achieve specular highlight removal.

STELLA employs a dynamic semantic abstraction mechanism that decouples input series into trend, seasonality, and residual components. It then translates intrinsic behavioral features of these components into Hierarchical Semantic Anchors: a Corpus-level Semantic Prior (CSP) for global context and a Fine-grained Behavioral Prompt (FBP) for instance-level patterns. Using these anchors as prefix-prompts, STELLA guides the LLM to model intrinsic dynamics. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that STELLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in long- and short-term forecasting, showing superior generalization in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our dynamically generated semantic anchors.", "AI": {"tldr": "STELLA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5229\u7528LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u539f\u59cb\u5e8f\u5217\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "method": "STELLA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u8d8b\u52bf\u3001\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5185\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5206\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\uff08CSP\u548cFBP\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u52a8\u6001\u65b9\u5f0f\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSTELLA\u5728\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "STELLA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

As these systems scale, they rely heavily on preprocessing pipelines to handle diverse inputs efficiently. However, this dependency on standard preprocessing operations, specifically image downscaling, creates a significant yet often overlooked security vulnerability. While intended for computational optimization, scaling algorithms can be exploited to conceal malicious visual prompts that are invisible to human observers but become active semantic instructions once processed by the model. Current adversarial strategies remain largely static, failing to account for the dynamic nature of modern agentic workflows. To address this gap, we propose Chameleon, a novel, adaptive adversarial framework designed to expose and exploit scaling vulnerabilities in production VLMs. Unlike traditional static attacks, Chameleon employs an iterative, agent-based optimization mechanism that dynamically refines image perturbations based on the target model's real-time feedback. This allows the framework to craft highly robust adversarial examples that survive standard downscaling operations to hijack downstream execution. We evaluate Chameleon against Gemini 2.5 Flash model. Our experiments demonstrate that Chameleon achieves an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 84.5% across varying scaling factors, significantly outperforming static baseline attacks which average only 32.1%. Furthermore, we show that these attacks effectively compromise agentic pipelines, reducing decision-making accuracy by over 45% in multi-step tasks.

In this work, we present UltraImage, a principled framework that addresses both issues. Through frequency-wise analysis of positional embeddings, we identify that repetition arises from the periodicity of the dominant frequency, whose period aligns with the training resolution. We introduce a recursive dominant frequency correction to constrain it within a single period after extrapolation. Furthermore, we find that quality degradation stems from diluted attention and thus propose entropy-guided adaptive attention concentration, which assigns higher focus factors to sharpen local attention for fine detail and lower ones to global attention patterns to preserve structural consistency. Experiments show that UltraImage consistently outperforms prior methods on Qwen-Image and Flux (around 4K) across three generation scenarios, reducing repetition and improving visual fidelity. Moreover, UltraImage can generate images up to 6K*6K without low-resolution guidance from a training resolution of 1328p, demonstrating its extreme extrapolation capability.

However, due to the distinct characteristics of infrared images, existing foundation models such as Masked Autoencoder (MAE) trained on visible data perform suboptimal in infrared image interpretation tasks. To bridge this gap, an infrared foundation model known as InfMAE was developed and pre-trained on large-scale infrared datasets. Despite its effectiveness, InfMAE still faces several limitations, including the omission of informative tokens, insufficient modeling of global associations, and neglect of non-uniform noise. In this paper, we propose a Dual-domain Guided Infrared foundation model based on MAE (DuGI-MAE). First, we design a deterministic masking strategy based on token entropy, preserving only high-entropy tokens for reconstruction to enhance informativeness. Next, we introduce a Dual-Domain Guidance (DDG) module, which simultaneously captures global token relationships and adaptively filters non-uniform background noise commonly present in infrared imagery. To facilitate large-scale pretraining, we construct Inf-590K, a comprehensive infrared image dataset encompassing diverse scenes, various target types, and multiple spatial resolutions.

Existing autoregressive models suffer from content drift, where object identity and scene semantics degrade over time. To address this challenge, we introduce EgoLCD, an end-to-end framework for egocentric long-context video generation that treats long video synthesis as a problem of efficient and stable memory management. EgoLCD combines a Long-Term Sparse KV Cache for stable global context with an attention-based short-term memory, extended by LoRA for local adaptation. A Memory Regulation Loss enforces consistent memory usage, and Structured Narrative Prompting provides explicit temporal guidance. Extensive experiments on the EgoVid-5M benchmark demonstrate that EgoLCD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both perceptual quality and temporal consistency, effectively mitigating generative forgetting and representing a significant step toward building scalable world models for embodied AI.

We approach this problem from a memory perspective, treating video synthesis as a recurrent dynamical process that requires coordinated short- and long-term context. We propose VideoSSM, a Long Video Model that unifies AR diffusion with a hybrid state-space memory. The state-space model (SSM) serves as an evolving global memory of scene dynamics across the entire sequence, while a context window provides local memory for motion cues and fine details. This hybrid design preserves global consistency without frozen, repetitive patterns, supports prompt-adaptive interaction, and scales in linear time with sequence length.

Current approaches to adapting pretrained models, including full-parameter and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, still rely heavily on task-specific training on downstream tasks. Therefore, zero-shot segmentation has gained increasing attention, especially with foundation models such as SAM demonstrating promising generalization capabilities. However, SAM still faces notable limitations on medical datasets due to domain shifts, making efficient zero-shot enhancement an urgent research goal. To address these challenges, we propose BA-TTA-SAM, a task-agnostic test-time adaptation framework that significantly enhances the zero-shot segmentation performance of SAM via test-time adaptation. This framework integrates two key mechanisms: (1) The encoder-level Gaussian prompt injection embeds Gaussian-based prompts directly into the image encoder, providing explicit guidance for initial representation learning. (2) The cross-layer boundary-aware attention alignment exploits the hierarchical feature interactions within the ViT backbone, aligning deep semantic responses with shallow boundary cues. Experiments on four datasets, including ISIC, Kvasir, BUSI, and REFUGE, show an average improvement of 12.4\\% in the DICE score compared with SAM's zero-shot segmentation performance. The results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in medical image segmentation. Our framework significantly enhances the generalization ability of SAM, without requiring any source-domain training data. Extensive experiments on publicly available medical datasets strongly demonstrate the superiority of our framework.

To fill this gap, we propose Physics-Informed Deformable Gaussian Splatting (PIDG), which treats each Gaussian particle as a Lagrangian material point with time-varying constitutive parameters and is supervised by 2D optical flow via motion projection. Specifically, we adopt static-dynamic decoupled 4D decomposed hash encoding to reconstruct geometry and motion efficiently. Subsequently, we impose the Cauchy momentum residual as a physics constraint, enabling independent prediction of each particle's velocity and constitutive stress via a time-evolving material field.

Among various types of sensing media, WiFi signals offer advantages such as widespread availability, low hardware cost, and strong robustness to environmental conditions like light, temperature, and humidity. By analyzing Wi-Fi signals in the environment, it is possible to capture dynamic changes of the human body and accomplish sensing applications such as gesture recognition. Although many existing gesture sensing solutions perform well in-domain but lack cross-domain capabilities (i.e., recognition performance in untrained environments). To address this, we extract Doppler spectra from the channel state information (CSI) received by all receivers and concatenate each Doppler spectrum along the same time axis to generate fused images with multi-angle information as input features. Furthermore, inspired by the convolutional block attention module (CBAM), we propose a gesture recognition network that integrates a multi-semantic spatial attention mechanism with a self-attention-based channel mechanism.

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Identity Clue Refinement and Enhancement (ICRE) network to mine and utilize the implicit discriminative knowledge inherent in modality-specific attributes. Initially, we design a Multi-Perception Feature Refinement (MPFR) module that aggregates shallow features from shared branches, aiming to capture modality-specific attributes that are easily overlooked. Then, we propose a Semantic Distillation Cascade Enhancement (SDCE) module, which distills identity-aware knowledge from the aggregated shallow features and guide the learning of modality-invariant features.

However, they often fail in scenarios requiring a deeper understanding of physical dynamics. This limitation primarily arises from their reliance on appearance-based matching. Incorporating physical motion modeling is crucial for deeper video understanding, but presents three key challenges: (1) motion signals are often entangled with appearance variations, making it difficult to extract clean physical cues; (2) effective motion modeling requires not only continuous-time motion representations but also capturing physical dynamics; and (3) collecting accurate annotations for physical attributes is costly and often impractical. To address these issues, we propose PhyVLLM, a physical-guided video-language framework that explicitly incorporates physical motion into Video LLMs. Specifically, PhyVLLM disentangles visual appearance and object motion through a dual-branch encoder. To model physical dynamics over time, we incorporate a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) module, which generates differentiable physical dynamic representations. The resulting motion-aware representations are projected into the token space of a pretrained LLM, enabling physics reasoning without compromising the model's original multimodal capabilities. To circumvent the need for explicit physical labels, PhyVLLM employs a self-supervised manner to model the continuous evolution of object motion.

In this paper, we introduce a new task, Object Retexture, which transfers local textures from a reference object to a target object in images or videos. To perform this task, a straightforward solution is to use ControlNet conditioned on the source structure and the reference texture. However, this approach suffers from limited controllability for two reasons: conditioning on the raw reference image introduces unwanted structural information, and it fails to disentangle the visual texture and structure information of the source. To address this problem, we propose Refa\u00e7ade, a method that consists of two key designs to achieve precise and controllable texture transfer in both images and videos. First, we employ a texture remover trained on paired textured/untextured 3D mesh renderings to remove appearance information while preserving the geometry and motion of source videos.

However, progress in both Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and world models is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse training data. A promising solution is to \"robotize\" web-scale human videos, which has been proven effective for policy training. However, these solutions mainly \"overlay\" robot arms to egocentric videos, which cannot handle complex full-body motions and scene occlusions in third-person videos, making them unsuitable for robotizing humans. To bridge this gap, we introduce X-Humanoid, a generative video editing approach that adapts the powerful Wan 2.2 model into a video-to-video structure and finetunes it for the human-to-humanoid translation task. This finetuning requires paired human-humanoid videos, so we designed a scalable data creation pipeline, turning community assets into 17+ hours of paired synthetic videos using Unreal Engine. We then apply our trained model to 60 hours of the Ego-Exo4D videos, generating and releasing a new large-scale dataset of over 3.6 million \"robotized\" humanoid video frames.

To address this, recent works have attempted to construct external knowledge bases and corresponding retrieval agumented generation (RAG) systems, yet these incur enormous storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we propose VideoMem, a novel framework that pioneers models long video understanding as a sequential generation task via adaptive memory management. Specifically, VideoMem dynamically updates a global memory buffer, which adaptively retains critical information while discarding redundant content across the video timeline. To efficiently train VLMs for such long-term tasks, VideoMem integrates the Progressive Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO) algorithm, equipped with two core modules: Progressive State Propagation (PSP) adaptively retains valid current states, propagates them to the next rollout step, and gradually narrows the model exploration space. Temporal Cascading Reward (TCR) further alleviates reward sparsity, improving sample utilization and accelerating convergence.

This review provides a comprehensive guide to the critical steps in dataset creation, including: 1) image acquisition, 2) selection of annotation software, and 3) annotation creation. In addition to ensuring a sufficiently large number of images, it is crucial to address sources of image variability (domain shifts) - such as those related to slide preparation and digitization - that could lead to algorithmic errors if not adequately represented in the training data. Key quality criteria for annotations are the three \"C\"s: correctness, completeness, and consistency. This review explores methods to enhance annotation quality through the use of advanced techniques that mitigate the limitations of single annotators. To support dataset creators, a standard operating procedure (SOP) is provided as supplemental material, outlining best practices for dataset development. Furthermore, the article underscores the importance of open datasets in driving innovation and enhancing reproducibility of DL research.

However, obtaining a complete multi-phase series is often clinically unfeasible due to radiation concerns or scanning limitations, leading to the \"missing modality\" problem. Existing deep learning approaches typically treat missing phases as absent independent channels, ignoring the inherent temporal continuity of hemodynamics. In this work, we propose Time Attenuated Representation Disentanglement (TARDis), a novel physics-aware framework that redefines missing modalities as missing sample points on a continuous Time-Attenuation Curve. TARDis explicitly disentangles the latent feature space into a time-invariant static component (anatomy) and a time-dependent dynamic component (perfusion). We achieve this via a dual-path architecture: a quantization-based path using a learnable embedding dictionary to extract consistent anatomical structures, and a probabilistic path using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder to model dynamic enhancement conditioned on the estimated scan time.

However, the infrared UAV targets often exhibit weak features and complex backgrounds, posing significant challenges to accurate tracking. To address these problems, we introduce SiamDFF, a novel dynamic feature fusion Siamese network that integrates feature enhancement and global contextual attention knowledge distillation for infrared UAV target (IRUT) tracking. The SiamDFF incorporates a selective target enhancement network (STEN), a dynamic spatial feature aggregation module (DSFAM), and a dynamic channel feature aggregation module (DCFAM). The STEN employs intensity-aware multi-head cross-attention to adaptively enhance important regions for both template and search branches. The DSFAM enhances multi-scale UAV target features by integrating local details with global features, utilizing spatial attention guidance within the search frame. The DCFAM effectively integrates the mixed template generated from STEN in the template branch and original template, avoiding excessive background interference with the template and thereby enhancing the emphasis on UAV target region features within the search frame. Furthermore, to enhance the feature extraction capabilities of the network for IRUT without adding extra computational burden, we propose a novel tracking-specific target-aware contextual attention knowledge distiller. It transfers the target prior from the teacher network to the student model, significantly improving the student network's focus on informative regions at each hierarchical level of the backbone network.

While this marks the first integration of language-level concepts within the SAM family, real-world usage typically requires far richer expressions that include attributes, spatial relations, functionalities, actions, states, and even implicit reasoning over instances. Currently, SAM3 relies on external multi-modal agents to convert complex instructions into NPs and then conduct iterative mask filtering. However, these NP-level concepts remain overly coarse, often failing to precisely represent a specific instance. In this work, we present SAM3-I, an enhanced framework that unifies concept-level understanding and instruction-level reasoning within the SAM family. SAM3-I introduces an instruction-aware cascaded adaptation mechanism that progressively aligns expressive instruction semantics with SAM3's existing vision-language representations, enabling direct instruction-following segmentation without sacrificing its original concept-driven capabilities. Furthermore, we design a structured instruction taxonomy spanning concept, simple, and complex levels, and develop a scalable data engine to construct a dataset with diverse instruction-mask pairs. Experiments show that SAM3-I delivers appealing performance, demonstrating that SAM3 can be effectively extended to follow natural-language instructions while preserving its strong concept grounding.

We introduce a zero-shot pipeline that simultaneously (i) detects if an image contains harmful content, (ii) identifies each critical element involved, and (iii) localizes those elements with pixel-accurate masks - all in one pass. The system first applies foundation segmentation model (SAM) to generate candidate object masks and refines them into larger independent regions. Each region is scored for malicious relevance by a vision-language model using open-vocabulary prompts; these scores weight a fusion step that produces a consolidated malicious object map. An ensemble across multiple segmenters hardens the pipeline against adaptive attacks that target any single segmentation method. Evaluated on a newly-annotated 790-image dataset spanning drug, sexual, violent and extremist content, our method attains 85.8% element-level recall, 78.1% precision and a 92.1% segment-success rate - exceeding direct zero-shot VLM localization by 27.4% recall at comparable precision. Against PGD adversarial perturbations crafted to break SAM and VLM, our method's precision and recall decreased by no more than 10%, demonstrating high robustness against attacks.

To better understand how they encode spatiotemporal information, we analyze the internal representations of Video Diffusion Transformer (VDiT). Our analysis reveals that attention heads act as minimal functional units with distinct specializations for matching, semantic understanding, and positional encoding. Additionally, we find that the low-frequency components in VDiT features are crucial for establishing correspondences, whereas the high-frequency components tend to introduce noise. Building on these insights, we propose a head- and frequency-aware feature selection strategy that jointly selects the most informative attention head and low-frequency components to enhance tracking performance. Specifically, our method extracts discriminative features through single-step denoising, applies feature selection, and employs soft-argmax localization with forward-backward consistency checks for correspondence estimation. Extensive experiments on TAP-Vid benchmarks demonstrate that HeFT achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot tracking performance, approaching the accuracy of supervised methods while eliminating the need for annotated training data.

However, these models still struggle to effectively perceive and exploit rich temporal information in videos when responding to user queries. Therefore, they often generate descriptions of events that are temporal inconsistent or causally implausible, causing severe hallucination issues. While most prior studies have focused on spatial hallucinations (e.g. object mismatches), temporal reasoning in video understanding remains relatively underexplored. To address this issue, we propose Self-Diagnostic Contrastive Decoding (SEASON), a training-free method that adaptively enhances temporal and spatial faithfulness for each output token. It achieves this by dynamically diagnosing each token's hallucination tendency and applying adaptive contrastive decoding against its corresponding temporal and spatial negatives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEASON outperforms all existing training-free hallucination mitigation approaches on three hallucination examination benchmarks, while further improves VideoLLMs across four general video understanding benchmarks.

We present Live Avatar, an algorithm-system co-designed framework that enables efficient, high-fidelity, and infinite-length avatar generation using a 14-billion-parameter diffusion model. Our approach introduces Timestep-forcing Pipeline Parallelism (TPP), a distributed inference paradigm that pipelines denoising steps across multiple GPUs, effectively breaking the autoregressive bottleneck and ensuring stable, low-latency real-time streaming. To further enhance temporal consistency and mitigate identity drift and color artifacts, we propose the Rolling Sink Frame Mechanism (RSFM), which maintains sequence fidelity by dynamically recalibrating appearance using a cached reference image.

Existing methods distill few-step video diffusion models with sliding window attention, using initial frames as sink tokens to maintain attention performance and reduce error accumulation. However, video frames become overly dependent on these static tokens, resulting in copied initial frames and diminished motion dynamics. To address this, we introduce Reward Forcing, a novel framework with two key designs. First, we propose EMA-Sink, which maintains fixed-size tokens initialized from initial frames and continuously updated by fusing evicted tokens via exponential moving average as they exit the sliding window. Without additional computation cost, EMA-Sink tokens capture both long-term context and recent dynamics, preventing initial frame copying while maintaining long-horizon consistency. Second, to better distill motion dynamics from teacher models, we propose a novel Rewarded Distribution Matching Distillation (Re-DMD). Vanilla distribution matching treats every training sample equally, limiting the model's ability to prioritize dynamic content. Instead, Re-DMD biases the model's output distribution toward high-reward regions by prioritizing samples with greater dynamics rated by a vision-language model. Re-DMD significantly enhances motion quality while preserving data fidelity.

Most existing ASSR approaches rely on implicit neural representation (INR), but its regression-driven feature extraction and aggregation intrinsically limit the ability to synthesize fine details, leading to low realism. Recent diffusion-based realistic image super-resolution (Real-ISR) models leverage powerful pre-trained diffusion priors and show impressive results at the 4x setting. We observe that they can also achieve ASSR because the diffusion prior implicitly adapts to scale by encouraging high-realism generation. However, without explicit scale control, the diffusion process cannot be properly adjusted for different magnification levels, resulting in excessive hallucination or blurry outputs, especially under ultra-high scales. To address these issues, we propose OmniScaleSR, a diffusion-based realistic arbitrary-scale SR framework designed to achieve both high fidelity and high realism. We introduce explicit, diffusion-native scale control mechanisms that work synergistically with implicit scale adaptation, enabling scale-aware and content-aware modulation of the diffusion process. In addition, we incorporate multi-domain fidelity enhancement designs to further improve reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments on bicubic degradation benchmarks and real-world datasets show that OmniScaleSR surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both fidelity and perceptual realism, with particularly strong performance at large magnification factors.

We propose a complete ecosystem to address these twin challenges. First, we introduce Multilevel Insight Network for Disentanglement(MIND), a novel hierarchical visual encoder that introduces a Status Judgment module to algorithmically suppress ambiguous lip features based on their temporal feature variance, achieving explicit visual disentanglement. Second, we construct ConvoInsight-DB, a new large-scale dataset with expert annotations for micro-expressions and deep psychological inference. Third, Third, we designed the Mental Reasoning Insight Rating Metric (PRISM), an automated dimensional framework that uses expert-guided LLM to measure the multidimensional performance of large mental vision models.

We propose E3AD, an emotion-aware VLA framework that augments semantic understanding with two cognitively inspired components: a continuous Valenc-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) emotion model that captures tone and urgency from language, and a dual-pathway spatial reasoning module that fuses egocentric and allocentric views for human-like spatial cognition. A consistency-oriented training scheme, combining modality pretraining with preference-based alignment, further enforces coherence between emotional intent and driving actions. Across real-world datasets, E3AD improves visual grounding and waypoint planning and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) VAD correlation for emotion estimation.

While many existing approaches rely on semantic segmentation to guide depth completion, they often overlook the benefits of object-level understanding. In this work, we introduce an instance-aware depth completion framework that explicitly integrates binary instance masks as spatial priors to refine depth predictions. Our model combines four main components: a frozen YOLO V11 instance segmentation branch, a U-Net-based depth completion backbone, a cross-attention fusion module, and an attention-guided prediction head. The instance segmentation branch generates per-image foreground masks that guide the depth branch via cross-attention, allowing the network to focus on object-centric regions during refinement. We validate our method on the Virtual KITTI 2 dataset, showing that it achieves lower RMSE compared to both a U-Net-only baseline and previous semantic-guided methods, while maintaining competitive MAE. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively enhances depth accuracy near object boundaries, occlusions, and thin structures. Our findings suggest that incorporating instance-aware cues offers a promising direction for improving depth completion without relying on dense semantic labels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9e\u4f8b\u611f\u77e5\u6df1\u5ea6\u8865\u5168\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u4f18\u5316\u6df1\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728Virtual KITTI 2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u8fb9\u754c\u533a\u57df\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u8865\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u7269\u4f53\u7ea7\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u6574\u5408\u5b9e\u4f8b\u63a9\u7801\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5ea6\u8865\u5168\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u6a21\u578b\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684YOLO V11\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u5206\u652f\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eU-Net\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u8865\u5168\u4e3b\u5e72\u3001\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5934\u3002\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u5206\u652f\u751f\u6210\u524d\u666f\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f15\u5bfc\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u533a\u57df\u7684\u7ec6\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728Virtual KITTI 2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728RMSE\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528U-Net\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684MAE\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u5747\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u8fb9\u754c\u7b49\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u4f8b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u8865\u5168\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u8fb9\u754c\u3001\u906e\u6321\u548c\u8584\u7ed3\u6784\u533a\u57df\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bc6\u96c6\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u8865\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

This paper investigates the root causes of exposure bias in Flow Matching, including: (1) the model lacks generalization to biased inputs during training, and (2) insufficient low-frequency content captured during early denoising, leading to accumulated bias. Based on these insights, we propose ReflexFlow, a simple and effective reflexive refinement of the Flow Matching learning objective that dynamically corrects exposure bias. ReflexFlow consists of two components: (1) Anti-Drift Rectification (ADR), which reflexively adjusts prediction targets for biased inputs utilizing a redesigned loss under training-time scheduled sampling; and (2) Frequency Compensation (FC), which reflects on missing low-frequency components and compensates them by reweighting the loss using exposure bias. ReflexFlow is model-agnostic, compatible with all Flow Matching frameworks, and improves generation quality across datasets.

Supervised training approaches struggle with this task due to the lack of large-scale datasets capturing visual consistency and the complexity of modeling human perceptual preferences. In this paper, we argue that reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by enabling models to learn complex and subjective visual criteria in a data-free manner. To achieve this, we introduce PaCo-RL, a comprehensive framework that combines a specialized consistency reward model with an efficient RL algorithm. The first component, PaCo-Reward, is a pairwise consistency evaluator trained on a large-scale dataset constructed via automated sub-figure pairing. It evaluates consistency through a generative, autoregressive scoring mechanism enhanced by task-aware instructions and CoT reasons. The second component, PaCo-GRPO, leverages a novel resolution-decoupled optimization strategy to substantially reduce RL cost, alongside a log-tamed multi-reward aggregation mechanism that ensures balanced and stable reward optimization. Extensive experiments across the two representative subtasks show that PaCo-Reward significantly improves alignment with human perceptions of visual consistency, and PaCo-GRPO achieves state-of-the-art consistency performance with improved training efficiency and stability.

However, existing native approaches are constrained by the absence of a powerful and versatile latent representation, which severely limits the fidelity and generality of their generated textures. We identify this representation gap as the principal barrier to further progress. We introduce LaFiTe, a framework that addresses this challenge by learning to generate textures as a 3D generative sparse latent color field. At its core, LaFiTe employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode complex surface appearance into a sparse, structured latent space, which is subsequently decoded into a continuous color field. This representation achieves unprecedented fidelity, exceeding state-of-the-art methods by >10 dB PSNR in reconstruction, by effectively disentangling texture appearance from mesh topology and UV parameterization.

Conventional deep learning approaches require large annotated datasets, which are costly and often imbalanced across disease categories, limiting their reliability in practice. Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses this challenge by enabling models to generalize from only a few labeled samples per class. In this study,we propose a balanced few-shot episodic learning framework tailored to the Retinal Fundus Multi-Disease Image Dataset (RFMiD). Focusing on the ten most represented classes, which still show substantial imbalance between majority diseases (e.g., Diabetic Retinopathy, Macular Hole) and minority ones (e.g., Optic Disc Edema, Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion), our method integrates three key components: (i) balanced episodic sampling, ensuring equal participation of all classes in each 5-way 5-shot episode; (ii) targeted augmentation, including Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and color/geometry transformations, to improve minority-class di- versity; and (iii) a ResNet-50 encoder pretrained on ImageNet, selected for its superior ability to capture fine-grained retinal features. Prototypes are computed in the embedding space and classification is performed with cosine similarity for improved stability. Trained on 100 episodes and evaluated on 1,000 test episodes, our framework achieves substantial accuracy gains and reduces bias toward majority classes, with notable improvements for underrepresented diseases.

We systematically analyze existing reflection removal data sources for diversity, scalability, and photorealism.

Efficient LoRA-based adaptation of the foundation model, combined with the proposed synthetic data, achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks.

However, existing methods struggle with accurately modeling in-the-wild scenes affected by transient objects and illuminations, leading to artifacts in the rendered images. We identify that the Gaussian densification process, while enhancing scene detail capture, unintentionally contributes to these artifacts by growing additional Gaussians that model transient disturbances and illumination variations. To address this, we propose RobustSplat++, a robust solution based on several critical designs. First, we introduce a delayed Gaussian growth strategy that prioritizes optimizing static scene structure before allowing Gaussian splitting/cloning, mitigating overfitting to transient objects in early optimization.

We introduce Spatial Aesthetics, a paradigm that assesses the aesthetic quality of interior images along four dimensions: layout, harmony, lighting, and distortion. We construct SA-BENCH, the first benchmark for spatial aesthetics, comprising 18,000 images and 50,000 precise annotations. Employing SA-BENCH, we systematically evaluate current IQA methodologies and develop SA-IQA, through MLLM fine-tuning and a multidimensional fusion approach, as a comprehensive reward framework for assessing spatial aesthetics. We apply SA-IQA to two downstream tasks: (1) serving as a reward signal integrated with GRPO reinforcement learning to optimize the AIGC generation pipeline, and (2) Best-of-N selection to filter high-quality images and improve generation quality.

It has demonstrated strong generative capabilities and attracted significant attention as a simulation-free flow-based framework capable of learning exact data densities. Motivated by these advances, we propose LatentFM, a flow-based model operating in the latent space for medical image segmentation. To model the data distribution, we first design two variational autoencoders (VAEs) to encode both medical images and their corresponding masks into a lower-dimensional latent space. We then estimate a conditional velocity field that guides the flow based on the input image. By sampling multiple latent representations, our method synthesizes diverse segmentation outputs whose pixel-wise variance reliably captures the underlying data distribution, enabling both highly accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions. Furthermore, we generate confidence maps that quantify the model certainty, providing clinicians with richer information for deeper analysis. We conduct experiments on two datasets, ISIC-2018 and CVC-Clinic, and compare our method with several prior baselines, including both deterministic and generative approach models.

However, existing approaches remain limited, either treating the model merely as a standalone generator or relying on abstract textual planning. To this end, we propose Draft-as-CoT (DraCo), a novel interleaved reasoning paradigm that fully leverages both textual and visual contents in CoT for better planning and verification. Our method first generates a low-resolution draft image as preview, providing more concrete and structural visual planning and guidance. Then, we employ the model's inherent understanding capability to verify potential semantic misalignments between the draft and input prompt, and performs refinement through selective corrections with super-resolution.

Although \"generalizable\" is the ultimate target once and for all, with limited training forgeries and domains, it appears idealistic to expect generalization that covers entirely unseen variations, especially given the diversity of real-world deepfakes. Therefore, introducing large-scale multi-domain data for training can be feasible and important for real-world applications. However, within such a multi-domain scenario, the differences between multiple domains, rather than the subtle real/fake distinctions, dominate the feature space. As a result, despite detectors being able to relatively separate real and fake within each domain (i.e., high AUC), they struggle with single-image real/fake judgments in domain-unspecified conditions (i.e., low ACC). In this paper, we first define a new research paradigm named Multi-In-Domain Face Forgery Detection (MID-FFD), which includes sufficient volumes of real-fake domains for training. Then, the detector should provide definitive real-fake judgments to the domain-unspecified inputs, which simulate the frame-by-frame independent detection scenario in the real world. Meanwhile, to address the domain-dominant issue, we propose a model-agnostic framework termed DevDet (Developer for Detector) to amplify real/fake differences and make them dominant in the feature space. DevDet consists of a Face Forgery Developer (FFDev) and a Dose-Adaptive detector Fine-Tuning strategy (DAFT).

However, existing AR image generation suffers from severe memory bottlenecks due to the need to cache all previously generated visual tokens during decoding, leading to both high storage requirements and low throughput. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{LineAR}, a novel, training-free progressive key-value (KV) cache compression pipeline for autoregressive image generation. By fully exploiting the intrinsic characteristics of visual attention, LineAR manages the cache at the line level using a 2D view, preserving the visual dependency regions while progressively evicting less-informative tokens that are harmless for subsequent line generation, guided by inter-line attention. LineAR enables efficient autoregressive (AR) image generation by utilizing only a few lines of cache, achieving both memory savings and throughput speedup, while maintaining or even improving generation quality. Extensive experiments across six autoregressive image generation models, including class-conditional and text-to-image generation, validate its effectiveness and generality. LineAR improves ImageNet FID from 2.77 to 2.68 and COCO FID from 23.85 to 22.86 on LlamaGen-XL and Janus-Pro-1B, while retaining only 1/6 KV cache.

While video-based estimation approaches have become increasingly accurate, they often fail in common scenarios involving self-contact, such as a hand touching the face. In contrast, wearable bioimpedance sensing can cheaply and unobtrusively measure ground-truth skin-to-skin contact. Consequently, we propose a novel framework that combines visual pose estimators with bioimpedance sensing to capture the 3D pose of people by taking self-contact into account. Our method, BioTUCH, initializes the pose using an off-the-shelf estimator and introduces contact-aware pose optimization during measured self-contact: reprojection error and deviations from the input estimate are minimized while enforcing vertex proximity constraints. We validate our approach using a new dataset of synchronized RGB video, bioimpedance measurements, and 3D motion capture. Testing with three input pose estimators, we demonstrate an average of 11.7% improvement in reconstruction accuracy. We also present a miniature wearable bioimpedance sensor that enables efficient large-scale collection of contact-aware training data for improving pose estimation and generation using BioTUCH.

While recent promptable detection frameworks have achieved remarkable accuracy in target localization, existing methods typically rely on manual annotations as prompts, which are labor-intensive and impractical for clinical applications. To address this limitation, we propose SP-Det, a novel self-prompted detection framework that automatically generates rich textual context to guide multi-label lesion detection without requiring expert annotations. Specifically, we introduce an expert-free dual-text prompt generator (DTPG) that leverages two complementary textual modalities: semantic context prompts that capture global pathological patterns and disease beacon prompts that focus on disease-specific manifestations. Moreover, we devise a bidirectional feature enhancer (BFE) that synergistically integrates comprehensive diagnostic context with disease-specific embeddings to significantly improve feature representation and detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on two chest X-ray datasets with diverse thoracic disease categories demonstrate that our SP-Det framework outperforms state-of-the-art detection methods while completely eliminating the dependency on expert-annotated prompts compared to existing promptable architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "SP-Det\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u63d0\u793a\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u80f8\u90e8X\u5c04\u7ebf\u75c5\u53d8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u75c5\u53d8\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\u548c\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u81ea\u63d0\u793a\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "SP-Det\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u4e13\u5bb6\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u53cc\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08DTPG\uff09\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u5668\uff08BFE\uff09\u3002DTPG\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u75be\u75c5\u4fe1\u6807\u63d0\u793a\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u793a\uff1bBFE\u5219\u6574\u5408\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0e\u75be\u75c5\u7279\u5b9a\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u591a\u79cd\u80f8\u90e8\u75be\u75c5\u7684X\u5c04\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSP-Det\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5b8c\u5168\u65e0\u9700\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "SP-Det\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u75c5\u53d8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Downsampling high-resolution imagery to standard detector input sizes causes small target features to collapse below detectable thresholds. Yet processing native 1080p frames on resource-constrained platforms yields insufficient throughput for smooth gimbal control. We propose SDG-Track, a Sparse Detection-Guided Tracker that adopts an Observer-Follower architecture to reconcile this conflict. The Observer stream runs a high-capacity detector at low frequency on the GPU to provide accurate position anchors from 1920x1080 frames. The Follower stream performs high-frequency trajectory interpolation via ROI-constrained sparse optical flow on the CPU. To handle tracking failures from occlusion or model drift caused by spectrally similar distractors, we introduce Dual-Space Recovery, a training-free re-acquisition mechanism combining color histogram matching with geometric consistency constraints. Experiments on a ground-to-air tracking station demonstrate that SDG-Track achieves 35.1 FPS system throughput while retaining 97.2\\% of the frame-by-frame detection precision.

It is utilized in numerous domains. Nonetheless, object detection continues to encounter the issue of catastrophic forgetting. The model must be retrained whenever new products are introduced, utilizing not only the new products dataset but also the entirety of the previous dataset. The outcome is obvious: increasing model training expenses and significant time consumption. In numerous sectors, particularly retail checkout, the frequent introduction of new products presents a great challenge. This study introduces You Only Train Once (YOTO), a methodology designed to address the issue of catastrophic forgetting by integrating YOLO11n for object localization with DeIT and Proxy Anchor Loss for feature extraction and metric learning. For classification, we utilize cosine similarity between the embedding features of the target product and those in the Qdrant vector database. In a case study conducted in a retail store with 140 products, the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves encouraging accuracy, whether for detecting new or existing products. Furthermore, without retraining, the training duration difference is significant. We achieve almost 3 times the training time efficiency compared to classical object detection approaches. This efficiency escalates as additional new products are added to the product database. The average inference time is 580 ms per image containing multiple products, on an edge device, validating the proposed framework's feasibility for practical use.", "AI": {"tldr": "YOTO\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7ed3\u5408YOLO11n\u3001DeIT\u548c\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u96f6\u552e\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u96f6\u552e\u7ed3\u8d26\u7b49\u9891\u7e41\u65b0\u589e\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6574\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6210\u672c\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "method": "YOTO\u6846\u67b6\u6574\u5408\u4e86YOLO11n\u7528\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0cDeIT\u548cProxy Anchor Loss\u7528\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u5219\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u4ea7\u54c1\u4e0eQdrant\u5411\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728140\u79cd\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u96f6\u552e\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0cYOTO\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u65b0\u65e7\u4ea7\u54c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u662f\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8fd13\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u4ea7\u54c1\u589e\u52a0\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5355\u5f20\u591a\u4ea7\u54c1\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a580\u6beb\u79d2\uff08\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684YOTO\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408YOLO11n\u3001DeIT\u548cProxy Anchor Loss\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u96f6\u552e\u7ed3\u8d26\u7b49\u9891\u7e41\u66f4\u65b0\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

We aim to enable automatic adaptive prescription of 2D diagnostic MRI slices with 6-DoF head pose estimation, supported by 3D MRI volumes rapidly acquired before each 2D slice. Existing methods struggle to generalize to clinical volumes, due to pose ambiguities induced by inherent anatomical symmetries, as well as low resolution, noise, and artifacts.

This indicates the preceding semantics potentially benefit texture generation by providing a semantic anchor. Recent advances have integrated semantic priors from pretrained visual encoders to further enhance LDMs, yet they still denoise semantic and VAE-encoded texture synchronously, neglecting such ordering. Observing these, we propose Semantic-First Diffusion (SFD), a latent diffusion paradigm that explicitly prioritizes semantic formation. SFD first constructs composite latents by combining a compact semantic latent, which is extracted from a pretrained visual encoder via a dedicated Semantic VAE, with the texture latent. The core of SFD is to denoise the semantic and texture latents asynchronously using separate noise schedules: semantics precede textures by a temporal offset, providing clearer high-level guidance for texture refinement and enabling natural coarse-to-fine generation. On ImageNet 256x256 with guidance, SFD achieves FID 1.06 (LightningDiT-XL) and FID 1.04 (1.0B LightningDiT-XXL), while achieving up to 100x faster convergence than the original DiT. SFD also improves existing methods like ReDi and VA-VAE, demonstrating the effectiveness of asynchronous, semantics-led modeling.

They promise to contain a wealth of previously unseen Greek and Latin texts, but are extremely fragile and thus most cannot be unrolled physically. A solution to access these texts is virtual unrolling, where the papyrus surface is digitally traced out in a CT scan of the scroll, to create a flattened representation. This tracing is very laborious to do manually in gigavoxel-sized scans, so automated approaches are desirable. We present the first top-down method that automatically fits a surface model to a CT scan of a severely damaged scroll. We take a novel approach that globally fits an explicit parametric model of the deformed scroll to existing neural network predictions of where the rolled papyrus likely passes. Our method guarantees the resulting surface is a single continuous 2D sheet, even passing through regions where the surface is not detectable in the CT scan. We conduct comprehensive experiments on high-resolution CT scans of two scrolls, showing that our approach successfully unrolls large regions, and exceeds the performance of the only existing automated unrolling method suitable for this data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u62df\u5408\u8868\u9762\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u4e25\u91cd\u635f\u574f\u5377\u8f74CT\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u62df\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u865a\u62df\u5c55\u5f00\u5927\u9762\u79ef\u533a\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8d6b\u5e93\u5170\u5c3c\u59c6\u7eb8\u838e\u8349\u5377\u56e0\u6781\u5ea6\u8106\u5f31\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7269\u7406\u5c55\u5f00\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u865a\u62df\u5c55\u5f00\u6280\u672f\u8bbf\u95ee\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73cd\u8d35\u6587\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u62df\u5408\u663e\u5f0f\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5377\u8f74\u53ef\u80fd\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8868\u9762\u662f\u5355\u4e00\u8fde\u7eed\u76842D\u7247\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728CT\u626b\u63cf\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u8868\u9762\u7684\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u5377\u8f74\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387CT\u626b\u63cf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u5f00\u4e86\u5927\u9762\u79ef\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5c55\u5f00\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u62df\u5408\u8868\u9762\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u4e25\u91cd\u635f\u574f\u5377\u8f74CT\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u9996\u4e2a\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u5f00\u4e86\u5927\u9762\u79ef\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5c55\u5f00\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, it is time-consuming and memory-intensive for long sequences, limiting application to large-scale scenes beyond hundreds of images. To address this, we propose LiteVGGT, achieving up to 10x speedup and substantial memory reduction, enabling efficient processing of 1000-image scenes. We derive two key insights for 3D reconstruction: (1) tokens from local image regions have inherent geometric correlations, leading to high similarity and computational redundancy; (2) token similarity across adjacent network layers remains stable, allowing for reusable merge decisions. Guided by these, we design a simple yet efficient strategy, dubbed geometry-aware cached token merging. We analyze each token's geometric importance, optimizing anchor token selection to better preserve key information for reconstruction. We also cache and reuse merge indices across layers, substantially reducing latency with minimal accuracy impact. This strategy retains VGGT's core performance, enabling efficient fine-tuning and FP8 quantization for further gains. Extensive experiments validate LiteVGGT's effectiveness, scalability, and robustness.

While most existing methods primarily leverage features from the final layer, we systematically analyze the contributions of layer-wise features to this task. Our study reveals that earlier layers provide more localized and generalizable features, often surpassing the performance of final-layer features in detection tasks. Moreover, we find that different layers capture distinct aspects of the data, each contributing uniquely to AI-generated image detection. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a novel adaptive method, termed MoLD, which dynamically integrates features from multiple ViT layers using a gating-based mechanism. Extensive experiments on both GAN- and diffusion-generated images demonstrate that MoLD significantly improves detection performance, enhances generalization across diverse generative models, and exhibits robustness in real-world scenarios. Finally, we illustrate the scalability and versatility of our approach by successfully applying it to other pre-trained ViTs, such as DINOv2.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoLD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u6574\u5408\u591a\u5c42\u7ea7ViT\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5229\u7528\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5177\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u7ea7\u6355\u83b7\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5bf9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMoLD\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u95e8\u63a7\u7684\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u6574\u5408\u6765\u81ea\u591a\u4e2aViT\u5c42\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728GAN\u548c\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMoLD\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u8de8\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MoLD\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6574\u5408\u591a\u5c42\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3ViT\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982DINOv2\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper, we show that LVLM-based models produce markedly more socially biased images than non-LVLM-based models. We introduce a 1,024 prompt benchmark spanning four levels of linguistic complexity and evaluate demographic bias across multiple attributes in a systematic manner. Our analysis identifies system prompts, the predefined instructions guiding LVLMs, as a primary driver of biased behavior. Through decoded intermediate representations, token-probability diagnostics, and embedding-association analyses, we reveal how system prompts encode demographic priors that propagate into image synthesis. To this end, we propose FairPro, a training-free meta-prompting framework that enables LVLMs to self-audit and construct fairness-aware system prompts at test time. Experiments on two LVLM-based T2I models, SANA and Qwen-Image, show that FairPro substantially reduces demographic bias while preserving text-image alignment.

VANICP is a recently published acceleration framework that significantly improves the computational efficiency of point-cloud-based applications. By transforming the global nearest neighbor search into a localized process through a dilation-based information propagation mechanism, VANICP greatly reduces the computational complexity of the NNS. However, its original implementation demands a considerable amount of memory, which restricts its deployment in resource-constrained environments such as embedded systems. To address this issue, we propose a GPU-oriented dynamic memory assignment strategy that optimizes the memory usage of the dilation operation. Furthermore, based on this strategy, we construct an enhanced version of the VANICP framework that achieves over 97% reduction in memory consumption while preserving the original performance.

Conventional depth sensors have difficulty in sensing the depth of transparent objects due to refraction and reflection of light. Previous research has typically train a neural network to complete the depth acquired by the sensor, and this method can quickly and accurately acquire accurate depth maps of transparent objects. However, previous training relies on a large amount of annotation data for supervision, and the labeling of depth maps is costly.

Existing perceptual codecs primarily rely on pre-trained image generative priors to restore high-frequency details, but their frame-wise nature lacks temporal modeling and inevitably leads to perceptual flickering. To address this, GNVC-VD introduces a unified flow-matching latent refinement module that leverages a video diffusion transformer to jointly enhance intra- and inter-frame latents through sequence-level denoising, ensuring consistent spatio-temporal details. Instead of denoising from pure Gaussian noise as in video generation, GNVC-VD initializes refinement from decoded spatio-temporal latents and learns a correction term that adapts the diffusion prior to compression-induced degradation. A conditioning adaptor further injects compression-aware cues into intermediate DiT layers, enabling effective artifact removal while maintaining temporal coherence under extreme bitrate constraints. Extensive experiments show that GNVC-VD surpasses both traditional and learned codecs in perceptual quality and significantly reduces the flickering artifacts that persist in prior generative approaches, even below 0.01 bpp, highlighting the promise of integrating video-native generative priors into neural codecs for next-generation perceptual video compression.", "AI": {"tldr": "GNVC-VD\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eDiT\u7684\u751f\u6210\u795e\u7ecf\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u65f6\u7a7a\u6f5c\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u751f\u6210\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u95ea\u70c1\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u6765\u6062\u590d\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5e27\u7ea7\u7279\u6027\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u5730\u5bfc\u81f4\u611f\u77e5\u95ea\u70c1\u3002", "method": "GNVC-VD\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6f5c\u5728\u7ec6\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u53bb\u566a\u8054\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u5e27\u5185\u548c\u5e27\u95f4\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "GNVC-VD\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u95ea\u70c1\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\uff08<0.01 bpp\uff09\u4e0b\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "GNVC-VD\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u9891\u539f\u751f\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u5230\u795e\u7ecf\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u95ea\u70c1\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u611f\u77e5\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To overcome these limitations we introduce RAMEN, a resolution-adjustable multimodal encoder that learns a shared visual representation across EO data in a fully sensor-agnostic manner. RAMEN treats the modality and spatial and temporal resolutions as key input data features, enabling coherent analysis across modalities within a unified latent space.

Though there are recent lot of advances in deep generative models, existing methods face problems with large irregular masks, often producing blurry textures on the edges of the masked region, semantic inconsistencies, or unconvincing facial structures due to direct pixel level synthesis approach and limited exploitation of facial priors. In this paper we propose a novel architecture, which address these above challenges through semantic-guided hierarchical synthesis. Our approach starts with a method that organizes and synthesizes information based on meaning, followed by refining the texture. This process gives clear insights into the facial structure before we move on to creating detailed images. In the first stage, we blend two techniques: one that focuses on local features with CNNs and global features with Vision Transformers. This helped us create clear and detailed semantic layouts. In the second stage, we use a Multi-Modal Texture Generator to refine these layouts by pulling in information from different scales, ensuring everything looks cohesive and consistent.

Most existing generate-then-reconstruct and reconstruct-then-generate methods decouple geometry from motion, causing spatiotemporal inconsistencies and poor generalization. To address these, we extend the reconstruct-then-generate framework to jointly perform Motion generation and geometric Reconstruction for 4D Synthesis (MoRe4D). We first introduce TrajScene-60K, a large-scale dataset of 60,000 video samples with dense point trajectories, addressing the scarcity of high-quality 4D scene data. Based on this, we propose a diffusion-based 4D Scene Trajectory Generator (4D-STraG) to jointly generate geometrically consistent and motion-plausible 4D point trajectories. To leverage single-view priors, we design a depth-guided motion normalization strategy and a motion-aware module for effective geometry and dynamics integration. We then propose a 4D View Synthesis Module (4D-ViSM) to render videos with arbitrary camera trajectories from 4D point track representations. Experiments show that MoRe4D generates high-quality 4D scenes with multi-view consistency and rich dynamic details from a single image.

However, existing approaches to 4D semantic field construction primarily rely on scene-specific Gaussian splatting, which requires per-scene optimization, exhibits limited generalization, and is difficult to scale to real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose 4DLangVGGT, the first Transformer-based feed-forward unified framework for 4D language grounding, that jointly integrates geometric perception and language alignment within a single architecture. 4DLangVGGT has two key components: the 4D Visual Geometry Transformer, StreamVGGT, which captures spatio-temporal geometric representations of dynamic scenes; and the Semantic Bridging Decoder (SBD), which projects geometry-aware features into a language-aligned semantic space, thereby enhancing semantic interpretability while preserving structural fidelity. Unlike prior methods that depend on costly per-scene optimization, 4DLangVGGT can be jointly trained across multiple dynamic scenes and directly applied during inference, achieving both deployment efficiency and strong generalization. This design significantly improves the practicality of large-scale deployment and establishes a new paradigm for open-vocabulary 4D scene understanding. Experiments on HyperNeRF and Neu3D datasets demonstrate that our approach not only generalizes effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving up to 2% gains under per-scene training and 1% improvements under multi-scene training.

We find that naively applying StreamingLLM-style attention sinks to video diffusion leads to fidelity degradation and motion stagnation. To overcome this, we introduce Deep Forcing, which consists of two training-free mechanisms that address this without any fine-tuning. Specifically, 1) Deep Sink dedicates half of the sliding window to persistent sink tokens and re-aligns their temporal RoPE phase to the current timeline, stabilizing global context during long rollouts. 2) Participative Compression performs importance-aware KV cache pruning that preserves only tokens actively participating in recent attention while safely discarding redundant and degraded history, minimizing error accumulation under out-of-distribution length generation.

However, most existing approaches typically lack explicit frequency modeling and rely on fixed or heuristic optimization schedules, which limit the generalization across heterogeneous degradation. To address these limitations, we propose EvoIR, an AiOIR-specific framework that introduces evolutionary frequency modulation for dynamic and adaptive image restoration. Specifically, EvoIR employs the Frequency-Modulated Module (FMM) that decomposes features into high- and low-frequency branches in an explicit manner and adaptively modulates them to enhance both structural fidelity and fine-grained details. Central to EvoIR, an Evolutionary Optimization Strategy (EOS) iteratively adjusts frequency-aware objectives through a population-based evolutionary process, dynamically balancing structural accuracy and perceptual fidelity. Its evolutionary guidance further mitigates gradient conflicts across degradation and accelerates convergence. By synergizing FMM and EOS, EvoIR yields greater improvements than using either component alone, underscoring their complementary roles.

Project page: https://chien90190.github.io/splannequin/", "summary": "Synthesizing high-fidelity frozen 3D scenes from monocular Mannequin-Challenge (MC) videos is a unique problem distinct from standard dynamic scene reconstruction. Instead of focusing on modeling motion, our goal is to create a frozen scene while strategically preserving subtle dynamics to enable user-controlled instant selection. To achieve this, we introduce a novel application of dynamic Gaussian splatting: the scene is modeled dynamically, which retains nearby temporal variation, and a static scene is rendered by fixing the model's time parameter. However, under this usage, monocular capture with sparse temporal supervision introduces artifacts like ghosting and blur for Gaussians that become unobserved or occluded at weakly supervised timestamps. We propose Splannequin, an architecture-agnostic regularization that detects two states of Gaussian primitives, hidden and defective, and applies temporal anchoring. Under predominantly forward camera motion, hidden states are anchored to their recent well-observed past states, while defective states are anchored to future states with stronger supervision. Our method integrates into existing dynamic Gaussian pipelines via simple loss terms, requires no architectural changes, and adds zero inference overhead. This results in markedly improved visual quality, enabling high-fidelity, user-selectable frozen-time renderings, validated by a 96% user preference.

Moving beyond relighting, a key step toward generative modeling of real-world scenes is the joint control of camera trajectory and illumination, since visual dynamics are inherently shaped by both geometry and lighting. To this end, we present Light-X, a video generation framework that enables controllable rendering from monocular videos with both viewpoint and illumination control. 1) We propose a disentangled design that decouples geometry and lighting signals: geometry and motion are captured via dynamic point clouds projected along user-defined camera trajectories, while illumination cues are provided by a relit frame consistently projected into the same geometry. These explicit, fine-grained cues enable effective disentanglement and guide high-quality illumination. 2) To address the lack of paired multi-view and multi-illumination videos, we introduce Light-Syn, a degradation-based pipeline with inverse-mapping that synthesizes training pairs from in-the-wild monocular footage. This strategy yields a dataset covering static, dynamic, and AI-generated scenes, ensuring robust training. Extensive experiments show that Light-X outperforms baseline methods in joint camera-illumination control and surpasses prior video relighting methods under both text- and background-conditioned settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Light-X \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5149\u7167\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u5149\u7167\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u5149\u7167\u7684\u8054\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5149\u7167\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u89e3\u8026\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5c06\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5149\u7167\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u79bb\uff1a\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u70b9\u4e91\u6355\u6349\uff0c\u5149\u7167\u4fe1\u53f7\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u5149\u7167\u7684\u5e27\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86 Light-Syn \u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u591a\u5149\u7167\u89c6\u9891\u914d\u5bf9\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLight-X \u5728\u8054\u5408\u76f8\u673a-\u5149\u7167\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6587\u672c\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u65b0\u5149\u7167\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Light-X \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u5149\u7167\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5149\u7167\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}
