However, supporting nested virtualization significantly increases host hypervisor complexity and introduces a new attack surface in cloud platforms. While many prior studies have explored hypervisor fuzzing, none has explicitly addressed nested virtualization due to the challenge of generating effective virtual machine (VM) instances with a vast state space as fuzzing inputs.\n  We present NecoFuzz, the first fuzzing framework that systematically targets nested virtualization-specific logic in hypervisors. NecoFuzz synthesizes executable fuzz-harness VMs with internal states near the boundary between valid and invalid, guided by an approximate model of hardware-assisted virtualization specifications. Since vulnerabilities in nested virtualization often stem from incorrect handling of unexpected VM states, this specification-guided, boundary-oriented generation significantly improves coverage of security-critical code across different hypervisors.\n  We implemented NecoFuzz on Intel VT-x and AMD-V by extending AFL++ to support fuzz-harness VMs. NecoFuzz achieved 84.7% and 74.2% code coverage for nested virtualization-specific code on Intel VT-x and AMD-V, respectively, and uncovered six previously unknown vulnerabilities across three hypervisors, including two assigned CVEs.", "AI": {"tldr": "NecoFuzz\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u5d4c\u5957\u865a\u62df\u5316\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u8fb9\u754c\u72b6\u6001VM\u63d0\u9ad8\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u4e2a\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5d4c\u5957\u865a\u62df\u5316\u5728\u4e91\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u7ba1\u7406\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u9762\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9488\u5bf9\u5176\u7279\u5b9a\u903b\u8f91\u3002", "method": "NecoFuzz\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u63a5\u8fd1\u6709\u6548\u548c\u65e0\u6548\u72b6\u6001\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u865a\u62df\u673a\uff08VM\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u786c\u4ef6\u8f85\u52a9\u865a\u62df\u5316\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u9488\u5bf9\u5d4c\u5957\u865a\u62df\u5316\u7279\u5b9a\u903b\u8f91\u3002", "result": "NecoFuzz\u5728Intel VT-x\u548cAMD-V\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8684.7%\u548c74.2%\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ba1\u7406\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u516d\u4e2a\u672a\u77e5\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e24\u4e2a\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86CVE\u7f16\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "NecoFuzz\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bf9\u5d4c\u5957\u865a\u62df\u5316\u7279\u5b9a\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7ba1\u7406\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u672a\u77e5\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

While most are deployed in single node setups, CXL.mem is a technology that implements memories that can be attached to multiple nodes simultaneously, enabling shared memory pooling.

Our approach analyzes data access patterns of MPI applications: it analyzes on-node accesses to/from MPI buffers, as well as cross-node MPI traffic to gather a full understanding of the impact of memory performance. We combine this data in an extended performance model to predict which data transfers could benefit from direct CXL.mem implementations as compared to traditional MPI messages. Our model works on a per-MPI call granularity, allowing the identification and later optimizations of those MPI invocations in the code with the highest potential for speedup by using CXL.mem.\n  For our toolchain, we extend the memory trace sampling tool Mitos and use it to extract data access behavior. In the post-processing step, the raw data is automatically analyzed to provide performance models for each individual MPI call.

Previous approaches typically rely on off-the-shelf motion reconstruction techniques to obtain 3D trajectories for physics-based imitation. These reconstruction methods struggle with generalizability, as they either require 3D training data (potentially scarce) or fail to produce physically plausible poses, hindering their application to challenging scenarios like human-object interaction (HOI) or non-human characters. We tackle this challenge by introducing Mimic2DM, a novel motion imitation framework that learns the control policy directly and solely from widely available 2D keypoint trajectories extracted from videos. By minimizing the reprojection error, we train a general single-view 2D motion tracking policy capable of following arbitrary 2D reference motions in physics simulation, using only 2D motion data. The policy, when trained on diverse 2D motions captured from different or slightly different viewpoints, can further acquire 3D motion tracking capabilities by aggregating multiple views. Moreover, we develop a transformer-based autoregressive 2D motion generator and integrate it into a hierarchical control framework, where the generator produces high-quality 2D reference trajectories to guide the tracking policy. We show that the proposed approach is versatile and can effectively learn to synthesize physically plausible and diverse motions across a range of domains, including dancing, soccer dribbling, and animal movements, without any reliance on explicit 3D motion data.

Although automating scientific tasks with large language models (LLMs) has attracted attention, applying them to the complete, end-to-end CFD workflow remains a challenge due to its stringent domain-specific requirements. We introduce CFD-copilot, a domain-specialized LLM framework designed to facilitate natural language-driven CFD simulation from setup to post-processing. The framework employs a fine-tuned LLM to directly translate user descriptions into executable CFD setups. A multi-agent system integrates the LLM with simulation execution, automatic error correction, and result analysis. For post-processing, the framework utilizes the model context protocol (MCP), an open standard that decouples LLM reasoning from external tool execution. This modular design allows the LLM to interact with numerous specialized post-processing functions through a unified and scalable interface, improving the automation of data extraction and analysis. The framework was evaluated on benchmarks including the NACA~0012 airfoil and the three-element 30P-30N airfoil. The results indicate that domain-specific adaptation and the incorporation of the MCP jointly enhance the reliability and efficiency of LLM-driven engineering workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "CFD-copilot\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u7684LLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9a71\u52a8\u4ece\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5230\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7684CFD\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u548cMCP\u534f\u8bae\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u914d\u7f6eCFD\u6a21\u62df\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u969c\u788d\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u79d1\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u5df2\u5f15\u8d77\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aefCFD\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "CFD-copilot\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7684LLM\u76f4\u63a5\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7528\u6237\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684CFD\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6574\u5408LLM\u4e0e\u6a21\u62df\u6267\u884c\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u540e\u5904\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528MCP\u534f\u8bae\u89e3\u8026LLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5305\u62ecNACA~0012\u7ffc\u578b\u548c\u4e09\u5143\u7d2030P-30N\u7ffc\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548cMCP\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u5de5\u7a0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u534f\u8bae\uff08MCP\uff09\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u5171\u540c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u5de5\u7a0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

While sparsity has been well-exploited to scale solvers, a complementary and underexploited structure is \\emph{separability} -- where some variables (e.g., visual landmarks) appear linearly in the residuals and, for any estimate of the remaining variables (e.g., poses), have a closed-form solution. Variable projection (VarPro) methods are a family of techniques that exploit this structure by analytically eliminating the linear variables and presenting a reduced problem in the remaining variables that has favorable properties. However, VarPro has seen limited use in robotic perception; a major challenge arises from gauge symmetries (e.g., cost invariance to global shifts and rotations), which are common in perception and induce specific computational challenges in standard VarPro approaches. We present a VarPro scheme designed for problems with gauge symmetries that jointly exploits separability and sparsity. Our method can be applied as a one-time preprocessing step to construct a \\emph{matrix-free Schur complement operator}. This operator allows efficient evaluation of costs, gradients, and Hessian-vector products of the reduced problem and readily integrates with standard iterative NLS solvers. We provide precise conditions under which our method applies, and describe extensions when these conditions are only partially met. Across synthetic and real benchmarks in SLAM, SNL, and SfM, our approach achieves up to \\textbf{2$\\times$--35$\\times$ faster runtimes} than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining accuracy.

Network slicing offers a promising solution for spectrum optimization in UAV based systems serving heterogeneous service demands. For that, this paper proposes a hierarchical network slicing framework for UAV satellite integrated networks supporting eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC services. Specifically, we formulate a joint optimization of UAV trajectory, transmission power, and spectrum allocation as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process that ensures quality of service while minimizing energy consumption and maximizing resource fairness. To address the computational intractability and partial observability, we develop a multi agent deep reinforcement learning solution under the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm. In the proposed system, UAV agents act as distributed actors coordinated by a shared critic operating with multi head attention mechanism at a low Earth orbit satellite. Experimental results then demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods by up to 33% in cumulative reward while achieving superior energy efficiency and fairness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a-\u536b\u661f\u96c6\u6210\u7f51\u7edc\u5207\u7247\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u975e\u5730\u9762\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u74036G\u8986\u76d6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u673a\u8f7d\u7535\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u64cd\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7a7a\u4e2d\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u7f51\u7edc\u5207\u7247\u4e3a\u6ee1\u8db3\u5f02\u6784\u670d\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9891\u8c31\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u96c6\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5206\u6563\u6267\u884c\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u6279\u8bc4\u5668\u534f\u8c03\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7d2f\u79ef\u5956\u52b1\u4e0a\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u51fa33%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a-\u536b\u661f\u96c6\u6210\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u5207\u7247\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u4f20\u8f93\u529f\u7387\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002"}}

Due to the vigorous development of the internet, social media provide many different ways for the user to express their opinions and exchange information. Cyberbullying occurs on social media using text messages, comments, sharing images and GIFs or stickers, and audio and video. Much research has been done to detect cyberbullying on textual data; some are available for images. Very few studies are available to detect cyberbullying on GIFs/stickers. We collect a GIF dataset from Twitter and Applied a deep learning model to detect cyberbullying from the dataset. Firstly, we extracted hashtags related to cyberbullying using Twitter. We used these hashtags to download GIF file using publicly available API GIPHY.

This study provides a comprehensive performance analysis of Data Oriented Design (DOD) versus the traditional Object-Oriented Design (OOD), focusing on cache utilization and efficiency in multi-threaded environments. We developed and compared four distinct versions of the A* search algorithm: single-threaded OOD (ST-OOD), single-threaded DOD (ST-DOD), multi-threaded OOD (MT-OOD), and multi-threaded DOD (MT-DOD). The evaluation was based on metrics including execution time, memory usage, and CPU cache misses. In multi-threaded tests, the DOD implementation demonstrated considerable performance gains, with faster execution times and a lower number of raw system calls and cache misses. While OOD occasionally showed marginal advantages in memory usage or percentage-based cache miss rates, DOD's efficiency in data-intensive operations was more evident. Furthermore, our findings reveal that for a fine-grained task like the A* algorithm, the overhead associated with thread management led to single-threaded versions significantly outperforming their multi-threaded counterparts in both paradigms. We conclude that even when performance differences appear subtle in simple algorithms, the consistent advantages of DOD in critical metrics highlight its foundational architectural superiority, suggesting it is a more effective approach for maximizing hardware efficiency in complex, large-scale AI and parallel computing tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86DOD\u4e0eOOD\u5728A*\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0DOD\u5728\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5355\u7ebf\u7a0b\u7248\u672c\u56e0\u7ebf\u7a0b\u7ba1\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u800c\u6574\u4f53\u66f4\u4f18\u3002DOD\u5728\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u66f4\u4f73\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6838CPU\u4e0e\u4e3b\u5185\u5b58\u4e4b\u95f4\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u9700\u8981\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8303\u5f0f\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08DOD\uff09\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u9762\u5411\u5bf9\u8c61\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08OOD\uff09\u5728\u7f13\u5b58\u5229\u7528\u548c\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u73af\u5883\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86A*\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\uff1a\u5355\u7ebf\u7a0bOOD\uff08ST-OOD\uff09\u3001\u5355\u7ebf\u7a0bDOD\uff08ST-DOD\uff09\u3001\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0bOOD\uff08MT-OOD\uff09\u548c\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0bDOD\uff08MT-DOD\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u548cCPU\u7f13\u5b58\u672a\u547d\u4e2d\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDOD\u5b9e\u73b0\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u7528\u53ca\u7f13\u5b58\u672a\u547d\u4e2d\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1OOD\u5076\u5c14\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u6216\u7f13\u5b58\u672a\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u8f7b\u5fae\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46DOD\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u4e3a\u660e\u663e\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982A*\u7b97\u6cd5\uff09\uff0c\u7ebf\u7a0b\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u5f00\u9500\u5bfc\u81f4\u5355\u7ebf\u7a0b\u7248\u672c\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u4e2d\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u7248\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f97\u51fa\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u4f46DOD\u5728\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u52bf\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u5176\u57fa\u7840\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u590d\u6742\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684AI\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cDOD\u662f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Our comprehensive design and implementation of CFS successfully fulfill the objective of providing a multi-credential Common Access API. The architecture of CFS is methodically segmented into three integral components: Firstly, the DataCapsule server, tasked with the storage, dissemination, and replication of DataCapsules on the edge. Secondly, the middleware, a crucial element running in a Trusted Execution Environment responsible for the enforcement and management of write permissions and requests. Finally, the client component, which manifests as a POSIX-compliant filesystem, is adaptable and operational across many architectures. Experimental evaluations of CFS reveal that, while its read and write performances are comparatively modest, it upholds a high degree of functional correctness.

We introduce Terrain Diffusion, an AI-era successor to Perlin noise that bridges the fidelity of diffusion models with the properties that made procedural noise indispensable: seamless infinite extent, seed-consistency, and constant-time random access. At its core is InfiniteDiffusion, a novel algorithm for infinite generation, enabling seamless, real-time synthesis of boundless landscapes.

Extensive evaluations on the PaperBench benchmark demonstrate that DeepCode achieves state-of-the-art performance, decisively outperforming leading commercial agents such as Cursor and Claude Code, and crucially, surpassing PhD-level human experts from top institutes on key reproduction metrics.

Existing approaches often suffer from either the sim-to-real gap during policy transfer or a limited amount of training data with action labels. To address this problem, we introduce Vision-Language Distance (VLD) learning, a scalable framework for goal-conditioned navigation that decouples perception learning from policy learning. Instead of relying on raw sensory inputs during policy training, we first train a self-supervised distance-to-goal predictor on internet-scale video data. This predictor generalizes across both image- and text-based goals, providing a distance signal that can be minimized by a reinforcement learning (RL) policy. The RL policy can be trained entirely in simulation using privileged geometric distance signals, with injected noise to mimic the uncertainty of the trained distance predictor. At deployment, the policy consumes VLD predictions, inheriting semantic goal information-\"where to go\"-from large-scale visual training while retaining the robust low-level navigation behaviors learned in simulation. We propose using ordinal consistency to assess distance functions directly and demonstrate that VLD outperforms prior temporal distance approaches, such as ViNT and VIP.

It spans data architecture and systems, integration, quality, governance, and continuous improvement. While AI assistants can help specific persona, such as data engineers and stewards, to navigate and configure the data stack, they fall far short of full automation. However, as AI becomes increasingly capable of tackling tasks that have previously resisted automation due to inherent complexities, we believe there is an imminent opportunity to target fully autonomous data estates. Currently, AI is used in different parts of the data stack, but in this paper, we argue for a paradigm shift from the use of AI in independent data component operations towards a more holistic and autonomous handling of the entire data lifecycle. Towards that end, we explore how each stage of the modern data stack can be autonomously managed by intelligent agents to build self-sufficient systems that can be used not only by human end-users, but also by AI itself. We begin by describing the mounting forces and opportunities that demand this paradigm shift, examine how agents can streamline the data lifecycle, and highlight open questions and areas where additional research is needed.

While prior work has focused primarily on kernel-level performance or single-GPU microbenchmarks, the complex interaction between communication, computation, memory behavior, and power management in multi-GPU LLM training remains poorly characterized. In this work, we introduce Chopper, a profiling and analysis framework that collects, aligns, and visualizes GPU kernel traces and hardware performance counters across multiple granularities (i.e., from individual kernels to operations, layers, phases, iterations, and GPUs). Using Chopper, we perform a comprehensive end-to-end characterization of Llama 3 8B training under fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP) on an eight-GPU AMD InstinctTM MI300X node. Our analysis reveals several previously underexplored bottlenecks and behaviors, such as memory determinism enabling higher, more stable GPU and memory frequencies. We identify several sources of inefficiencies, with frequency overhead (DVFS effects) being the single largest contributor to the gap between theoretical and observed performance, exceeding the impact of MFMA utilization loss, communication/computation overlap, and kernel launch overheads. Overall, Chopper provides the first holistic, multi-granularity characterization of LLM training on AMD InstinctTM MI300X GPUs, yielding actionable insights for optimizing training frameworks, improving power-management strategies, and guiding future GPU architecture and system design.", "AI": {"tldr": "Chopper\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u591aGPU LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9891\u7387\u5f00\u9500\u662f\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u6700\u5927\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u73b0\u4ee3GPU\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u591aGPU LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u7535\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Chopper\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6536\u96c6\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316GPU\u5185\u6838\u8ddf\u8e2a\u53ca\u786c\u4ef6\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u6570\u5668\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4ece\u5355\u4e2a\u5185\u6838\u5230\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u5c42\u3001\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u548cGPU\u7684\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5982\u5185\u5b58\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684GPU\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u5982\u9891\u7387\u5f00\u9500\uff08DVFS\u6548\u5e94\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "Chopper\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aAMD InstinctTM MI300X GPU\u4e0a\u7684LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u6539\u8fdb\u7535\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u53ca\u6307\u5bfc\u672a\u6765GPU\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, existing viewer solutions remain fragmented, heavy, or constrained by legacy pipelines, resulting in high deployment friction and limited support for dynamic content and generative models. In this work, we present Visionary, an open, web-native platform for real-time various Gaussian Splatting and meshes rendering. Built on an efficient WebGPU renderer with per-frame ONNX inference, Visionary enables dynamic neural processing while maintaining a lightweight, \"click-to-run\" browser experience. It introduces a standardized Gaussian Generator contract, which not only supports standard 3DGS rendering but also allows plug-and-play algorithms to generate or update Gaussians each frame. Such inference also enables us to apply feedforward generative post-processing. The platform further offers a plug in three.js library with a concise TypeScript API for seamless integration into existing web applications.

Yet, the nondeterministic and run-time-defined semantics of ML complicate traditional software refactoring. We define semantic preservation in LESS as the property that optimizations of intelligent components do not alter the system's overall functional behavior. This paper introduces an empirical framework to evaluate semantic preservation in LESS by mining model evolution data from HuggingFace. We extract commit histories, $\\textit{Model Cards}$, and performance metrics from a large number of models. To establish baselines, we conducted case studies in three domains, tracing performance changes across versions. Our analysis demonstrates how $\\textit{semantic drift}$ can be detected via evaluation metrics across commits and reveals common refactoring patterns based on commit message analysis. Although API constraints limited the possibility of estimating a full-scale threshold, our pipeline offers a foundation for defining community-accepted boundaries for semantic preservation. Our contributions include: (1) a large-scale dataset of ML model evolution, curated from 1.7 million Hugging Face entries via a reproducible pipeline using the native HF hub API, (2) a practical pipeline for the evaluation of semantic preservation for a subset of 536 models and 4000+ metrics and (3) empirical case studies illustrating semantic drift in practice.

The proliferation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) introduces a new dimension to this threat, as UAVs can act as mobile, intelligent jammers capable of launching sophisticated attacks by leveraging Line-of-Sight (LoS) channels and adaptive strategies. This paper addresses a critical challenge of countering intelligent UAV jamming in the context of energy-constrained ambient backscatter communication systems. Traditional anti-jamming techniques often fall short against such dynamic threats or are unsuitable for low-power backscatter devices. Hence, we propose a novel anti-jamming framework based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) that empowers the transmitter to not only defend against but also strategically exploit the UAV's jamming signals. In particular, our approach allows the transmitter to learn an optimal policy for switching between active transmission, energy harvesting from the jamming signal, and backscattering information using the jammer's own emissions. We then formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employ a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to derive the optimal operational strategy.

Inspired by recent advances in reference-guided image editing, we explore whether rich visual attributes from source videos can be similarly leveraged to enhance both fidelity and temporal coherence in video face swapping. Building on this insight, this work presents LivingSwap, the first video reference guided face swapping model. Our approach employs keyframes as conditioning signals to inject the target identity, enabling flexible and controllable editing. By combining keyframe conditioning with video reference guidance, the model performs temporal stitching to ensure stable identity preservation and high-fidelity reconstruction across long video sequences. To address the scarcity of data for reference-guided training, we construct a paired face-swapping dataset, Face2Face, and further reverse the data pairs to ensure reliable ground-truth supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results, seamlessly integrating the target identity with the source video's expressions, lighting, and motion, while significantly reducing manual effort in production workflows.

This costs both memory and throughput bottleneck limiting their efficient deployment. Towards reducing KV cache size during inference, we first investigate the effectiveness of existing KV cache eviction methods for CoT reasoning. Interestingly, we find that due to unstable token-wise scoring and the reduced effective KV budget caused by padding tokens, state-of-the-art (SoTA) eviction methods fail to maintain accuracy in the multi-batch setting. Additionally, these methods often generate longer sequences than the original model, as semantic-unaware token-wise eviction leads to repeated revalidation during reasoning. To address these issues, we present \\textbf{SkipKV}, a \\textbf{\\textit{training-free}} KV compression method for selective \\textit{eviction} and \\textit{generation} operating at a coarse-grained sentence-level sequence removal for efficient CoT reasoning. In specific, it introduces a \\textit{sentence-scoring metric} to identify and remove highly similar sentences while maintaining semantic coherence. To suppress redundant generation, SkipKV dynamically adjusts a steering vector to update the hidden activation states during inference enforcing the LRM to generate concise response. Extensive evaluations on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SkipKV in maintaining up to $\\mathbf{26.7}\\%$ improved accuracy compared to the alternatives, at a similar compression budget.

Recent vision foundation models like VGGT take an orthogonal approach -- 3D knowledge is gained implicitly through training data and loss objectives, enabling feed-forward prediction of both camera parameters and 3D representations directly from a set of uncalibrated images. While flexible, VGGT features lack explicit multi-view geometric consistency, and we find that improving such 3D feature consistency benefits both NVS and pose estimation tasks. We introduce Selfi, a self-improving 3D reconstruction pipeline via feature alignment, transforming a VGGT backbone into a high-fidelity 3D reconstruction engine by leveraging its own outputs as pseudo-ground-truth. Specifically, we train a lightweight feature adapter using a reprojection-based consistency loss, which distills VGGT outputs into a new geometrically-aligned feature space that captures spatial proximity in 3D. This enables state-of-the-art performance in both NVS and camera pose estimation, demonstrating that feature alignment is a highly beneficial step for downstream 3D reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Selfi\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u6539\u8fdbVGGT\u76843D\u7279\u5f81\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6539\u8fdbVGGT\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\uff08NVS\uff09\u548c\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5c06VGGT\u8f93\u51fa\u63d0\u70bc\u5230\u65b0\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u9f50\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728NVS\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Selfi\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u5c06VGGT\u4e3b\u5e72\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f3D\u91cd\u5efa\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e383D\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u663e\u8457\u76ca\u5904\u3002"}}

This paper presents a review of existing gray literature, examining fairness requirements in AI context, with a focus on how they are defined across various application domains, managed throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), and the causes, as well as the corresponding consequences of their violation by AI models. Our gray literature investigation shows various definitions of fairness requirements in AI systems, commonly emphasizing non-discrimination and equal treatment across different demographic and social attributes. Fairness requirement management practices vary across the SDLC, particularly in model training and bias mitigation, fairness monitoring and evaluation, and data handling practices. Fairness requirement violations are frequently linked, but not limited, to data representation bias, algorithmic and model design bias, human judgment, and evaluation and transparency gaps. The corresponding consequences include harm in a broad sense, encompassing specific professional and societal impacts as key examples, stereotype reinforcement, data and privacy risks, and loss of trust and legitimacy in AI-supported decisions.

A way of introducing this within semantic segmentation models is by utilising hierarchy-aware methodologies. However, existing hierarchy-aware segmentation methods largely encode anatomical structure through the loss functions, providing weak and indirect supervision. We introduce a general framework that embeds an explicit anatomical hierarchy into semantic segmentation by coupling a recurrent, level-wise prediction scheme with restrictive output heads and top-down feature conditioning. At each depth of the class tree, the backbone is re-run on the original image concatenated with logits from the previous level. Child class features are conditioned using Feature-wise Linear Modulation of their parent class probabilities, to modulate child feature spaces for fine grained detection. A probabilistic composition rule enforces consistency between parent and descendant classes. Hierarchical loss combines per-level class weighted Dice and cross entropy loss and a consistency term loss, ensuring parent predictions are the sum of their children. We validate our approach on our proposed dataset, TL-pano, containing 194 panoramic radiographs with dense instance and semantic segmentation annotations, of tooth layers and alveolar bone. Utilising UNet and HRNet as donor models across a 5-fold cross validation scheme, the hierarchical variants consistently increase IoU, Dice, and recall, particularly for fine-grained anatomies, and produce more anatomically coherent masks. However, hierarchical variants also demonstrated increased recall over precision, implying increased false positives.

Motivated by this architectural trend, the emulation of high-precision matrix multiplication using low-precision hardware has attracted significant interest in the high-performance computing community. Ozaki, Uchino, and Imamura introduced the Ozaki-II scheme as a general framework for emulating matrix multiplication. Building on this framework, Uchino, Ozaki, and Imamura developed high-performance and power-efficient techniques for emulating single- and double-precision real matrix multiplication on INT8 matrix engines. Extending this line of research, the present study proposes high-performance emulation methods for single- and double-precision complex matrix multiplication on INT8 matrix engines, based on the Ozaki-II scheme. On an NVIDIA B200 GPU, the proposed methods achieve 4.0x--5.6x and 4.4x--6.5x speedups over the native single- and double-precision complex matrix multiplication routines from cuBLAS, respectively, for sufficiently large problem sizes. When lower accuracy than that of the standard routine is acceptable, the proposed methods can operate at even higher speed. Conversely, with only a modest increase in computation time, they can also deliver higher accuracy than the standard routines. These properties suggest that the proposed approach has the potential to serve as a default algorithm across a wide range of applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposed methods emulate complex matrix multiplication on INT8 engines, achieving significant speedups over native routines, with flexible accuracy options.", "motivation": "Motivated by the higher throughput of low-precision matrix multiplication units in modern architectures, the research aims to emulate high-precision operations efficiently on low-precision hardware.", "method": "The study extends the Ozaki-II scheme to develop high-performance emulation methods for single- and double-precision complex matrix multiplication on INT8 matrix engines.", "result": "On an NVIDIA B200 GPU, the methods achieve 4.0x--5.6x and 4.4x--6.5x speedups over native cuBLAS routines for large problem sizes, with adjustable accuracy.", "conclusion": "The proposed methods for emulating high-precision complex matrix multiplication on INT8 engines show significant speedups and flexibility in accuracy, suggesting their potential as a default algorithm in various applications."}}

Traditional caching policies, such as Least Recently Used (LRU) and Least Frequently Used (LFU), perform well under specific request patterns. LRU excels in workloads with strong temporal locality, while LFU is effective when content popularity remains static. However, real-world client requests often exhibit correlations due to shared contexts and coordinated activities. This is particularly evident in Virtual Reality (VR) environments, where groups of clients navigate shared virtual spaces, leading to correlated content requests.\n  In this paper, we introduce the \\textit{grouped client request model}, a generalization of the Independent Reference Model that explicitly captures different types of request correlations. Our theoretical analysis of LRU under this model reveals that the optimal causal caching policy depends on cache size: LFU is optimal for small to moderate caches, while LRU outperforms it for larger caches. To address the limitations of existing policies, we propose Least Following and Recently Used (LFRU), a novel online caching policy that dynamically infers and adapts to causal relationships in client requests to optimize evictions. LFRU prioritizes objects likely to be requested based on inferred dependencies, achieving near-optimal performance compared to the offline optimal Belady policy in structured correlation settings.\n  We develop VR based datasets to evaluate caching policies under realistic correlated requests.

Although essential as a concrete cognitive capability and for critical tasks such as disaster response and urban planning, it remains largely unevaluated. Building on progress in chart and infographic understanding, recent large vision language model studies on map visual question-answering often treat maps as a special case of charts. In contrast, map VQA demands comprehension of layered symbology (e.g., symbols, geometries, and text labels) as well as spatial relations tied to orientation and distance that often span multiple maps and are not captured by chart-style evaluations. To address this gap, we introduce FRIEDA, a benchmark for testing complex open-ended cartographic reasoning in LVLMs. FRIEDA sources real map images from documents and reports in various domains and geographical areas. Following classifications in Geographic Information System (GIS) literature, FRIEDA targets all three categories of spatial relations: topological (border, equal, intersect, within), metric (distance), and directional (orientation). All questions require multi-step inference, and many require cross-map grounding and reasoning. We evaluate eleven state-of-the-art LVLMs under two settings: (1) the direct setting, where we provide the maps relevant to the question, and (2) the contextual setting, where the model may have to identify the maps relevant to the question before reasoning. Even the strongest models, Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5-Think, achieve only 38.20% and 37.20% accuracy, respectively, far below human performance of 84.87%.

While existing optimization efforts focus primarily on hardware energy efficiency, a significant but overlooked source of inefficiency is software energy waste caused by poor software design. This often includes redundant or poorly designed operations that consume more energy without improving performance. These inefficiencies arise in widely used ML frameworks and applications, yet developers often lack the visibility and tools to detect and diagnose them.\n  We propose differential energy debugging, a novel approach that leverages the observation that competing ML systems often implement similar functionality with vastly different energy consumption. Building on this insight, we design and implement Magneton, an energy profiler that compares energy consumption between similar ML systems at the operator level and automatically pinpoints code regions and configuration choices responsible for excessive energy use. Applied to 9 popular ML systems spanning LLM inference, general ML frameworks, and image generation, Magneton detects and diagnoses 16 known cases of software energy inefficiency and further discovers 8 previously unknown cases, 7 of which have been confirmed by developers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Magneton \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u80fd\u91cf\u8c03\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u76f8\u4f3cML\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6d6a\u8d39\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u91cf\u80fd\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u80fd\u6548\u4e0a\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0d\u5f53\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86 Magneton\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u76f8\u4f3c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u5bfc\u81f4\u80fd\u91cf\u6d6a\u8d39\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u533a\u57df\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u57289\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0cMagneton \u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u8bca\u65ad\u4e8616\u4e2a\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u80fd\u91cf\u4f4e\u6548\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e868\u4e2a\u672a\u77e5\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d7\u4e2a\u5df2\u5f97\u5230\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u786e\u8ba4\u3002", "conclusion": "Magneton \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6d6a\u8d39\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Investigating Package Hallucinations of Shell Command in Original and Quantized LLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models for code (LLMs4Code) are increasingly used to generate software artifacts, including library and package recommendations in languages such as Go. However, recent evidence shows that LLMs frequently hallucinate package names or generate dependencies containing known security vulnerabilities, posing significant risks to developers and downstream software supply chains. At the same time, quantization has become a widely adopted technique to reduce inference cost and enable deployment of LLMs on resource-constrained environments. Despite its popularity, little is known about how quantization affects the correctness and security of LLM-generated software dependencies while generating shell commands for package installation.\n  In this work, we conduct the first systematic empirical study of the impact of quantization on package hallucination and vulnerability risks in LLM-generated Go packages. We evaluate five Qwen model sizes under full-precision, 8-bit, and 4-bit quantization across three datasets (SO, MBPP, and paraphrase). Our results show that quantization substantially increases the package hallucination rate (PHR), with 4-bit models exhibiting the most severe degradation. We further find that even among the correctly generated packages, the vulnerability presence rate (VPR) rises as precision decreases, indicating elevated security risk in lower-precision models. Finally, our analysis of hallucinated outputs reveals that most fabricated packages resemble realistic URL-based Go module paths, such as most commonly malformed or non-existent GitHub and golang.org repositories, highlighting a systematic pattern in how LLMs hallucinate dependencies. Overall, our findings provide actionable insights into the reliability and security implications of deploying quantized LLMs for code generation and dependency recommendation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5316LLM\u5728\u751f\u6210Go\u5305\u65f6\uff0c\u5305\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u548c\u6f0f\u6d1e\u98ce\u9669\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f4\u4f4d\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u90e8\u7f72\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5316\u867d\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdbLLM\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9LLM\u751f\u6210\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u4e94\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684Qwen\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b8c\u6574\u7cbe\u5ea6\u30018\u4f4d\u548c4\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08SO\u3001MBPP\u548cparaphrase\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u91cf\u5316\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5305\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\uff08PHR\uff09\uff0c4\u4f4d\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u5dee\uff1b\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6b63\u786e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5305\u4e2d\uff0c\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5b58\u5728\u7387\uff08VPR\uff09\u4e5f\u968f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u800c\u4e0a\u5347\u3002\u5e7b\u89c9\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u5448\u73b0\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u771f\u5b9eURL\u7684Go\u6a21\u5757\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5316\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u4e86LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684Go\u5305\u4e2d\u7684\u5305\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u548c\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5b58\u5728\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u90e8\u7f72\u91cf\u5316LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u63a8\u8350\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u53ca\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

This shift focuses on enabling more personalized task planning and design, thereby achieving a higher quality of interaction experience and greater flexibility, which can be used in many fileds, such as agriculture, aerial photography, logistics, and environmental monitoring. However, due to the lack of a common language between users and the UAVs, such interactions are often difficult to be achieved. The developments of Large Language Models possess the ability to understand nature languages and Robots' (UAVs') behaviors, marking the possibility of personalized Human-UAV Interaction. Recently, some HUI frameworks based on LLMs have been proposed, but they commonly suffer from difficulties in mixed task planning and execution, leading to low adaptability in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-agent HUI framework. This framework constructs two independent LLM agents (a task planning agent, and an execution agent) and applies different Prompt Engineering to separately handle the understanding, planning, and execution of tasks.

A key design principle of NGN is decoupling of service-related functions from the underlying transport stratum, making user services independent of transport technologies. Interestingly, the NGN architecture, as defined in ITU standards, did not follow this design principle for internal network services, e.g., mobility, or authentication though adhering for external user services like IPTV or Multimedia services. These internal services are handled by the NGN transport control plane, making them an intrinsic part of the transport stratum, resulting in a tightly coupled service and transport functionality as opposed to the proclaimed design goal. This design choice may force each transport technology to support internal services individually, e.g., separate authentication service for each transport, leading to duplication. Since the NGN architecture is the base underlying architecture for most packet-based telecommunications network including advanced cellular networks like 4th/5th Generation cellular networks, the limitation persists in these cellular networks as well. To remedy the situation, the decoupling of service and transport can be generalized to include internal services like mobility and authentication also. In this context, the recently published ITU Y.2325 recommendation, defines an evolved NGN architecture, wherein all services, including internal network services, are decoupled from the transport stratum. The proposal results in a more scalable and modular evolved NGN architecture that can be used as a template for all future telecom networks including IMT-2030 (6th generation mobile networks).

However, due to their black-box nature, model explainers are used to help clinicians understand better and trust model outputs. This paper introduces an explainer method for classifying Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) from fundus images. Previous methods fail to generate explanations that preserve input image structures such as smoothness and sparsity. We introduce Sparse and Smooth Explainer (SSplain), a method that generates pixel-wise explanations while preserving image structures by enforcing smoothness and sparsity. This results in realistic explanations to enhance the understanding of the given black-box model. To achieve this goal, we define an optimization problem with combinatorial constraints and solve it using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Experimental results show that SSplain outperforms commonly used explainers in terms of both post-hoc accuracy and smoothness analyses. Additionally, SSplain identifies features that are consistent with domain-understandable features that clinicians consider as discriminative factors for ROP. We also show SSplain's generalization by applying it to additional publicly available datasets.

However, implementations for access by programmable alternatives known as lightweight threads (also referred to as asynchronous calls or coroutines) have not been thoroughly studied. The main advantage of lightweight threads is their significantly lower overhead during launch and context switching. However, this comes at a cost: to achieve proper parallelism, context switches must be manually invoked in the code; without these switches, new lightweight threads will never be executed.\n  In this paper, we focus on the simplest multithreaded data structure: a mutex (also known as a lock). We demonstrate that original implementations for OS threads cannot be used effectively in this new context due to the potential for deadlocks. Furthermore, correctness is not the only concern. In certain languages, such as C++, there are various lightweight thread libraries, each with different implementations and interfaces, which necessitate distinct lock implementations.\n  In this work, we present a modification of TTAS and MCS locks for the use from lightweight threads and demonstrate that the two context switch mechanisms of lightweight threads, yielding and sleeping, are crucial. However, the performance of TTAS and MCS may differ significantly depending on the settings. If one wants to have a lock that works well for any library, we suggest using the cohort lock, which strikes a balance between MCS and TTAS by utilizing several MCS queues with a common TTAS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7ebf\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u9501\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edfOS\u7ebf\u7a0b\u9501\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4fee\u6539\u7248TTAS\u548cMCS\u9501\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u8350cohort\u9501\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7528\u4e8e\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ebf\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7ebf\u7a0b\uff08\u5982\u534f\u7a0b\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7ebf\u7a0b\u7684\u542f\u52a8\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5207\u6362\u5f00\u9500\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u624b\u52a8\u89e6\u53d1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5207\u6362\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5bf9TTAS\u548cMCS\u9501\u7684\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7ebf\u7a0b\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5207\u6362\u673a\u5236\uff08yielding\u548csleeping\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u539f\u59cbOS\u7ebf\u7a0b\u7684\u9501\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7ebf\u7a0b\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b7b\u9501\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7ebf\u7a0b\u5e93\u9700\u8981\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9501\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002TTAS\u548cMCS\u9501\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u56e0\u8bbe\u7f6e\u800c\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u5efa\u8bae\u4f7f\u7528cohort\u9501\uff0c\u5b83\u5728MCS\u548cTTAS\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7ebf\u7a0b\u5e93\u3002"}}

This paper reports our experience converting the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) from Qiskit Algorithms with Qiskit 1.x (v1 primitives) to a custom implementation using Qiskit 2.x (v2 primitives). Despite identical circuits, optimizers, and Hamiltonians, the new version produced drastically different results. A systematic analysis revealed the root cause: the sampling budget -- the number of circuit executions (shots) per iteration. The library's implicit use of unlimited shots yielded dense probability distributions, whereas the v2 default of 10 000 shots captured only 23% of the state space. Increasing shots to 250 000 restored library-level accuracy.

We employ the Gluestick pipeline to establish 2D-3D point and line feature correspondences for a robust and automatic initial guess. To enhance accuracy, we quantitatively analyze the impact of feature distribution on calibration results and adaptively weight the cost of each feature based on these metrics. As a result, extrinsic parameters are optimized by filtering out the adverse effects of inferior features.

We use these addresses to understand the prevalence of IPv6 in countries corresponding to Wikimedia site languages, how IPv6 adoption has grown over time, and the prevalence of EUI-64 addressing on client devices like desktops, laptops, and mobile phones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\u7b49Wikimedia\u7f51\u7ad920\u5e74\u6765\u7684IPv6\u5730\u5740\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86IPv6\u7684\u5168\u7403\u91c7\u7528\u8d8b\u52bf\u548cEUI-64\u5bfb\u5740\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "Wikimedia\u7f51\u7ad9\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u653f\u7b56\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u6210\u4e3aIPv6\u5730\u5740\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u80f6\u56ca\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76IPv6\u5730\u5740\u5206\u914d\u53ca\u5176\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u4ece2003\u5e74\u81f32024\u5e74\u7684Wikimedia\u7f51\u7ad9\uff08\u5982\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\uff09\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4e861900\u4e07\u4e2a\u72ec\u7279\u7684IPv6\u5730\u5740\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790IPv6\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u548c\u5730\u5740\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5305\u62ecIPv6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3001\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u589e\u957f\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8bbe\u5907\uff08\u5982\u53f0\u5f0f\u673a\u3001\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7535\u8111\u548c\u624b\u673a\uff09\u4e2dEUI-64\u5bfb\u5740\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790Wikimedia\u7f51\u7ad9\u4e2d\u7684IPv6\u5730\u5740\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86IPv6\u5728\u5168\u7403\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u8d8b\u52bf\u3001\u5730\u57df\u5206\u5e03\u4ee5\u53caEUI-64\u5bfb\u5740\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u60c5\u51b5\u3002"}}

To achieve this, our approach is built upon three components: (i) a lightweight visual backbone that captures manual and non-manual cues from human keypoints and lip-region images while preserving signer privacy; (ii) a Sliding Perceiver mapping network that aggregates consecutive visual features into word-level embeddings to bridge the vision-text gap; and (iii) a multi-task scalable training strategy that jointly optimises SLT and SSA, reinforcing both linguistic and temporal alignment. To promote cross-linguistic generalisation, we pretrain our model on large-scale sign-text corpora covering British Sign Language (BSL) and American Sign Language (ASL) from the BOBSL and YouTube-SL-25 datasets. With this multilingual pretraining and strong model design, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the challenging BOBSL (BSL) dataset for both SLT and SSA.

Causal models and especially causal learning have proved to be difficult for large pretrained models using standard techniques of deep learning. In contrast, cognitive scientists have applied advances in our formal understanding of causation in computer science, particularly within the Causal Bayes Net formalism, to understand human causal learning. In the very different tradition of reinforcement learning, researchers have described an intrinsic reward signal called \"empowerment\" which maximizes mutual information between actions and their outcomes. \"Empowerment\" may be an important bridge between classical Bayesian causal learning and reinforcement learning and may help to characterize causal learning in humans and enable it in machines. If an agent learns an accurate causal world model, they will necessarily increase their empowerment, and increasing empowerment will lead to a more accurate causal world model. Empowerment may also explain distinctive features of childrens causal learning, as well as providing a more tractable computational account of how that learning is possible. In an empirical study, we systematically test how children and adults use cues to empowerment to infer causal relations, and design effective causal interventions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Empowerment connects Bayesian causal learning and reinforcement learning, aiding human and machine causal learning.

One important factor is the inherent verbosity of programming languages, such as unnecessary formatting elements and lengthy boilerplate code. This leads to inflated token counts in both input and generated outputs, which increases inference costs and slows down the generation process. Prior work improves this through simplifying programming language grammar, reducing token usage across both code understanding and generation tasks. However, it is confined to syntactic transformations, leaving significant opportunities for token reduction unrealized at the semantic level.\n  In this work, we propose Token Sugar, a concept that replaces frequent and verbose code patterns with reversible, token-efficient shorthand in the source code. To realize this concept in practice, we designed a systematic solution that mines high-frequency, token-heavy patterns from a code corpus, maps each to a unique shorthand, and integrates them into LLM pretraining via code transformation. With this solution, we obtain 799 (code pattern, shorthand) pairs, which can reduce up to 15.1% token count in the source code and is complementary to existing syntax-focused methods. We further trained three widely used LLMs on Token Sugar-augmented data.

We propose DualVLN, the first dual-system VLN foundation model that synergistically integrates high-level reasoning with low-level action execution. System 2, a VLM-based global planner, \"grounds slowly\" by predicting mid-term waypoint goals via image-grounded reasoning. System 1, a lightweight, multi-modal conditioning Diffusion Transformer policy, \"moves fast\" by leveraging both explicit pixel goals and latent features from System 2 to generate smooth and accurate trajectories. The dual-system design enables robust real-time control and adaptive local decision-making in complex, dynamic environments. By decoupling training, the VLM retains its generalization, while System 1 achieves interpretable and effective local navigation.

This requires robust generalization to new and unseen deepfakes, which emerge frequently, while minimizing computational overhead to enable large-scale deepfake screening, a critical objective in the era of Green AI. In this work, we explore frequency-domain masking as a training strategy for deepfake detectors. Unlike traditional methods that rely heavily on spatial features or large-scale pretrained models, our approach introduces random masking and geometric transformations, with a focus on frequency masking due to its superior generalization properties. We demonstrate that frequency masking not only enhances detection accuracy across diverse generators but also maintains performance under significant model pruning, offering a scalable and resource-conscious solution. Our method achieves state-of-the-art generalization on GAN- and diffusion-generated image datasets and exhibits consistent robustness under structured pruning. These results highlight the potential of frequency-based masking as a practical step toward sustainable and generalizable deepfake detection.

However, most existing LAD approaches assume centralized training, which is often impractical due to privacy constraints and the decentralized nature of system logs. While federated learning (FL) offers a promising alternative, there is a lack of dedicated testbeds tailored to the needs of LAD in federated settings. To address this, we present FedLAD, a unified platform for training and evaluating LAD models under FL constraints. FedLAD supports plug-and-play integration of diverse LAD models, benchmark datasets, and aggregation strategies, while offering runtime support for validation logging (self-monitoring), parameter tuning (self-configuration), and adaptive strategy control (self-adaptation). By enabling reproducible and scalable experimentation, FedLAD bridges the gap between FL frameworks and LAD requirements, providing a solid foundation for future research.

While video-generation models are increasingly adopted, they often lack rigorous physical grounding, leading to hallucinations and a failure to maintain consistency in long-horizon physical constraints. To address these limitations, we propose Embodied Tree of Thoughts (EToT), a novel Real2Sim2Real planning framework that leverages a physics-based interactive digital twin as an embodied world model. EToT formulates manipulation planning as a tree search expanded through two synergistic mechanisms: (1) Priori Branching, which generates diverse candidate execution paths based on semantic and spatial analysis; and (2) Reflective Branching, which utilizes VLMs to diagnose execution failures within the simulator and iteratively refine the planning tree with corrective actions. By grounding high-level reasoning in a physics simulator, our framework ensures that generated plans adhere to rigid-body dynamics and collision constraints. We validate EToT on a suite of short- and long-horizon manipulation tasks, where it consistently outperforms baselines by effectively predicting physical dynamics and adapting to potential failures.

Recent continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods use masking to regulate learning, but often depend on calibrated uncertainty or stable attention scores and introduce added complexity. We ask: do we need custom-made masking designs, or can a simple random masking schedule suffice under strong corruption? We introduce Mask to Adapt (M2A), a simple CTTA approach that generates a short sequence of masked views (spatial or frequency) and adapts with two objectives: a mask consistency loss that aligns predictions across different views and an entropy minimization loss that encourages confident outputs. Motivated by masked image modeling, we study two common masking families -- spatial masking and frequency masking -- and further compare subtypes within each (spatial: patch vs.\\ pixel; frequency: all vs.\\ low vs.\\ high). On CIFAR10C/CIFAR100C/ImageNetC (severity~5), M2A (Spatial) attains 8.3\\%/19.8\\%/39.2\\% mean error, outperforming or matching strong CTTA baselines, while M2A (Frequency) lags behind.

Traditional cloud-based tools offer strong reasoning but risk data exposure and latency, while on-device solutions lack full-context understanding across codebase and developer tooling. We introduce SolidGPT, an open-source, edge-cloud hybrid developer assistant built on GitHub, designed to enhance code and workspace semantic search. SolidGPT enables developers to: talk to your codebase: interactively query code and project structure, discovering the right methods and modules without manual searching. Automate software project workflows: generate PRDs, task breakdowns, Kanban boards, and even scaffold web app beginnings, with deep integration via VSCode and Notion. Configure private, extensible agents: onboard private code folders (up to approximately 500 files), connect Notion, customize AI agent personas via embedding and in-context training, and deploy via Docker, CLI, or VSCode extension. In practice, SolidGPT empowers developer productivity through: Semantic-rich code navigation: no more hunting through files or wondering where a feature lives.

To tackle such challenges, SDAR tightly knit together its dependency-driven task planner (SDAR-T) and synchronous dual-arm motion planner (SDAR-M), to intelligently sift through a large number of possible task and motion plans. Specifically, SDAR-T applies a simple yet effective strategy to decompose the global object dependency graph induced by the rearrangement task, to produce more optimal dual-arm task plans than solutions derived from optimal task plans for a single arm. Leveraging state-of-the-art GPU SIMD-based motion planning tools, SDAR-M employs a layered motion planning strategy to sift through many task plans for the best synchronous dual-arm motion plan while ensuring high levels of success rate. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that SDAR delivers a 100% success rate in solving complex, non-monotone, long-horizon tabletop rearrangement tasks with solution quality far exceeding the previous state-of-the-art.

The Satellite-based Monitoring Project of Deforestation in the Brazilian Legal Amazon (PRODES), a project of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), stands out as a fundamental initiative in this effort, annually monitoring deforested areas not only in the Amazon but also in other Brazilian biomes. Recently, machine learning models have been developed using PRODES data to support this effort through the comparative analysis of multitemporal satellite images, treating deforestation detection as a change detection problem. However, existing approaches present significant limitations: models evaluated in the literature still show unsatisfactory effectiveness, many do not incorporate modern architectures, such as those based on self-attention mechanisms, and there is a lack of methodological standardization that allows direct comparisons between different studies. In this work, we address these gaps by evaluating various change detection models in a unified dataset, including fully convolutional models and networks incorporating self-attention mechanisms based on Transformers. We investigate the impact of different pre- and post-processing techniques, such as filtering deforested areas predicted by the models based on the size of connected components, texture replacement, and image enhancements; we demonstrate that such approaches can significantly improve individual model effectiveness. Additionally, we test different strategies for combining the evaluated models to achieve results superior to those obtained individually, reaching an F1-score of 80.41%, a value comparable to other recent works in the literature.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u96e8\u6797\u780d\u4f10\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe80.41%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u96e8\u6797\u780d\u4f10\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u73b0\u4ee3\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5168\u5377\u79ef\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u3002\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5982\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u901a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u66ff\u6362\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8680.41%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u72ec\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5168\u5377\u79ef\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u5982\u4f55\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8680.41%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4e0e\u8fd1\u671f\u6587\u732e\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u5f53\u3002"}}

Human writers face time constraints, and extrinsic evaluations can be costly. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential in content creation, concerns about the quality of AI-generated content persist. Traditional evaluation methods, like human surveys, further add operational costs, highlighting the need for efficient, automated solutions. This research introduces Generative Agents as a means to tackle these challenges.

However, such models are computationally intensive and large in size, making them unsuitable for deployment on edge devices. In addition, strict privacy constraints hinder centralized data management, motivating the adoption of Federated Learning (FL). To address these challenges, this study proposes a skewness-guided pruning method that selectively prunes the Multi-Head Self-Attention and Multi-Layer Perceptron layers of a multimodal Swin Transformer based on the statistical skewness of their output distributions. The proposed method was validated in a horizontal FL environment and shown to maintain performance while substantially reducing model complexity. Experiments on the compact Swin Transformer demonstrate approximately 36\\% model size reduction with no loss in accuracy.

A key limitation in existing research is the failure to distinguish between agreement with the abstract, high-level values of the Agile Manifesto and agreement with the concrete, day-to-day practices derived from the 12 Principles. This paper addresses this methodological gap by presenting the design and validation of two distinct instruments: the novel Manifesto Agreement Scale (MAS), and the Principle Agreement Scale (PAS), which is a systematic adaptation and refinement of a prior instrument.\n  We detail the systematic process of item creation and selection, survey design, and validation. The results demonstrate that both scales possess important internal consistency and construct validity. A convergence and divergence analysis, including Proportional Odds Logistic Regression, a Bland-Altman plot, and an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), reveals that while the two scales are moderately correlated, they are not interchangeable and capture distinct dimensions of agile agreement. The primary contribution of this work is a pair of publicly available instruments, validated within a specific demographic of Belgian IT professionals. These scales represent a critical initial step toward facilitating a more nuanced measurement of agile agreement, distinguishing agile agreement across various levels of perception and aiding in a more refined interpretation of person-agile fit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u91cf\u8868\uff08MAS\u548cPAS\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u654f\u6377\u5ba3\u8a00\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u548c\u539f\u5219\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u540c\u610f\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6bd4\u5229\u65f6IT\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u58eb\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u654f\u6377\u5ba3\u8a00\u62bd\u8c61\u9ad8\u5c42\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684\u540c\u610f\u4e0e\u5bf912\u6761\u539f\u5219\u884d\u751f\u65e5\u5e38\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u540c\u610f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e2a\u4f53\u2018\u654f\u6377\u540c\u610f\u2019\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u7cca\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u8be6\u7ec6\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u9879\u76ee\u521b\u5efa\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u8c03\u67e5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f7f\u7528\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4f18\u52bf\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u3001Bland-Altman\u56fe\u548c\u7c7b\u5185\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\uff08ICC\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6536\u655b\u548c\u53d1\u6563\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u91cf\u8868\u5747\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u6548\u5ea6\u3002\u6536\u655b\u548c\u53d1\u6563\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u4e24\u4e2a\u91cf\u8868\u9002\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0d\u53ef\u4e92\u6362\uff0c\u4e14\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u654f\u6377\u540c\u610f\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u2014\u2014\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u300a\u5ba3\u8a00\u540c\u610f\u91cf\u8868\u300b\uff08MAS\uff09\u548c\u300a\u539f\u5219\u540c\u610f\u91cf\u8868\u300b\uff08PAS\uff09\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u672a\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u654f\u6377\u5ba3\u8a00\u62bd\u8c61\u9ad8\u5c42\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684\u540c\u610f\u4e0e\u5bf912\u6761\u539f\u5219\u884d\u751f\u65e5\u5e38\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u540c\u610f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u6bd4\u5229\u65f6IT\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u58eb\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u4eba\u7fa4\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u5730\u6d4b\u91cf\u654f\u6377\u540c\u610f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u521d\u6b65\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002"}}

While risk is subjective, humans form rational mental models that guide action selection in dynamic environments. This work proposes a framework for extracting implicit human risk models by introducing a novel, semantically-conditioned and spatially-varying parametrization of risk, supervised directly from safe human demonstration videos and VLM common sense. Notably, we define risk through a Bayesian formulation. The prior is furnished by a pretrained vision-language model. In order to encourage the risk estimate to be more human aligned, a likelihood function modulates the prior to produce a relative metric of risk. Specifically, the likelihood is a learned ViT that maps pretrained features, to pixel-aligned risk values. Our pipeline ingests RGB images and a query object string, producing pixel-dense risk images. These images that can then be used as value-predictors in robot planning tasks or be projected into 3D for use in conventional trajectory optimization to produce human-like motion. This learned mapping enables generalization to novel objects and contexts, and has the potential to scale to much larger training datasets. In particular, the Bayesian framework that is introduced enables fast adaptation of our model to additional observations or common sense rules. We demonstrate that our proposed framework produces contextual risk that aligns with human preferences. Additionally, we illustrate several downstream applications of the model; as a value learner for visuomotor planners or in conjunction with a classical trajectory optimization algorithm. Our results suggest that our framework is a significant step toward enabling autonomous systems to internalize human-like risk.

Existing approaches primarily rely on unstructured representations, such as point clouds, voxels, or patch features, and inject scene context implicitly via coordinate embeddings. However, this often results in limited spatial reasoning capabilities due to the lack of explicit, high-level structural understanding. To address this limitation, we introduce two complementary components into a Large Multimodal Model-based architecture: target-affinity token, analogous to central vision, that guides the model's attention toward query-relevant objects; and allocentric grid, akin to peripheral vision, that captures global scene context and spatial arrangements. These components work in tandem to enable structured, context-aware understanding of complex 3D environments.

Despite this widespread adoption, the principles that determine their performance remain underexplored, leaving practitioners to rely on heuristics rather than principled design choices. We address this gap by deriving quantitative scaling principles for agent systems. We evaluate this across four diverse benchmarks: Finance-Agent, BrowseComp-Plus, PlanCraft, and Workbench. Using five canonical architectures (Single, Independent, Centralized, Decentralized, Hybrid) instantiated across three LLM families, we perform a controlled evaluation spanning 180 configurations with standardized tools and token budgets. We derive a predictive model using empirical coordination metrics, including efficiency, overhead, error amplification, and redundancy, that achieves cross-validated R^2=0.513. We identify three dominant effects: (1) a tool-coordination trade-off: under fixed computational budgets, tool-heavy tasks suffer disproportionately from multi-agent overhead. (2) a capability saturation: coordination yields diminishing or negative returns (beta=-0.408, p<0.001) once single-agent baselines exceed ~45%. (3) topology-dependent error amplification: independent agents amplify errors 17.2x through unchecked propagation, while centralized coordination contains this to 4.4x. Centralized coordination improves performance by 80.9% on parallelizable tasks like financial reasoning, while decentralized coordination excels on dynamic web navigation (+9.2% vs. +0.2%). Yet for sequential reasoning tasks, all multi-agent variants degraded performance by 39-70%. The framework predicts the optimal coordination strategy for 87% of held-out configurations, providing a predictive principle of agentic scaling based on measurable task properties.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5de5\u5177\u534f\u8c03\u6743\u8861\u3001\u80fd\u529b\u9971\u548c\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u653e\u5927\u662f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6700\u4f18\u534f\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u73b0\u5b9eAI\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u51b3\u5b9a\u539f\u5219\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u800c\u975e\u539f\u5219\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e94\u4e2a\u7ecf\u5178\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5355\u4e00\u3001\u72ec\u7acb\u3001\u96c6\u4e2d\u3001\u5206\u6563\u3001\u6df7\u5408\uff09\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aLLM\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86180\u4e2a\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u53d7\u63a7\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6548\u5e94\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u5de5\u5177\u534f\u8c03\u6743\u8861\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u80fd\u529b\u9971\u548c\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u62d3\u6251\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u653e\u5927\u3002\u96c6\u4e2d\u534f\u8c03\u5728\u53ef\u5e76\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u91d1\u878d\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff08\u63d0\u534780.9%\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u5206\u6563\u534f\u8c03\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff08+9.2% vs. +0.2%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u6027\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\u6269\u5c55\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a87%\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u9884\u6d4b\u6700\u4f18\u534f\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Grounded in the person-object theory of interest (POI), we conceptualize enthusiasm as a short-term, activating expression of interest that combines positive affect, perceived relevance, and intention to re-engage. Experiencing such enthusiasm can temporarily shift CS attitudes and strengthen future engagement intentions, making it a valuable lens for evaluating brief outreach activities. To capture these dynamics, we developed a theoretically grounded questionnaire for pre-post assessment of the enthusiasm potential of CS interventions. Using data from more than 400 students participating in online CS courses, we examined age- and gender-related patterns in enthusiasm. The findings challenge the prevailing belief that early exposure is the primary pathway to sustained interest in CS. Instead, we identify a marked decline in enthusiasm during early adolescence, particularly among girls, alongside substantial variability in interest trajectories across age groups. Crucially, our analyses reveal that age is a more decisive factor than gender in shaping interest development and uncover key developmental breakpoints. Despite starting with lower baseline attitudes, older students showed the largest positive changes following the intervention, suggesting that well-designed short activities can effectively re-activate interest even at later ages.

Although Transformer-based methods excel at capturing global context, their quadratic computational complexity hinders real-time deployment. To address this, we propose Fourier Receptance Weighted Key Value (Fourier-RWKV), a novel dehazing framework based on a Multi-State Perception paradigm. The model achieves comprehensive haze degradation modeling with linear complexity by synergistically integrating three distinct perceptual states: (1) Spatial-form Perception, realized through the Deformable Quad-directional Token Shift (DQ-Shift) operation, which dynamically adjusts receptive fields to accommodate local haze variations; (2) Frequency-domain Perception, implemented within the Fourier Mix block, which extends the core WKV attention mechanism of RWKV from the spatial domain to the Fourier domain, preserving the long-range dependencies essential for global haze estimation while mitigating spatial attenuation; (3) Semantic-relation Perception, facilitated by the Semantic Bridge Module (SBM), which utilizes Dynamic Semantic Kernel Fusion (DSK-Fusion) to precisely align encoder-decoder features and suppress artifacts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Fourier-RWKV delivers state-of-the-art performance across diverse haze scenarios while significantly reducing computational overhead, establishing a favorable trade-off between restoration quality and practical efficiency.

Motivated by this, this paper proposes a novel reinforced strategy injection mechanism (rSIM), that enables any LLM to become an RLM by employing a small planner to guide the LLM's CoT through the adaptive injection of reasoning strategies. To achieve this, the planner (leader agent) is jointly trained with an LLM (follower agent) using multi-agent RL (MARL), based on a leader-follower framework and straightforward rule-based rewards. Experimental results show that rSIM enables Qwen2.5-0.5B to become an RLM and significantly outperform Qwen2.5-14B.

It emphasizes a learner-centered approach that aligns gamification design with pedagogical goals, while mitigating risks such as the erosion of intrinsic motivation. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify ten widely discussed GDEs. Visual prototypes representing each element were developed, and a best-worst scaling (BWS) survey with 125 participants was administered to elicit preference rankings. Qualitative feedback was also collected to uncover motivational drivers. Learners consistently preferred GDEs that support learning processes directly-most notably progress bars, concept maps, immediate feedback, and achievements. Qualitative analysis revealed six recurring motivational themes, including visible progress, content relevance, and constructive feedback. The findings suggest that learners value gamification elements that are meaningfully integrated with educational content and support intrinsic motivation.

Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved superhuman accuracy on physical-based benchmarks, a key challenge remains: aligning model representations with human perception, a promising strategy for enhancing model robustness and interpretability. Research in object recognition has revealed a complex trade-off between model accuracy and human-like behavior, raising a question whether a similar divergence exist in depth estimation, particularly for natural outdoor scenes where benchmarks rely on sensor-based ground truth rather than human perceptual estimates. In this study, we systematically investigated the relationship between model accuracy and human similarity across 69 monocular depth estimators using the KITTI dataset. To dissect the structure of error patterns on a factor-by-factor basis, we applied affine fitting to decompose prediction errors into interpretable components. Intriguingly, our results reveal while humans and DNNs share certain estimation biases (positive error correlations), we observed distinct trade-off relationships between model accuracy and human similarity.

Also available on Zenodo: DOI 10.5281/zenodo.17530868", "summary": "The California Bearing Ratio (CBR) is a key geotechnical indicator used to assess the load-bearing capacity of subgrade soils, especially in transportation infrastructure and foundation design. Traditional CBR determination relies on laboratory penetration tests. Despite their accuracy, these tests are often time-consuming, costly, and can be impractical, particularly for large-scale or diverse soil profiles. Recent progress in artificial intelligence, especially machine learning (ML), has enabled data-driven approaches for modeling complex soil behavior with greater speed and precision. This study introduces a comprehensive ML framework for CBR prediction using a dataset of 382 soil samples collected from various geoclimatic regions in T\u00fcrkiye. The dataset includes physicochemical soil properties relevant to bearing capacity, allowing multidimensional feature representation in a supervised learning context. Twelve ML algorithms were tested, including decision tree, random forest, extra trees, gradient boosting, xgboost, k-nearest neighbors, support vector regression, multi-layer perceptron, adaboost, bagging, voting, and stacking regressors. Each model was trained, validated, and evaluated to assess its generalization and robustness.

We propose Model Predictive Diffuser (MPDiffuser), a compositional model-based diffusion framework consisting of: (i) a planner that generates diverse, task-aligned trajectories; (ii) a dynamics model that enforces consistency with the underlying system dynamics; and (iii) a ranker module that selects behaviors aligned with the task objectives. MPDiffuser employs an alternating diffusion sampling scheme, where planner and dynamics updates are interleaved to progressively refine trajectories for both task alignment and feasibility during the sampling process. We also provide a theoretical rationale for this procedure, showing how it balances fidelity to data priors with dynamics consistency. Empirically, the compositional design improves sample efficiency, as it leverages even low-quality data for dynamics learning and adapts seamlessly to novel dynamics. We evaluate MPDiffuser on both unconstrained (D4RL) and constrained (DSRL) offline decision-making benchmarks, demonstrating consistent gains over existing approaches. Furthermore, we present a preliminary study extending MPDiffuser to vision-based control tasks, showing its potential to scale to high-dimensional sensory inputs.

Also available on Zenodo: DOI 10.5281/zenodo.17533851", "summary": "Soil compaction is critical in construction engineering to ensure the stability of structures like road embankments and earth dams. Traditional methods for determining optimum moisture content (OMC) and maximum dry density (MDD) involve labor-intensive laboratory experiments, and empirical regression models have limited applicability and accuracy across diverse soil types. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as alternatives for predicting these compaction parameters. However, ML models often struggle with prediction accuracy and generalizability, particularly with heterogeneous datasets representing various soil types. This study proposes an automated machine learning (AutoML) approach to predict OMC and MDD. AutoML automates algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization, potentially improving accuracy and scalability. Through extensive experimentation, the study found that the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm provided the best performance, achieving R-squared values of 80.4% for MDD and 89.1% for OMC on a separate dataset.

However, they still fall short on new tasks not covered in the training data. When finetuned on limited demonstrations of a new task, these policies often overfit to the specific demonstrations--not only losing their prior abilities to solve a wide variety of generalist tasks but also failing to generalize within the new task itself. In this work, we aim to develop a method that preserves the generalization capabilities of the generalist policy during finetuning, allowing a single policy to robustly incorporate a new skill into its repertoire. Our goal is a single policy that both learns to generalize to variations of the new task and retains the broad competencies gained from pretraining. We show that this can be achieved through a simple yet effective strategy: interpolating the weights of a finetuned model with that of the pretrained model. We show, across extensive simulated and real-world experiments, that such model merging produces a single model that inherits the generalist abilities of the base model and learns to solve the new task robustly, outperforming both the pretrained and finetuned model on out-of-distribution variations of the new task.

In these settings, inference must run directly on collar tags or low-power edge nodes built around microcontrollers (MCUs), yet most Animal Re-ID models are designed for workstations or servers and are too large for devices with small memory and low-resolution inputs. We propose an on-device framework. First, we characterise the gap between state-of-the-art Animal Re-ID models and MCU-class hardware, showing that straightforward knowledge distillation from large teachers offers limited benefit once memory and input resolution are constrained. Second, guided by this analysis, we design a high-accuracy Animal Re-ID architecture by systematically scaling a CNN-based MobileNetV2 backbone for low-resolution inputs. Third, we evaluate the framework with a real-world dataset and introduce a data-efficient fine-tuning strategy to enable fast adaptation with just three images per animal identity at a new site. Across six public Animal Re-ID datasets, our compact model achieves competitive retrieval accuracy while reducing model size by over two orders of magnitude. On a self-collected cattle dataset, the deployed model performs fully on-device inference with only a small accuracy drop and unchanged Top-1 accuracy relative to its cluster version.

The wide adoption in numerous applications underscores the value of these models. However, the complexity of these methods often impedes understanding their decision-making processes. Current Explainable AI (XAI) methods struggle to untangle the intricate relationships and interactions within graphs. Several methods have tried to bridge this gap via a post-hoc approach or self-interpretable design. Most of them focus on graph structure analysis to determine essential patterns that correlate with prediction outcomes. While post-hoc explanation methods are adaptable, they require extra computational resources and may be less reliable due to limited access to the model's internal workings. Conversely, Interpretable models can provide immediate explanations, but their generalizability to different scenarios remains a major concern.

We study four multicalibration approaches on three function synthesis benchmarks, using latest-generation code LLMs (Qwen3 Coder, GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-R1-Distill). Our results demonstrate that multicalibration can yield distinct improvements over both uncalibrated token likelihoods (+1.03 in skill score) and baseline calibrations (+0.37 in skill score).

Many such tasks inherently demand multimodal reasoning; for example, filling a bottle with water will lead to visual information alone being ambiguous or incomplete, thereby requiring reasoning over the temporal evolution of audio, accounting for its underlying physical properties and pitch patterns. In this paper, we propose a generative latent flow matching model to anticipate future audio observations, enabling the system to reason about long-term consequences when integrated into a robot policy. We demonstrate the superior capabilities of our system through two manipulation tasks that require perceiving in-the-wild audio or music signals, compared to methods without future lookahead.

Current approaches typically yield either geometrically inconsistent multi-view images or sacrifice photorealism, resulting in blurry outputs under diverse viewing angles and complex motions. To address these issues, we propose Blur2Sharp, a novel framework integrating 3D-aware neural rendering and diffusion models to generate sharp, geometrically consistent novel-view images from only a single reference view. Our method employs a dual-conditioning architecture: initially, a Human NeRF model generates geometrically coherent multi-view renderings for target poses, explicitly encoding 3D structural guidance. Subsequently, a diffusion model conditioned on these renderings refines the generated images, preserving fine-grained details and structural fidelity. We further enhance visual quality through hierarchical feature fusion, incorporating texture, normal, and semantic priors extracted from parametric SMPL models to simultaneously improve global coherence and local detail accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Blur2Sharp consistently surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in both novel pose and view generation tasks, particularly excelling under challenging scenarios involving loose clothing and occlusions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Blur2Sharp\u7ed3\u54083D\u611f\u77e5\u795e\u7ecf\u6e32\u67d3\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u53c2\u8003\u89c6\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u7ec6\u8282\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u6216\u4fdd\u6301\u7167\u7247\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u7cca\u8f93\u51fa\u3002Blur2Sharp\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "Blur2Sharp\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u6761\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528Human NeRF\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7ec6\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7eb9\u7406\u3001\u6cd5\u7ebf\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u63d0\u5347\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBlur2Sharp\u5728\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u59ff\u52bf\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u677e\u6563\u8863\u7269\u548c\u906e\u6321\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "Blur2Sharp \u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u54083D\u611f\u77e5\u795e\u7ecf\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u7ec6\u8282\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u59ff\u52bf\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

To investigate its importance and to what extent it has been explored, we analyze real user-LLM dialogues from WildChat and find that: (1) The Dev Knowledge QA task accounts for 39.6% of interactions(highest among all tasks), revealing broad knowledge needs beyond code generation (32.3%). (2) Only 27.5% of real Dev Knowledge QA dialogues focus on code understanding, leaving out development knowledge-seeking. (3) Only 17.1% of real-world Dev Knowledge QA dialogues can be used for constructing a benchmark. Existing benchmarks have two primary limitations for evaluating the Dev Knowledge QA capability of LLMs. First, existing benchmarks offer a limited development knowledge scope, mainly focusing on code understanding and neglecting broader knowledge during development. Second, some benchmarks are not built from real user queries. To bridge this gap, we design a three-phase pipeline that transforms real-world dialogue into simple development knowledge-seeking QA pairs. Through this pipeline, we introduce SimpleDevQA, a multilingual benchmark derived from real user dialogues. It contains 2,740 QA pairs in three languages (English, Chinese, and Russian), and focuses on questions with unique, short, and verifiable answers for accurate and simple evaluation. Experiments show that: Code LLMs generally outperform general LLMs of similar scale; Knowledge injection with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategy can boost LLM accuracy by 11.3% on average; LLMs show systematic overconfidence in Dev Knowledge QA, and the answering accuracy of LLMs shows a positive correlation with their stated confidence; Generally, LLMs with stronger code generation performance also exhibit stronger performance in Dev Knowledge QA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6SimpleDevQA\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4ee3\u7801LLMs\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0cRAG\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14LLMs\u7684\u81ea\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u80fd\u529b\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u8303\u56f4\u72ed\u7a84\uff08\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\uff09\u4e14\u90e8\u5206\u57fa\u51c6\u975e\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237-LLM\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff08WildChat\uff09\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u51c6SimpleDevQA\uff08\u5305\u542b2,740\u4e2aQA\u5bf9\uff09\u3002", "result": "Dev Knowledge QA\u5360\u4ea4\u4e92\u768439.6%\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec527.5%\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u805a\u7126\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec517.1%\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u51c6\u3002SimpleDevQA\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u4ee3\u7801LLMs\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528LLMs\uff1bRAG\u7b56\u7565\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534711.3%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1bLLMs\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u81ea\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4ee3\u7801LLMs\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528LLMs\uff0c\u4e14\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982RAG\uff09\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cLLMs\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u81ea\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u7684LLMs\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002"}}

Traditional design space exploration (DSE) approaches struggle with multi-modal execution outputs and complex performance trade-offs, and often require human involvement to assess correctness based on execution outputs. This paper presents a multi-agent, large language model (LLM)-based DSE framework, which integrates multi-modal reasoning with 3D simulation and profiling tools to automate the interpretation of execution outputs and guide the exploration of system designs. Specialized LLM agents are leveraged to handle user input interpretation, design point generation, execution orchestration, and analysis of both visual and textual execution outputs, which enables identification of potential bottlenecks without human intervention. A prototype implementation is developed and evaluated on a robotaxi case study (an SAE Level 4 autonomous driving application). Compared with a genetic algorithm baseline, the proposed framework identifies more Pareto-optimal, cost-efficient solutions with reduced navigation time under the same exploration budget. Experimental results also demonstrate the efficiency of the adoption of the LLM-based approach for DSE.

Under review", "summary": "Understanding objects is fundamental to computer vision. Beyond object recognition that provides only a category label as typical output, in-depth object understanding represents a comprehensive perception of an object category, involving its components, appearance characteristics, inter-category relationships, contextual background knowledge, etc. Developing such capability requires sufficient multi-modal data, including visual annotations such as parts, attributes, and co-occurrences for specific tasks, as well as textual knowledge to support high-level tasks like reasoning and question answering. However, these data are generally task-oriented and not systematically organized enough to achieve the expected understanding of object categories. In response, we propose the Visual Knowledge Base that structures multi-modal object knowledge as graphs, and present a construction framework named VisKnow that extracts multi-modal, object-level knowledge for object understanding. This framework integrates enriched aligned text and image-source knowledge with region annotations at both object and part levels through a combination of expert design and large-scale model application. As a specific case study, we construct AnimalKB, a structured animal knowledge base covering 406 animal categories, which contains 22K textual knowledge triplets extracted from encyclopedic documents, 420K images, and corresponding region annotations. A series of experiments showcase how AnimalKB enhances object-level visual tasks such as zero-shot recognition and fine-grained VQA, and serves as challenging benchmarks for knowledge graph completion and part segmentation. Our findings highlight the potential of automatically constructing visual knowledge bases to advance visual understanding and its practical applications.

Inspired by human problem-solving, we propose DuSAR (Dual-Strategy Agent with Reflecting) - a demonstration-free framework that enables a single frozen LLM to perform co-adaptive reasoning via two complementary strategies: a high-level holistic plan and a context-grounded local policy. These strategies interact through a lightweight reflection mechanism, where the agent continuously assesses progress via a Strategy Fitness Score and dynamically revises its global plan when stuck or refines it upon meaningful advancement, mimicking human metacognitive behavior. On ALFWorld and Mind2Web, DuSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance with open-source LLMs (7B-70B), reaching 37.1% success on ALFWorld (Llama3.1-70B) - more than doubling the best prior result (13.0%) - and 4.02% on Mind2Web, also more than doubling the strongest baseline. Remarkably, it reduces per-step token consumption by 3-9X while maintaining strong performance. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of dual-strategy coordination. Moreover, optional integration of expert demonstrations further boosts results, highlighting DuSAR's flexibility and compatibility with external knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "DuSAR\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u7b56\u7565\u534f\u540c\u548c\u53cd\u601d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u6f14\u793a\u6216\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u89c4\u5212\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u548c\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDuSAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u5168\u5c40\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5c40\u90e8\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b56\u7565\u9002\u5e94\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728ALFWorld\u548cMind2Web\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0cALFWorld\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u81f337.1%\uff08Llama3.1-70B\uff09\uff0cMind2Web\u8fbe4.02%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u6bcf\u6b65token\u6d88\u80173-9\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "DuSAR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u7b56\u7565\u534f\u540c\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53cd\u601d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002"}}

Gelman and Loken refer to this freedom as leading to a \"garden of forking paths\". Although this freedom is often seen as an advantage, it also poses a threat to robustness and replicability: variations in analytical decisions, even when justifiable, can lead to divergent conclusions.\n  To better understand this risk, we conducted a so-called multiverse analysis on a published empirical SE paper. The paper we picked is a Mining Software Repositories study, as MSR studies commonly use non-trivial statistical models to analyze post-hoc, observational data. In the study, we identified nine pivotal analytical decisions-each with at least one equally defensible alternative and systematically reran all the 3,072 resulting analysis pipelines on the original dataset. Interestingly, only 6 of these universes (<0.2%) reproduced the published results; the overwhelming majority produced qualitatively different, and sometimes even opposite, findings.\n  This case study of a data analytical method commonly applied to empirical software engineering data reveals how methodological choices can exert a more profound influence on outcomes than is often acknowledged. We therefore advocate that SE researchers complement standard reporting with robustness checks across plausible analysis variants or, at least, explicitly justify each analytical decision. We propose a structured classification model to help classify and improve justification for methodological choices. Secondly, we show how the multiverse analysis is a practical tool in the methodological arsenal of SE researchers, one that can help produce more reliable, reproducible science.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u591a\u5b87\u5b99\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u52a0\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5373\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6df1\u8fdc\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5b87\u5b99\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e00\u7bc7\u5df2\u53d1\u8868\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u8bba\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u91cd\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e863072\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5206\u6790\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u4ec56\u79cd\u5206\u6790\u8def\u5f84\uff08<0.2%\uff09\u91cd\u73b0\u4e86\u539f\u8bba\u6587\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u8def\u5f84\u5f97\u51fa\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u540c\u751a\u81f3\u76f8\u53cd\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3b\u5f20\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e94\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5b87\u5b99\u5206\u6790\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002"}}

Conventional pHRI control frameworks typically build on optimal control theory, which assumes that human actions minimize a cost function; however, human behavior under uncertainty often departs from such optimal patterns. To address this gap, additional understanding of human behavior under uncertainty is needed. This pilot study implemented a physically coupled target-reaching task in which the robot delivered assistance or disturbances with systematically varied probabilities (10\\% to 90\\%). Analysis of participants' force inputs and decision-making strategies revealed two distinct behavioral clusters: a \"trade-off\" group that modulated their physical responses according to disturbance likelihood, and an \"always-compensate\" group characterized by strong risk aversion irrespective of probability. These findings provide empirical evidence that human decision-making in pHRI is highly individualized and that the perception of probability can differ to its true value. Accordingly, the study highlights the need for more interpretable behavioral models, such as cumulative prospect theory (CPT), to more accurately capture these behaviors and inform the design of future adaptive robot controllers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728pHRI\u4e2d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u884c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\uff0c\u5bf9\u6982\u7387\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u9700\u91c7\u7528CPT\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u672a\u6765\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u5982\u4f55\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b89\u5168\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08pHRI\uff09\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7269\u7406\u5408\u4f5c\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u6e90\uff08\u5982\u4fe1\u4efb\u3001\u8212\u9002\u5ea6\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff09\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684pHRI\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u5e38\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u4f1a\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5e38\u504f\u79bb\u8fd9\u79cd\u6700\u4f18\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7269\u7406\u8026\u5408\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5230\u8fbe\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6982\u7387\uff0810%\u81f390%\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u534f\u52a9\u6216\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u529b\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u96c6\u7fa4\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u2018\u6743\u8861\u2019\u7ec4\u6839\u636e\u5e72\u6270\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u8c03\u8282\u5176\u7269\u7406\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u2018\u603b\u662f\u8865\u507f\u2019\u7ec4\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u89c4\u907f\uff0c\u4e0d\u53d7\u6982\u7387\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08pHRI\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u884c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6982\u7387\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u503c\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u7d2f\u79ef\u524d\u666f\u7406\u8bbaCPT\uff09\u6765\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u8fd9\u4e9b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

Machine learning models used in these applications often rely on features extracted from biosignals due to their effectiveness, lower data dimensionality, and wide compatibility across various model architectures. However, existing feature extraction methods often lack task-specific contextual knowledge, struggle to identify optimal feature extraction settings in high-dimensional feature space, and are prone to code generation and automation errors. In this paper, we propose DeepFeature, the first LLM-empowered, context-aware feature generation framework for wearable biosignals. DeepFeature introduces a multi-source feature generation mechanism that integrates expert knowledge with task settings. It also employs an iterative feature refinement process that uses feature assessment-based feedback for feature re-selection. Additionally, DeepFeature utilizes a robust multi-layer filtering and verification approach for robust feature-to-code translation to ensure that the extraction functions run without crashing.

However, in split inference systems-where intermediate features from neural network are transmitted instead of pixel data-these assumptions no longer apply. Intermediate features are abstract, sparse, and task-specific, making perceptual fidelity irrelevant. In this paper, we investigate the use of Versatile Video Coding (VVC) for compressing such features under the MPEG-AI Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) standard. We perform a tool-level analysis to understand the impact of individual coding components on compression efficiency and downstream vision task accuracy. Based on these insights, we propose three lightweight essential VVC profiles-Fast, Faster, and Fastest. The Fast profile provides 2.96% BD-Rate gain while reducing encoding time by 21.8%. Faster achieves a 1.85% BD-Rate gain with a 51.5% speedup. Fastest reduces encoding time by 95.6% with only a 1.71% loss in BD-Rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86VVC\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7f16\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5206\u5272\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e2d\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u6027\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u611f\u77e5\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u518d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u65b0\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u5177\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76VVC\u5728MPEG-AI FCM\u6807\u51c6\u4e0b\u538b\u7f29\u4e2d\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u79cdVVC\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "Fast\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e862.96%\u7684BD-Rate\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1121.8%\uff1bFaster\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b01.85% BD-Rate\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534751.5%\uff1bFastest\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u7f16\u7801\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1195.6%\uff0cBD-Rate\u4ec5\u635f\u59311.71%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684VVC\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\uff08Fast\u3001Faster\u3001Fastest\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7f16\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Conventional latent world models typically employ monolithic neural networks that enforce global continuity, inevitably over-smoothing the distinct dynamic modes (e.g., sticking vs. sliding, flight vs. stance). For a planner, this smoothing results in catastrophic compounding errors during long-horizon lookaheads, rendering the search process unreliable at physical boundaries. To address this, we introduce the Prismatic World Model (PRISM-WM), a structured architecture designed to decompose complex hybrid dynamics into composable primitives. PRISM-WM leverages a context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework where a gating mechanism implicitly identifies the current physical mode, and specialized experts predict the associated transition dynamics. We further introduce a latent orthogonalization objective to ensure expert diversity, effectively preventing mode collapse. By accurately modeling the sharp mode transitions in system dynamics, PRISM-WM significantly reduces rollout drift. Extensive experiments on challenging continuous control benchmarks, including high-dimensional humanoids and diverse multi-task settings, demonstrate that PRISM-WM provides a superior high-fidelity substrate for trajectory optimization algorithms (e.g., TD-MPC), proving its potential as a powerful foundational model for next-generation model-based agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "PRISM-WM\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u5206\u89e3\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7269\u7406\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u8fde\u7eed\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u63a5\u89e6\u548c\u78b0\u649e\uff09\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u4e00\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u548c\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002", "method": "PRISM-WM\u91c7\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08MoE\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u8bc6\u522b\u5f53\u524d\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u7531\u4e13\u95e8\u4e13\u5bb6\u9884\u6d4b\u76f8\u5173\u8fc7\u6e21\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u6f5c\u5728\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u786e\u4fdd\u4e13\u5bb6\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u62ec\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPRISM-WM\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5982TD-MPC\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "PRISM-WM\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e3a\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u57fa\u5143\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6eda\u52a8\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Common open-source simulators like CARLA are extensively used in training, evaluation, and software-in-the-loop testing of new automated driving algorithms.

The goal of this work is therefore to create a simulation framework for testing the automation software on its dedicated hardware and identifying its limits. Achieving this goal would greatly benefit the open-source development workflow of automated driving functions, designating CARLA as a consistent evaluation tool along the entire development process.

Yet a critical question remains: is such reasoning genuinely grounded in visual evidence and logically coherent? Existing benchmarks emphasize generation but neglect verification, i.e., the capacity to assess whether a reasoning chain is both visually consistent and logically valid. To fill this gap, we introduce MM-CoT, a diagnostic benchmark specifically designed to probe the visual grounding and logical coherence of CoT reasoning in MMs. Instead of generating free-form explanations, models must select the sole event chain that satisfies two orthogonal constraints: (i) visual consistency, ensuring all steps are anchored in observable evidence, and (ii) logical coherence, ensuring causal and commonsense validity. Adversarial distractors are engineered to violate one of these constraints, exposing distinct reasoning failures. We evaluate leading vision-language models on MM-CoT and find that even the most advanced systems struggle, revealing a sharp discrepancy between generative fluency and true reasoning fidelity. MM-CoT shows low correlation with existing benchmarks, confirming that it measures a unique combination of visual grounding and logical reasoning.

As AI systems increasingly influence high-stakes domains including healthcare, finance, and public policy, the alignment problem--ensuring AI behavior corresponds with human values and intentions--has become critical. Current approaches predominantly optimize technical performance metrics while neglecting the sociotechnical dimensions of AI deployment. IDAIF addresses this gap by establishing a systematic mapping between ToC's five-stage model (Inputs-Activities-Outputs-Outcomes-Impact) and corresponding AI architectural layers (Data Layer-Pipeline Layer-Inference Layer-Agentic Layer-Normative Layer). Each layer incorporates rigorous theoretical foundations: multi-objective Pareto optimization for value alignment, hierarchical multi-agent orchestration for outcome achievement, causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for hallucination mitigation, and adversarial debiasing with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for fairness assurance.

However, a critical challenge arises from severe distribution shifts between robotic action data, primarily due to substantial numerical variations in action commands across diverse robotic platforms and tasks, hindering the effective transfer of pretrained knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose a semantically grounded linguistic representation to normalize actions for efficient pretraining. Unlike conventional discretized action representations that are sensitive to numerical scales, the motion representation specifically disregards numeric scale effects, emphasizing directionality instead. This abstraction mitigates distribution shifts, yielding a more generalizable pretraining representation.

RGB-D and stereo vision sensors are widely used for this purpose, but the depth maps they produce are often noisy, incomplete, or biased due to sensor limitations and environmental conditions. Depth completion methods aim to generate dense, reliable depth maps from RGB images and sparse depth input. However, a key limitation in current depth completion pipelines is the unrealistic generation of sparse depth: sparse pixels are typically selected uniformly at random from dense ground-truth depth, ignoring the fact that real sensors exhibit geometry-dependent and spatially nonuniform reliability. In this work, we propose a normal-guided sparse depth sampling strategy that leverages PCA-based surface normal estimation on the RGB-D point cloud to compute a per-pixel depth reliability measure. The sparse depth samples are then drawn according to this reliability distribution. We integrate this sampling method with the Marigold-DC diffusion-based depth completion model and evaluate it on NYU Depth v2 using the standard metrics.

To study the process of skill acquisition under fully controlled conditions, we bypass human subjects. Instead, we directly interface a generalist reinforcement learning agent with a spinning cylinder in a tabletop circulating water channel to maximize or minimize drag. This setup has several desirable properties. First, it is a physical system, with the rich interactions and complex dynamics that only the physical world has: the flow is highly chaotic and extremely difficult, if not impossible, to model or simulate accurately. Second, the objective -- drag minimization or maximization -- is easy to state and can be captured directly in the reward, yet good strategies are not obvious beforehand. Third, decades-old experimental studies provide recipes for simple, high-performance open-loop policies. Finally, the setup is inexpensive and far easier to reproduce than human studies. In our experiments we find that high-dimensional flow feedback lets the agent discover high-performance drag-control strategies with only minutes of real-world interaction. When we later replay the same action sequences without any feedback, we obtain almost identical performance. This shows that feedback, and in particular flow feedback, is not needed to execute the learned policy. Surprisingly, without flow feedback during training the agent fails to discover any well-performing policy in drag maximization, but still succeeds in drag minimization, albeit more slowly and less reliably. Our studies show that learning a high-performance skill can require richer information than executing it, and learning conditions can be kind or wicked depending solely on the goal, not on dynamics or policy complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b66\u4e60\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u597d\u574f\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u52a8\u6001\u6216\u7b56\u7565\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u5916\u90e8\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u6280\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u901a\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0e\u684c\u9762\u5faa\u73af\u6c34\u901a\u9053\u4e2d\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u5706\u67f1\u4f53\u76f4\u63a5\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6216\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u963b\u529b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u53d7\u63a7\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u83b7\u53d6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6d41\u52a8\u53cd\u9988\u4f7f\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4ec5\u51e0\u5206\u949f\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u963b\u529b\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u6d41\u52a8\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u963b\u529b\u6700\u5927\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u672a\u80fd\u53d1\u73b0\u4efb\u4f55\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u963b\u529b\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u80fd\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u901f\u5ea6\u8f83\u6162\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6280\u80fd\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u6bd4\u6267\u884c\u6280\u80fd\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u597d\u574f\u53ef\u80fd\u4ec5\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u52a8\u6001\u6216\u7b56\u7565\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002"}}

Unlike most existing methods, the proposed approach relies solely on observable information about other robots, eliminating the necessity of excessive communication use. The computationally efficient algorithm for computing RVCs, together with the direct integration of these constraints into NMPC problem formulation on a controller level, allows the whole pipeline to run at 100 Hz. This high processing rate, combined with modeled nonlinear dynamics of the controlled Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), is a key feature that facilitates the use of the proposed approach for an agile UAV flight. The proposed approach was evaluated through extensive simulations emulating real-world conditions in scenarios involving up to 10 UAVs and velocities of up to 25 m/s, and in real-world experiments with accelerations up to 30 m/s$^2$.

This bottleneck stems from a deep-rooted dependency on computationally prohibitive view transformations and bespoke, platform-specific kernels. This paper introduces FastBEV++, a framework engineered to reconcile this tension, demonstrating that high performance and deployment efficiency can be achieved in unison via two guiding principles: Fast by Algorithm and Deployable by Design. We realize the \"Deployable by Design\" principle through a novel view transformation paradigm that decomposes the monolithic projection into a standard Index-Gather-Reshape pipeline. Enabled by a deterministic pre-sorting strategy, this transformation is executed entirely with elementary, operator native primitives (e.g Gather, Matrix Multiplication), which eliminates the need for specialized CUDA kernels and ensures fully TensorRT-native portability. Concurrently, our framework is \"Fast by Algorithm\", leveraging this decomposed structure to seamlessly integrate an end-to-end, depth-aware fusion mechanism. This jointly learned depth modulation, further bolstered by temporal aggregation and robust data augmentation, significantly enhances the geometric fidelity of the BEV representation.Empirical validation on the nuScenes benchmark corroborates the efficacy of our approach. FastBEV++ establishes a new state-of-the-art 0.359 NDS while maintaining exceptional real-time performance, exceeding 134 FPS on automotive-grade hardware (e.g Tesla T4). By offering a solution that is free of custom plugins yet highly accurate, FastBEV++ presents a mature and scalable design philosophy for production autonomous systems.

Our approach builds upon the general multi-modal reasoning capabilities of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), progressively extending them to embodied reasoning and action prediction, and ultimately towards structured reasoning and reasoning-action alignment. This results in a three-stage pre-training pipeline: (1) Continued VLM pre-training on curated vision-language data to enhance embodied reasoning skills such as planning, spatial understanding, and trajectory prediction; (2) Co-training on cross-embodiment robot data alongside vision-language data; and (3) Action training with reasoning process on trajectories collected on Astribot S1, a bimanual mobile manipulator with human-like dexterity and agility. Finally, we integrate reinforcement learning to further refine reasoning-action consistency and close the loop between semantic inference and motor control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Lumo-1 achieves significant performance improvements in embodied vision-language reasoning, a critical component for generalist robotic control.

Traditional approaches face a trade-off: continuous compression dilutes high-level semantics such as object identities, while discrete quantization loses fine-grained details such as textures. We introduce HTC-VLM, a hybrid framework that disentangles semantics and appearance through dual channels, i.e., a continuous pathway for fine-grained details via ViT patches and a discrete pathway for symbolic anchors using MGVQ quantization projected to four tokens. These are fused into a 580-token hybrid sequence and compressed into a single voco token via a disentanglement attention mask and bottleneck, ensuring efficient and grounded representations.

To confront their variable working conditions, transfer learning (TL) emerges as a promising technique for leveraging knowledge from data-rich source working conditions, significantly reducing the training data required for SOH monitoring from target working conditions. However, traditional TL-based SOH monitoring is infeasible when applied in portable mobile devices since substantial computational resources are consumed during the TL stage and unexpectedly reduce the working endurance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight TL-based SOH monitoring approach with constructive incremental transfer learning (CITL). First, taking advantage of the unlabeled data in the target domain, a semi-supervised TL mechanism is proposed to minimize the monitoring residual in a constructive way, through iteratively adding network nodes in the CITL. Second, the cross-domain learning ability of node parameters for CITL is comprehensively guaranteed through structural risk minimization, transfer mismatching minimization, and manifold consistency maximization. Moreover, the convergence analysis of the CITL is given, theoretically guaranteeing the efficacy of TL performance and network compactness. Finally, the proposed approach is verified through extensive experiments with a realistic unmanned air vehicles (UAV) battery dataset collected from dozens of flight missions. Specifically, the CITL outperforms SS-TCA, MMD-LSTM-DA, DDAN, BO-CNN-TL, and AS$^3$LSTM, in SOH estimation by 83.73%, 61.15%, 28.24%, 87.70%, and 57.34%, respectively, as evaluated using the index root mean square error.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684CITL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4fbf\u643a\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u9502\u79bb\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\u7684SOH\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u4fbf\u643a\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u9502\u79bb\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\u7684SOH\u76d1\u6d4b\u9700\u8981\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edfTL\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u800c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684TL\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u534a\u76d1\u7763TL\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u589e\u52a0\u7f51\u7edc\u8282\u70b9\u6765\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u76d1\u6d4b\u6b8b\u5dee\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u98ce\u9669\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u3001\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u548c\u6d41\u5f62\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6700\u5927\u5316\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u4fdd\u969c\u4e86CITL\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "CITL\u5728SOH\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08SS-TCA\u3001MMD-LSTM-DA\u3001DDAN\u3001BO-CNN-TL\u548cAS$^3$LSTM\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u4e8683.73%\u300161.15%\u300128.24%\u300187.70%\u548c57.34%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\uff08TL\uff09\u7684SOH\u76d1\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u6027\u589e\u91cf\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CITL\uff09\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfTL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fbf\u643a\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86CITL\u5728SOH\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Furthermore, for learning global dependencies, Swin Transformer blocks are customized using internal residual pathways, which reinforce gradient stability, refine local patterns, and facilitate global feature fusion. Formerly, for enhancing tissue continuity, ultrasound noise suppressions, and accentuating fine structural transitions Laplacian-of-Gaussian regional operator is applied, and for maintaining the morphological integrity of malignant lesion contours, a boundary-oriented operator has been incorporated. Subsequently, a contraction strategy was applied stage-wise by progressively reducing features-map progressively for capturing scale invariance and enhancing the robustness of structural variability. In addition, each decoder level prior augmentation integrates a new Multi-Scale Channel Attention and Squeezing (MSCAS) module. The MSCAS selectively emphasizes encoder salient maps, retains discriminative global context, and complementary local structures with minimal computational cost while suppressing redundant activations. Finally, the Pixel-Attention module encodes class-relevant spatial cues by adaptively weighing malignant lesion pixels while suppressing background interference. The Residual-SwinCA-Net and existing CNNs/ViTs techniques have been implemented on the publicly available BUSI dataset. The proposed Residual-SwinCA-Net framework outperformed and achieved 99.29% mean accuracy, 98.74% IoU, and 0.9041 Dice for breast lesion segmentation.

Unlike image-derived corruption benchmarks (e.g., SemanticKITTI-C) or simulation-only approaches (e.g., lidarsim), the proposed system preserves per-point geometry, intensity, and temporal structure while applying structured dropout, FoV reduction, Gaussian noise, occlusion masking, sparsification, and motion distortion. The framework features autonomous topic and sensor detection, modular configuration with four severity tiers (light--extreme), and real-time performance (less than 20 ms per frame) compatible with ROS workflows.

Knowledge distillation (KD) can be an appealing framework for transferring rich information from offline models to online models. However, existing KD methods overlook future frames, as they mainly focus on spatial feature distillation under strict frame alignment or on temporal relational distillation, thereby making it challenging for online models to effectively learn future knowledge. To this end, we propose a sparse query-based approach, Future Temporal Knowledge Distillation (FTKD), which effectively transfers future frame knowledge from an offline teacher model to an online student model. Specifically, we present a future-aware feature reconstruction strategy to encourage the student model to capture future features without strict frame alignment. In addition, we further introduce future-guided logit distillation to leverage the teacher's stable foreground and background context.

However, due to challenges inherent to underwater vehicles, such as complex hydrostatics and hydrodynamics, parametric uncertainties, and frequent changes in dynamics due to payload changes, control is challenging. Performance typically relies on carefully tuned controllers targeting unique platform configurations, and a need for re-tuning for deployment under varying payloads and hydrodynamic conditions. As a consequence, agile maneuvering with simultaneous tracking of time-varying references in both translational and rotational DOFs is rarely utilized in practice. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first general zero-shot sim2real deep reinforcement learning-based (DRL) velocity controller enabling path following and agile 6DOF maneuvering with a training duration of just 3 minutes. Sim2Swim, the proposed approach, inspired by state-of-the-art DRL-based position control, leverages domain randomization and massively parallelized training to converge to field-deployable control policies for AUVs of variable characteristics without post-processing or tuning. Sim2Swim is extensively validated in pool trials for a variety of configurations, showcasing robust control for highly agile motions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Sim2Swim\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eDRL\u7684\u901a\u7528AUV\u901f\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8c03\u8c10\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u654f\u63776DOF\u673a\u52a8\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ec5\u97003\u5206\u949f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c34\u4e0b\u8f66\u8f86\u7531\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6d41\u4f53\u9759\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u8f7d\u8377\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u5e73\u53f0\u914d\u7f6e\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u901a\u7528\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9886\u57df\u968f\u673a\u5316\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e76\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Sim2Swim\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DRL\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u6c60\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86Sim2Swim\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u6377\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Sim2Swim\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6216\u8c03\u8c10\u5373\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540cAUV\u7279\u6027\u7684\u901a\u7528\u96f6\u6837\u672csim2real\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u901f\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u654f\u63776DOF\u673a\u52a8\u3002"}}

However, existing metric-based prototype learning methods generate prototypes solely from the support set, without considering their relevance to query data. This often results in prototype bias, where prototypes overfit support-specific characteristics and fail to generalize to the query distribution, especially in the presence of distribution shifts, which leads to degraded segmentation performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Query-aware Hub Prototype (QHP) learning method that explicitly models semantic correlations between support and query sets. Specifically, we propose a Hub Prototype Generation (HPG) module that constructs a bipartite graph connecting query and support points, identifies frequently linked support hubs, and generates query-relevant prototypes that better capture cross-set semantics. To further mitigate the influence of bad hubs and ambiguous prototypes near class boundaries, we introduce a Prototype Distribution Optimization (PDO) module, which employs a purity-reweighted contrastive loss to refine prototype representations by pulling bad hubs and outlier prototypes closer to their corresponding class centers.

Ergodic planning offers a principled framework that balances exploration (visiting all areas) and exploitation (focusing on high-information regions) by planning trajectories such that the time spent in a region is proportional to the amount of information in that region. Existing ergodic planning often oversimplifies the sensing model by assuming a point sensor or a footprint with constant shape and resolution. In practice, the sensor footprint can drastically change over time as the robot moves, such as aerial robots equipped with downward-facing cameras, whose field of view depends on the orientation and altitude. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new metric that accounts for dynamic sensor footprints, analyze the theoretic local optimality conditions, and propose numerical trajectory optimization algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can simultaneously optimize both the trajectories and sensor footprints, with up to an order of magnitude better ergodicity than conventional methods.

Existing methods typically rely on a single prior, which is inherently insufficient to handle multiple degradations, or employ complex network architectures trained on synthetic data, which suffer from poor generalization for diverse real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose Spatial and Frequency Priors (SFP) for real-world scene recovery. In the spatial domain, we observe that the inverse of the degraded image exhibits a projection along its spectral direction that resembles the scene transmission. Leveraging this spatial prior, the transmission map is estimated to recover the scene from scattering degradation. In the frequency domain, a mask is constructed for adaptive frequency enhancement, with two parameters estimated using our proposed novel priors. Specifically, one prior assumes that the mean intensity of the degraded image's direct current (DC) components across three channels in the frequency domain closely approximates that of each channel in the clear image.

By bridging the gap between digital agents and the physical world, See-Control provides a concrete step toward enabling home robots to perform smartphone-dependent tasks in realistic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "See-Control \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u76f4\u63a5\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5e73\u53f0\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5305\u542b\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u51c6\u3001MLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56Android Debug Bridge (ADB)\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728Android\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "See-Control \u5305\u62ec\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a(1) \u5305\u542b155\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684ESO\u57fa\u51c6\u53ca\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff1b(2) \u57fa\u4e8eMLLM\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u65e0\u9700ADB\u6216\u7cfb\u7edf\u540e\u7aef\u8bbf\u95ee\u5373\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u547d\u4ee4\uff1b(3) \u4e30\u5bcc\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "See-Control \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0e\u5e73\u53f0\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "See-Control \u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0e\u5e73\u53f0\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u64cd\u4f5c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u5bb6\u5ead\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6267\u884c\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u52a1\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

Translating exocentric (third-person) videos into egocentric (first-person) videos opens up new possibilities for immersive understanding but remains highly challenging due to extreme camera pose variations and minimal view overlap. This task requires faithfully preserving visible content while synthesizing unseen regions in a geometrically consistent manner. To achieve this, we present EgoX, a novel framework for generating egocentric videos from a single exocentric input. EgoX leverages the pretrained spatio temporal knowledge of large-scale video diffusion models through lightweight LoRA adaptation and introduces a unified conditioning strategy that combines exocentric and egocentric priors via width and channel wise concatenation. Additionally, a geometry-guided self-attention mechanism selectively attends to spatially relevant regions, ensuring geometric coherence and high visual fidelity.

Code is available at: https://github.com/MohamedAlsiagy/dynamic_parameter_est", "summary": "Bridging the sim-to-real gap remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, as accurate dynamic parameter estimation is essential for reliable model-based control, realistic simulation, and safe deployment of manipulators. Traditional analytical approaches often fall short when faced with complex robot structures and interactions. Data-driven methods offer a promising alternative, yet conventional neural networks such as recurrent models struggle to capture long-range dependencies critical for accurate estimation. In this study, we propose a Transformer-based approach for dynamic parameter estimation, supported by an automated pipeline that generates diverse robot models and enriched trajectory data using Jacobian-derived features. The dataset consists of 8,192 robots with varied inertial and frictional properties. Leveraging attention mechanisms, our model effectively captures both temporal and spatial dependencies. Experimental results highlight the influence of sequence length, sampling rate, and architecture, with the best configuration (sequence length 64, 64 Hz, four layers, 32 heads) achieving a validation R2 of 0.8633. Mass and inertia are estimated with near-perfect accuracy, Coulomb friction with moderate-to-high accuracy, while viscous friction and distal link center-of-mass remain more challenging. These results demonstrate that combining Transformers with automated dataset generation and kinematic enrichment enables scalable, accurate dynamic parameter estimation, contributing to improved sim-to-real transfer in robotic systems", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u60ef\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u903c\u771f\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u9762\u524d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5982\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u6d3e\u751f\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u3002\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b8,192\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u60ef\u6027\u548c\u6469\u64e6\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002\u5229\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u914d\u7f6e\uff08\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea664\u300164 Hz\u3001\u56db\u5c42\u300132\u4e2a\u5934\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1R2\u4e3a0.8633\u3002\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u60ef\u91cf\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\uff0c\u5e93\u4ed1\u6469\u64e6\u5177\u6709\u4e2d\u5230\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u7c98\u6027\u6469\u64e6\u548c\u8fdc\u7aef\u8fde\u6746\u8d28\u5fc3\u4f30\u8ba1\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u53ca\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u8f6c\u79fb\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

We present Physics-Aware Video-to-Audio Synthesis (PAVAS), a method that incorporates physical reasoning into a latent diffusion-based V2A generation through the Physics-Driven Audio Adapter (Phy-Adapter). The adapter receives object-level physical parameters estimated by the Physical Parameter Estimator (PPE), which uses a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to infer the moving-object mass and a segmentation-based dynamic 3D reconstruction module to recover its motion trajectory for velocity computation. These physical cues enable the model to synthesize sounds that reflect underlying physical factors. To assess physical realism, we curate VGG-Impact, a benchmark focusing on object-object interactions, and introduce Audio-Physics Correlation Coefficient (APCC), an evaluation metric that measures consistency between physical and auditory attributes. Comprehensive experiments show that PAVAS produces physically plausible and perceptually coherent audio, outperforming existing V2A models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

This enables expert thinking, such as medical diagnostic logic and teaching intuition, to be converted into reusable and scalable public assets, realizing a paradigm shift from \"AI as a tool\" to \"AI as a thinking partner.\" This work not only provides the first engineering proof for \"cognitive equity\" but also opens up a new path for AI governance: constructing a verifiable and intervenable governance paradigm through \"transparency of interaction protocols\" rather than prying into the internal mechanisms of models.

To appear, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1145/3748522.3779970", "summary": "Multi-robot systems performing continuous tasks face a performance trade-off when interrupted by urgent, time-critical sub-tasks. We investigate this trade-off in a scenario where a team must balance area patrolling with locating an anomalous radio signal. To address this trade-off, we evaluate both behavioral heterogeneity through agent role specialization (\"patrollers\" and \"searchers\") and sensing heterogeneity (i.e., only the searchers can sense the radio signal). Through simulation, we identify the Pareto-optimal trade-offs under varying team compositions, with behaviorally heterogeneous teams demonstrating the most balanced trade-offs in the majority of cases. When sensing capability is restricted, heterogeneous teams with half of the sensing-capable agents perform comparably to homogeneous teams, providing cost-saving rationale for restricting sensor payload deployment. Our findings demonstrate that pre-deployment role and sensing specialization are powerful design considerations for multi-robot systems facing time-conflicting tasks, where varying the degree of behavioral heterogeneity can tune system performance toward either task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5de1\u903b\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5f02\u5e38\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u884c\u4e3a\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u56e2\u961f\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6267\u884c\u8fde\u7eed\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u88ab\u7d27\u6025\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u952e\u6027\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u65ad\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u8bc4\u4f30\u884c\u4e3a\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff08\u89d2\u8272\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\uff09\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff08\u4ec5\u641c\u7d22\u8005\u80fd\u611f\u77e5\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u56e2\u961f\u7ec4\u6210\u4e0b\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u884c\u4e3a\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u56e2\u961f\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u5f53\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u534a\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u56e2\u961f\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u56e2\u961f\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u90e8\u7f72\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u65f6\u95f4\u51b2\u7a81\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8003\u91cf\uff0c\u884c\u4e3a\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u53ef\u4ee5\u8c03\u6574\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

The dataset is built with a four-stage pipeline that exploits cross-frame identity priors. (i) Video Curation. We apply resolution and aesthetic filtering to obtain high-quality clips.

We identify four core capabilities of FMs in multi-agent contexts: understanding, planning, efficient communication, and adaptation. Contrary to assumptions about the spontaneous emergence of such abilities, we provide extensive empirical evidence across 41 large language models showing that strong single-agent performance alone does not automatically yield robust multi-agent intelligence.

This opens the question: to what extent do self-play PPO agents learn general coordination strategies grounded in the underlying game, compared to overfitting to their training partners' behaviors? This paper investigates the question using the Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Challenge (HeMAC) environment, which features distinct Observer and Drone agents with complementary capabilities. We introduce Rotating Policy Training (RPT), an approach that rotates heterogeneous teammate policies of different learning algorithms during training, to expose the agent to a broader range of partner strategies. When playing alongside a withheld teammate policy (DDQN), we find that RPT achieves similar performance to a standard self-play baseline, IPPO, where all agents were trained sharing a single PPO policy. This result indicates that in this heterogeneous multi-agent setting, the IPPO baseline generalizes to novel teammate algorithms despite not experiencing teammate diversity during training. This shows that a simple IPPO baseline may possess the level of generalization to novel teammates that a diverse training regimen was designed to achieve.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u7684IPPO\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u961f\u53cb\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4e0eRPT\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u81ea\u5b66\u4e60PPO\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u662f\u5426\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u57fa\u4e8e\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u901a\u7528\u534f\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u8fc7\u5ea6\u9002\u5e94\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f19\u4f34\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Rotating Policy Training (RPT)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6e\u6362\u5f02\u6784\u961f\u53cb\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u4ee5\u66b4\u9732\u5176\u4e8e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u961f\u53cb\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "RPT\u5728\u4e0e\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u961f\u53cb\u7b56\u7565\uff08DDQN\uff09\u5408\u4f5c\u65f6\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u81ea\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebfIPPO\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u8868\u660eIPPO\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u672a\u7ecf\u5386\u961f\u53cb\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u7684IPPO\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u5982RPT\uff09\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u961f\u53cb\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

When mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), they benefit from flexible deployment and improved line-of-sight conditions. Despite their promising potential, a comprehensive performance comparison between aerial RIS and STAR-RIS architectures has not been thoroughly investigated. This letter presents a detailed performance comparison between aerial RIS and STAR-RIS in three-dimensional wireless environments. Accurate channel models incorporating directional radiation patterns are established, and the influence of deployment altitude and orientation is thoroughly examined. To optimize the system sum-rate, we formulate joint optimization problems for both architectures and propose an efficient solution based on the weighted minimum mean square error and block coordinate descent algorithms. Simulation results reveal that STAR-RIS outperforms RIS in low-altitude scenarios due to its full-space coverage capability, whereas RIS delivers better performance near the base station at higher altitudes. The findings provide practical insights for the deployment of aerial intelligent surfaces in future 6G communication systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u7a7a\u4e2dRIS\u548cSTAR-RIS\u5728\u4e09\u7ef4\u65e0\u7ebf\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0STAR-RIS\u5728\u4f4e\u7a7a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0cRIS\u5728\u9ad8\u7a7a\u66f4\u4f73\uff0c\u4e3a6G\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1RIS\u548cSTAR-RIS\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u65e0\u7ebf\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u5bb9\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7a7a\u4e2dRIS\u548cSTAR-RIS\u67b6\u6784\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5168\u9762\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u5c1a\u672a\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u5b9a\u5411\u8f90\u5c04\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u4fe1\u9053\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u90e8\u7f72\u9ad8\u5ea6\u548c\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u603b\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e24\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u5236\u5b9a\u4e86\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a0\u6743\u6700\u5c0f\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u5757\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u964d\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cSTAR-RIS\u5728\u4f4e\u7a7a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u5168\u7a7a\u95f4\u8986\u76d6\u80fd\u529b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eRIS\uff0c\u800cRIS\u5728\u57fa\u7ad9\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u9ad8\u7a7a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "STAR-RIS\u5728\u4f4e\u7a7a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eRIS\uff0c\u800cRIS\u5728\u57fa\u7ad9\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u9ad8\u7a7a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f73\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u67656G\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7a7a\u4e2d\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

We demonstrate that a robot policy trained exclusively on human demonstrations collected with OSMO, without any real robot data, is capable of executing a challenging contact-rich manipulation task. By equipping both the human and the robot with the same glove, OSMO minimizes the visual and tactile embodiment gap, enabling the transfer of continuous shear and normal force feedback while avoiding the need for image inpainting or other vision-based force inference. On a real-world wiping task requiring sustained contact pressure, our tactile-aware policy achieves a 72% success rate, outperforming vision-only baselines by eliminating contact-related failure modes.

Existing distribution-matching methods are confined to Euclidean spaces, making them only capture linear structures and overlook the intrinsic geometry of real data, e.g., curvature. However, high-dimensional data often lie on low-dimensional manifolds, suggesting that dataset distillation should have the distilled data manifold aligned with the original data manifold. In this work, we propose a geometry-aware distribution-matching framework, called \\textbf{GeoDM}, which operates in the Cartesian product of Euclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical manifolds, with flat, hierarchical, and cyclical structures all captured by a unified representation. To adapt to the underlying data geometry, we introduce learnable curvature and weight parameters for three kinds of geometries. At the same time, we design an optimal transport loss to enhance the distribution fidelity. Our theoretical analysis shows that the geometry-aware distribution matching in a product space yields a smaller generalization error bound than the Euclidean counterparts. Extensive experiments conducted on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art data distillation methods and remains effective across various distribution-matching strategies for the single geometries.", "AI": {"tldr": "GeoDM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u6d41\u5f62\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u84b8\u998f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5185\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u66f2\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5bf9\u9f50\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u6846\u67b6GeoDM\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u3001\u53cc\u66f2\u548c\u7403\u5f62\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u635f\u5931\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u5e03\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0cGeoDM\u5728\u4e58\u79ef\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u6bd4\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cGeoDM\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5355\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "GeoDM\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u591a\u51e0\u4f55\u6d41\u5f62\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Unlike traditional single model prompting, agentic workflows integrate multiple specialized agents with different Large Language Models(LLMs), tool-augmented capabilities, orchestration logic, and external system interactions to form dynamic pipelines capable of autonomous decision-making and action. As adoption accelerates across industry and research, organizations face a central challenge: how to design, engineer, and operate production-grade agentic AI workflows that are reliable, observable, maintainable, and aligned with safety and governance requirements. This paper provides a practical, end-to-end guide for designing, developing, and deploying production-quality agentic AI systems. We introduce a structured engineering lifecycle encompassing workflow decomposition, multi-agent design patterns, Model Context Protocol(MCP), and tool integration, deterministic orchestration, Responsible-AI considerations, and environment-aware deployment strategies. We then present nine core best practices for engineering production-grade agentic AI workflows, including tool-first design over MCP, pure-function invocation, single-tool and single-responsibility agents, externalized prompt management, Responsible-AI-aligned model-consortium design, clean separation between workflow logic and MCP servers, containerized deployment for scalable operations, and adherence to the Keep it Simple, Stupid (KISS) principle to maintain simplicity and robustness. To demonstrate these principles in practice, we present a comprehensive case study: a multimodal news-analysis and media-generation workflow. By combining architectural guidance, operational patterns, and practical implementation insights, this paper offers a foundational reference to build robust, extensible, and production-ready agentic AI workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7Agentic AI\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5168\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e5d\u5927\u6838\u5fc3\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740Agentic AI\u5728\u884c\u4e1a\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u9762\u4e34\u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u5de5\u7a0b\u5316\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7Agentic AI\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u9700\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u3001\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\uff0c\u5e76\u7b26\u5408\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u5305\u62ec\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u534f\u8bae(MCP)\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u3001\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7f16\u6392\u3001\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efbAI\u8003\u8651\u548c\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u90e8\u7f72\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5185\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5de5\u7a0b\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e5d\u5927\u6838\u5fc3\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b0\u95fb\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5a92\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u539f\u5219\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7Agentic AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5de5\u7a0b\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u548c\u4e5d\u5927\u6838\u5fc3\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u6784\u5efa\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u751f\u4ea7\u5c31\u7eea\u7684Agentic AI\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002"}}

To address these complexities, the development of advanced techniques, especially through the application of deep learning, is essential for the precise and reliable detection of 3D tooth landmarks. In this context, the 3DTeethLand challenge was held in collaboration with the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) in 2024, calling for algorithms focused on teeth landmark detection from intraoral 3D scans.

Existing discovery methods depend on unreliable user descriptions or biased popularity metrics, hindering usability. We present CARLoS, a large-scale framework for characterizing LoRAs without requiring additional metadata. Analyzing over 650 LoRAs, we employ them in image generation over a variety of prompts and seeds, as a credible way to assess their behavior. Using CLIP embeddings and their difference to a base-model generation, we concisely define a three-part representation: Directions, defining semantic shift; Strength, quantifying the significance of the effect; and Consistency, quantifying how stable the effect is. Using these representations, we develop an efficient retrieval framework that semantically matches textual queries to relevant LoRAs while filtering overly strong or unstable ones, outperforming textual baselines in automated and human evaluations.

Recently, existing mainstream Eulerian approaches address amplification-induced noise via decoupling representation learning such as texture, shape and frequancey schemes, but they still struggle to separate photon noise from true micro-motion when motion displacements are very small. We propose GeoDiffMM, a novel diffusion-based Lagrangian VMM framework conditioned on optical flow as a geometric cue, enabling structurally consistent motion magnification. Specifically, we design a Noise-free Optical Flow Augmentation strategy that synthesizes diverse nonrigid motion fields without photon noise as supervision, helping the model learn more accurate geometry-aware optial flow and generalize better. Next, we develop a Diffusion Motion Magnifier that conditions the denoising process on (i) optical flow as a geometry prior and (ii) a learnable magnification factor controlling magnitude, thereby selectively amplifying motion components consistent with scene semantics and structure while suppressing content-irrelevant perturbations. Finally, we perform Flow-based Video Synthesis to map the amplified motion back to the image domain with high fidelity. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets show that GeoDiffMM outperforms state-of-the-art methods and significantly improves motion magnification.", "AI": {"tldr": "GeoDiffMM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u548c\u5149\u6d41\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8fd0\u52a8\u653e\u5927\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u5149\u6d41\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u53bb\u566a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u653e\u5927\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6b27\u62c9\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5fae\u5c0f\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f4d\u79fb\u4e0b\u533a\u5206\u5149\u5b50\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5fae\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8fd0\u52a8\u653e\u5927\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GeoDiffMM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u5149\u6d41\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u6269\u6563\u8fd0\u52a8\u653e\u5927\u5668\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u6d41\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGeoDiffMM\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u653e\u5927\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "GeoDiffMM\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5149\u6d41\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u8fd0\u52a8\u653e\u5927\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5fae\u5c0f\u8fd0\u52a8\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

For the purpose of promoting low-rank structures resulting from strongly correlated color channels, a quaternion nuclear norm regularization term, serving as a natural extension of the conventional matrix nuclear norm to the quaternion domain, is added to the hinge loss in our LSQMM model. An Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based iterative algorithm is designed to effectively resolve the proposed quaternion optimization model.

We introduce a holistic depth-only 6D pose estimation approach that fuses multi-view depth maps into either a fine-grained 3D point cloud in its vanilla version, or a sparse Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF). At the core of our framework lies a staged heatmap mechanism that yields scene-adaptive attention priors across different resolutions, steering computation toward foreground regions, thus keeping memory requirements at high resolutions feasible. Along, we propose a density-aware sparse transformer block that dynamically attends to (self-) occlusions and the non-uniform distribution of 3D data. While sparse 3D approaches has proven effective for long-range perception, its potential in close-range robotic applications remains underexplored. Our framework operates fully sparse, enabling high-resolution volumetric representations to capture fine geometric details crucial for accurate pose estimation in clutter. Our method processes the entire scene integrally, predicting the 6D pose via a novel per-voxel voting strategy, allowing simultaneous pose predictions for an arbitrary number of target objects.

While their empirical effectiveness is known, the internal structure, detectability, and representational behavior of these perturbations remain poorly understood. This study provides a systematic, explainable AI analysis using a unified framework that integrates white-box feature-space inspection and black-box signal-level probing. Through latent-space clustering, feature-channel activation analysis, occlusion-based spatial sensitivity mapping, and frequency-domain characterization, we show that protection mechanisms operate as structured, low-entropy perturbations tightly coupled to underlying image content across representational, spatial, and spectral domains. Protected images preserve content-driven feature organization with protection-specific substructure rather than inducing global representational drift. Detectability is governed by interacting effects of perturbation entropy, spatial deployment, and frequency alignment, with sequential protection amplifying detectable structure rather than suppressing it. Frequency-domain analysis shows that Glaze and Nightshade redistribute energy along dominant image-aligned frequency axes rather than introducing diffuse noise. These findings indicate that contemporary image protection operates through structured feature-level deformation rather than semantic dislocation, explaining why protection signals remain visually subtle yet consistently detectable.

Our benchmarks contain samples with the same semantic information in three modalities (image, text, mixed) and we show that state-of-the-art MLLMs cannot consistently reason over these different modalities. We evaluate 15 MLLMs and find that the degree of modality inconsistency varies substantially, even when accounting for problems with text recognition (OCR). Neither rendering text as image nor rendering an image as text solves the inconsistency. Even if OCR is correct, we find that visual characteristics (text colour and resolution, but not font) and the number of vision tokens have an impact on model performance.

However, their effectiveness diminishes significantly in the contexts of low-resource languages. Current multilingual enhancement methods are often limited to text modality or rely solely on machine translation. While such approaches help models acquire basic linguistic capabilities and produce \"thin descriptions\", they neglect the importance of multimodal informativeness and cultural groundedness, both of which are crucial for serving low-resource language users effectively. To bridge this gap, in this study, we identify two significant objectives for a truly effective MLLM in low-resource language settings, namely 1) linguistic capability and 2) cultural groundedness, placing special emphasis on cultural awareness. To achieve these dual objectives, we propose a dual-source strategy that guides the collection of data tailored to each goal, sourcing native web alt-text for culture and MLLM-generated captions for linguistics. As a concrete implementation, we introduce MELLA, a multimodal, multilingual dataset. Experiment results show that after fine-tuning on MELLA, there is a general performance improvement for the eight languages on various MLLM backbones, with models producing \"thick descriptions\".

However, capturing unobstructed videos is challenging since surgeons frequently block the camera field of view. To avoid occlusion, the positions and angles of the camera must be frequently adjusted, which is highly labor-intensive. Prior work has addressed this issue by installing multiple cameras on a shadowless lamp and arranging them to fully surround the surgical area. This setup increases the chances of some cameras capturing an unobstructed view. However, manual image alignment is needed in post-processing since camera configurations change every time surgeons move the lamp for optimal lighting. This paper aims to fully automate this alignment task. The proposed method identifies frames in which the lighting system moves, realigns them, and selects the camera with the least occlusion to generate a video that consistently presents the surgical field from a fixed perspective.

Conventional deep learning-based methods are inherently limited in their ability to adapt to regional heterogeneity within feature representations. Although various adaptive convolution methods have been proposed to address this limitation, they often suffer from excessive computational costs and a limited ability to capture heterogeneous regions in remote sensing images effectively. To overcome these challenges, we propose Bimodal Bi-Adaptive Mask-Aware Convolution (Bi^2MAC), which effectively exploits information from different types of regions while intelligently allocating computational resources. Specifically, we design a lightweight module to generate both soft and hard masks, which are used to modulate the input features preliminarily and to guide different types of regions into separate processing branches, respectively. Redundant features are directed to a compact branch for low-cost global processing. In contrast, heterogeneous features are routed to a focused branch that invests more computational resources for fine-grained modeling.

Conventional segmentation architectures like U-Net rely on convolution operators that are not rotation-invariant, leading to degraded segmentation accuracy across varying viewpoints. Rotation invariance can be achieved by expanding the filter bank across multiple orientations; however, this will significantly increase computational cost and memory traffic. In this paper, we introduce a GPU-optimized rotation-invariant convolution framework that eliminates the traditional data-lowering (im2col) step required for matrix-multiplication-based convolution. By exploiting structured data sharing among symmetrically rotated filters, our method achieves multi-orientation convolution with greatly reduced memory traffic and computational redundancy. We further generalize the approach to accelerate convolution with arbitrary (non-symmetric) rotation angles.\n  Across extensive benchmarks, the proposed convolution achieves 20--55% faster training and 15--45% lower energy consumption than CUDNN, while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art rotation-invariant methods. In the eight-orientation setting, our approach achieves up to 45% speedup and 41% energy savings on 256\\(\\times\\)256 inputs, and 32% speedup and 23% lower energy usage on 1024\\(\\times\\)1024 inputs.

We introduce Lighting-driven Dynamic Active Sensing (LiDAS), a closed-loop active illumination system that combines off-the-shelf visual perception models with high-definition headlights. Rather than uniformly brightening the scene, LiDAS dynamically predicts an optimal illumination field that maximizes downstream perception performance, i.e., decreasing light on empty areas to reallocate it on object regions. LiDAS enables zero-shot nighttime generalization of daytime-trained models through adaptive illumination control.

Motivated by this, we propose DINO-BOLDNet, a DINOv3-guided multi-slice attention framework that integrates a frozen self-supervised DINOv3 encoder with a lightweight trainable decoder. The model uses DINOv3 to extract within-slice structural representations, and a separate slice-attention module to fuse contextual information across neighboring slices. A multi-scale generation decoder then restores fine-grained functional contrast, while a DINO-based perceptual loss encourages structural and textural consistency between predictions and ground-truth BOLD in the transformer feature space. Experiments on a clinical dataset of 248 subjects show that DINO-BOLDNet surpasses a conditional GAN baseline in both PSNR and MS-SSIM.

However, we argue that the existing monocular 3D tracking methods still fall short in separating the camera motion from foreground dynamic motion and cannot densely track newly emerging dynamic subjects in the videos. To address these two limitations, we propose TrackingWorld, a novel pipeline for dense 3D tracking of almost all pixels within a world-centric 3D coordinate system. First, we introduce a tracking upsampler that efficiently lifts the arbitrary sparse 2D tracks into dense 2D tracks. Then, to generalize the current tracking methods to newly emerging objects, we apply the upsampler to all frames and reduce the redundancy of 2D tracks by eliminating the tracks in overlapped regions. Finally, we present an efficient optimization-based framework to back-project dense 2D tracks into world-centric 3D trajectories by estimating the camera poses and the 3D coordinates of these 2D tracks. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our system achieves accurate and dense 3D tracking in a world-centric coordinate frame.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTrackingWorld\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bc6\u96c63D\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u65b0\u7269\u4f53\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u76ee3D\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u79bb\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u524d\u666f\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u53ca\u5bc6\u96c6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b0\u51fa\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5f15\u5165\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u5c06\u7a00\u758f2D\u8f68\u8ff9\u63d0\u5347\u4e3a\u5bc6\u96c62D\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u5e27\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u5bc6\u96c62D\u8f68\u8ff9\u53cd\u5411\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u5fc33D\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u5bc6\u96c6\u76843D\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684TrackingWorld\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u5bc6\u96c6\u76843D\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u79bb\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u524d\u666f\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u53ca\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b0\u51fa\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

However, their reliance on the ubiquitous Pre-Norm architecture introduces a subtle yet critical flaw: a severe norm disparity between the high-norm visual tokens and the low-norm text tokens. In this work, we present a formal theoretical analysis demonstrating that this imbalance is not a static issue. Instead, it induces an ``asymmetric update dynamic,'' where high-norm visual tokens exhibit a ``representational inertia,'' causing them to transform semantically much slower than their textual counterparts. This fundamentally impairs effective cross-modal feature fusion. Our empirical validation across a range of mainstream MLLMs confirms that this theoretical dynamic -- the persistence of norm disparity and the resulting asymmetric update rates -- is a prevalent phenomenon. Based on this insight, we propose a remarkably simple yet effective solution: inserting a single, carefully initialized LayerNorm layer after the visual projector to enforce norm alignment. Experiments conducted on the LLaVA-1.5 architecture show that this intervention yields significant performance gains not only on a wide suite of multimodal benchmarks but also, notably, on text-only evaluations such as MMLU, suggesting that resolving the architectural imbalance leads to a more holistically capable model.", "AI": {"tldr": "MLLMs\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u8303\u6570\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u66f4\u65b0\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0LayerNorm\u5c42\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "MLLMs\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u8303\u6570\u5dee\u5f02\u5f15\u53d1\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u66f4\u65b0\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u540e\u63d2\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cbe\u5fc3\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684LayerNorm\u5c42\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f3a\u5236\u8303\u6570\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728LLaVA-1.5\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ca\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08\u5982MMLU\uff09\u4e0a\u5747\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0MLLMs\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u8303\u6570\u5dee\u5f02\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u66f4\u65b0\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u2014\u2014\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u540e\u6dfb\u52a0LayerNorm\u5c42\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Although numerous methods have been proposed to enhance image quality, they either significantly amplify inherent noise or are only effective under specific illumination conditions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for simultaneous enhancement and noise suppression under complex illumination conditions. Firstly, a gradient-domain weighted guided filter (GDWGIF) is employed to accurately estimate illumination and improve image quality. Next, the Retinex model is applied to decompose the captured image into separate illumination and reflection layers. These layers undergo parallel processing, with the illumination layer being corrected to optimize lighting conditions and the reflection layer enhanced to improve image quality. Finally, the dynamic range of the image is optimized through multi-exposure fusion and a linear stretching strategy. The proposed method is evaluated on real-world datasets obtained from practical applications.

With the recent adoption of Electronic Monitoring (EM) systems, more video data is now being collected than can be feasibly reviewed manually. This paper addresses this challenge by developing an optimized deep learning pipeline for automated fish re-identification (Re-ID) using the novel AutoFish dataset, which simulates EM systems with conveyor belts with six similarly looking fish species. We demonstrate that key Re-ID metrics (R1 and mAP@k) are substantially improved by using hard triplet mining in conjunction with a custom image transformation pipeline that includes dataset-specific normalization. By employing these strategies, we demonstrate that the Vision Transformer-based Swin-T architecture consistently outperforms the Convolutional Neural Network-based ResNet-50, achieving peak performance of 41.65% mAP@k and 90.43% Rank-1 accuracy. An in-depth analysis reveals that the primary challenge is distinguishing visually similar individuals of the same species (Intra-species errors), where viewpoint inconsistency proves significantly more detrimental than partial occlusion.

While recent image-based HMR methods such as SAM 3D Body achieve strong robustness on in-the-wild images, they rely on per-frame inference when applied to videos, leading to temporal inconsistency and degraded performance under occlusions. We address these issues without extra training by leveraging the inherent human continuity in videos. We propose SAM-Body4D, a training-free framework for temporally consistent and occlusion-robust HMR from videos. We first generate identity-consistent masklets using a promptable video segmentation model, then refine them with an Occlusion-Aware module to recover missing regions.

Compared with existing video RAG methods, OneClip-RAG makes full use of the merits of video clips for augmented video understanding in terms of both knowledge integrity and semantic coherence. Besides, it is also equipped with a novel query-guided video chunking algorithm that can unify clip chunking and cross-modal retrieval in one processing step, avoiding redundant computations. To improve instruction following, we further propose a new dataset called SynLongVideo and design a progressive training regime for OneClip-RAG. OneClip-RAG is plugged into five recent MLLMs and validated on a set of long-video benchmarks. Experimental results not only show the obvious performance gains by OneClip-RAG over MLLMs, e.g., boosting InternLV2 8B and Qwen2-VL 7B to the level of GPT-4o on MLVU, but also show its superior efficiency in handling long videos. e.g., enabling LLaVA-Video understand up to an hour of videos in less than 2.2 minutes on a single 4090 GPU.", "AI": {"tldr": "OneClip-RAG\u901a\u8fc7\u67e5\u8be2\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5757\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347MLLMs\u5904\u7406\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8eGPT-4o\u4e14\u5904\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6781\u5feb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u56e0\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u4ec5\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u6709\u9650\u5e27\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOneClip-RAG\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5757\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efaSynLongVideo\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1OneClip-RAG\u5728\u591a\u4e2aMLLMs\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5982InternLV2 8B\u548cQwen2-VL 7B\u5728MLVU\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230GPT-4o\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4e14\u5904\u7406\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "OneClip-RAG\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5904\u7406\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230GPT-4o\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u5982\u5355\u53614090 GPU\u4e0b2.2\u5206\u949f\u5185\u5904\u74061\u5c0f\u65f6\u89c6\u9891\u3002"}}

Existing approaches typically fine-tune natural foundation models (e.g., SAM) with limited supervision, functioning merely as domain adapters rather than surgical foundation models. Consequently, they struggle to generalize across the vast variability of surgical targets. To bridge this gap, we present LapFM, a foundation model designed to evolve robust segmentation capabilities from massive unlabeled surgical images. Distinct from medical foundation models relying on inefficient self-supervised proxy tasks, LapFM leverages a Hierarchical Concept Evolving Pre-training paradigm. First, we establish a Laparoscopic Concept Hierarchy (LCH) via a hierarchical mask decoder with parent-child query embeddings, unifying diverse entities (i.e., Anatomy, Tissue, and Instrument) into a scalable knowledge structure with cross-granularity semantic consistency. Second, we propose a Confidence-driven Evolving Labeling that iteratively generates and filters pseudo-labels based on hierarchical consistency, progressively incorporating reliable samples from unlabeled images into training. This process yields LapBench-114K, a large-scale benchmark comprising 114K image-mask pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LapFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing new standards for granularity-adaptive generalization in universal laparoscopic segmentation.

While these methods perform well in in-distribution (ID) settings, their behavior under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions remains poorly understood. Through extensive experiments across multiple ID-OOD sets, we find that reliability of the existing subset based methods degrades markedly, yielding redundant, unstable, and uncertainty-sensitive explanations. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a framework that combines submodular subset selection with layer-wise, gradient-based uncertainty estimation to improve robustness and fidelity without requiring additional training or auxiliary models. Our approach estimates uncertainty via adaptive weight perturbations and uses these estimates to guide submodular optimization, ensuring diverse and informative subset selection. Empirical evaluations show that, beyond mitigating the weaknesses of existing methods under OOD scenarios, our framework also yields improvements in ID settings.

This paper presents a lightweight SAM-based tracking method combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with CSRT trackers and jersey color-based appearance models. We propose a team-aware tracking system that uses SAM for precise initialization and HSV histogram-based re-identification to improve occlusion recovery. Our evaluation measures three dimensions: processing speed (FPS and memory), tracking accuracy (success rate and box stability), and robustness (occlusion recovery and identity consistency). Experiments on football video sequences show that the approach achieves 7.6-7.7 FPS with stable memory usage (~1880 MB), maintaining 100 percent tracking success in light occlusions and 90 percent in crowded penalty-box scenarios with 5 or more players. Appearance-based re-identification recovers 50 percent of heavy occlusions, demonstrating the value of domain-specific cues. Analysis reveals key trade-offs: the SAM + CSRT combination provides consistent performance across crowd densities but struggles with long-term occlusions where players leave the frame, achieving only 8.66 percent re-acquisition success. These results offer practical guidelines for deploying football tracking systems under resource constraints, showing that classical tracker-based methods work well with continuous visibility but require stronger re-identification mechanisms for extended absences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408SAM\u548cCSRT\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8db3\u7403\u8fd0\u52a8\u5458\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u906e\u6321\u4ecd\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u8db3\u7403\u8fd0\u52a8\u5458\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5728\u62e5\u6324\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u9891\u7e41\u906e\u6321\u3001\u76f8\u4f3c\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86Segment Anything Model\uff08SAM\uff09\u548cCSRT\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u7403\u8863\u989c\u8272\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u56e2\u961f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528SAM\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eHSV\u76f4\u65b9\u56fe\u7684\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u906e\u6321\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8db3\u7403\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e867.6-7.7 FPS\u7684\u5904\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u7a33\u5b9a\uff08\u7ea61880 MB\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u8f7b\u5ea6\u906e\u6321\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301100%\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u62e5\u6324\u7684\u7981\u533a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff085\u540d\u6216\u66f4\u591a\u7403\u5458\uff09\u8fbe\u523090%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002\u5916\u89c2\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u6062\u590d\u4e8650%\u7684\u91cd\u5ea6\u906e\u6321\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u906e\u6321\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u91cd\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ec5\u4e3a8.66%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eSAM\u548cCSRT\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u90e8\u7f72\u8db3\u7403\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u906e\u6321\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Despite existing methods having made notable progress, they still fail to fully exploit the contextual information in the reference image, including fine-grained texture details, leading to edits with limited coherence and fidelity. To address this challenge, we introduce ContextDrag, a new paradigm for drag-based editing that leverages the strong contextual modeling capability of editing models, such as FLUX-Kontext. By incorporating VAE-encoded features from the reference image, ContextDrag can leverage rich contextual cues and preserve fine-grained details, without the need for finetuning or inversion. Specifically, ContextDrag introduced a novel Context-preserving Token Injection (CTI) that injects noise-free reference features into their correct destination locations via a Latent-space Reverse Mapping (LRM) algorithm. This strategy enables precise drag control while preserving consistency in both semantics and texture details. Second, ContextDrag adopts a novel Position-Consistent Attention (PCA), which positional re-encodes the reference tokens and applies overlap-aware masking to eliminate interference from irrelevant reference features. Extensive experiments on DragBench-SR and DragBench-DR demonstrate that our approach surpasses all existing SOTA methods.

Yet, generation unfolds along a trajectory, and analyzing this dynamic process is crucial for understanding how controllable, reliable, and predictable these models are in terms of their success/failure modes. In this work, we ask the question: when does noise turn into a specific concept (e.g., age) and lock in the denoising trajectory? We propose PCI (Prompt-Conditioned Intervention) to study this question. PCI is a training-free and model-agnostic framework for analyzing concept dynamics through diffusion time. The central idea is the analysis of Concept Insertion Success (CIS), defined as the probability that a concept inserted at a given timestep is preserved and reflected in the final image, offering a way to characterize the temporal dynamics of concept formation. Applied to several state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models and a broad taxonomy of concepts, PCI reveals diverse temporal behaviors across diffusion models, in which certain phases of the trajectory are more favorable to specific concepts even within the same concept type. These findings also provide actionable insights for text-driven image editing, highlighting when interventions are most effective without requiring access to model internals or training, and yielding quantitatively stronger edits that achieve a balance of semantic accuracy and content preservation than strong baselines.

While on-the-fly extensions of 3DGS have shown promise for real-time reconstruction from monocular RGB streams, they often fail to achieve complete 3D coverage due to the limited field of view (FOV). Employing a multi-camera rig fundamentally addresses this limitation. In this paper, we present the first on-the-fly 3D reconstruction framework for multi-camera rigs. Our method incrementally fuses dense RGB streams from multiple overlapping cameras into a unified Gaussian representation, achieving drift-free trajectory estimation and efficient online reconstruction. We propose a hierarchical camera initialization scheme that enables coarse inter-camera alignment without calibration, followed by a lightweight multi-camera bundle adjustment that stabilizes trajectories while maintaining real-time performance. Furthermore, we introduce a redundancy-free Gaussian sampling strategy and a frequency-aware optimization scheduler to reduce the number of Gaussian primitives and the required optimization iterations, thereby maintaining both efficiency and reconstruction fidelity. Our method reconstructs hundreds of meters of 3D scenes within just 2 minutes using only raw multi-camera video streams, demonstrating unprecedented speed, robustness, and Fidelity for on-the-fly 3D scene reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u76f8\u673a\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u5b9e\u65f63D\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u76f8\u673a\u534f\u540c\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u901f\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7684\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5355\u76eeRGB\u6d41\u5b9e\u65f6\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u56e0\u6709\u9650\u89c6\u91ce\u5bfc\u81f4\u76843D\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u76f8\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u76f8\u673a\u675f\u8c03\u6574\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5197\u4f59\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u539f\u59cb\u591a\u76f8\u673a\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\uff0c\u57282\u5206\u949f\u5185\u91cd\u5efa\u4e86\u6570\u767e\u7c73\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u76f8\u673a\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u65f63D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u901f\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

We introduce \\textbf{ReasonBreak}, a novel adversarial framework specifically designed to disrupt hierarchical reasoning in MLRMs through concept-aware perturbations. Our approach is founded on the key insight that effective disruption of geographic reasoning requires perturbations aligned with conceptual hierarchies rather than uniform noise. ReasonBreak strategically targets critical conceptual dependencies within reasoning chains, generating perturbations that invalidate specific inference steps and cascade through subsequent reasoning stages. To facilitate this approach, we contribute \\textbf{GeoPrivacy-6K}, a comprehensive dataset comprising 6,341 ultra-high-resolution images ($\\geq$2K) with hierarchical concept annotations. Extensive evaluation across seven state-of-the-art MLRMs (including GPT-o3, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro) demonstrates ReasonBreak's superior effectiveness, achieving a 14.4\\% improvement in tract-level protection (33.8\\% vs 19.4\\%) and nearly doubling block-level protection (33.5\\% vs 16.8\\%).

Despite the success of this architecture, misalignment and hallucinations remain common issues and require automatic misalignment detection tools to improve quality, for example by applying them in a Best-of-N (BoN) post-generation setting. Unfortunately, measuring the alignment after the generation is an expensive step since we need to wait for the overall generation to finish to determine prompt adherence. In contrast, this work hypothesizes that text/image misalignments can be detected early in the denoising process, enabling real-time alignment assessment without waiting for the complete generation.

This work is the first to explore and benchmark prompt-to-latent misalignment detection during image generation using dual encoders in the reverse diffusion process.

To flexibly gather high-quality 3D profiles of the building in diverse resolution, we propose OCCDiff applying latent diffusion in the occupancy function space. Our OCCDiff combines a latent diffusion process with a function autoencoder architecture to generate continuous occupancy functions evaluable at arbitrary locations. Moreover, a point encoder is proposed to provide condition features to diffusion learning, constraint the final occupancy prediction for occupancy decoder, and insert multi-modal features for latent generation to latent encoder. To further enhance the model performance, a multi-task training strategy is employed, ensuring that the point encoder learns diverse and robust feature representations.

However, we observe that existing grounding models exhibit significant coordinate prediction instability, minor visual perturbations (e.g. cropping a few pixels) can drastically alter predictions, flipping results between correct and incorrect. This instability severely undermines model performance, especially for samples with high-resolution and small UI elements. To address this issue, we propose Multi-View Prediction (MVP), a training-free framework that enhances grounding performance through multi-view inference. Our key insight is that while single-view predictions may be unstable, aggregating predictions from multiple carefully cropped views can effectively distinguish correct coordinates from outliers. MVP comprises two components: (1) Attention-Guided View Proposal, which derives diverse views guided by instruction-to-image attention scores, and (2) Multi-Coordinates Clustering, which ensembles predictions by selecting the centroid of the densest spatial cluster.

Our study shows that template-sample similarity (TSS), defined as the resemblance between a text template and an image sample, introduces bias.

We present a framework that uses empty prompts, textual inputs that convey the idea of \"emptiness\" without category information. These prompts capture unbiased template features and offset TSS bias. The framework employs two stages. During pre-training, empty prompts reveal and reduce template-induced bias within the CLIP encoder. During few-shot fine-tuning, a bias calibration loss enforces correct alignment between images and their categories, ensuring the model focuses on relevant visual cues.

Specifically: (1) The entropy-informed speculative strategy encourages draft model to produce higher-entropy representations aligned with target model's entropy characteristics, mitigating entropy mismatch and high rejection rates caused by draft overconfidence. (2) For diffusion decoding, rather than treating it as an independent module, we integrate it into the same end-to-end framework using a dynamic scheduler that prioritizes AR optimization to guide the diffusion part in further steps. The diffusion part is optimized through a joint distillation framework combining trajectory and distribution matching, ensuring stable training and high-quality synthesis with extremely few steps.

This task holds promise for real-world applications such as low-altitude inspection, search-and-rescue, and autonomous aerial delivery. Existing methods often rely on panoramic images, depth inputs, or odometry to support spatial reasoning and action planning. These requirements increase system cost and integration complexity, thus hindering practical deployment for lightweight UAVs. We present a unified aerial VLN framework that operates solely on egocentric monocular RGB observations and natural language instructions. The model formulates navigation as a next-token prediction problem, jointly optimizing spatial perception, trajectory reasoning, and action prediction through prompt-guided multi-task learning. Moreover, we propose a keyframe selection strategy to reduce visual redundancy by retaining semantically informative frames, along with an action merging and label reweighting mechanism that mitigates long-tailed supervision imbalance and facilitates stable multi-task co-training. Extensive experiments on the Aerial VLN benchmark validate the effectiveness of our method.

The key component of diffusion inversion is to minimize errors at each inversion step, thereby mitigating cumulative inaccuracies. Recently, fixed-point iteration has emerged as a widely adopted approach to minimize reconstruction errors at each inversion step. However, it suffers from high computational costs due to its iterative nature and the complexity of hyperparameter selection. To address these issues, we propose an iteration-free fixed-point estimator for diffusion inversion. First, we derive an explicit expression of the fixed point from an ideal inversion step. Unfortunately, it inherently contains an unknown data prediction error. Building upon this, we introduce the error approximation, which uses the calculable error from the previous inversion step to approximate the unknown error at the current inversion step. This yields a calculable, approximate expression for the fixed point, which is an unbiased estimator characterized by low variance, as shown by our theoretical analysis. We evaluate reconstruction performance on two text-image datasets, NOCAPS and MS-COCO.

We treat skin tone as a continuous attribute rather than a categorical label, and employ kernel density estimation (KDE) to model its distribution. We further compare twelve statistical distance metrics to quantify disparities between skin tone distributions and propose a distance-based reweighting (DRW) loss function to correct underrepresentation in minority tones. Experiments across CNN and Transformer models demonstrate: (i) the limitations of categorical reweighting in capturing individual-level disparities, and (ii) the superior performance of distribution-based reweighting, particularly with Fidelity Similarity (FS), Wasserstein Distance (WD), Hellinger Metric (HM), and Harmonic Mean Similarity (HS).

We achieve this by using a sliding time window with short strides and consider the temporal dimension by storing convolution results between passes. This allows us to ignore unchanged regions, significantly reducing the number of convolution operations per forward pass without sacrificing accuracy. This data reuse scheme introduces extreme sparsity to detection data. To exploit this sparsity, we extend our previous work on scatter-based convolutions to allow for data reuse, and as such propose Sparse Scatter-Based Convolution Algorithm with Temporal Data Recycling (SSCATeR). This operation treats incoming LiDAR data as a continuous stream and acts only on the changing parts of the point cloud. By doing so, we achieve the same results with as much as a 6.61-fold reduction in processing time.

First, we discover candidate interpretable patterns in fMRI activity through unsupervised, data-driven decomposition methods. Next, we explain each pattern by identifying the set of natural images that most strongly elicit it and generating a natural-language description of their shared visual meaning. To scale this process, we introduce an automated pipeline that tests multiple candidate explanations, assigns quantitative reliability scores, and selects the most consistent description for each voxel pattern. Our framework reveals thousands of interpretable patterns spanning many distinct visual concepts, including fine-grained representations previously unreported.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u4eba\u7c7b\u76ae\u5c42\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u5927\u8111\u5982\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u89c6\u89c9\u6982\u5ff5\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8868\u793a\u5728\u54ea\u4e9b\u8111\u533a\u7f16\u7801\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u957f\u671f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u5e38\u89c4\u6a21\u5c0f\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u52a8\u68c0\u67e5\u3001\u5173\u6ce8\u7279\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728fMRI\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u5019\u9009\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u80fd\u6fc0\u53d1\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u96c6\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u5176\u5171\u4eab\u89c6\u89c9\u542b\u4e49\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u4eba\u7c7b\u76ae\u5c42\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4ee5\u524d\u672a\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\u3002"}}

However, addressing artifacts and unrealistic regions remains a critical challenge. We propose self-refining diffusion, a novel framework that enhances image generation quality by detecting these flaws. The framework employs an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based flaw highlighter to produce flaw activation maps (FAMs) that identify artifacts and unrealistic regions. These FAMs improve reconstruction quality by amplifying noise in flawed regions during the forward process and by focusing on these regions during the reverse process. The proposed approach achieves up to a 27.3% improvement in Fr\u00e9chet inception distance across various diffusion-based models, demonstrating consistently strong performance on diverse datasets. It also shows robust effectiveness across different tasks, including image generation, text-to-image generation, and inpainting.

The tool is carefully engineered to take advantage of the high-quality rendering of our neural ISP and to enable unlimited post-editable re-rendering. Our method is a fully learning-based framework with variants of different capacities, all of moderate size (ranging from ~0.5 M to ~3.9 M parameters for the entire pipeline), and consistently delivers competitive qualitative and quantitative results across multiple test sets.

This fine-grained, class- and instance-aware adaptation produces more reliable supervision and mitigates error accumulation throughout continual adaptation. Extensive experiments across eight CTTA and TTA scenarios, including synthetic-to-real and long-term shifts, show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, setting a new standard for semantic segmentation under evolving conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7684CTTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u53d8\u5316\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u6216\u6279\u91cf\u7ea7\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u95f4\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u53d7\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5927\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2aCTTA\u548cTTA\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5408\u6210\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u957f\u671f\u504f\u79fb\uff09\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u53d8\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\uff08CTTA\uff09\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\uff08TTA\uff09\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u53d8\u5316\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We used YOLOv8s for object detection and MobileNetV3L for the classification task, evaluating their performance across imaging modalities. The models achieved 91.3% mAP50 for detection and 97% overall accuracy for classification on optical images, whereas the initial performance on greyscale holographic images was substantially lower.

Existing methods fall into two camps: language-only chain-of-thought approaches, which demand large-scale (image, query, answer) supervision, and program-synthesis approaches which use pre-trained models and avoid training, but suffer from flawed logic and erroneous grounding. We propose an annotation-free training framework that improves both reasoning and grounding. Our framework uses AI-powered verifiers: an LLM verifier refines LLM reasoning via reinforcement learning, while a VLM verifier strengthens visual grounding through automated hard-negative mining, eliminating the need for ground truth labels. This design combines the strengths of modern AI systems: advanced language-only reasoning models for decomposing spatial queries into simpler subtasks, and strong vision specialist models improved via performant VLM critics. We evaluate our approach across diverse spatial reasoning tasks, and show that our method improves visual reasoning and surpasses open-source and proprietary models, while with our improved visual grounding model we further outperform recent text-only visual reasoning methods.

With the rising focus on spatial AI in recent years, combining SLAM with semantic understanding has become increasingly important for enabling intelligent perception and interaction.

In this work, we present OpenMonoGS-SLAM, the first monocular SLAM framework that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with open-set semantic understanding. To achieve our goal, we leverage recent advances in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), including MASt3R for visual geometry and SAM and CLIP for open-vocabulary semantics. These models provide robust generalization across diverse tasks, enabling accurate monocular camera tracking and mapping, as well as a rich understanding of semantics in open-world environments. Our method operates without any depth input or 3D semantic ground truth, relying solely on self-supervised learning objectives. Furthermore, we propose a memory mechanism specifically designed to manage high-dimensional semantic features, which effectively constructs Gaussian semantic feature maps, leading to strong overall performance.

However, world models with the ability to predict long-horizon futures from past observations and actions remain underexplored, especially for general-purpose scenarios and various forms of actions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Astra, an interactive general world model that generates real-world futures for diverse scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving, robot grasping) with precise action interactions (e.g., camera motion, robot action). We propose an autoregressive denoising architecture and use temporal causal attention to aggregate past observations and support streaming outputs. We use a noise-augmented history memory to avoid over-reliance on past frames to balance responsiveness with temporal coherence. For precise action control, we introduce an action-aware adapter that directly injects action signals into the denoising process.

From an optical standpoint, perspective-based blur is depth-position-dependent: objects residing at distinct spatial locations incur different blur levels even under the same imaging settings. Inspired by this, we propose a novel method that estimate metric depth by examining the blur pattern of a video stream and dense trajectory via joint optical design algorithm. Specifically, we employ off-the-shelf vision encoder and point tracker to extract video information. Then, we estimate depth map via windowed embedding and multi-window aggregation, and densify the sparse trajectory from the optical algorithm using a vision-language model.

Furthermore, their non-human-like workflows make them difficult for human observers to interpret. To address this, we introduce the Chain-of-Image Generation (CoIG) framework, which reframes image generation as a sequential, semantic process analogous to how humans create art. Similar to the advantages in monitorability and performance that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) brought to large language models (LLMs), CoIG can produce equivalent benefits in text-to-image generation. CoIG utilizes an LLM to decompose a complex prompt into a sequence of simple, step-by-step instructions. The image generation model then executes this plan by progressively generating and editing the image. Each step focuses on a single semantic entity, enabling direct monitoring. We formally assess this property using two novel metrics: CoIG Readability, which evaluates the clarity of each intermediate step via its corresponding output; and Causal Relevance, which quantifies the impact of each procedural step on the final generated image. We further show that our framework mitigates entity collapse by decomposing the complex generation task into simple subproblems, analogous to the procedural reasoning employed by CoT. Our experimental results indicate that CoIG substantially enhances quantitative monitorability while achieving competitive compositional robustness compared to established baseline models.

However, lightweight models often fail to capture fine-grained behavioral cues, resulting in reduced performance on unseen drivers or under varying conditions.

This work addresses the need for a lightweight architecture that overcomes these constraints. We propose Computationally efficient Dynamic region of Interest Routing and domain-invariant Adversarial learning for lightweight driver behavior recognition (C-DIRA). The framework combines saliency-driven Top-K ROI pooling and fused classification for local feature extraction and integration. Dynamic ROI routing enables selective computation by applying ROI inference only to high difficulty data samples. Moreover, pseudo-domain labeling and adversarial learning are used to learn domain-invariant features robust to driver and background variation. Experiments on the State Farm Distracted Driver Detection Dataset show that C-DIRA maintains high accuracy with significantly fewer FLOPs and lower latency than prior lightweight models.

However, these generative methods have been proven to struggle to capture high-level discriminative features effectively, leading to poor performance on linear probing and other downstream tasks. In contrast, contrastive methods excel in discriminative feature representation and generalization ability on image data. Despite this, contrastive learning (CL) in 3D data remains scarce. Besides, simply applying CL methods designed for 2D data to 3D fails to effectively learn 3D local details. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Dual-Branch \\textbf{C}enter-\\textbf{S}urrounding \\textbf{Con}trast (CSCon) framework. Specifically, we apply masking to the center and surrounding parts separately, constructing dual-branch inputs with center-biased and surrounding-biased representations to better capture rich geometric information. Meanwhile, we introduce a patch-level contrastive loss to further enhance both high-level information and local sensitivity. Under the FULL and ALL protocols, CSCon achieves performance comparable to generative methods; under the MLP-LINEAR, MLP-3, and ONLY-NEW protocols, our method attains state-of-the-art results, even surpassing cross-modal approaches.

A Mixture-of-Experts Framework for Semantic Attribute Importance", "comment": null, "summary": "State-of-the-art person re-identification methods achieve impressive accuracy but remain largely opaque, leaving open the question: which high-level semantic attributes do these models actually rely on? We propose MoSAIC-ReID, a Mixture-of-Experts framework that systematically quantifies the importance of pedestrian attributes for re-identification. Our approach uses LoRA-based experts, each linked to a single attribute, and an oracle router that enables controlled attribution analysis. While MoSAIC-ReID achieves competitive performance on Market-1501 and DukeMTMC under the assumption that attribute annotations are available at test time, its primary value lies in providing a large-scale, quantitative study of attribute importance across intrinsic and extrinsic cues. Using generalized linear models, statistical tests, and feature-importance analyses, we reveal which attributes, such as clothing colors and intrinsic characteristics, contribute most strongly, while infrequent cues (e.g. accessories) have limited effect.

However, directly applying these models to Full Surround Monocular Depth Estimation (FSMDE) presents two major challenges: (1) high computational cost, which limits real-time performance, and (2) difficulty in estimating metric-scale depth, as these models are typically trained to predict only relative depth. To address these limitations, we propose a novel knowledge distillation strategy that transfers robust depth knowledge from a foundation model to a lightweight FSMDE network. Our approach leverages a hybrid regression framework combining the knowledge distillation scheme--traditionally used in classification--with a depth binning module to enhance scale consistency. Specifically, we introduce a cross-interaction knowledge distillation scheme that distills the scale-invariant depth bin probabilities of a foundation model into the student network while guiding it to infer metric-scale depth bin centers from ground-truth depth. Furthermore, we propose view-relational knowledge distillation, which encodes structural relationships among adjacent camera views and transfers them to enhance cross-view depth consistency. Experiments on DDAD and nuScenes demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to conventional supervised methods and existing knowledge distillation approaches. Moreover, our method achieves a favorable trade-off between performance and efficiency, meeting real-time requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u73af\u7ed5\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u73af\u7ed5\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u96be\u4ee5\u4f30\u8ba1\u5ea6\u91cf\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e14\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u56de\u5f52\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u7bb1\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4ea4\u53c9\u4e92\u52a8\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u5173\u7cfb\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728DDAD\u548cnuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7FSMDE\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5168\u73af\u7ed5\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5ea6\u91cf\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u3002"}}

While these approaches have made progress, they often face challenges in precise localization or require complex pipelines to combine separate modules, especially in remote sensing scenarios where numerous dense and small targets are present. Recently, Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM 3) was proposed, unifying segmentation and recognition in a promptable framework. In this paper, we present a preliminary exploration of applying SAM 3 to the remote sensing OVSS task without any training. First, we implement a mask fusion strategy that combines the outputs from SAM 3's semantic segmentation head and the Transformer decoder (instance head). This allows us to leverage the strengths of both heads for better land coverage. Second, we utilize the presence score from the presence head to filter out categories that do not exist in the scene, reducing false positives caused by the vast vocabulary sizes and patch-level processing in geospatial scenes. We evaluate our method on extensive remote sensing datasets. Experiments show that this simple adaptation achieves promising performance, demonstrating the potential of SAM 3 for remote sensing OVSS.

However, the problem of sign-to-sign retrieval or detecting a specific sign within a sequence of continuous signs remains largely unexplored. We define this novel task as Sign Language Spotting. In this paper, we present a first step toward sign language retrieval by addressing the challenge of detecting the presence or absence of a query sign video within a sentence-level gloss or sign video. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on intermediate gloss recognition or text-based matching, we propose an end-to-end model that directly operates on pose keypoints extracted from sign videos. Our architecture employs an encoder-only backbone with a binary classification head to determine whether the query sign appears within the target sequence. By focusing on pose representations instead of raw RGB frames, our method significantly reduces computational cost and mitigates visual noise. We evaluate our approach on the Word Presence Prediction dataset from the WSLP 2025 shared task, achieving 61.88\\% accuracy and 60.00\\% F1-score.

Code and data available at https://github.com/ali-vilab/Wan-Move", "summary": "We present Wan-Move, a simple and scalable framework that brings motion control to video generative models. Existing motion-controllable methods typically suffer from coarse control granularity and limited scalability, leaving their outputs insufficient for practical use. We narrow this gap by achieving precise and high-quality motion control. Our core idea is to directly make the original condition features motion-aware for guiding video synthesis. To this end, we first represent object motions with dense point trajectories, allowing fine-grained control over the scene. We then project these trajectories into latent space and propagate the first frame's features along each trajectory, producing an aligned spatiotemporal feature map that tells how each scene element should move. This feature map serves as the updated latent condition, which is naturally integrated into the off-the-shelf image-to-video model, e.g., Wan-I2V-14B, as motion guidance without any architecture change. It removes the need for auxiliary motion encoders and makes fine-tuning base models easily scalable. Through scaled training, Wan-Move generates 5-second, 480p videos whose motion controllability rivals Kling 1.5 Pro's commercial Motion Brush, as indicated by user studies.

While a few hypernetwork-based approaches attempt to predict adaptation weights directly, they struggle to map fine-grained user prompts to complex LoRA distributions, limiting their practical applicability. To bridge this gap, we propose LoFA, a general framework that efficiently predicts personalized priors for fast model adaptation. We first identify a key property of LoRA: structured distribution patterns emerge in the relative changes between LoRA and base model parameters. Building on this, we design a two-stage hypernetwork: first predicting relative distribution patterns that capture key adaptation regions, then using these to guide final LoRA weight prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently predicts high-quality personalized priors within seconds, across multiple tasks and user prompts, even outperforming conventional LoRA that requires hours of processing.

Yet today's most successful vision models are non-generative, relying on an encoder that maps images to representations without decoder inversion. This raises the question of whether generation is, in fact, necessary for machines to achieve human-level visual perception. To address this, we study whether generative and non-generative methods can achieve compositional generalization, a hallmark of human perception. Under a compositional data generating process, we formalize the inductive biases required to guarantee compositional generalization in decoder-based (generative) and encoder-based (non-generative) methods. We then show theoretically that enforcing these inductive biases on encoders is generally infeasible using regularization or architectural constraints. In contrast, for generative methods, the inductive biases can be enforced straightforwardly, thereby enabling compositional generalization by constraining a decoder and inverting it. We highlight how this inversion can be performed efficiently, either online through gradient-based search or offline through generative replay. We examine the empirical implications of our theory by training a range of generative and non-generative methods on photorealistic image datasets. We find that, without the necessary inductive biases, non-generative methods often fail to generalize compositionally and require large-scale pretraining or added supervision to improve generalization. By comparison, generative methods yield significant improvements in compositional generalization, without requiring additional data, by leveraging suitable inductive biases on a decoder along with search and replay.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u53cd\u8f6c\uff08\u5982\u68af\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u6216\u751f\u6210\u56de\u653e\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u975e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5426\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u8fd9\u4e00\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u6807\u5fd7\u6027\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u975e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u90e8\u5206\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u90e8\u5206\u5219\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u65bd\u52a0\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5219\u96be\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6216\u67b6\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6548\u679c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u975e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u65bd\u52a0\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u6216\u76d1\u7763\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u975e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u9664\u975e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u989d\u5916\u76d1\u7763\u3002"}}

Accepted to the AAAI 2026 Workshop on Trust and Control in Agentic AI (TrustAgent)", "summary": "Verifiable geometric reasoning is a critical component for trustworthy and controllable agentic AI. Despite impressive capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often fail under realistic scene changes. We present Tri-Bench, a compact benchmark of planar triangle problems that isolates relative geometric reasoning while stressing two deployment-critical factors: camera pose (planar vs. tilted) and scene context via object interference (10 everyday objects). To test verifiability and control, we evaluate four recent VLMs using a single, fixed prompt whose guardrail explicitly describes a surrounding square border, enabling correct answers via homography. We evaluate six simple tasks over binary and continuous targets, and observe that the overall accuracy with respect to 3D ground truth is modest, ~69% on average (best ~75%, worst ~64%). The same responses align even more closely with 2D projections in the image plane, where mean accuracy is ~72%. All four VLMs consistently fail, with accuracy falling to ~0%, on recognizing minority shape classes (equilateral, isosceles, right-angled triangles).

The variety of real-world applications makes it highly challenging to develop a single model capable of unifying the diverse range of input-constrained generation sub-tasks, such as those conditioned by element types, sizes, or their relationships. Current methods either address only a subset of these tasks or necessitate separate model parameters for different conditions, failing to offer a truly unified solution. In this paper, we propose UniLayDiff: a Unified Diffusion Transformer, that for the first time, addresses various content-aware layout generation tasks with a single, end-to-end trainable model. Specifically, we treat layout constraints as a distinct modality and employ Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer framework to capture the complex interplay between the background image, layout elements, and diverse constraints. Moreover, we integrate relation constraints through fine-tuning the model with LoRA after pretraining the model on other tasks. Such a schema not only achieves unified conditional generation but also enhances overall layout quality.

While diffusion models provide strong generative priors for general image restoration, they often produce text hallucinations in text-centric tasks due to the absence of explicit linguistic knowledge. To address this, we propose UniT, a unified text restoration framework that integrates a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), a Vision-Language Model (VLM), and a Text Spotting Module (TSM) in an iterative fashion for high-fidelity text restoration. In UniT, the VLM extracts textual content from degraded images to provide explicit textual guidance. Simultaneously, the TSM, trained on diffusion features, generates intermediate OCR predictions at each denoising step, enabling the VLM to iteratively refine its guidance during the denoising process. Finally, the DiT backbone, leveraging its strong representational power, exploit these cues to recover fine-grained textual content while effectively suppressing text hallucinations. Experiments on the SA-Text and Real-Text benchmarks demonstrate that UniT faithfully reconstructs degraded text, substantially reduces hallucinations, and achieves state-of-the-art end-to-end F1-score performance in TAIR task.", "AI": {"tldr": "UniT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408DiT\u3001VLM\u548cTSM\u7684\u6587\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u663e\u5f0f\u6587\u672c\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u6587\u672c\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u6574\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "UniT\u6846\u67b6\u6574\u5408\u4e86Diffusion Transformer (DiT)\u3001Vision-Language Model (VLM)\u548cText Spotting Module (TSM)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u663e\u5f0f\u6587\u672c\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9010\u6b65\u4f18\u5316OCR\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728SA-Text\u548cReal-Text\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cUniT\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aefF1\u5206\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "UniT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408DiT\u3001VLM\u548cTSM\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This paper introduces D4RT, a simple yet powerful feedforward model designed to efficiently solve this task. D4RT utilizes a unified transformer architecture to jointly infer depth, spatio-temporal correspondence, and full camera parameters from a single video. Its core innovation is a novel querying mechanism that sidesteps the heavy computation of dense, per-frame decoding and the complexity of managing multiple, task-specific decoders. Our decoding interface allows the model to independently and flexibly probe the 3D position of any point in space and time. The result is a lightweight and highly scalable method that enables remarkably efficient training and inference. We demonstrate that our approach sets a new state of the art, outperforming previous methods across a wide spectrum of 4D reconstruction tasks.
