TL;DR: 结合高斯泼溅与UV纹理映射，实现高质量且可编辑的头像重建，支持重光照和直观修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯泼溅技术在头像重建中虽能实现高精度，但缺乏传统三角网格方法的直观编辑性，因此需要一种结合两者优势的方法。

Method: 通过将高斯原语的局部坐标系嵌入到模板网格的UV空间中，从单目视频重建连续可编辑的材质纹理，并利用物理反射模型实现重光照。

Result: 与现有方法相比，该方法在重建准确性、重光照效果及通过纹理映射直观修改外观和几何形状的能力上表现优异。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种结合2D高斯泼溅和UV纹理映射的方法，实现了高质量且可直观编辑的头像重建，并通过物理反射模型支持重光照和材质编辑，展示了其准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Gaussian Splatting have enabled increasingly accurate reconstruction of photorealistic head avatars, opening the door to numerous applications in visual effects, videoconferencing, and virtual reality. This, however, comes with the lack of intuitive editability offered by traditional triangle mesh-based methods. In contrast, we propose a method that combines the accuracy and fidelity of 2D Gaussian Splatting with the intuitiveness of UV texture mapping. By embedding each canonical Gaussian primitive's local frame into a patch in the UV space of a template mesh in a computationally efficient manner, we reconstruct continuous editable material head textures from a single monocular video on a conventional UV domain. Furthermore, we leverage an efficient physically based reflectance model to enable relighting and editing of these intrinsic material maps. Through extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate the accuracy of our reconstructions, the quality of our relighting results, and the ability to provide intuitive controls for modifying an avatar's appearance and geometry via texture mapping without additional optimization.

*Jin Cao,Hong-Xing Yu,Jiajun Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WonderZoom 通过自适应高斯曲面和渐进细节合成器，从单一图像生成多尺度3D场景，性能优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D世界生成模型局限于单一尺度合成，无法生成不同粒度的连贯场景内容，缺乏能够处理不同空间大小的3D表示。

Method: 采用两种关键技术：(1) 自适应高斯曲面用于多尺度3D场景的生成与实时渲染，(2) 渐进细节合成器迭代生成更精细的3D内容。

Result: 实验表明，WonderZoom 在质量和对齐性上显著优于现有视频和3D模型，支持从单一图像创建多尺度3D世界。

Conclusion: WonderZoom 提出了一种创新的多尺度3D场景生成方法，通过自适应高斯曲面和渐进细节合成器，实现了从单一图像生成多尺度3D内容的能力，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: We present WonderZoom, a novel approach to generating 3D scenes with contents across multiple spatial scales from a single image. Existing 3D world generation models remain limited to single-scale synthesis and cannot produce coherent scene contents at varying granularities. The fundamental challenge is the lack of a scale-aware 3D representation capable of generating and rendering content with largely different spatial sizes. WonderZoom addresses this through two key innovations: (1) scale-adaptive Gaussian surfels for generating and real-time rendering of multi-scale 3D scenes, and (2) a progressive detail synthesizer that iteratively generates finer-scale 3D contents. Our approach enables users to "zoom into" a 3D region and auto-regressively synthesize previously non-existent fine details from landscapes to microscopic features. Experiments demonstrate that WonderZoom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art video and 3D models in both quality and alignment, enabling multi-scale 3D world creation from a single image. We show video results and an interactive viewer of generated multi-scale 3D worlds in https://wonderzoom.github.io/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMMs在时间顺序理解上表现不足，MECOT通过事件级微调和思维链提示显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMMs在时间顺序理解上表现不佳，且可能在现有基准上依赖场景先验知识而非实际时间顺序处理。

Method: 提出了MECOT方法，包括（1）基于事件级视频描述的微调和（2）推理时使用思维链提示增强时间感知。

Result: MECOT在VECTOR基准上优于现有方法，并提升了现有视频基准的性能。

Conclusion: MECOT方法通过详细的事件描述和思维链提示显著提升了VLMMs在时间顺序理解上的性能，并在VECTOR基准和现有视频基准上均表现出色。

Abstract: Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs) have shown impressive performance in video understanding, yet their ability to accurately capture the temporal order of multiple events remains underexplored. We interestingly observe that, even when video frames are scrambled, models perform very well on the existing benchmarks by comprehensive experiments. This implies that VLMMs may not necessarily rely on accurate sequential processing of visual events, but instead depend on prior knowledge of typical scenarios to answer the question. To benchmark temporal understanding capabilities in VLMMs, we propose VECTOR, designed to explicitly assess a model's ability to identify the temporal order of events. On this benchmark, we observe that various VLMMs often fail to understand the orders of events. To address this, we propose MECOT (Multi-Event instruction fine-tuning with Chain-of-Thought), which (1) trains models on detailed, event-by-event video descriptions and (2) using chain-of-thought prompts at inference to enhance temporal awareness. MECOT outperforms prior arts on VECTOR as well as improving performance on existing video benchmarks, implying effectiveness of temporal understanding. We release our code, model and datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源方法多限于单图像输入，无法满足真实世界多图像QA任务需求，需开发更强大的视觉代理。

Method: 采用多智能体系统生成挑战性多图像QA对，结合视觉反射和确认工具，以及动作-轨迹两级掩码策略，实现纯强化学习训练。

Result: IMAgent在多图像数据集上取得显著提升，同时在单图像基准上保持良好性能。

Conclusion: IMAgent通过端到端强化学习训练，专为复杂多图像任务设计，显著提升了多图像QA任务的性能，并在现有单图像基准上保持强劲表现。

Abstract: Recent VLM-based agents aim to replicate OpenAI O3's ``thinking with images" via tool use, but most open-source methods limit input to a single image, falling short on real-world multi-image QA tasks. To address this, we propose IMAgent, an open-source vision agent trained via end-to-end reinforcement learning dedicated for complex multi-image tasks. By leveraging a multi-agent system, we generate challenging and visually-rich multi-image QA pairs to fully activate the tool-use potential of the base VLM. Through manual verification, we obtain MIFG-QA, comprising 10k samples for training and evaluation. With deeper reasoning steps, VLMs may increasingly ignore visual inputs. We therefore develop two specialized tools for visual reflection and confirmation, allowing the model to proactively reallocate its attention to image content during inference. Benefiting from our well-designed action-trajectory two-level mask strategy, IMAgent achieves stable tool use behavior via pure RL training without requiring costly supervised fine-tuning data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMAgent maintains strong performance on existing single-image benchmarks while achieving substantial improvements on our proposed multi-image dataset, with our analysis providing actionable insights for the research community. Codes and data will be released soon.

### [5] [Mitigating Bias with Words: Inducing Demographic Ambiguity in Face Recognition Templates by Text Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08981)
*Tahar Chettaoui,Naser Damer,Fadi Boutros*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UTIE通过跨模态特征融合减少人脸识别偏见，实验证明其有效性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸识别系统因面部嵌入中人口统计信息与身份特征的纠缠而存在偏见，导致不同人口统计群体的验证性能差异。

Method: 提出Unified Text-Image Embedding (UTIE)方法，利用视觉语言模型（VLM）的零样本能力和跨模态语义对齐，将其他人口统计群体的文本特征融入面部嵌入，以增强身份相关特征。

Result: 在RFW和BFW基准测试中，UTIE显著降低了偏见指标，同时保持或提升了人脸验证准确性。

Conclusion: UTIE策略通过引入跨人口统计群体的文本特征，有效减少了人脸识别系统中的偏见，同时保持或提升了验证准确性。

Abstract: Face recognition (FR) systems are often prone to demographic biases, partially due to the entanglement of demographic-specific information with identity-relevant features in facial embeddings. This bias is extremely critical in large multicultural cities, especially where biometrics play a major role in smart city infrastructure. The entanglement can cause demographic attributes to overshadow identity cues in the embedding space, resulting in disparities in verification performance across different demographic groups. To address this issue, we propose a novel strategy, Unified Text-Image Embedding (UTIE), which aims to induce demographic ambiguity in face embeddings by enriching them with information related to other demographic groups. This encourages face embeddings to emphasize identity-relevant features and thus promotes fairer verification performance across groups. UTIE leverages the zero-shot capabilities and cross-modal semantic alignment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Given that VLMs are naturally trained to align visual and textual representations, we enrich the facial embeddings of each demographic group with text-derived demographic features extracted from other demographic groups. This encourages a more neutral representation in terms of demographic attributes. We evaluate UTIE using three VLMs, CLIP, OpenCLIP, and SigLIP, on two widely used benchmarks, RFW and BFW, designed to assess bias in FR. Experimental results show that UTIE consistently reduces bias metrics while maintaining, or even improving in several cases, the face verification accuracy.

Method: 采用双目标一致性损失结合地面真实对齐和自适应噪声强调采样策略，优化训练动态。

Result: 在VE-LOL-L数据集上，Consist-Retinex以单步采样实现PSNR 25.51和FID 44.73，优于Diff-Retinex++，且训练成本仅为基准的1/8。

Conclusion: Consist-Retinex通过双目标一致性损失和自适应噪声强调采样策略，首次将一致性模型应用于基于Retinex的低光增强，实现了单步采样的最先进性能，同时大幅降低了训练成本。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in low-light image enhancement through Retinex-based decomposition, yet their requirement for hundreds of iterative sampling steps severely limits practical deployment. While recent consistency models offer promising one-step generation for \textit{unconditional synthesis}, their application to \textit{conditional enhancement} remains unexplored. We present \textbf{Consist-Retinex}, the first framework adapting consistency modeling to Retinex-based low-light enhancement. Our key insight is that conditional enhancement requires fundamentally different training dynamics than unconditional generation standard consistency training focuses on low-noise regions near the data manifold, while conditional mapping critically depends on large-noise regimes that bridge degraded inputs to enhanced outputs. We introduce two core innovations: (1) a \textbf{dual-objective consistency loss} combining temporal consistency with ground-truth alignment under randomized time sampling, providing full-spectrum supervision for stable convergence; and (2) an \textbf{adaptive noise-emphasized sampling strategy} that prioritizes training on large-noise regions essential for one-step conditional generation. On VE-LOL-L, Consist-Retinex achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art performance with single-step sampling} (\textbf{PSNR: 25.51 vs. 23.41, FID: 44.73 vs. 49.59} compared to Diff-Retinex++), while requiring only \textbf{1/8 of the training budget} relative to the 1000-step Diff-Retinex baseline.

### [7] [HSCP: A Two-Stage Spectral Clustering Framework for Resource-Constrained UAV Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08983)
*Maoyu Wang,Yao Lu,Bo Zhou,Zhuangzhi Chen,Yun Lin,Qi Xuan,Guan Gui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HSCP框架通过层级谱聚类剪枝和噪声鲁棒微调，显著提升无人机射频指纹识别性能，实现高压缩率和高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无人机识别方法在复杂环境中难以提取可靠信号特征且实时性不足，深度学习RFFI方法虽提升精度但模型大、计算需求高，难以部署在资源受限的边缘设备上。

Method: HSCP采用层级谱聚类剪枝框架，结合CKA引导的谱聚类进行冗余层和通道的识别与剪枝，并采用噪声鲁棒微调策略确保模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在UAV-M100基准测试中，HSCP在ResNet18上实现了86.39%参数减少和84.44%FLOPs减少，同时精度提升1.49%，并在低信噪比环境中保持优越鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HSCP框架通过结合层级谱聚类剪枝和噪声鲁棒微调策略，显著提升了无人机射频指纹识别的性能，实现了高压缩率、高性能和高效推理。

Abstract: With the rapid development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and the increasing complexity of low-altitude security threats, traditional UAV identification methods struggle to extract reliable signal features and meet real-time requirements in complex environments. Recently, deep learning based Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) approaches have greatly improved recognition accuracy. However, their large model sizes and high computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. While model pruning offers a general solution for complexity reduction, existing weight, channel, and layer pruning techniques struggle to concurrently optimize compression rate, hardware acceleration, and recognition accuracy. To this end, in this paper, we introduce HSCP, a Hierarchical Spectral Clustering Pruning framework that combines layer pruning with channel pruning to achieve extreme compression, high performance, and efficient inference. In the first stage, HSCP employs spectral clustering guided by Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) to identify and remove redundant layers. Subsequently, the same strategy is applied to the channel dimension to eliminate a finer redundancy. To ensure robustness, we further employ a noise-robust fine-tuning strategy. Experiments on the UAV-M100 benchmark demonstrate that HSCP outperforms existing channel and layer pruning methods. Specifically, HSCP achieves $86.39\%$ parameter reduction and $84.44\%$ FLOPs reduction on ResNet18 while improving accuracy by $1.49\%$ compared to the unpruned baseline, and maintains superior robustness even in low signal-to-noise ratio environments.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) underpins applications in healthcare, rehabilitation, fitness tracking, and smart environments, yet existing deep learning approaches demand dataset-specific training, large labeled corpora, and significant computational resources.We introduce RAG-HAR, a training-free retrieval-augmented framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for HAR. RAG-HAR computes lightweight statistical descriptors, retrieves semantically similar samples from a vector database, and uses this contextual evidence to make LLM-based activity identification. We further enhance RAG-HAR by first applying prompt optimization and introducing an LLM-based activity descriptor that generates context-enriched vector databases for delivering accurate and highly relevant contextual information. Along with these mechanisms, RAG-HAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across six diverse HAR benchmarks. Most importantly, RAG-HAR attains these improvements without requiring model training or fine-tuning, emphasizing its robustness and practical applicability. RAG-HAR moves beyond known behaviors, enabling the recognition and meaningful labelling of multiple unseen human activities.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为Verifier-Threshold的方法，通过自动重新分配测试时计算资源，显著提高了效率。在GenEval基准测试中，与现有最优方法相比，计算时间减少了2-4倍。

Abstract: Image generation has emerged as a mainstream application of large generative AI models. Just as test-time compute and reasoning have helped language models improve their capabilities, similar benefits have also been observed with image generation models. In particular, searching over noise samples for diffusion and flow models has shown to scale well with test-time compute. While recent works have explored allocating non-uniform inference-compute budgets across different denoising steps, they rely on greedy algorithms and allocate the compute budget ineffectively. In this work, we study this problem and propose solutions to fix it. We propose the Verifier-Threshold method which automatically reallocates test-time compute and delivers substantial efficiency improvements. For the same performance on the GenEval benchmark, we achieve a 2-4x reduction in computational time over the state-of-the-art method.

Conclusion: 提出的质量控制框架能有效筛选高质量数据，提升AI模型的训练和评估效果。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) affects individuals with long-term diabetes. Without early diagnosis, DR can lead to vision loss. Fundus photography captures the structure of the retina along with abnormalities indicative of the stage of the disease. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can support clinicians in identifying these lesions, reducing manual workload, but models require high-quality annotated datasets. Due to the complexity of retinal structures, errors in image acquisition and lesion interpretation of manual annotators can occur. We proposed a quality-control framework, ensuring only high-standard data is used for evaluation and AI training. First, an explainable feature-based classifier is used to filter inadequate images. The features are extracted both using image processing and contrastive learning. Then, the images are enhanced and put subject to annotation, using deep-learning-based assistance. Lastly, the agreement between annotators calculated using derived formulas determines the usability of the annotations.

Conclusion: 3DID框架通过结合连续潜在表示和物理感知优化策略，直接在3D设计空间中导航，生成高保真3D几何形状，在解决方案质量和设计多样性上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Inverse design aims to design the input variables of a physical system to optimize a specified objective function, typically formulated as a search or optimization problem. However, in 3D domains, the design space grows exponentially, rendering exhaustive grid-based searches infeasible. Recent advances in deep learning have accelerated inverse design by providing powerful generative priors and differentiable surrogate models. Nevertheless, current methods tend to approximate the 3D design space using 2D projections or fine-tune existing 3D shapes. These approaches sacrifice volumetric detail and constrain design exploration, preventing true 3D design from scratch. In this paper, we propose a 3D Inverse Design (3DID) framework that directly navigates the 3D design space by coupling a continuous latent representation with a physics-aware optimization strategy. We first learn a unified physics-geometry embedding that compactly captures shape and physical field data in a continuous latent space. Then, we introduce a two-stage strategy to perform physics-aware optimization. In the first stage, a gradient-guided diffusion sampler explores the global latent manifold. In the second stage, an objective-driven, topology-preserving refinement further sculpts each candidate toward the target objective. This enables 3DID to generate high-fidelity 3D geometries, outperforming existing methods in both solution quality and design versatility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CKI框架通过光谱对齐、跨场景知识共享偏好和互补信息整合，解决了异构HSI分类中的光谱变化和语义不一致问题。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在标签空间不重叠时依赖源域完全覆盖，忽略了目标私有信息，限制了异构场景下的知识迁移效果。

Method: CKI包括三个关键组件：ASC用于减少光谱差异，CKSP通过SSM解决语义不匹配，CII则最大化利用目标特定互补信息。

Result: 大量实验证明，CKI在多样化的跨场景HSI场景中实现了最先进的性能，并表现出强稳定性。

Conclusion: CKI框架通过显式整合目标私有知识，在完全异构场景下实现了有效的知识迁移，显著提升了跨场景HSI分类的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Knowledge transfer has strong potential to improve hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, yet two inherent challenges fundamentally restrict effective cross-domain transfer: spectral variations caused by different sensors and semantic inconsistencies across heterogeneous scenes. Existing methods are limited by transfer settings that assume homogeneous domains or heterogeneous scenarios with only co-occurring categories. When label spaces do not overlap, they further rely on complete source-domain coverage and therefore overlook critical target-private information. To overcome these limitations and enable knowledge transfer in fully heterogeneous settings, we propose Cross-scene Knowledge Integration (CKI), a framework that explicitly incorporates target-private knowledge during transfer. CKI includes: (1) Alignment of Spectral Characteristics (ASC) to reduce spectral discrepancies through domain-agnostic projection; (2) Cross-scene Knowledge Sharing Preference (CKSP), which resolves semantic mismatch via a Source Similarity Mechanism (SSM); and (3) Complementary Information Integration (CII) to maximize the use of target-specific complementary cues. Extensive experiments verify that CKI achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong stability across diverse cross-scene HSI scenarios.

Conclusion: 提出了一种确定性世界模型（DWM），通过消除不可解释的潜在变量来确保精确的输入边界，显著提高了验证性能。

Abstract: Verifying closed-loop vision-based control systems remains a fundamental challenge due to the high dimensionality of images and the difficulty of modeling visual environments. While generative models are increasingly used as camera surrogates in verification, their reliance on stochastic latent variables introduces unnecessary overapproximation error. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Deterministic World Model (DWM) that maps system states directly to generative images, effectively eliminating uninterpretable latent variables to ensure precise input bounds. The DWM is trained with a dual-objective loss function that combines pixel-level reconstruction accuracy with a control difference loss to maintain behavioral consistency with the real system. We integrate DWM into a verification pipeline utilizing Star-based reachability analysis (StarV) and employ conformal prediction to derive rigorous statistical bounds on the trajectory deviation between the world model and the actual vision-based system. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our approach yields significantly tighter reachable sets and better verification performance than a latent-variable baseline.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法依赖参考计划作为训练的真实值，可能导致模型偏向特定规划风格或机构偏好，限制了灵活性和个性化。

Method: 引入一种新颖的生成模型，仅基于用户定义的偏好风味预测3D剂量分布，支持在危及器官（OARs）和计划靶区（PTVs）之间灵活权衡。

Result: 比较评估表明，该方法在某些场景下超越了Varian RapidPlan模型，展现出更高的适应性和计划质量。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的生成模型通过用户自定义偏好风味，能够灵活且个性化地预测3D剂量分布，在适应性和计划质量上优于现有方法（如Varian RapidPlan模型），并可与临床治疗规划系统无缝集成。

Abstract: Radiotherapy planning is a highly complex process that often varies significantly across institutions and individual planners. Most existing deep learning approaches for 3D dose prediction rely on reference plans as ground truth during training, which can inadvertently bias models toward specific planning styles or institutional preferences. In this study, we introduce a novel generative model that predicts 3D dose distributions based solely on user-defined preference flavors. These customizable preferences enable planners to prioritize specific trade-offs between organs-at-risk (OARs) and planning target volumes (PTVs), offering greater flexibility and personalization. Designed for seamless integration with clinical treatment planning systems, our approach assists users in generating high-quality plans efficiently. Comparative evaluations demonstrate that our method can surpasses the Varian RapidPlan model in both adaptability and plan quality in some scenarios.

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) images are often severely corrupted by artifacts in the presence of metals. Existing supervised metal artifact reduction (MAR) approaches suffer from performance instability on known data due to their reliance on limited paired metal-clean data, which limits their clinical applicability. Moreover, existing unsupervised methods face two main challenges: 1) the CT physical geometry is not effectively incorporated into the MAR process to ensure data fidelity; 2) traditional heuristics regularization terms cannot fully capture the abundant prior knowledge available. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose diffusion model regularized implicit neural representation framework for MAR. The implicit neural representation integrates physical constraints and imposes data fidelity, while the pre-trained diffusion model provides prior knowledge to regularize the solution. Experimental results on both simulated and clinical data demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method, highlighting its potential to be applied to clinical settings.

TL;DR: Proposed a method to generate large-scale, annotated defect datasets for AI-based lithography inspection, showing significant performance improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of high-quality, physically grounded training data for AI in micro/nano manufacturing, particularly in lithography defect inspection.

Method: The framework synthesizes defect layouts using physics-constrained mathematical morphology operations, fabricates physical samples via DMD-based lithography, and creates consistent annotations by comparing defect and defect-free micrographs.

Result: A dataset of 3,530 optical micrographs with 13,365 annotated defect instances was created. Mask R-CNN outperformed Faster R-CNN by approximately 34% in mean AP@0.5 for bridge, burr, and pinch classes, and 42% for contamination.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology successfully generates large-scale, physically valid defect datasets with pixel-level annotations, significantly improving AI-based defect inspection in semiconductor fabrication.

Abstract: The efficacy of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in micro/nano manufacturing is fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of high-quality and physically grounded training data for defect inspection. Lithography defect data from semiconductor industry are rarely accessible for research use, resulting in a shortage of publicly available datasets. To address this bottleneck in lithography, this study proposes a novel methodology for generating large-scale, physically valid defect datasets with pixel-level annotations. The framework begins with the ab initio synthesis of defect layouts using controllable, physics-constrained mathematical morphology operations (erosion and dilation) applied to the original design-level layout. These synthesized layouts, together with their defect-free counterparts, are fabricated into physical samples via high-fidelity digital micromirror device (DMD)-based lithography. Optical micrographs of the synthesized defect samples and their defect-free references are then compared to create consistent defect delineation annotations. Using this methodology, we constructed a comprehensive dataset of 3,530 Optical micrographs containing 13,365 annotated defect instances including four classes: bridge, burr, pinch, and contamination. Each defect instance is annotated with a pixel-accurate segmentation mask, preserving full contour and geometry. The segmentation-based Mask R-CNN achieves AP@0.5 of 0.980, 0.965, and 0.971, compared with 0.740, 0.719, and 0.717 for Faster R-CNN on bridge, burr, and pinch classes, representing a mean AP@0.5 improvement of approximately 34%. For the contamination class, Mask R-CNN achieves an AP@0.5 roughly 42% higher than Faster R-CNN. These consistent gains demonstrate that our proposed methodology to generate defect datasets with pixel-level annotations is feasible for robust AI-based Measurement/Inspection (MI) in semiconductor fabrication.

Abstract: Body and face motion play an integral role in communication. They convey crucial information on the participants. Advances in generative modeling and multi-modal learning have enabled motion generation from signals such as speech, conversational context and visual cues. However, generating expressive and coherent face and body dynamics remains challenging due to the complex interplay of verbal / non-verbal cues and individual personality traits. This survey reviews body and face motion generation, covering core concepts, representations techniques, generative approaches, datasets and evaluation metrics. We highlight future directions to enhance the realism, coherence and expressiveness of avatars in dyadic settings. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first comprehensive review to cover both body and face motion. Detailed resources are listed on https://lownish23csz0010.github.io/mogen/.

Conclusion: LUVC框架通过系统化压缩视觉标记直至在LLM最后一层完全消除，实现了语言模型推理速度的2倍提升，且准确率下降可忽略不计。其免训练特性使其可立即部署于多种VLMs。

Abstract: Visual language models encounter challenges in computational efficiency and latency, primarily due to the substantial redundancy in the token representations of high-resolution images and videos. Current attention/similarity-based compression algorithms suffer from either position bias or class imbalance, leading to significant accuracy degradation. They also fail to generalize to shallow LLM layers, which exhibit weaker cross-modal interactions. To address this, we extend token compression to the visual encoder through an effective iterative merging scheme that is orthogonal in spatial axes to accelerate the computation across the entire VLM. Furthermoer, we integrate a spectrum pruning unit into LLM through an attention/similarity-free low-pass filter, which gradually prunes redundant visual tokens and is fully compatible to modern FlashAttention. On this basis, we propose Lossless Ultimate Vision tokens Compression (LUVC) framework. LUVC systematically compresses visual tokens until complete elimination at the final layer of LLM, so that the high-dimensional visual features are gradually fused into the multimodal queries. The experiments show that LUVC achieves a 2 speedup inference in language model with negligible accuracy degradation, and the training-free characteristic enables immediate deployment across multiple VLMs.

Abstract: The notion of learning underlies almost every evolution of Intelligent Agents. In this paper, we present an approach for searching and detecting a given entity in a video sequence. Specifically, we study how the deep learning technique by artificial neuralnetworks allows us to detect a character in a video sequence. The technique of detecting a character in a video is a complex field of study, considering the multitude of objects present in the data under analysis. From the results obtained, we highlight the following, compared to state of the art: In our approach, within the field of Computer Vision, the structuring of supervised learning algorithms allowed us to achieve several successes from simple characteristics of the target character. Our results demonstrate that is new approach allows us to locate, in an efficient way, wanted individuals from a private or public image base. For the case of Angola, the classifier we propose opens the possibility of reinforcing the national security system based on the database of target individuals (disappeared, criminals, etc.) and the video sequences of the Integrated Public Security Centre (CISP).

Abstract: Event cameras have the potential to revolutionize vision systems with their high temporal resolution and dynamic range, yet they remain susceptible to lens flare, a fundamental optical artifact that causes severe degradation. In event streams, this optical artifact forms a complex, spatio-temporal distortion that has been largely overlooked. We present E-Deflare, the first systematic framework for removing lens flare from event camera data. We first establish the theoretical foundation by deriving a physics-grounded forward model of the non-linear suppression mechanism. This insight enables the creation of the E-Deflare Benchmark, a comprehensive resource featuring a large-scale simulated training set, E-Flare-2.7K, and the first-ever paired real-world test set, E-Flare-R, captured by our novel optical system. Empowered by this benchmark, we design E-DeflareNet, which achieves state-of-the-art restoration performance. Extensive experiments validate our approach and demonstrate clear benefits for downstream tasks. Code and datasets are publicly available.

Conclusion: ConceptPose 是一种无需训练和模型的方法，通过利用视觉语言模型（VLM）创建开放词汇的3D概念地图，实现了6DoF相对姿态的精确估计，并在零样本相对姿态估计基准测试中显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Object pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision and robotics, yet most methods require extensive, dataset-specific training. Concurrently, large-scale vision language models show remarkable zero-shot capabilities. In this work, we bridge these two worlds by introducing ConceptPose, a framework for object pose estimation that is both training-free and model-free. ConceptPose leverages a vision-language-model (VLM) to create open-vocabulary 3D concept maps, where each point is tagged with a concept vector derived from saliency maps. By establishing robust 3D-3D correspondences across concept maps, our approach allows precise estimation of 6DoF relative pose. Without any object or dataset-specific training, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on common zero shot relative pose estimation benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing methods by over 62% in ADD(-S) score, including those that utilize extensive dataset-specific training.

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene interpretation in active construction sites is essential for progress monitoring, safety assessment, and digital twin development. LiDAR is widely used in construction because it offers advantages over camera-based systems, performing reliably in cluttered and dynamically changing conditions. Yet most public datasets for 3D perception are derived from densely fused scans with uniform sampling and complete visibility, conditions that do not reflect real construction sites. Field data are often collected as isolated single-station LiDAR views, constrained by safety requirements, limited access, and ongoing operations. These factors lead to radial density decay, fragmented geometry, and view-dependent visibility-characteristics that remain underrepresented in existing datasets. This paper presents SIP, Site in Pieces, a dataset created to reflect the practical constraints of LiDAR acquisition during construction. SIP provides indoor and outdoor scenes captured with a terrestrial LiDAR scanner and annotated at the point level using a taxonomy tailored to construction environments: A. Built Environment, B. Construction Operations, and C. Site Surroundings. The dataset includes both structural components and slender temporary objects such as scaffolding, MEP piping, and scissor lifts, where sparsity caused by occlusion and fragmented geometry make segmentation particularly challenging. The scanning protocol, annotation workflow, and quality control procedures establish a consistent foundation for the dataset. SIP is openly available with a supporting Git repository, offering adaptable class configurations that streamline adoption within modern 3D deep learning frameworks. By providing field data that retain real-world sensing characteristics, SIP enables robust benchmarking and contributes to advancing construction-oriented 3D vision tasks.

Conclusion: KD-OCT框架成功地将高性能的ConvNeXtV2-Large教师模型压缩为轻量级的EfficientNet-B2学生模型，在保持高诊断性能的同时实现了实时部署，为AMD筛查提供了边缘部署的可行性。

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and choroidal neovascularization (CNV)-related conditions are leading causes of vision loss worldwide, with optical coherence tomography (OCT) serving as a cornerstone for early detection and management. However, deploying state-of-the-art deep learning models like ConvNeXtV2-Large in clinical settings is hindered by their computational demands. Therefore, it is desirable to develop efficient models that maintain high diagnostic performance while enabling real-time deployment. In this study, a novel knowledge distillation framework, termed KD-OCT, is proposed to compress a high-performance ConvNeXtV2-Large teacher model, enhanced with advanced augmentations, stochastic weight averaging, and focal loss, into a lightweight EfficientNet-B2 student for classifying normal, drusen, and CNV cases. KD-OCT employs real-time distillation with a combined loss balancing soft teacher knowledge transfer and hard ground-truth supervision. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on the Noor Eye Hospital (NEH) dataset using patient-level cross-validation. Experimental results demonstrate that KD-OCT outperforms comparable multi-scale or feature-fusion OCT classifiers in efficiency- accuracy balance, achieving near-teacher performance with substantial reductions in model size and inference time. Despite the compression, the student model exceeds most existing frameworks, facilitating edge deployment for AMD screening. Code is available at https://github.com/erfan-nourbakhsh/KD- OCT.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种通过分析'负'高斯混合统计量来自动选择视觉地点识别（VPR）阈值的方法，该方法适用于多种图像数据库和描述符。

Abstract: Visual place recognition (VPR) is an important component technology for camera-based mapping and navigation applications. This is a challenging problem because images of the same place may appear quite different for reasons including seasonal changes, weather illumination, structural changes to the environment, as well as transient pedestrian or vehicle traffic. Papers focusing on generating image descriptors for VPR report their results using metrics such as recall@K and ROC curves. However, for a robot implementation, determining which matches are sufficiently good is often reduced to a manually set threshold. And it is difficult to manually select a threshold that will work for a variety of visual scenarios. This paper addresses the problem of automatically selecting a threshold for VPR by looking at the 'negative' Gaussian mixture statistics for a place - image statistics indicating not this place. We show that this approach can be used to select thresholds that work well for a variety of image databases and image descriptors.

Conclusion: AgentComp框架通过显式训练模型区分组合性变化，显著提升了文本到图像生成模型的组合性能力，同时在图像质量和其他能力（如文本渲染）上表现优异。

Abstract: Text-to-image generative models have achieved remarkable visual quality but still struggle with compositionality$-$accurately capturing object relationships, attribute bindings, and fine-grained details in prompts. A key limitation is that models are not explicitly trained to differentiate between compositionally similar prompts and images, resulting in outputs that are close to the intended description yet deviate in fine-grained details. To address this, we propose AgentComp, a framework that explicitly trains models to better differentiate such compositional variations and enhance their reasoning ability. AgentComp leverages the reasoning and tool-use capabilities of large language models equipped with image generation, editing, and VQA tools to autonomously construct compositional datasets. Using these datasets, we apply an agentic preference optimization method to fine-tune text-to-image models, enabling them to better distinguish between compositionally similar samples and resulting in overall stronger compositional generation ability. AgentComp achieves state-of-the-art results on compositionality benchmarks such as T2I-CompBench, without compromising image quality$-$a common drawback in prior approaches$-$and even generalizes to other capabilities not explicitly trained for, such as text rendering.

Abstract: Underground mining disasters produce pervasive darkness, dust, and collapses that obscure vision and make situational awareness difficult for humans and conventional systems. To address this, we propose MDSE, Multimodal Disaster Situation Explainer, a novel vision-language framework that automatically generates detailed textual explanations of post-disaster underground scenes. MDSE has three-fold innovations: (i) Context-Aware Cross-Attention for robust alignment of visual and textual features even under severe degradation; (ii) Segmentation-aware dual pathway visual encoding that fuses global and region-specific embeddings; and (iii) Resource-Efficient Transformer-Based Language Model for expressive caption generation with minimal compute cost. To support this task, we present the Underground Mine Disaster (UMD) dataset--the first image-caption corpus of real underground disaster scenes--enabling rigorous training and evaluation. Extensive experiments on UMD and related benchmarks show that MDSE substantially outperforms state-of-the-art captioning models, producing more accurate and contextually relevant descriptions that capture crucial details in obscured environments, improving situational awareness for underground emergency response.

Conclusion: FoCULR通过整合食品领域知识并在生成过程中早期引入核心概念，有效提升了食品图像生成的性能。

Abstract: Generating realistic food images for categories with multiple nouns is surprisingly challenging. For instance, the prompt "egg noodle" may result in images that incorrectly contain both eggs and noodles as separate entities. Multi-noun food categories are common in real-world datasets and account for a large portion of entries in benchmarks such as UEC-256. These compound names often cause generative models to misinterpret the semantics, producing unintended ingredients or objects. This is due to insufficient multi-noun category related knowledge in the text encoder and misinterpretation of multi-noun relationships, leading to incorrect spatial layouts. To overcome these challenges, we propose FoCULR (Food Category Understanding and Layout Refinement) which incorporates food domain knowledge and introduces core concepts early in the generation process. Experimental results demonstrate that the integration of these techniques improves image generation performance in the food domain.

Conclusion: GimbalDiffusion框架通过绝对坐标系和重力参考实现了对摄像机运动的精确控制，显著提升了文本到视频生成的可控性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-video generation has achieved remarkable realism, yet fine-grained control over camera motion and orientation remains elusive. Existing approaches typically encode camera trajectories through relative or ambiguous representations, limiting explicit geometric control. We introduce GimbalDiffusion, a framework that enables camera control grounded in physical-world coordinates, using gravity as a global reference. Instead of describing motion relative to previous frames, our method defines camera trajectories in an absolute coordinate system, allowing precise and interpretable control over camera parameters without requiring an initial reference frame. We leverage panoramic 360-degree videos to construct a wide variety of camera trajectories, well beyond the predominantly straight, forward-facing trajectories seen in conventional video data. To further enhance camera guidance, we introduce null-pitch conditioning, an annotation strategy that reduces the model's reliance on text content when conflicting with camera specifications (e.g., generating grass while the camera points towards the sky). Finally, we establish a benchmark for camera-aware video generation by rebalancing SpatialVID-HQ for comprehensive evaluation under wide camera pitch variation. Together, these contributions advance the controllability and robustness of text-to-video models, enabling precise, gravity-aligned camera manipulation within generative frameworks.

Conclusion: SuperF通过利用坐标基神经网络和联合优化帧对齐与INR的方法，在无需高分辨率训练数据的情况下，实现了多图像超分辨率（MISR）的显著提升，适用于卫星和手持相机图像。

Abstract: High-resolution imagery is often hindered by limitations in sensor technology, atmospheric conditions, and costs. Such challenges occur in satellite remote sensing, but also with handheld cameras, such as our smartphones. Hence, super-resolution aims to enhance the image resolution algorithmically. Since single-image super-resolution requires solving an inverse problem, such methods must exploit strong priors, e.g. learned from high-resolution training data, or be constrained by auxiliary data, e.g. by a high-resolution guide from another modality. While qualitatively pleasing, such approaches often lead to "hallucinated" structures that do not match reality. In contrast, multi-image super-resolution (MISR) aims to improve the (optical) resolution by constraining the super-resolution process with multiple views taken with sub-pixel shifts. Here, we propose SuperF, a test-time optimization approach for MISR that leverages coordinate-based neural networks, also called neural fields. Their ability to represent continuous signals with an implicit neural representation (INR) makes them an ideal fit for the MISR task.
  The key characteristic of our approach is to share an INR for multiple shifted low-resolution frames and to jointly optimize the frame alignment with the INR. Our approach advances related INR baselines, adopted from burst fusion for layer separation, by directly parameterizing the sub-pixel alignment as optimizable affine transformation parameters and by optimizing via a super-sampled coordinate grid that corresponds to the output resolution. Our experiments yield compelling results on simulated bursts of satellite imagery and ground-level images from handheld cameras, with upsampling factors of up to 8. A key advantage of SuperF is that this approach does not rely on any high-resolution training data.

TL;DR: AngioAI-QFR是一种结合深度学习与血管造影的自动化流程，能快速、准确地评估冠状动脉狭窄和功能，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冠状动脉造影是评估冠状动脉疾病的主要工具，但视觉狭窄分级存在变异性且与缺血仅中度相关。基于导丝的FFR改善了病变选择但未被系统使用。血管造影衍生指标如QFR提供了无导丝的生理学评估，但许多工具工作流程繁琐且与自动化解剖分析和虚拟PCI规划分离。

Method: 开发了AngioAI-QFR，一个端到端的血管造影流程，结合深度学习狭窄检测、管腔分割、中心线和直径提取、每毫米相对流量容量分析，以及虚拟支架植入并自动重新计算血管造影衍生的QFR。

Result: 在100条连续血管中以侵入性FFR为参考进行评估。狭窄检测精度为0.97，管腔分割Dice为0.78。AngioAI-QFR与FFR强相关（r=0.89，MAE 0.045）。检测FFR≤0.80的AUC为0.93，敏感性0.88，特异性0.86。流程在93%的血管中完全自动完成，中位结果时间为41秒。

Conclusion: AngioAI-QFR提供了一种实用、近乎实时的流程，结合了计算机视觉、功能分析和虚拟PCI，实现了自动化的血管造影衍生生理学评估。

Abstract: Coronary angiography is the main tool for assessing coronary artery disease, but visual grading of stenosis is variable and only moderately related to ischaemia. Wire based fractional flow reserve (FFR) improves lesion selection but is not used systematically. Angiography derived indices such as quantitative flow ratio (QFR) offer wire free physiology, yet many tools are workflow intensive and separate from automated anatomy analysis and virtual PCI planning. We developed AngioAI-QFR, an end to end angiography only pipeline combining deep learning stenosis detection, lumen segmentation, centreline and diameter extraction, per millimetre Relative Flow Capacity profiling, and virtual stenting with automatic recomputation of angiography derived QFR. The system was evaluated in 100 consecutive vessels with invasive FFR as reference. Primary endpoints were agreement with FFR (correlation, mean absolute error) and diagnostic performance for FFR <= 0.80. On held out frames, stenosis detection achieved precision 0.97 and lumen segmentation Dice 0.78. Across 100 vessels, AngioAI-QFR correlated strongly with FFR (r = 0.89, MAE 0.045). The AUC for detecting FFR <= 0.80 was 0.93, with sensitivity 0.88 and specificity 0.86. The pipeline completed fully automatically in 93 percent of vessels, with median time to result 41 s. RFC profiling distinguished focal from diffuse capacity loss, and virtual stenting predicted larger QFR gain in focal than in diffuse disease. AngioAI-QFR provides a practical, near real time pipeline that unifies computer vision, functional profiling, and virtual PCI with automated angiography derived physiology.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决组合零样本学习（CZSL）中持续适应新属性和对象及其组合的同时防止遗忘先前知识的挑战。

Method: 基于冻结的VLM主干，提出PromptCCZSL框架，结合多教师蒸馏、会话感知组合提示、余弦锚定损失（CAL）、正交投影损失（OPL）和会话内多样性损失（IDL）。

Result: 在UT-Zappos和C-GQA基准测试中，PromptCCZSL显著优于现有的VLM和非VLM基线方法。

Conclusion: PromptCCZSL框架通过多教师蒸馏、会话感知提示和多种损失函数，显著提升了持续组合零样本学习的性能，并在UT-Zappos和C-GQA基准测试中取得了优于现有方法的结果。

Abstract: We tackle continual adaptation of vision-language models to new attributes, objects, and their compositions in Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL), while preventing forgetting of prior knowledge. Unlike classical continual learning where classes are disjoint, CCZSL is more complex as attributes and objects may reoccur across sessions while compositions remain unique. Built on a frozen VLM backbone, we propose the first Prompt-based Continual Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (PromptCCZSL) framework that retains prior knowledge through recency-weighted multi-teacher distillation. It employs session-aware compositional prompts to fuse multimodal features for new compositions, while attribute and object prompts are learned through session-agnostic fusion to maintain global semantic consistency, which is further stabilized by a Cosine Anchor Loss (CAL) to preserve prior knowledge. To enhance adaptation in the current session, an Orthogonal Projection Loss (OPL) ensures that new attribute and object embeddings remain distinct from previous ones, preventing overlap, while an Intra-Session Diversity Loss (IDL) promotes variation among current-session embeddings for richer, more discriminative representations. We also introduce a comprehensive protocol that jointly measures catastrophic forgetting and compositional generalization. Extensive experiments on UT-Zappos and C-GQA benchmarks demonstrate that PromptCCZSL achieves substantial improvements over prior VLM-based and non-VLM baselines, setting a new benchmark for CCZSL in closed-world settings.

TL;DR: $Δ$-LFM 是一种通过 Flow Matching 和患者特定潜在对齐来建模疾病进展的框架，提高了潜在空间的一致性和语义意义，并在 MRI 数据中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疾病进展的动态本质上是连续和单调的，但现有生成方法的潜在表示往往分散且缺乏语义结构，扩散模型通过随机去噪过程破坏了连续性。

Method: 通过将疾病动态视为速度场并利用 Flow Matching (FM) 来对齐患者数据的时间演化，同时学习患者特定的潜在对齐，确保患者轨迹沿特定轴排列，且幅度随疾病严重程度单调增加。

Result: $Δ$-LFM 在三个纵向 MRI 基准测试中表现出强大的实证性能，并提供了疾病动态的可解释性和可视化。

Conclusion: $Δ$-LFM 提供了一个新的框架，用于解释和可视化疾病动态，并在三个纵向 MRI 基准测试中表现出强大的实证性能。

Abstract: Understanding disease progression is a central clinical challenge with direct implications for early diagnosis and personalized treatment. While recent generative approaches have attempted to model progression, key mismatches remain: disease dynamics are inherently continuous and monotonic, yet latent representations are often scattered, lacking semantic structure, and diffusion-based models disrupt continuity with random denoising process. In this work, we propose to treat the disease dynamic as a velocity field and leverage Flow Matching (FM) to align the temporal evolution of patient data. Unlike prior methods, it captures the intrinsic dynamic of disease, making the progression more interpretable. However, a key challenge remains: in latent space, Auto-Encoders (AEs) do not guarantee alignment across patients or correlation with clinical-severity indicators (e.g., age and disease conditions). To address this, we propose to learn patient-specific latent alignment, which enforces patient trajectories to lie along a specific axis, with magnitude increasing monotonically with disease severity. This leads to a consistent and semantically meaningful latent space. Together, we present $Δ$-LFM, a framework for modeling patient-specific latent progression with flow matching. Across three longitudinal MRI benchmarks, $Δ$-LFM demonstrates strong empirical performance and, more importantly, offers a new framework for interpreting and visualizing disease dynamics.

TL;DR: VoG通过场景图结构化和主动探索机制，解决了现有3D视觉定位方法中的视觉表示纠缠问题，显著提升了零样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（VLM + SI）导致视觉表示纠缠，难以有效利用空间语义关系，需改进为更结构化的推理方式。

Method: 提出View-on-Graph（VoG）方法，将3D场景组织为多模态、多层次的场景图，使VLM作为主动代理逐步检索必要信息。

Result: VoG在零样本3D视觉定位任务中达到最先进性能，验证了结构化场景探索的有效性。

Conclusion: VoG方法通过结构化场景图和主动探索机制，显著提升了零样本3D视觉定位的性能和可解释性，成为该领域的先进策略。

Abstract: 3D visual grounding (3DVG) identifies objects in 3D scenes from language descriptions. Existing zero-shot approaches leverage 2D vision-language models (VLMs) by converting 3D spatial information (SI) into forms amenable to VLM processing, typically as composite inputs such as specified view renderings or video sequences with overlaid object markers. However, this VLM + SI paradigm yields entangled visual representations that compel the VLM to process entire cluttered cues, making it hard to exploit spatial semantic relationships effectively. In this work, we propose a new VLM x SI paradigm that externalizes the 3D SI into a form enabling the VLM to incrementally retrieve only what it needs during reasoning. We instantiate this paradigm with a novel View-on-Graph (VoG) method, which organizes the scene into a multi-modal, multi-layer scene graph and allows the VLM to operate as an active agent that selectively accesses necessary cues as it traverses the scene. This design offers two intrinsic advantages: (i) by structuring 3D context into a spatially and semantically coherent scene graph rather than confounding the VLM with densely entangled visual inputs, it lowers the VLM's reasoning difficulty; and (ii) by actively exploring and reasoning over the scene graph, it naturally produces transparent, step-by-step traces for interpretable 3DVG. Extensive experiments show that VoG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, establishing structured scene exploration as a promising strategy for advancing zero-shot 3DVG.

Conclusion: 本文提出的Z-score归一化方法在特征数据压缩中表现优异，不仅减少了开销比特，还提升了任务准确性，尤其在对象跟踪任务中效果显著。

Abstract: The split-inference paradigm divides an artificial intelligence (AI) model into two parts. This necessitates the transfer of intermediate feature data between the two halves. Here, effective compression of the feature data becomes vital. In this paper, we employ Z-score normalization to efficiently recover the compressed feature data at the decoder side. To examine the efficacy of our method, the proposed method is integrated into the latest Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) codec standard under development by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG). Our method supersedes the existing scaling method used by the current standard under development. It both reduces the overhead bits and improves the end-task accuracy. To further reduce the overhead in certain circumstances, we also propose a simplified method. Experiments show that using our proposed method shows 17.09% reduction in bitrate on average across different tasks and up to 65.69% for object tracking without sacrificing the task accuracy.

Conclusion: CS3D框架通过分解Convolutional 3D方法降低了计算复杂度和能耗，同时利用软脉冲神经元和时空注意力机制提升了信息保留能力，从而提高了面部表情识别的准确性。

Abstract: Responsive and accurate facial expression recognition is crucial to human-robot interaction for daily service robots. Nowadays, event cameras are becoming more widely adopted as they surpass RGB cameras in capturing facial expression changes due to their high temporal resolution, low latency, computational efficiency, and robustness in low-light conditions. Despite these advantages, event-based approaches still encounter practical challenges, particularly in adopting mainstream deep learning models. Traditional deep learning methods for facial expression analysis are energy-intensive, making them difficult to deploy on edge computing devices and thereby increasing costs, especially for high-frequency, dynamic, event vision-based approaches. To address this challenging issue, we proposed the CS3D framework by decomposing the Convolutional 3D method to reduce the computational complexity and energy consumption. Additionally, by utilizing soft spiking neurons and a spatial-temporal attention mechanism, the ability to retain information is enhanced, thus improving the accuracy of facial expression detection. Experimental results indicate that our proposed CS3D method attains higher accuracy on multiple datasets compared to architectures such as the RNN, Transformer, and C3D, while the energy consumption of the CS3D method is just 21.97\% of the original C3D required on the same device.

Result: 在 RGBA 分层数据集上的大量实验表明，OmniPSD 实现了高保真生成、结构一致性和透明度感知。

Conclusion: OmniPSD 提出了一种基于扩散模型的统一框架，能够通过上下文学习实现文本到PSD生成和图像到PSD分解，为分层设计生成和分解提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have greatly improved image generation and editing, yet generating or reconstructing layered PSD files with transparent alpha channels remains highly challenging. We propose OmniPSD, a unified diffusion framework built upon the Flux ecosystem that enables both text-to-PSD generation and image-to-PSD decomposition through in-context learning. For text-to-PSD generation, OmniPSD arranges multiple target layers spatially into a single canvas and learns their compositional relationships through spatial attention, producing semantically coherent and hierarchically structured layers. For image-to-PSD decomposition, it performs iterative in-context editing, progressively extracting and erasing textual and foreground components to reconstruct editable PSD layers from a single flattened image. An RGBA-VAE is employed as an auxiliary representation module to preserve transparency without affecting structure learning. Extensive experiments on our new RGBA-layered dataset demonstrate that OmniPSD achieves high-fidelity generation, structural consistency, and transparency awareness, offering a new paradigm for layered design generation and decomposition with diffusion transformers.

Abstract: Glacial lake monitoring bears great significance in mitigating the anticipated risk of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods. However, existing segmentation methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), remain constrained to pixel-level predictions, lacking high-level global scene semantics and human-interpretable reasoning. To address this, we introduce GLACIA (\textbf{G}lacial \textbf{LA}ke segmentation with \textbf{C}ontextual \textbf{I}nstance \textbf{A}wareness), the first framework that integrates large language models with segmentation capabilities to produce both accurate segmentation masks and corresponding spatial reasoning outputs. We construct the Glacial Lake Position Reasoning (GLake-Pos) dataset pipeline, which provides diverse, spatially grounded question-answer pairs designed to overcome the lack of instance-aware positional reasoning data in remote sensing. Comparative evaluation demonstrate that GLACIA (mIoU: 87.30) surpasses state-of-the-art method based on CNNs (mIoU: 78.55 - 79.01), ViTs (mIoU: 69.27 - 81.75), Geo-foundation models (mIoU: 76.37 - 87.10), and reasoning based segmentation methods (mIoU: 60.12 - 75.66).

Conclusion: MoRel框架通过ARBB机制和FHD方案，实现了长时域动态场景的高效、一致建模，解决了内存爆炸和时间闪烁问题，展示了动态高斯表示的可扩展性和效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) have extended the high-speed rendering capability of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) into the temporal domain, enabling real-time rendering of dynamic scenes. However, one of the major remaining challenges lies in modeling long-range motion-contained dynamic videos, where a naive extension of existing methods leads to severe memory explosion, temporal flickering, and failure to handle appearing or disappearing occlusions over time. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 4DGS framework characterized by an Anchor Relay-based Bidirectional Blending (ARBB) mechanism, named MoRel, which enables temporally consistent and memory-efficient modeling of long-range dynamic scenes. Our method progressively constructs locally canonical anchor spaces at key-frame time index and models inter-frame deformations at the anchor level, enhancing temporal coherence. By learning bidirectional deformations between KfA and adaptively blending them through learnable opacity control, our approach mitigates temporal discontinuities and flickering artifacts. We further introduce a Feature-variance-guided Hierarchical Densification (FHD) scheme that effectively densifies KfA's while keeping rendering quality, based on an assigned level of feature-variance. To effectively evaluate our model's capability to handle real-world long-range 4D motion, we newly compose long-range 4D motion-contained dataset, called SelfCap$_{\text{LR}}$. It has larger average dynamic motion magnitude, captured at spatially wider spaces, compared to previous dynamic video datasets. Overall, our MoRel achieves temporally coherent and flicker-free long-range 4D reconstruction while maintaining bounded memory usage, demonstrating both scalability and efficiency in dynamic Gaussian-based representations.

Conclusion: LongT2IExpert通过指令调优和层次对齐思维链（CoT）方法，在长文本-图像对齐评估和解释方面表现出优越性。

Abstract: The increasing popularity of long Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has created an urgent need for automatic and interpretable models that can evaluate the image-text alignment in long prompt scenarios. However, the existing T2I alignment benchmarks predominantly focus on short prompt scenarios and only provide MOS or Likert scale annotations. This inherent limitation hinders the development of long T2I evaluators, particularly in terms of the interpretability of alignment. In this study, we contribute LongT2IBench, which comprises 14K long text-image pairs accompanied by graph-structured human annotations. Given the detail-intensive nature of long prompts, we first design a Generate-Refine-Qualify annotation protocol to convert them into textual graph structures that encompass entities, attributes, and relations. Through this transformation, fine-grained alignment annotations are achieved based on these granular elements. Finally, the graph-structed annotations are converted into alignment scores and interpretations to facilitate the design of T2I evaluation models. Based on LongT2IBench, we further propose LongT2IExpert, a LongT2I evaluator that enables multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to provide both quantitative scores and structured interpretations through an instruction-tuning process with Hierarchical Alignment Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LongT2IExpert in alignment evaluation and interpretation.

Conclusion: 使用log RGB色彩空间能显著提升NeRF的渲染质量，增强场景鲁棒性，尤其在低光条件下表现优异，且优势在不同网络规模和NeRF变体中具有普适性。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved remarkable results in novel view synthesis, typically using sRGB images for supervision. However, little attention has been paid to the color space in which the network is learning the radiance field representation. Inspired by the BiIlluminant Dichromatic Reflection (BIDR) model, which suggests that a logarithmic transformation simplifies the separation of illumination and reflectance, we hypothesize that log RGB space enables NeRF to learn a more compact and effective representation of scene appearance. To test this, we captured approximately 30 videos using a GoPro camera, ensuring linear data recovery through inverse encoding. We trained NeRF models under various color space interpretations linear, sRGB, GPLog, and log RGB by converting each network output to a common color space before rendering and loss computation, enforcing representation learning in different color spaces. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that using a log RGB color space consistently improves rendering quality, exhibits greater robustness across scenes, and performs particularly well in low light conditions while using the same bit-depth input images. Further analysis across different network sizes and NeRF variants confirms the generalization and stability of the log space advantage.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD), a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, significantly affects patients' daily functioning and social interactions. To facilitate a more efficient and accessible diagnostic approach for PD, we propose a dynamic facial expression analysis-based PD auxiliary diagnosis method. This method targets hypomimia, a characteristic clinical symptom of PD, by analyzing two manifestations: reduced facial expressivity and facial rigidity, thereby facilitating the diagnosis process. We develop a multimodal facial expression analysis network to extract expression intensity features during patients' performance of various facial expressions. This network leverages the CLIP architecture to integrate visual and textual features while preserving the temporal dynamics of facial expressions. Subsequently, the expression intensity features are processed and input into an LSTM-based classification network for PD diagnosis. Our method achieves an accuracy of 93.1%, outperforming other in-vitro PD diagnostic approaches. This technique offers a more convenient detection method for potential PD patients, improving their diagnostic experience.

Conclusion: LoGoColor通过其'局部-全局'方法有效解决了多视角一致性问题，并在复杂360°场景中实现了比现有方法更一致和合理的3D色彩化，同时通过新颖的色彩多样性指数验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Single-channel 3D reconstruction is widely used in fields such as robotics and medical imaging. While this line of work excels at reconstructing 3D geometry, the outputs are not colored 3D models, thus 3D colorization is required for visualization. Recent 3D colorization studies address this problem by distilling 2D image colorization models. However, these approaches suffer from an inherent inconsistency of 2D image models. This results in colors being averaged during training, leading to monotonous and oversimplified results, particularly in complex 360° scenes. In contrast, we aim to preserve color diversity by generating a new set of consistently colorized training views, thereby bypassing the averaging process. Nevertheless, eliminating the averaging process introduces a new challenge: ensuring strict multi-view consistency across these colorized views. To achieve this, we propose LoGoColor, a pipeline designed to preserve color diversity by eliminating this guidance-averaging process with a `Local-Global' approach: we partition the scene into subscenes and explicitly tackle both inter-subscene and intra-subscene consistency using a fine-tuned multi-view diffusion model. We demonstrate that our method achieves quantitatively and qualitatively more consistent and plausible 3D colorization on complex 360° scenes than existing methods, and validate its superior color diversity using a novel Color Diversity Index.

Abstract: Class-incremental learning requires a learning system to continually learn knowledge of new classes and meanwhile try to preserve previously learned knowledge of old classes. As current state-of-the-art methods based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still suffer from the issue of differentiating classes across learning tasks. Here a novel VLM-based continual learning framework for image classification is proposed. In this framework, task-specific adapters are added to the pre-trained and frozen image encoder to learn new knowledge, and a novel cross-task representation calibration strategy based on a mixture of light-weight projectors is used to help better separate all learned classes in a unified feature space, alleviating class confusion across tasks. In addition, a novel inference strategy guided by prediction uncertainty is developed to more accurately select the most appropriate image feature for class prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets under various settings demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing ones.

Abstract: Recent studies have witnessed significant advances in image restoration foundation models driven by improvements in the scale and quality of pre-training data. In this work, we find that the data mixture proportions from different restoration tasks are also a critical factor directly determining the overall performance of all-in-one image restoration models. To this end, we propose a high-capacity diffusion-based image restoration foundation model, FoundIR-v2, which adopts a data equilibrium scheduling paradigm to dynamically optimize the proportions of mixed training datasets from different tasks. By leveraging the data mixing law, our method ensures a balanced dataset composition, enabling the model to achieve consistent generalization and comprehensive performance across diverse tasks. Furthermore, we introduce an effective Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven scheduler into generative pre-training to flexibly allocate task-adaptive diffusion priors for each restoration task, accounting for the distinct degradation forms and levels exhibited by different tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can address over 50 sub-tasks across a broader scope of real-world scenarios and achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Infertility is a major global health issue, and while in-vitro fertilization has improved treatment outcomes, embryo selection remains a critical bottleneck. Time-lapse imaging enables continuous, non-invasive monitoring of embryo development, yet most automated assessment methods rely solely on conventional morphokinetic features and overlook emerging biomarkers. Cytoplasmic Strings, thin filamentous structures connecting the inner cell mass and trophectoderm in expanded blastocysts, have been associated with faster blastocyst formation, higher blastocyst grades, and improved viability. However, CS assessment currently depends on manual visual inspection, which is labor-intensive, subjective, and severely affected by detection and subtle visual appearance. In this work, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first computational framework for CS analysis in human IVF embryos. We first design a human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline to curate a biologically validated CS dataset from TLI videos, comprising 13,568 frames with highly sparse CS-positive instances. Building on this dataset, we propose a two-stage deep learning framework that (i) classifies CS presence at the frame level and (ii) localizes CS regions in positive cases. To address severe imbalance and feature uncertainty, we introduce the Novel Uncertainty-aware Contractive Embedding (NUCE) loss, which couples confidence-aware reweighting with an embedding contraction term to form compact, well-separated class clusters. NUCE consistently improves F1-score across five transformer backbones, while RF-DETR-based localization achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection performance for thin, low-contrast CS structures.

Abstract: Automated skin lesion classification using deep learning has shown remarkable accuracy, yet clinical adoption remains limited due to the "black box" nature of these models. We present MelanomaNet, an explainable deep learning system for multi-class skin lesion classification that addresses this gap through four complementary interpretability mechanisms. Our approach combines an EfficientNet V2 backbone with GradCAM++ attention visualization, automated ABCDE clinical criterion extraction, Fast Concept Activation Vectors (FastCAV) for concept-based explanations, and Monte Carlo Dropout uncertainty quantification. We evaluate our system on the ISIC 2019 dataset containing 25,331 dermoscopic images across 9 diagnostic categories. Our model achieves 85.61% accuracy with a weighted F1 score of 0.8564, while providing clinically meaningful explanations that align model attention with established dermatological assessment criteria. The uncertainty quantification module decomposes prediction confidence into epistemic and aleatoric components, enabling automatic flagging of unreliable predictions for clinical review. Our results demonstrate that high classification performance can be achieved alongside comprehensive interpretability, potentially facilitating greater trust and adoption in clinical dermatology workflows.

Abstract: The adoption of AI-powered computer vision in industry is often constrained by the need to balance operational utility with worker privacy. Building on our previously proposed privacy-preserving framework, this paper presents its first comprehensive validation on real-world data collected directly by industrial partners in active production environments. We evaluate the framework across three representative use cases: woodworking production monitoring, human-aware AGV navigation, and multi-camera ergonomic risk assessment. The approach employs learned visual transformations that obscure sensitive or task-irrelevant information while retaining features essential for task performance. Through both quantitative evaluation of the privacy-utility trade-off and qualitative feedback from industrial partners, we assess the framework's effectiveness, deployment feasibility, and trust implications. Results demonstrate that task-specific obfuscation enables effective monitoring with reduced privacy risks, establishing the framework's readiness for real-world adoption and providing cross-domain recommendations for responsible, human-centric AI deployment in industry.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the key issue in autonomous driving: small target recognition in dynamic perception. Existing algorithms suffer from poor detection performance due to missing small target information, scale imbalance, and occlusion. We propose an improved YOLOv8n-SPTS model, which enhances the detection accuracy of small traffic targets through three key innovations: First, optimizing the feature extraction module. In the Backbone Bottleneck structure of YOLOv8n, 4 traditional convolution modules are replaced with Space-to-Depth Convolution (SPD-Conv) modules. This module retains fine-grained information through space-to-depth conversion, reduces information loss, and enhances the ability to capture features of low-resolution small targets. Second, enhancing feature fusion capability. The Spatial Pyramid Pooling - Fast Cross Stage Partial Connection (SPPFCSPC) module is introduced to replace the original SPPF module, integrating the multi-scale feature extraction from Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) and the feature fusion mechanism of Cross Stage Partial Connection (CSP), thereby improving the model's contextual understanding of complex scenes and multi-scale feature expression ability. Third, designing a dedicated detection structure for small targets. A Triple-Stage Feature Pyramid (TSFP) structure is proposed, which adds a 160*160 small target detection head to the original detection heads to fully utilize high-resolution features in shallow layers; meanwhile, redundant large target detection heads are removed to balance computational efficiency. Comparative experiments on the VisDrone2019-DET dataset show that YOLOv8n-SPTS model ranks first in precision (61.9%), recall (48.3%), mAP@0.5 (52.6%), and mAP@0.5:0.95 (32.6%). Visualization results verify that the miss rate of small targets such as pedestrians and bicycles in occluded and dense scenes is significantly reduced.

Conclusion: The proposed ViViT-based framework effectively enhances spectral reconstruction quality for robust agricultural monitoring by addressing the limitations of existing ViT-based methods.

Abstract: Cloud cover in multispectral imagery (MSI) significantly hinders early-season crop mapping by corrupting spectral information. Existing Vision Transformer(ViT)-based time-series reconstruction methods, like SMTS-ViT, often employ coarse temporal embeddings that aggregate entire sequences, causing substantial information loss and reducing reconstruction accuracy. To address these limitations, a Video Vision Transformer (ViViT)-based framework with temporal-spatial fusion embedding for MSI reconstruction in cloud-covered regions is proposed in this study. Non-overlapping tubelets are extracted via 3D convolution with constrained temporal span $(t=2)$, ensuring local temporal coherence while reducing cross-day information degradation. Both MSI-only and SAR-MSI fusion scenarios are considered during the experiments. Comprehensive experiments on 2020 Traill County data demonstrate notable performance improvements: MTS-ViViT achieves a 2.23\% reduction in MSE compared to the MTS-ViT baseline, while SMTS-ViViT achieves a 10.33\% improvement with SAR integration over the SMTS-ViT baseline. The proposed framework effectively enhances spectral reconstruction quality for robust agricultural monitoring.

Conclusion: VABench旨在为同步音频-视频生成模型设立新的评估标准，并推动该领域的全面进步。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have been remarkable, enabling models to produce visually compelling videos with synchronized audio. While existing video generation benchmarks provide comprehensive metrics for visual quality, they lack convincing evaluations for audio-video generation, especially for models aiming to generate synchronized audio-video outputs. To address this gap, we introduce VABench, a comprehensive and multi-dimensional benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities of synchronous audio-video generation. VABench encompasses three primary task types: text-to-audio-video (T2AV), image-to-audio-video (I2AV), and stereo audio-video generation. It further establishes two major evaluation modules covering 15 dimensions. These dimensions specifically assess pairwise similarities (text-video, text-audio, video-audio), audio-video synchronization, lip-speech consistency, and carefully curated audio and video question-answering (QA) pairs, among others. Furthermore, VABench covers seven major content categories: animals, human sounds, music, environmental sounds, synchronous physical sounds, complex scenes, and virtual worlds. We provide a systematic analysis and visualization of the evaluation results, aiming to establish a new standard for assessing video generation models with synchronous audio capabilities and to promote the comprehensive advancement of the field.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have achieved remarkable visual fidelity, yet a detailed understanding of how specific perceptual attributes - such as color and shape - are internally represented remains limited. This work explores how color is encoded in a generative model through a systematic analysis of the latent representations in Stable Diffusion. Through controlled synthetic datasets, principal component analysis (PCA) and similarity metrics, we reveal that color information is encoded along circular, opponent axes predominantly captured in latent channels c_3 and c_4, whereas intensity and shape are primarily represented in channels c_1 and c_2. Our findings indicate that the latent space of Stable Diffusion exhibits an interpretable structure aligned with a efficient coding representation. These insights provide a foundation for future work in model understanding, editing applications, and the design of more disentangled generative frameworks.

Abstract: Accurate polyp segmentation during colonoscopy is critical for the early detection of colorectal cancer and still remains challenging due to significant size, shape, and color variations, and the camouflaged nature of polyps. While lightweight baseline models such as U-Net, U-Net++, and PraNet offer advantages in terms of easy deployment and low computational cost, they struggle to deal with the above issues, leading to limited segmentation performance. In contrast, large-scale vision foundation models such as SAM, DINOv2, OneFormer, and Mask2Former have exhibited impressive generalization performance across natural image domains. However, their direct transfer to medical imaging tasks (e.g., colonoscopic polyp segmentation) is not straightforward, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale datasets and lack of domain-specific knowledge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel distillation framework, Polyp-DiFoM, that transfers the rich representations of foundation models into lightweight segmentation baselines, allowing efficient and accurate deployment in clinical settings. In particular, we infuse semantic priors from the foundation models into canonical architectures such as U-Net and U-Net++ and further perform frequency domain encoding for enhanced distillation, corroborating their generalization capability. Extensive experiments are performed across five benchmark datasets, such as Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ClinicDB, ETIS, ColonDB, and CVC-300. Notably, Polyp-DiFoM consistently outperforms respective baseline models significantly, as well as the state-of-the-art model, with nearly 9 times reduced computation overhead.

On the other hand, Vision Transformers (ViTs), inspired by models originally created for language processing, use self-attention mechanisms, which allow them to understand relationships across the entire image. In this paper, we compare different types of ViTs (pure, hierarchical, and hybrid) against traditional CNN models across various tasks, including object recognition, detection, and medical image classification. We conduct thorough tests on standard datasets like ImageNet for image classification and COCO for object detection. Additionally, we apply these models to medical imaging using the ChestX-ray14 dataset. We find that hybrid and hierarchical transformers, especially Swin and CvT, offer a strong balance between accuracy and computational resources. Furthermore, by experimenting with data augmentation techniques on medical images, we discover significant performance improvements, particularly with the Swin Transformer model. Overall, our results indicate that Vision Transformers are competitive and, in many cases, outperform traditional CNNs, especially in scenarios requiring the understanding of global visual contexts like medical imaging.

Result: 实验表明现有LNL方法在高噪声和真实世界噪声下性能显著下降，类不平衡和领域变异性是主要挑战。

Conclusion: LNMBench提供了一个标准化评估框架，揭示了现有LNL方法在高噪声和真实世界噪声下的性能下降，并提出了一种简单有效的改进方法。

Abstract: Learning from noisy labels remains a major challenge in medical image analysis, where annotation demands expert knowledge and substantial inter-observer variability often leads to inconsistent or erroneous labels. Despite extensive research on learning with noisy labels (LNL), the robustness of existing methods in medical imaging has not been systematically assessed. To address this gap, we introduce LNMBench, a comprehensive benchmark for Label Noise in Medical imaging. LNMBench encompasses \textbf{10} representative methods evaluated across 7 datasets, 6 imaging modalities, and 3 noise patterns, establishing a unified and reproducible framework for robustness evaluation under realistic conditions. Comprehensive experiments reveal that the performance of existing LNL methods degrades substantially under high and real-world noise, highlighting the persistent challenges of class imbalance and domain variability in medical data. Motivated by these findings, we further propose a simple yet effective improvement to enhance model robustness under such conditions. The LNMBench codebase is publicly released to facilitate standardized evaluation, promote reproducible research, and provide practical insights for developing noise-resilient algorithms in both research and real-world medical applications.The codebase is publicly available on https://github.com/myyy777/LNMBench.

Motivation: 基于基准研究的实证观察，假设简洁推理结合减少的视觉令牌集足以进行有效的视频推理。

Method: 设计并验证了一个高效的训练后和推理框架，使视频MLLM能够在压缩的视觉令牌上操作，并在回答前生成简短的推理轨迹。

Result: 模型显著提高了推理效率，在多样化的基准测试中表现优异，且无需依赖手动CoT注释或有监督微调。

Conclusion: 长且类人的CoT推理在通用视频推理中可能并非必要，简洁推理既有效又高效。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has been highly successful in solving complex tasks in natural language processing, and recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have extended this paradigm to video reasoning. However, these models typically build on lengthy reasoning chains and large numbers of input visual tokens. Motivated by empirical observations from our benchmark study, we hypothesize that concise reasoning combined with a reduced set of visual tokens can be sufficient for effective video reasoning. To evaluate this hypothesis, we design and validate an efficient post-training and inference framework that enhances a video MLLM's reasoning capability. Our framework enables models to operate on compressed visual tokens and generate brief reasoning traces prior to answering. The resulting models achieve substantially improved inference efficiency, deliver competitive performance across diverse benchmarks, and avoid reliance on manual CoT annotations or supervised fine-tuning. Collectively, our results suggest that long, human-like CoT reasoning may not be necessary for general video reasoning, and that concise reasoning can be both effective and efficient. Our code will be released at https://github.com/LaVi-Lab/Rethink_CoT_Video.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多专注于说话者生成，听者动作生成因音频驱动训练失败而僵硬，且现有联合生成方法依赖额外说话者动作，无法实时应用。

Method: 引入两阶段训练范式：第一阶段训练无音频的自回归生成器学习内部运动先验；第二阶段引入双轨音频微调生成器，基于外部语音线索调制学习到的运动先验。

Result: UniLS在说话准确性上达到最先进水平，听者指标提升44.1%，生成更多样且自然的听者表情。

Conclusion: UniLS框架通过两阶段训练范式有效解决了听者动作生成的僵硬问题，提供了高保真的音频驱动解决方案，适用于交互式数字人类。

Abstract: Generating lifelike conversational avatars requires modeling not just isolated speakers, but the dynamic, reciprocal interaction of speaking and listening. However, modeling the listener is exceptionally challenging: direct audio-driven training fails, producing stiff, static listening motions. This failure stems from a fundamental imbalance: the speaker's motion is strongly driven by speech audio, while the listener's motion primarily follows an internal motion prior and is only loosely guided by external speech. This challenge has led most methods to focus on speak-only generation. The only prior attempt at joint generation relies on extra speaker's motion to produce the listener. This design is not end-to-end, thereby hindering the real-time applicability. To address this limitation, we present UniLS, the first end-to-end framework for generating unified speak-listen expressions, driven by only dual-track audio. Our method introduces a novel two-stage training paradigm. Stage 1 first learns the internal motion prior by training an audio-free autoregressive generator, capturing the spontaneous dynamics of natural facial motion. Stage 2 then introduces the dual-track audio, fine-tuning the generator to modulate the learned motion prior based on external speech cues. Extensive evaluations show UniLS achieves state-of-the-art speaking accuracy. More importantly, it delivers up to 44.1\% improvement in listening metrics, generating significantly more diverse and natural listening expressions. This effectively mitigates the stiffness problem and provides a practical, high-fidelity audio-driven solution for interactive digital humans.

Abstract: Modeling relightable and animatable human avatars from monocular video is a long-standing and challenging task. Recently, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods have been employed to reconstruct the avatars. However, they often produce unsatisfactory photo-realistic results because of insufficient geometrical details related to body motion, such as clothing wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a 3DGS-based human avatar modeling framework, termed as Relightable and Dynamic Gaussian Avatar (RnD-Avatar), that presents accurate pose-variant deformation for high-fidelity geometrical details. To achieve this, we introduce dynamic skinning weights that define the human avatar's articulation based on pose while also learning additional deformations induced by body motion. We also introduce a novel regularization to capture fine geometric details under sparse visual cues. Furthermore, we present a new multi-view dataset with varied lighting conditions to evaluate relight. Our framework enables realistic rendering of novel poses and views while supporting photo-realistic lighting effects under arbitrary lighting conditions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, novel pose rendering, and relighting.

Abstract: U-Net and other U-shaped architectures have achieved significant success in image deconvolution tasks. However, challenges have emerged, as these methods might generate unrealistic artifacts or hallucinations, which can interfere with analysis in safety-critical scenarios. This paper introduces a novel approach for quantifying and comprehending hallucination artifacts to ensure trustworthy computer vision models. Our method, termed the Conformal Hallucination Estimation Metric (CHEM), is applicable to any image reconstruction model, enabling efficient identification and quantification of hallucination artifacts. It offers two key advantages: it leverages wavelet and shearlet representations to efficiently extract hallucinations of image features and uses conformalized quantile regression to assess hallucination levels in a distribution-free manner. Furthermore, from an approximation theoretical perspective, we explore the reasons why U-shaped networks are prone to hallucinations. We test the proposed approach on the CANDELS astronomical image dataset with models such as U-Net, SwinUNet, and Learnlets, and provide new perspectives on hallucination from different aspects in deep learning-based image processing.

Method: 分析MM-DiT模型中的注意力模式，特别是针对图像中要渲染的文本相关标记，并在去噪过程的早期阶段应用基于两种新引入的损失函数的潜在指导。

Result: TextGuider在测试时文本渲染中实现了最先进的性能，显著提高了召回率，并在OCR准确性和CLIP得分上取得了强劲结果。

Conclusion: TextGuider提出了一种无需训练的方法，通过对齐文本内容标记和图像中的文本区域，显著提升了文本渲染的准确性和完整性，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, diffusion-based text-to-image models still struggle with accurate text rendering. Several studies have proposed fine-tuning or training-free refinement methods for accurate text rendering. However, the critical issue of text omission, where the desired text is partially or entirely missing, remains largely overlooked. In this work, we propose TextGuider, a novel training-free method that encourages accurate and complete text appearance by aligning textual content tokens and text regions in the image. Specifically, we analyze attention patterns in MM-DiT models, particularly for text-related tokens intended to be rendered in the image. Leveraging this observation, we apply latent guidance during the early stage of denoising steps based on two loss functions that we introduce. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in test-time text rendering, with significant gains in recall and strong results in OCR accuracy and CLIP score.

Conclusion: Bind & Compose方法在视觉概念一致性、提示保真度和运动质量上优于现有方法，为视觉创意开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Visual concept composition, which aims to integrate different elements from images and videos into a single, coherent visual output, still falls short in accurately extracting complex concepts from visual inputs and flexibly combining concepts from both images and videos. We introduce Bind & Compose, a one-shot method that enables flexible visual concept composition by binding visual concepts with corresponding prompt tokens and composing the target prompt with bound tokens from various sources. It adopts a hierarchical binder structure for cross-attention conditioning in Diffusion Transformers to encode visual concepts into corresponding prompt tokens for accurate decomposition of complex visual concepts. To improve concept-token binding accuracy, we design a Diversify-and-Absorb Mechanism that uses an extra absorbent token to eliminate the impact of concept-irrelevant details when training with diversified prompts. To enhance the compatibility between image and video concepts, we present a Temporal Disentanglement Strategy that decouples the training process of video concepts into two stages with a dual-branch binder structure for temporal modeling. Evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves superior concept consistency, prompt fidelity, and motion quality over existing approaches, opening up new possibilities for visual creativity.

Method: Video-QTR是一个轻量级框架，将视频理解重新定义为查询引导的推理过程，动态分配感知资源。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，Video-QTR实现了最先进的性能，同时将输入帧消耗减少了73%。

Conclusion: Video-QTR通过查询驱动的时序推理，为视频理解提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案，显著减少了输入帧的消耗。

Abstract: The rapid development of multimodal large-language models (MLLMs) has significantly expanded the scope of visual language reasoning, enabling unified systems to interpret and describe complex visual content. However, applying these models to long-video understanding remains computationally intensive. Dense frame encoding generates excessive visual tokens, leading to high memory consumption, redundant computation, and limited scalability in real-world applications. This inefficiency highlights a key limitation of the traditional process-then-reason paradigm, which analyzes visual streams exhaustively before semantic reasoning. To address this challenge, we introduce Video-QTR (Query-Driven Temporal Reasoning), a lightweight framework that redefines video comprehension as a query-guided reasoning process. Instead of encoding every frame, Video-QTR dynamically allocates perceptual resources based on the semantic intent of the query, creating an adaptive feedback loop between reasoning and perception. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks: MSVD-QA, Activity Net-QA, Movie Chat, and Video MME demonstrate that Video-QTR achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing input frame consumption by up to 73%. These results confirm that query-driven temporal reasoning provides an efficient and scalable solution for video understanding.

TL;DR: MedForget是一个层次感知的多模态遗忘测试平台，用于评估医疗AI系统中的数据遗忘效果，实验显示现有方法在实现完全遗忘和保持性能之间存在权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的多模态大语言模型在医疗AI系统中的部署引发了隐私和合规性挑战，尤其是在‘被遗忘权’法规（如HIPAA和GDPR）下。遗忘作为选择性移除特定训练数据影响的方法，其有效性在复杂医疗环境中尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入了MedForget测试平台，采用层次感知的多模态遗忘方法，包含明确的保留和遗忘划分，以及包含重述变体的评估集。实验使用了四种最先进的遗忘方法，在三种任务（生成、分类、填空）上进行测试。

Result: 实验表明，现有方法难以在不降低诊断性能的情况下实现完全的层次感知遗忘。粗粒度遗忘的模型对重建攻击表现出较强抵抗力，而细粒度遗忘的模型则易受攻击。

Conclusion: MedForget提供了一个符合HIPAA标准的测试平台，用于构建合规的医疗AI系统，但现有方法在实现层次感知的完全遗忘同时保持诊断性能方面仍有挑战。

Abstract: Pretrained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in medical AI systems for clinical reasoning, diagnosis support, and report generation. However, their training on sensitive patient data raises critical privacy and compliance challenges under regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR, which enforce the "right to be forgotten". Unlearning, the process of tuning models to selectively remove the influence of specific training data points, offers a potential solution, yet its effectiveness in complex medical settings remains underexplored. To systematically study this, we introduce MedForget, a Hierarchy-Aware Multimodal Unlearning Testbed with explicit retain and forget splits and evaluation sets containing rephrased variants. MedForget models hospital data as a nested hierarchy (Institution -> Patient -> Study -> Section), enabling fine-grained assessment across eight organizational levels. The benchmark contains 3840 multimodal (image, question, answer) instances, each hierarchy level having a dedicated unlearning target, reflecting distinct unlearning challenges. Experiments with four SOTA unlearning methods on three tasks (generation, classification, cloze) show that existing methods struggle to achieve complete, hierarchy-aware forgetting without reducing diagnostic performance. To test whether unlearning truly deletes hierarchical pathways, we introduce a reconstruction attack that progressively adds hierarchical level context to prompts. Models unlearned at a coarse granularity show strong resistance, while fine-grained unlearning leaves models vulnerable to such reconstruction. MedForget provides a practical, HIPAA-aligned testbed for building compliant medical AI systems.

Abstract: Class-agnostic 3D instance segmentation tackles the challenging task of segmenting all object instances, including previously unseen ones, without semantic class reliance. Current methods struggle with generalization due to the scarce annotated 3D scene data or noisy 2D segmentations. While synthetic data generation offers a promising solution, existing 3D scene synthesis methods fail to simultaneously satisfy geometry diversity, context complexity, and layout reasonability, each essential for this task. To address these needs, we propose an Adapted 3D Scene Synthesis pipeline for class-agnostic 3D Instance SegmenTation, termed as ASSIST-3D, to synthesize proper data for model generalization enhancement. Specifically, ASSIST-3D features three key innovations, including 1) Heterogeneous Object Selection from extensive 3D CAD asset collections, incorporating randomness in object sampling to maximize geometric and contextual diversity; 2) Scene Layout Generation through LLM-guided spatial reasoning combined with depth-first search for reasonable object placements; and 3) Realistic Point Cloud Construction via multi-view RGB-D image rendering and fusion from the synthetic scenes, closely mimicking real-world sensor data acquisition. Experiments on ScanNetV2, ScanNet++, and S3DIS benchmarks demonstrate that models trained with ASSIST-3D-generated data significantly outperform existing methods. Further comparisons underscore the superiority of our purpose-built pipeline over existing 3D scene synthesis approaches.

Conclusion: FUSER和FUSER-DF在多视角点云配准中表现出色，不仅在精度上优于现有方法，还显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Registration of multiview point clouds conventionally relies on extensive pairwise matching to build a pose graph for global synchronization, which is computationally expensive and inherently ill-posed without holistic geometric constraints. This paper proposes FUSER, the first feed-forward multiview registration transformer that jointly processes all scans in a unified, compact latent space to directly predict global poses without any pairwise estimation. To maintain tractability, FUSER encodes each scan into low-resolution superpoint features via a sparse 3D CNN that preserves absolute translation cues, and performs efficient intra- and inter-scan reasoning through a Geometric Alternating Attention module. Particularly, we transfer 2D attention priors from off-the-shelf foundation models to enhance 3D feature interaction and geometric consistency. Building upon FUSER, we further introduce FUSER-DF, an SE(3)$^N$ diffusion refinement framework to correct FUSER's estimates via denoising in the joint SE(3)$^N$ space. FUSER acts as a surrogate multiview registration model to construct the denoiser, and a prior-conditioned SE(3)$^N$ variational lower bound is derived for denoising supervision. Extensive experiments on 3DMatch, ScanNet and ArkitScenes demonstrate that our approach achieves the superior registration accuracy and outstanding computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于感知启发的可学习HSI（LHSI）色彩空间的新框架，用于白平衡校正，展示了感知启发的色彩空间设计在计算摄影中的潜力。

Abstract: White balance (WB) is a key step in the image signal processor (ISP) pipeline that mitigates color casts caused by varying illumination and restores the scene's true colors. Currently, sRGB-based WB editing for post-ISP WB correction is widely used to address color constancy failures in the ISP pipeline when the original camera RAW is unavailable. However, additive color models (e.g., sRGB) are inherently limited by fixed nonlinear transformations and entangled color channels, which often impede their generalization to complex lighting conditions.
  To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for WB correction that leverages a perception-inspired Learnable HSI (LHSI) color space. Built upon a cylindrical color model that naturally separates luminance from chromatic components, our framework further introduces dedicated parameters to enhance this disentanglement and learnable mapping to adaptively refine the flexibility. Moreover, a new Mamba-based network is introduced, which is tailored to the characteristics of the proposed LHSI color space.
  Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting the potential of perception-inspired color space design in computational photography. The source code is available at https://github.com/YangCheng58/WB_Color_Space.

Abstract: Background. Subdural hematoma (SDH) is a common neurosurgical emergency, with increasing incidence in aging populations. Rapid and accurate identification is essential to guide timely intervention, yet existing automated tools focus primarily on detection and provide limited interpretability or spatial localization. There remains a need for transparent, high-performing systems that integrate multimodal clinical and imaging information to support real-time decision-making.
  Methods. We developed a multimodal deep-learning framework that integrates structured clinical variables, a 3D convolutional neural network trained on CT volumes, and a transformer-enhanced 2D segmentation model for SDH detection and localization. Using 25,315 head CT studies from Hartford HealthCare (2015--2024), of which 3,774 (14.9\%) contained clinician-confirmed SDH, tabular models were trained on demographics, comorbidities, medications, and laboratory results. Imaging models were trained to detect SDH and generate voxel-level probability maps. A greedy ensemble strategy combined complementary predictors.
  Findings. Clinical variables alone provided modest discriminatory power (AUC 0.75). Convolutional models trained on CT volumes and segmentation-derived maps achieved substantially higher accuracy (AUCs 0.922 and 0.926). The multimodal ensemble integrating all components achieved the best overall performance (AUC 0.9407; 95\% CI, 0.930--0.951) and produced anatomically meaningful localization maps consistent with known SDH patterns.
  Interpretation. This multimodal, interpretable framework provides rapid and accurate SDH detection and localization, achieving high detection performance and offering transparent, anatomically grounded outputs. Integration into radiology workflows could streamline triage, reduce time to intervention, and improve consistency in SDH management.

Conclusion: WAH框架通过双曲表示和Wasserstein对齐，显著提升了多视图聚类的性能，实现了最先进的聚类效果。

Abstract: Multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to uncover the latent structure of multi-view data by learning view-common and view-specific information. Although recent studies have explored hyperbolic representations for better tackling the representation gap between different views, they focus primarily on instance-level alignment and neglect global semantic consistency, rendering them vulnerable to view-specific information (\textit{e.g.}, noise and cross-view discrepancies). To this end, this paper proposes a novel Wasserstein-Aligned Hyperbolic (WAH) framework for multi-view clustering. Specifically, our method exploits a view-specific hyperbolic encoder for each view to embed features into the Lorentz manifold for hierarchical semantic modeling. Whereafter, a global semantic loss based on the hyperbolic sliced-Wasserstein distance is introduced to align manifold distributions across views. This is followed by soft cluster assignments to encourage cross-view semantic consistency. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarking datasets show that our method can achieve SOTA clustering performance.

Conclusion: Generative Point Cloud Registration通过结合2D生成模型与3D匹配任务，显著提升了配准性能。Match-ControlNet确保了2D-3D几何一致性和跨视角纹理一致性，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel 3D registration paradigm, Generative Point Cloud Registration, which bridges advanced 2D generative models with 3D matching tasks to enhance registration performance. Our key idea is to generate cross-view consistent image pairs that are well-aligned with the source and target point clouds, enabling geometry-color feature fusion to facilitate robust matching. To ensure high-quality matching, the generated image pair should feature both 2D-3D geometric consistency and cross-view texture consistency. To achieve this, we introduce Match-ControlNet, a matching-specific, controllable 2D generative model. Specifically, it leverages the depth-conditioned generation capability of ControlNet to produce images that are geometrically aligned with depth maps derived from point clouds, ensuring 2D-3D geometric consistency. Additionally, by incorporating a coupled conditional denoising scheme and coupled prompt guidance, Match-ControlNet further promotes cross-view feature interaction, guiding texture consistency generation. Our generative 3D registration paradigm is general and could be seamlessly integrated into various registration methods to enhance their performance. Extensive experiments on 3DMatch and ScanNet datasets verify the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 解决现有方法因缺乏真实配对数据而依赖掩码修复，导致边界伪影和遮挡信息恢复困难的问题。

Method: 提出DirectSwap框架，利用视频扩散模型和MEAR损失函数，直接进行视频头部交换，无需掩码修复。

Result: 实验表明，DirectSwap在多样化的真实视频场景中实现了最先进的视觉质量、身份保真度和一致性。

Conclusion: DirectSwap通过HeadSwapBench数据集和MEAR损失函数，实现了视频头部交换的最先进视觉质量、身份保真度以及动作和表情一致性，并将开源代码和数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Video head swapping aims to replace the entire head of a video subject, including facial identity, head shape, and hairstyle, with that of a reference image, while preserving the target body, background, and motion dynamics. Due to the lack of ground-truth paired swapping data, prior methods typically train on cross-frame pairs of the same person within a video and rely on mask-based inpainting to mitigate identity leakage. Beyond potential boundary artifacts, this paradigm struggles to recover essential cues occluded by the mask, such as facial pose, expressions, and motion dynamics. To address these issues, we prompt a video editing model to synthesize new heads for existing videos as fake swapping inputs, while maintaining frame-synchronized facial poses and expressions. This yields HeadSwapBench, the first cross-identity paired dataset for video head swapping, which supports both training (\TrainNum{} videos) and benchmarking (\TestNum{} videos) with genuine outputs. Leveraging this paired supervision, we propose DirectSwap, a mask-free, direct video head-swapping framework that extends an image U-Net into a video diffusion model with a motion module and conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce the Motion- and Expression-Aware Reconstruction (MEAR) loss, which reweights the diffusion loss per pixel using frame-difference magnitudes and facial-landmark proximity, thereby enhancing cross-frame coherence in motion and expressions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectSwap achieves state-of-the-art visual quality, identity fidelity, and motion and expression consistency across diverse in-the-wild video scenes. We will release the source code and the HeadSwapBench dataset to facilitate future research.

Motivation: 超声心动图的标记数据稀缺，受隐私限制和专家注释复杂性的影响，这成为深度学习方法的主要障碍。

Method: 提出了Motion Conditioned Diffusion Model (MCDM)，一个基于自监督运动特征的无标签潜在扩散框架，以及Motion and Appearance Feature Extractor (MAFE)来解耦视频中的运动和外观表示。通过两个辅助目标（基于伪外观特征的重新识别损失和基于伪流场的光流损失）增强特征学习。

Conclusion: MCDM展示了自监督条件在可扩展的超声心动图合成中的潜力，无需依赖手动标签即可生成具有时间一致性和临床真实性的序列。

Abstract: Ultrasound echocardiography is essential for the non-invasive, real-time assessment of cardiac function, but the scarcity of labelled data, driven by privacy restrictions and the complexity of expert annotation, remains a major obstacle for deep learning methods. We propose the Motion Conditioned Diffusion Model (MCDM), a label-free latent diffusion framework that synthesises realistic echocardiography videos conditioned on self-supervised motion features. To extract these features, we design the Motion and Appearance Feature Extractor (MAFE), which disentangles motion and appearance representations from videos. Feature learning is further enhanced by two auxiliary objectives: a re-identification loss guided by pseudo appearance features and an optical flow loss guided by pseudo flow fields. Evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, MCDM achieves competitive video generation performance, producing temporally coherent and clinically realistic sequences without reliance on manual labels. These results demonstrate the potential of self-supervised conditioning for scalable echocardiography synthesis. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZheLi2020/LabelfreeMCDM.

Abstract: Echocardiography playing a critical role in the diagnosis and monitoring of cardiovascular diseases as a non-invasive real-time assessment of cardiac structure and function. However, the growing scale of echocardiographic video data presents significant challenges in terms of storage, computation, and model training efficiency. Dataset distillation offers a promising solution by synthesizing a compact, informative subset of data that retains the key clinical features of the original dataset. In this work, we propose a novel approach for distilling a compact synthetic echocardiographic video dataset. Our method leverages motion feature extraction to capture temporal dynamics, followed by class-wise graph construction and representative sample selection using the Infomap algorithm. This enables us to select a diverse and informative subset of synthetic videos that preserves the essential characteristics of the original dataset. We evaluate our approach on the EchoNet-Dynamic datasets and achieve a test accuracy of \(69.38\%\) using only \(25\) synthetic videos. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our method for medical video dataset distillation.

Conclusion: FunPhase通过功能周期性自编码器学习运动相位流形，统一了运动预测与生成，并在多种下游任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Learning natural body motion remains challenging due to the strong coupling between spatial geometry and temporal dynamics. Embedding motion in phase manifolds, latent spaces that capture local periodicity, has proven effective for motion prediction; however, existing approaches lack scalability and remain confined to specific settings. We introduce FunPhase, a functional periodic autoencoder that learns a phase manifold for motion and replaces discrete temporal decoding with a function-space formulation, enabling smooth trajectories that can be sampled at arbitrary temporal resolutions. FunPhase supports downstream tasks such as super-resolution and partial-body motion completion, generalizes across skeletons and datasets, and unifies motion prediction and generation within a single interpretable manifold. Our model achieves substantially lower reconstruction error than prior periodic autoencoder baselines while enabling a broader range of applications and performing on par with state-of-the-art motion generation methods.

Conclusion: UniPart通过两阶段潜在扩散框架和双空间生成方案，显著提升了部分级3D生成的细分可控性和几何质量。

Abstract: Part-level 3D generation is essential for applications requiring decomposable and structured 3D synthesis. However, existing methods either rely on implicit part segmentation with limited granularity control or depend on strong external segmenters trained on large annotated datasets. In this work, we observe that part awareness emerges naturally during whole-object geometry learning and propose Geom-Seg VecSet, a unified geometry-segmentation latent representation that jointly encodes object geometry and part-level structure. Building on this representation, we introduce UniPart, a two-stage latent diffusion framework for image-guided part-level 3D generation. The first stage performs joint geometry generation and latent part segmentation, while the second stage conditions part-level diffusion on both whole-object and part-specific latents. A dual-space generation scheme further enhances geometric fidelity by predicting part latents in both global and canonical spaces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniPart achieves superior segmentation controllability and part-level geometric quality compared with existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在异常检测中忽视了细粒度异常类型（如“孔洞”、“切口”、“划痕”），而这些信息对理解异常根源和实施针对性措施至关重要。手动设计提示耗时且易受人为偏见影响。

Method: DAPO是一种基于渐进调优的缺陷感知提示优化方法，通过混合缺陷感知提示将异常相关图像特征与对应文本语义对齐。

Result: 在公开基准和内部数据集上，DAPO在分布偏移下图像级AUROC和平均精度指标平均提升3.7%，在零样本设置下定位新异常类型的性能平均提升6.5%。

Conclusion: DAPO通过结合固定文本锚点和可学习的令牌嵌入，显著提升了在分布偏移和零样本设置下的异常检测和分割性能，为制造商提供了更精确的异常类型识别。

Abstract: Recent vision language models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated impressive anomaly detection performance under significant distribution shift by utilizing high-level semantic information through text prompts. However, these models often neglect fine-grained details, such as which kind of anomalies, like "hole", "cut", "scratch" that could provide more specific insight into the nature of anomalies. We argue that recognizing fine-grained anomaly types 1) enriches the representation of "abnormal" with structured semantics, narrowing the gap between coarse anomaly signals and fine-grained defect categories; 2) enables manufacturers to understand the root causes of the anomaly and implement more targeted and appropriate corrective measures quickly. While incorporating such detailed semantic information is crucial, designing handcrafted prompts for each defect type is both time-consuming and susceptible to human bias. For this reason, we introduce DAPO, a novel approach for Defect-aware Prompt Optimization based on progressive tuning for the zero-shot multi-type and binary anomaly detection and segmentation under distribution shifts. Our approach aligns anomaly-relevant image features with their corresponding text semantics by learning hybrid defect-aware prompts with both fixed textual anchors and learnable token embeddings. We conducted experiments on public benchmarks (MPDD, VisA, MVTec-AD, MAD, and Real-IAD) and an internal dataset. The results suggest that compared to the baseline models, DAPO achieves a 3.7% average improvement in AUROC and average precision metrics at the image level under distribution shift, and a 6.5% average improvement in localizing novel anomaly types under zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 多光谱图像（MSIs）提供了额外的光谱线索，有望解决RGB检测器在小目标和复杂背景干扰下的性能限制，但缺乏训练数据阻碍了其潜力开发。

Method: 提出OSSDet框架，采用级联光谱-空间调制结构优化目标感知，利用光谱相似性聚合光谱相关特征以增强对象内相关性，并通过对象感知掩码抑制无关背景。交叉光谱注意力在明确的对象感知指导下进一步细化对象相关表示。

Result: OSSDet在参数和效率可比的情况下，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OSSDet框架通过整合光谱和空间信息与对象感知线索，显著提升了多光谱图像中的空中目标检测性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Aerial object detection faces significant challenges in real-world scenarios, such as small objects and extensive background interference, which limit the performance of RGB-based detectors with insufficient discriminative information. Multispectral images (MSIs) capture additional spectral cues across multiple bands, offering a promising alternative. However, the lack of training data has been the primary bottleneck to exploiting the potential of MSIs. To address this gap, we introduce the first large-scale dataset for Multispectral Object Detection in Aerial images (MODA), which comprises 14,041 MSIs and 330,191 annotations across diverse, challenging scenarios, providing a comprehensive data foundation for this field. Furthermore, to overcome challenges inherent to aerial object detection using MSIs, we propose OSSDet, a framework that integrates spectral and spatial information with object-aware cues. OSSDet employs a cascaded spectral-spatial modulation structure to optimize target perception, aggregates spectrally related features by exploiting spectral similarities to reinforce intra-object correlations, and suppresses irrelevant background via object-aware masking. Moreover, cross-spectral attention further refines object-related representations under explicit object-aware guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OSSDet outperforms existing methods with comparable parameters and efficiency.

Conclusion: StateSpace-SSL通过线性状态空间建模，显著提升了自监督学习在植物病害检测中的表现，优于现有的CNN和Transformer基线方法。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is attractive for plant disease detection as it can exploit large collections of unlabeled leaf images, yet most existing SSL methods are built on CNNs or vision transformers that are poorly matched to agricultural imagery. CNN-based SSL struggles to capture disease patterns that evolve continuously along leaf structures, while transformer-based SSL introduces quadratic attention cost from high-resolution patches. To address these limitations, we propose StateSpace-SSL, a linear-time SSL framework that employs a Vision Mamba state-space encoder to model long-range lesion continuity through directional scanning across the leaf surface. A prototype-driven teacher-student objective aligns representations across multiple views, encouraging stable and lesion-aware features from labelled data. Experiments on three publicly available plant disease datasets show that StateSpace-SSL consistently outperforms the CNN- and transformer-based SSL baselines in various evaluation metrics. Qualitative analyses further confirm that it learns compact, lesion-focused feature maps, highlighting the advantage of linear state-space modelling for self-supervised plant disease representation learning.

Abstract: Recently, infrared small target detection has attracted extensive attention. However, due to the small size and the lack of intrinsic features of infrared small targets, the existing methods generally have the problem of inaccurate edge positioning and the target is easily submerged by the background. Therefore, we propose an innovative gradient-guided learning network (GGL-Net). Specifically, we are the first to explore the introduction of gradient magnitude images into the deep learning-based infrared small target detection method, which is conducive to emphasizing the edge details and alleviating the problem of inaccurate edge positioning of small targets. On this basis, we propose a novel dual-branch feature extraction network that utilizes the proposed gradient supplementary module (GSM) to encode raw gradient information into deeper network layers and embeds attention mechanisms reasonably to enhance feature extraction ability. In addition, we construct a two-way guidance fusion module (TGFM), which fully considers the characteristics of feature maps at different levels. It can facilitate the effective fusion of multi-scale feature maps and extract richer semantic information and detailed information through reasonable two-way guidance. Extensive experiments prove that GGL-Net has achieves state-of-the-art results on the public real NUAA-SIRST dataset and the public synthetic NUDT-SIRST dataset.

Abstract: Surgical planning for complex tibial fractures can be challenging for surgeons, as the 3D structure of the later desirable bone alignment may be diffi- cult to imagine. To assist in such planning, we address the challenge of predicting a patient-specific reconstruction target from a CT of the fractured tibia. Our ap- proach combines neural registration and autoencoder models. Specifically, we first train a modified spatial transformer network (STN) to register a raw CT to a standardized coordinate system of a jointly trained tibia prototype. Subsequently, various autoencoder (AE) architectures are trained to model healthy tibial varia- tions. Both the STN and AE models are further designed to be robust to masked input, allowing us to apply them to fractured CTs and decode to a prediction of the patient-specific healthy bone in standard coordinates. Our contributions include: i) a 3D-adapted STN for global spatial registration, ii) a comparative analysis of AEs for bone CT modeling, and iii) the extension of both to handle masked inputs for predictive generation of healthy bone structures.

Conclusion: DDSRNet通过结合空间域和频域学习，在三个高光谱图像数据集上表现出色，计算成本低，验证了其在高光谱图像超分辨率中的有效性。

Abstract: This study presents a lightweight dual-domain super-resolution network (DDSRNet) that combines Spatial-Net with the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Specifically, our proposed model comprises three main components: (1) a shallow feature extraction module, termed Spatial-Net, which performs residual learning and bilinear interpolation; (2) a low-frequency enhancement branch based on the DWT that refines coarse image structures; and (3) a shared high-frequency refinement branch that simultaneously enhances the LH (horizontal), HL (vertical), and HH (diagonal) wavelet subbands using a single CNN with shared weights. As a result, the DWT enables subband decomposition, while the inverse DWT reconstructs the final high-resolution output. By doing so, the integration of spatial- and frequency-domain learning enables DDSRNet to achieve highly competitive performance with low computational cost on three hyperspectral image datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for hyperspectral image super-resolution.

However, these models often produce textual descriptions that contradict their final quality predictions, and the predicted scores can change unstably during inference - behaviors not aligned with human reasoning. To understand these issues, we analyze the factors that cause contradictory assessments and instability. We first estimate the relationship between the final quality predictions and the generated visual features, finding that the predictions are not fully grounded in the features and that the logical connection between them is weak. Moreover, decoding intermediate VLM layers shows that the model frequently relies on a limited set of candidate tokens, which contributes to prediction instability. To encourage more human-like reasoning, we introduce a two-stage tuning method that explicitly separates visual perception from quality inference. In the first stage, the model learns visual features; in the second, it infers quality solely from these features. Experiments on SPAQ and KONIQ demonstrate that our approach reduces prediction instability from 22.00% to 12.39% and achieves average gains of 0.3124/0.3507 in SRCC/PLCC across LIVE, CSIQ, SPAQ, and KONIQ compared to the baseline. Further analyses show that our method improves both stability and the reliability of the inference process.

Conclusion: DNS-HyXNet通过xLSTM序列建模有效替代了计算成本高的递归图生成方法，为实时DNS隧道检测提供了可部署且节能的解决方案。

Abstract: Domain Name System (DNS) tunneling remains a covert channel for data exfiltration and command-and-control communication. Although graph-based methods such as GraphTunnel achieve strong accuracy, they introduce significant latency and computational overhead due to recursive parsing and graph construction, limiting their suitability for real-time deployment. This work presents DNS-HyXNet, a lightweight extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) hybrid framework designed for efficient sequence-based DNS tunnel detection. DNS-HyXNet integrates tokenized domain embeddings with normalized numerical DNS features and processes them through a two-layer xLSTM network that directly learns temporal dependencies from packet sequences, eliminating the need for graph reconstruction and enabling single-stage multi-class classification. The model was trained and evaluated on two public benchmark datasets with carefully tuned hyperparameters to ensure low memory consumption and fast inference. Across all experimental splits of the DNS-Tunnel-Datasets, DNS-HyXNet achieved up to 99.99% accuracy, with macro-averaged precision, recall, and F1-scores exceeding 99.96%, and demonstrated a per-sample detection latency of just 0.041 ms, confirming its scalability and real-time readiness. These results show that sequential modeling with xLSTM can effectively replace computationally expensive recursive graph generation, offering a deployable and energy-efficient alternative for real-time DNS tunnel detection on commodity hardware.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs struggle with low-level distortion detection in IQA; fine-tuning the vision encoder improves accuracy from 14.92% to 84.43%, enhancing interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether MLLM-based IQA systems truly perceive essential visual features, given their unreliable detection of basic low-level distortions and inconsistent evaluations.

Method: The study introduces a low-level distortion perception task for classification and conducts component-wise analysis, including fine-tuning the vision encoder and computing semantic distances between visual features and semantic tokens.

Result: Improving the alignment of the vision encoder significantly enhances distortion recognition accuracy, increasing it from 14.92% to 84.43%.

Conclusion: Incorporating dedicated constraints on the vision encoder can enhance text-explainable visual representations, enabling MLLM-based pipelines to produce more coherent and interpretable reasoning in vision-centric tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in Image Quality Assessment (IQA) have leveraged Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate descriptive explanations. However, despite their strong visual perception modules, these models often fail to reliably detect basic low-level distortions such as blur, noise, and compression, and may produce inconsistent evaluations across repeated inferences. This raises an essential question: do MLLM-based IQA systems truly perceive the visual features that matter? To examine this issue, we introduce a low-level distortion perception task that requires models to classify specific distortion types. Our component-wise analysis shows that although MLLMs are structurally capable of representing such distortions, they tend to overfit training templates, leading to biases in quality scoring. As a result, critical low-level features are weakened or lost during the vision-language alignment transfer stage. Furthermore, by computing the semantic distance between visual features and corresponding semantic tokens before and after component-wise fine-tuning, we show that improving the alignment of the vision encoder dramatically enhances distortion recognition accuracy, increasing it from 14.92% to 84.43%. Overall, these findings indicate that incorporating dedicated constraints on the vision encoder can strengthen text-explainable visual representations and enable MLLM-based pipelines to produce more coherent and interpretable reasoning in vision-centric tasks.

Abstract: Environmental variables are increasingly affecting agricultural decision-making, yet accessible and scalable tools for soil assessment remain limited. This study presents a robust and scalable modeling system for estimating soil properties in croplands, including soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P), exchangeable potassium (K), and pH, using remote sensing data and environmental covariates. The system employs a hybrid modeling approach, combining the indirect methods of modeling soil through proxies and drivers with direct spectral modeling. We extend current approaches by using interpretable physics-informed covariates derived from radiative transfer models (RTMs) and complex, nonlinear embeddings from a foundation model. We validate the system on a harmonized dataset that covers Europes cropland soils across diverse pedoclimatic zones. Evaluation is conducted under a robust validation framework that enforces strict spatial blocking, stratified splits, and statistically distinct train-test sets, which deliberately make the evaluation harder and produce more realistic error estimates for unseen regions. The models achieved their highest accuracy for SOC and N. This performance held across unseen locations, under both spatial cross-validation and an independent test set. SOC obtained a MAE of 5.12 g/kg and a CCC of 0.77, and N obtained a MAE of 0.44 g/kg and a CCC of 0.77. We also assess uncertainty through conformal calibration, achieving 90 percent coverage at the target confidence level. This study contributes to the digital advancement of agriculture through the application of scalable, data-driven soil analysis frameworks that can be extended to related domains requiring quantitative soil evaluation, such as carbon markets.

Conclusion: CA-ATP方法通过内容自适应曲线映射和属性文本预测模块，实现了高质量的图像润色，能够适应多样化的颜色分布和用户定义的风格偏好，实验证明其性能达到了当前最佳水平。

Abstract: Image retouching has received significant attention due to its ability to achieve high-quality visual content. Existing approaches mainly rely on uniform pixel-wise color mapping across entire images, neglecting the inherent color variations induced by image content. This limitation hinders existing approaches from achieving adaptive retouching that accommodates both diverse color distributions and user-defined style preferences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Content-Adaptive image retouching method guided by Attribute-based Text Representation (CA-ATP). Specifically, we propose a content-adaptive curve mapping module, which leverages a series of basis curves to establish multiple color mapping relationships and learns the corresponding weight maps, enabling content-aware color adjustments. The proposed module can capture color diversity within the image content, allowing similar color values to receive distinct transformations based on their spatial context. In addition, we propose an attribute text prediction module that generates text representations from multiple image attributes, which explicitly represent user-defined style preferences. These attribute-based text representations are subsequently integrated with visual features via a multimodal model, providing user-friendly guidance for image retouching. Extensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: UnReflectAnything框架通过RGB图像成功移除高光，并在自然和手术图像领域展现出优异的泛化能力，与现有技术相比具有竞争力。

Abstract: Specular highlights distort appearance, obscure texture, and hinder geometric reasoning in both natural and surgical imagery. We present UnReflectAnything, an RGB-only framework that removes highlights from a single image by predicting a highlight map together with a reflection-free diffuse reconstruction. The model uses a frozen vision transformer encoder to extract multi-scale features, a lightweight head to localize specular regions, and a token-level inpainting module that restores corrupted feature patches before producing the final diffuse image. To overcome the lack of paired supervision, we introduce a Virtual Highlight Synthesis pipeline that renders physically plausible specularities using monocular geometry, Fresnel-aware shading, and randomized lighting which enables training on arbitrary RGB images with correct geometric structure. UnReflectAnything generalizes across natural and surgical domains where non-Lambertian surfaces and non-uniform lighting create severe highlights and it achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种轻量级的适应技术，用于多视图扩散模型中的外观迁移，通过结合输入图像的对象身份和参考图像的外观线索，生成具有多视图一致性的输出，同时保留基础对象几何和视图一致性。

Abstract: Multiview diffusion models have rapidly emerged as a powerful tool for content creation with spatial consistency across viewpoints, offering rich visual realism without requiring explicit geometry and appearance representation. However, compared to meshes or radiance fields, existing multiview diffusion models offer limited appearance manipulation, particularly in terms of material, texture, or style.
  In this paper, we present a lightweight adaptation technique for appearance transfer in multiview diffusion models. Our method learns to combine object identity from an input image with appearance cues rendered in a separate reference image, producing multi-view-consistent output that reflects the desired materials, textures, or styles. This allows explicit specification of appearance parameters at generation time while preserving the underlying object geometry and view coherence. We leverage three diffusion denoising processes responsible for generating the original object, the reference, and the target images, and perform reverse sampling to aggregate a small subset of layer-wise self-attention features from the object and the reference to influence the target generation. Our method requires only a few training examples to introduce appearance awareness to pretrained multiview models. The experiments show that our method provides a simple yet effective way toward multiview generation with diverse appearance, advocating the adoption of implicit generative 3D representations in practice.

Conclusion: 研究发现，通过将双向RNN的序列长度设置为1，使其作为高容量静态特征编码器，显著提升了分类准确率，最终达到97.60%。这一方法为低级别的手-物体交互识别提供了新的基准。

Abstract: Reliably predicting human intent in hand-object interactions is an open challenge for computer vision. Our research concentrates on a fundamental sub-problem: the fine-grained classification of atomic interaction states, namely 'approaching', 'grabbing', and 'holding'. To this end, we introduce a structured data engineering process that converts raw videos from the MANIAC dataset into 27,476 statistical-kinematic feature vectors. Each vector encapsulates relational and dynamic properties from a short temporal window of motion. Our initial hypothesis posited that sequential modeling would be critical, leading us to compare static classifiers (MLPs) against temporal models (RNNs). Counter-intuitively, the key discovery occurred when we set the sequence length of a Bidirectional RNN to one (seq_length=1). This modification converted the network's function, compelling it to act as a high-capacity static feature encoder. This architectural change directly led to a significant accuracy improvement, culminating in a final score of 97.60%. Of particular note, our optimized model successfully overcame the most challenging transitional class, 'grabbing', by achieving a balanced F1-score of 0.90. These findings provide a new benchmark for low-level hand-object interaction recognition using structured, interpretable features and lightweight architectures.

Abstract: Developing generalizable AI for medical imaging requires both access to large, multi-center datasets and standardized, reproducible tooling within research environments. However, leveraging real-world imaging data in clinical research environments is still hampered by strict regulatory constraints, fragmented software infrastructure, and the challenges inherent in conducting large-cohort multicentre studies. This leads to projects that rely on ad-hoc toolchains that are hard to reproduce, difficult to scale beyond single institutions and poorly suited for collaboration between clinicians and data scientists. We present Kaapana, a comprehensive open-source platform for medical imaging research that is designed to bridge this gap. Rather than building single-use, site-specific tooling, Kaapana provides a modular, extensible framework that unifies data ingestion, cohort curation, processing workflows and result inspection under a common user interface. By bringing the algorithm to the data, it enables institutions to keep control over their sensitive data while still participating in distributed experimentation and model development. By integrating flexible workflow orchestration with user-facing applications for researchers, Kaapana reduces technical overhead, improves reproducibility and enables conducting large-scale, collaborative, multi-centre imaging studies. We describe the core concepts of the platform and illustrate how they can support diverse use cases, from local prototyping to nation-wide research networks.

Conclusion: VHOI提出了一种两阶段框架，通过将稀疏轨迹稠密化为HOI掩码序列，并基于这些稠密掩码微调视频扩散模型，实现了可控的人类-物体交互视频生成，达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic human-object interactions (HOI) in video is challenging due to the complex, instance-specific interaction dynamics of both humans and objects. Incorporating controllability in video generation further adds to the complexity. Existing controllable video generation approaches face a trade-off: sparse controls like keypoint trajectories are easy to specify but lack instance-awareness, while dense signals such as optical flow, depths or 3D meshes are informative but costly to obtain. We propose VHOI, a two-stage framework that first densifies sparse trajectories into HOI mask sequences, and then fine-tunes a video diffusion model conditioned on these dense masks. We introduce a novel HOI-aware motion representation that uses color encodings to distinguish not only human and object motion, but also body-part-specific dynamics. This design incorporates a human prior into the conditioning signal and strengthens the model's ability to understand and generate realistic HOI dynamics. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results in controllable HOI video generation. VHOI is not limited to interaction-only scenarios and can also generate full human navigation leading up to object interactions in an end-to-end manner.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to impressive progress across various benchmarks. However, their capability in understanding infrared images remains unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce IF-Bench, the first high-quality benchmark designed for evaluating multimodal understanding of infrared images. IF-Bench consists of 499 images sourced from 23 infrared datasets and 680 carefully curated visual question-answer pairs, covering 10 essential dimensions of image understanding. Based on this benchmark, we systematically evaluate over 40 open-source and closed-source MLLMs, employing cyclic evaluation, bilingual assessment, and hybrid judgment strategies to enhance the reliability of the results. Our analysis reveals how model scale, architecture, and inference paradigms affect infrared image comprehension, providing valuable insights for this area. Furthermore, we propose a training-free generative visual prompting (GenViP) method, which leverages advanced image editing models to translate infrared images into semantically and spatially aligned RGB counterparts, thereby mitigating domain distribution shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently yields significant performance improvements across a wide range of MLLMs. The benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/casiatao/IF-Bench.

Abstract: We address the problem of fair classification in settings where data is scarce and unbalanced across demographic groups. Such low-data regimes are common in domains like medical imaging, where false negatives can have fatal consequences.
  We propose a novel approach \emph{OxEnsemble} for efficiently training ensembles and enforcing fairness in these low-data regimes. Unlike other approaches, we aggregate predictions across ensemble members, each trained to satisfy fairness constraints. By construction, \emph{OxEnsemble} is both data-efficient, carefully reusing held-out data to enforce fairness reliably, and compute-efficient, requiring little more compute than used to fine-tune or evaluate an existing model. We validate this approach with new theoretical guarantees. Experimentally, our approach yields more consistent outcomes and stronger fairness-accuracy trade-offs than existing methods across multiple challenging medical imaging classification datasets.

Abstract: The proliferation of satellite constellations, coupled with reduced tasking latency and diverse sensor capabilities, has expanded the opportunities for automated Earth observation. This paper introduces a fully automated Tip-and-Cue framework designed for satellite imaging tasking and scheduling. In this context, tips are generated from external data sources or analyses of prior satellite imagery, identifying spatiotemporal targets and prioritizing them for downstream planning. Corresponding cues are the imaging tasks formulated in response, which incorporate sensor constraints, timing requirements, and utility functions. The system autonomously generates candidate tasks, optimizes their scheduling across multiple satellites using continuous utility functions that reflect the expected value of each observation, and processes the resulting imagery using artificial-intelligence-based models, including object detectors and vision-language models. Structured visual reports are generated to support both interpretability and the identification of new insights for downstream tasking. The efficacy of the framework is demonstrated through a maritime vessel tracking scenario, utilizing Automatic Identification System (AIS) data for trajectory prediction, targeted observations, and the generation of actionable outputs. Maritime vessel tracking is a widely researched application, often used to benchmark novel approaches to satellite tasking, forecasting, and analysis. The system is extensible to broader applications such as smart-city monitoring and disaster response, where timely tasking and automated analysis are critical.

Existing approaches to mitigating memorization mainly focus on manipulating the denoising sampling process to steer image embeddings away from the memorized embedding space or employ unlearning methods that require training on datasets containing specific sets of memorized concepts. However, existing methods often incur substantial computational overhead during sampling, or focus narrowly on removing one or more groups of target concepts, imposing a significant limitation on their scalability. To understand and mitigate these problems, our work, UniForget, offers a new perspective on understanding the root cause of memorization. Our work demonstrates that specific parts of the model are responsible for copyrighted content generation. By applying model pruning, we can effectively suppress the probability of generating copyrighted content without targeting specific concepts while preserving the general generative capabilities of the model. Additionally, we show that our approach is both orthogonal and complementary to existing unlearning methods, thereby highlighting its potential to improve current unlearning and de-memorization techniques.

Conclusion: LiM-YOLO通过Pyramid Level Shift Strategy和GN-CBLinear模块，有效解决了卫星图像中船舶检测的尺度差异和形态各向异性问题，显著提升了检测精度和效率。

Abstract: Applying general-purpose object detectors to ship detection in satellite imagery presents significant challenges due to the extreme scale disparity and morphological anisotropy of maritime targets. Standard architectures utilizing stride-32 (P5) layers often fail to resolve narrow vessels, resulting in spatial feature dilution. In this work, we propose LiM-YOLO, a specialized detector designed to resolve these domain-specific conflicts. Based on a statistical analysis of ship scales, we introduce a Pyramid Level Shift Strategy that reconfigures the detection head to P2-P4. This shift ensures compliance with Nyquist sampling criteria for small objects while eliminating the computational redundancy of deep layers. To further enhance training stability on high-resolution inputs, we incorporate a Group Normalized Convolutional Block for Linear Projection (GN-CBLinear), which mitigates gradient volatility in micro-batch settings. Validated on SODA-A, DOTA-v1.5, FAIR1M-v2.0, and ShipRSImageNet-V1, LiM-YOLO demonstrates superior detection accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: SMA是一个通过风格迁移创建的多样化图像分类元数据集，用于提升OOD泛化和公平性研究的基准测试效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实约束下数据收集难以捕获广泛组多样性的问题，为OOD泛化和相关研究提供多样化基准。

Method: 使用风格迁移技术从12个主题分类数据集中创建SMA，提供4800个多样化组，结合多种主题和风格。

Result: SMA在OOD泛化和组公平性基准测试中显示，增加组多样性显著影响公平性，并提出了Top-M最差组准确率作为新的超参数调优指标。在无监督域适应基准测试中，SMA显著降低了误差条。

Conclusion: SMA通过灵活的组和类控制，显著提升了模型在多样组和域配置下的性能评估，尤其是在公平性、鲁棒性和适应性方面。

Abstract: We introduce Stylized Meta-Album (SMA), a new image classification meta-dataset comprising 24 datasets (12 content datasets, and 12 stylized datasets), designed to advance studies on out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization and related topics. Created using style transfer techniques from 12 subject classification datasets, SMA provides a diverse and extensive set of 4800 groups, combining various subjects (objects, plants, animals, human actions, textures) with multiple styles. SMA enables flexible control over groups and classes, allowing us to configure datasets to reflect diverse benchmark scenarios. While ideally, data collection would capture extensive group diversity, practical constraints often make this infeasible. SMA addresses this by enabling large and configurable group structures through flexible control over styles, subject classes, and domains-allowing datasets to reflect a wide range of real-world benchmark scenarios. This design not only expands group and class diversity, but also opens new methodological directions for evaluating model performance across diverse group and domain configurations-including scenarios with many minority groups, varying group imbalance, and complex domain shifts-and for studying fairness, robustness, and adaptation under a broader range of realistic conditions. To demonstrate SMA's effectiveness, we implemented two benchmarks: (1) a novel OOD generalization and group fairness benchmark leveraging SMA's domain, class, and group diversity to evaluate existing benchmarks. Our findings reveal that while simple balancing and algorithms utilizing group information remain competitive as claimed in previous benchmarks, increasing group diversity significantly impacts fairness, altering the superiority and relative rankings of algorithms. We also propose to use \textit{Top-M worst group accuracy} as a new hyperparameter tuning metric, demonstrating broader fairness during optimization and delivering better final worst-group accuracy for larger group diversity. (2) An unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) benchmark utilizing SMA's group diversity to evaluate UDA algorithms across more scenarios, offering a more comprehensive benchmark with lower error bars (reduced by 73\% and 28\% in closed-set setting and UniDA setting, respectively) compared to existing efforts. These use cases highlight SMA's potential to significantly impact the outcomes of conventional benchmarks.

<details>

Motivation: 现有基于 PnP 的算法计算密集，不适合资源受限的边缘设备实时部署，因此需要一种高效的非 PnP 方法。

Method: 提出 FastPose-ViT，一种基于 Vision Transformer 的架构，通过裁剪图像并引入新的数学形式将局部预测映射回全图像尺度。该方法利用投影几何和“表观旋转”概念预测旋转矩阵，再校正为真实方向。

Result: 在 SPEED 数据集上，FastPose-ViT 性能优于其他非 PnP 方法，并与基于 PnP 的最先进技术竞争。在 NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano 上，端到端延迟为 ~75 ms/帧，非阻塞吞吐量达 33 FPS。

Conclusion: FastPose-ViT 是一种基于 Vision Transformer 的架构，能够直接回归 6DoF 姿态，性能优于其他非 PnP 方法，并与基于 PnP 的最先进技术竞争。此外，该模型在资源受限的边缘设备上量化部署后，仍能实现低延迟和高吞吐量，适合实际太空任务。

Abstract: Estimating the 6-degrees-of-freedom (6DoF) pose of a spacecraft from a single image is critical for autonomous operations like in-orbit servicing and space debris removal. Existing state-of-the-art methods often rely on iterative Perspective-n-Point (PnP)-based algorithms, which are computationally intensive and ill-suited for real-time deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To overcome these limitations, we propose FastPose-ViT, a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architecture that directly regresses the 6DoF pose. Our approach processes cropped images from object bounding boxes and introduces a novel mathematical formalism to map these localized predictions back to the full-image scale. This formalism is derived from the principles of projective geometry and the concept of "apparent rotation", where the model predicts an apparent rotation matrix that is then corrected to find the true orientation. We demonstrate that our method outperforms other non-PnP strategies and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art PnP-based techniques on the SPEED dataset. Furthermore, we validate our model's suitability for real-world space missions by quantizing it and deploying it on power-constrained edge hardware. On the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, our end-to-end pipeline achieves a latency of ~75 ms per frame under sequential execution, and a non-blocking throughput of up to 33 FPS when stages are scheduled concurrently.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的半监督多模态框架通过MEM和CIF模块有效利用了多模态医学影像的互补信息，显著提升了在有限标注数据下的分割性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has become a promising direction for medical image segmentation, enabling models to learn from limited labeled data alongside abundant unlabeled samples. However, existing SSL approaches for multi-modal medical imaging often struggle to exploit the complementary information between modalities due to semantic discrepancies and misalignment across MRI sequences. To address this, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-modal framework that explicitly enhances modality-specific representations and facilitates adaptive cross-modal information fusion. Specifically, we introduce a Modality-specific Enhancing Module (MEM) to strengthen semantic cues unique to each modality via channel-wise attention, and a learnable Complementary Information Fusion (CIF) module to adaptively exchange complementary knowledge between modalities. The overall framework is optimized using a hybrid objective combining supervised segmentation loss and cross-modal consistency regularization on unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2019 (HGG subset) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong semi-supervised and multi-modal baselines under 1\%, 5\%, and 10\% labeled data settings, achieving significant improvements in both Dice and Sensitivity scores. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary effects of our proposed MEM and CIF in bridging cross-modality discrepancies and improving segmentation robustness under scarce supervision.

Conclusion: DynaIP通过动态解耦策略和分层专家混合特征融合模块，显著提升了PT2I生成的概念保真度、CP-PF平衡和多主题可扩展性，成为该领域的显著进步。

Abstract: Personalized Text-to-Image (PT2I) generation aims to produce customized images based on reference images. A prominent interest pertains to the integration of an image prompt adapter to facilitate zero-shot PT2I without test-time fine-tuning. However, current methods grapple with three fundamental challenges: 1. the elusive equilibrium between Concept Preservation (CP) and Prompt Following (PF), 2. the difficulty in retaining fine-grained concept details in reference images, and 3. the restricted scalability to extend to multi-subject personalization. To tackle these challenges, we present Dynamic Image Prompt Adapter (DynaIP), a cutting-edge plugin to enhance the fine-grained concept fidelity, CP-PF balance, and subject scalability of SOTA T2I multimodal diffusion transformers (MM-DiT) for PT2I generation. Our key finding is that MM-DiT inherently exhibit decoupling learning behavior when injecting reference image features into its dual branches via cross attentions. Based on this, we design an innovative Dynamic Decoupling Strategy that removes the interference of concept-agnostic information during inference, significantly enhancing the CP-PF balance and further bolstering the scalability of multi-subject compositions. Moreover, we identify the visual encoder as a key factor affecting fine-grained CP and reveal that the hierarchical features of commonly used CLIP can capture visual information at diverse granularity levels. Therefore, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts Feature Fusion Module to fully leverage the hierarchical features of CLIP, remarkably elevating the fine-grained concept fidelity while also providing flexible control of visual granularity. Extensive experiments across single- and multi-subject PT2I tasks verify that our DynaIP outperforms existing approaches, marking a notable advancement in the field of PT2l generation.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种实时检测和预测用户技能表现中困难时刻的方法，适用于智能辅助系统，并在跨任务和活动泛化方面展示了模型的实用性。

Abstract: Understanding human skill performance is essential for intelligent assistive systems, with struggle recognition offering a natural cue for identifying user difficulties. While prior work focuses on offline struggle classification and localization, real-time applications require models capable of detecting and anticipating struggle online. We reformulate struggle localization as an online detection task and further extend it to anticipation, predicting struggle moments before they occur. We adapt two off-the-shelf models as baselines for online struggle detection and anticipation. Online struggle detection achieves 70-80% per-frame mAP, while struggle anticipation up to 2 seconds ahead yields comparable performance with slight drops. We further examine generalization across tasks and activities and analyse the impact of skill evolution. Despite larger domain gaps in activity-level generalization, models still outperform random baselines by 4-20%. Our feature-based models run at up to 143 FPS, and the whole pipeline, including feature extraction, operates at around 20 FPS, sufficient for real-time assistive applications.

Conclusion: UniUGP框架通过整合预训练的视觉语言模型和视频生成模型，显著提升了自动驾驶系统在长尾场景中的规划性能，实现了感知、推理和决策的最先进表现。

Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) systems struggle in long-tail scenarios due to limited world knowledge and weak visual dynamic modeling. Existing vision-language-action (VLA)-based methods cannot leverage unlabeled videos for visual causal learning, while world model-based methods lack reasoning capabilities from large language models. In this paper, we construct multiple specialized datasets providing reasoning and planning annotations for complex scenarios. Then, a unified Understanding-Generation-Planning framework, named UniUGP, is proposed to synergize scene reasoning, future video generation, and trajectory planning through a hybrid expert architecture. By integrating pre-trained VLMs and video generation models, UniUGP leverages visual dynamics and semantic reasoning to enhance planning performance. Taking multi-frame observations and language instructions as input, it produces interpretable chain-of-thought reasoning, physically consistent trajectories, and coherent future videos. We introduce a four-stage training strategy that progressively builds these capabilities across multiple existing AD datasets, along with the proposed specialized datasets. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in perception, reasoning, and decision-making, with superior generalization to challenging long-tail situations.

Result: DPS4Un方法在三个真实世界基准数据集上表现优于现有高光谱解混方法。

Conclusion: DPS4Un方法在三个真实世界基准数据集上的实验结果表明，其性能优于当前最先进的高光谱解混方法。

Abstract: Linear spectral mixture models (LMM) provide a concise form to disentangle the constituent materials (endmembers) and their corresponding proportions (abundance) in a single pixel. The critical challenges are how to model the spectral prior distribution and spectral variability. Prior knowledge and spectral variability can be rigorously modeled under the Bayesian framework, where posterior estimation of Abundance is derived by combining observed data with endmember prior distribution. Considering the key challenges and the advantages of the Bayesian framework, a novel method using a diffusion posterior sampler for semiblind unmixing, denoted as DPS4Un, is proposed to deal with these challenges with the following features: (1) we view the pretrained conditional spectrum diffusion model as a posterior sampler, which can combine the learned endmember prior with observation to get the refined abundance distribution. (2) Instead of using the existing spectral library as prior, which may raise bias, we establish the image-based endmember bundles within superpixels, which are used to train the endmember prior learner with diffusion model. Superpixels make sure the sub-scene is more homogeneous. (3) Instead of using the image-level data consistency constraint, the superpixel-based data fidelity term is proposed. (4) The endmember is initialized as Gaussian noise for each superpixel region, DPS4Un iteratively updates the abundance and endmember, contributing to spectral variability modeling. The experimental results on three real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that DPS4Un outperforms the state-of-the-art hyperspectral unmixing methods.

Abstract: Correctly parsing mathematical formulas from PDFs is critical for training large language models and building scientific knowledge bases from academic literature, yet existing benchmarks either exclude formulas entirely or lack semantically-aware evaluation metrics. We introduce a novel benchmarking framework centered on synthetically generated PDFs with precise LaTeX ground truth, enabling systematic control over layout, formulas, and content characteristics. A key methodological contribution is pioneering LLM-as-a-judge for semantic formula assessment, combined with a robust two-stage matching pipeline that handles parser output inconsistencies. Through human validation on 250 formula pairs (750 ratings from 30 evaluators), we demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation achieves substantially higher correlation with human judgment (Pearson r=0.78) compared to CDM (r=0.34) and text similarity (r~0). Evaluating 20+ contemporary PDF parsers (including specialized OCR models, vision-language models, and rule-based approaches) across 100 synthetic documents with 2,000+ formulas reveals significant performance disparities. Our findings provide crucial insights for practitioners selecting parsers for downstream applications and establish a robust, scalable methodology that enables reproducible evaluation of PDF formula extraction quality.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in perceiving and describing visual environments. However, their ability to proactively reason and act based solely on visual inputs, without explicit textual prompts, remains underexplored. We introduce a new task, Visual Action Reasoning, and propose VisualActBench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 1,074 videos and 3,733 human-annotated actions across four real-world scenarios. Each action is labeled with an Action Prioritization Level (APL) and a proactive-reactive type to assess models' human-aligned reasoning and value sensitivity. We evaluate 29 VLMs on VisualActBench and find that while frontier models like GPT4o demonstrate relatively strong performance, a significant gap remains compared to human-level reasoning, particularly in generating proactive, high-priority actions. Our results highlight limitations in current VLMs' ability to interpret complex context, anticipate outcomes, and align with human decision-making frameworks. VisualActBench establishes a comprehensive foundation for assessing and improving the real-world readiness of proactive, vision-centric AI agents.

Conclusion: Splatent通过多视角注意力机制在2D空间中恢复细节，保持了预训练VAE的重建质量，并在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的VAE潜在辐射场重建效果。

Abstract: Radiance field representations have recently been explored in the latent space of VAEs that are commonly used by diffusion models. This direction offers efficient rendering and seamless integration with diffusion-based pipelines. However, these methods face a fundamental limitation: The VAE latent space lacks multi-view consistency, leading to blurred textures and missing details during 3D reconstruction. Existing approaches attempt to address this by fine-tuning the VAE, at the cost of reconstruction quality, or by relying on pre-trained diffusion models to recover fine-grained details, at the risk of some hallucinations. We present Splatent, a diffusion-based enhancement framework designed to operate on top of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in the latent space of VAEs. Our key insight departs from the conventional 3D-centric view: rather than reconstructing fine-grained details in 3D space, we recover them in 2D from input views through multi-view attention mechanisms. This approach preserves the reconstruction quality of pretrained VAEs while achieving faithful detail recovery. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, Splatent establishes a new state-of-the-art for VAE latent radiance field reconstruction. We further demonstrate that integrating our method with existing feed-forward frameworks, consistently improves detail preservation, opening new possibilities for high-quality sparse-view 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: ReViSE框架通过自我反思推理显著提升了视频编辑的准确性和视觉保真度，在RVE-Bench上实现了32%的性能提升。

Abstract: Video unified models exhibit strong capabilities in understanding and generation, yet they struggle with reason-informed visual editing even when equipped with powerful internal vision-language models (VLMs). We attribute this gap to two factors: 1) existing datasets are inadequate for training and evaluating reasoning-aware video editing, and 2) an inherent disconnect between the models' reasoning and editing capabilities, which prevents the rich understanding from effectively instructing the editing process. Bridging this gap requires an integrated framework that connects reasoning with visual transformation. To address this gap, we introduce the Reason-Informed Video Editing (RVE) task, which requires reasoning about physical plausibility and causal dynamics during editing. To support systematic evaluation, we construct RVE-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with two complementary subsets: Reasoning-Informed Video Editing and In-Context Video Generation. These subsets cover diverse reasoning dimensions and real-world editing scenarios. Building upon this foundation, we propose the ReViSE, a Self-Reflective Reasoning (SRF) framework that unifies generation and evaluation within a single architecture. The model's internal VLM provides intrinsic feedback by assessing whether the edited video logically satisfies the given instruction. The differential feedback that refines the generator's reasoning behavior during training. Extensive experiments on RVE-Bench demonstrate that ReViSE significantly enhances editing accuracy and visual fidelity, achieving a 32% improvement of the Overall score in the reasoning-informed video editing subset over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: GAINS提出两阶段逆渲染框架，结合学习先验优化稀疏多视角下的几何和材质恢复，显著提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于高斯泼溅的逆渲染方法在稀疏视角下因观测有限导致几何、反射率和光照间严重模糊，性能急剧下降。

Method: GAINS采用两阶段框架：首先利用单目深度/法线和扩散先验优化几何，随后通过分割、固有图像分解（IID）和扩散先验正则化材质恢复。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，GAINS在稀疏视角设置下显著提升了材质参数准确性、重光照质量和新视角合成效果。

Conclusion: GAINS通过两阶段逆渲染框架，显著提升了稀疏多视角捕获下的材质参数准确性、重光照质量和新视角合成效果，优于现有基于高斯的方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting-based inverse rendering extend Gaussian primitives with shading parameters and physically grounded light transport, enabling high-quality material recovery from dense multi-view captures. However, these methods degrade sharply under sparse-view settings, where limited observations lead to severe ambiguity between geometry, reflectance, and lighting. We introduce GAINS (Gaussian-based Inverse rendering from Sparse multi-view captures), a two-stage inverse rendering framework that leverages learning-based priors to stabilize geometry and material estimation. GAINS first refines geometry using monocular depth/normal and diffusion priors, then employs segmentation, intrinsic image decomposition (IID), and diffusion priors to regularize material recovery. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that GAINS significantly improves material parameter accuracy, relighting quality, and novel-view synthesis compared to state-of-the-art Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods, especially under sparse-view settings.

TL;DR: 提出SuperFrustum基元和ResFit算法，实现高保真、可编辑的3D形状分解，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D形状重建中保真度与简洁性之间的权衡问题，旨在生成高保真且可编辑的形状程序。

Method: 结合了新型基元SuperFrustum和迭代拟合算法ResFit，通过全局形状分析和局部优化交替进行，实现形状的简洁分解。

Result: 在多样化的3D基准测试中，IoU提升了9个百分点，同时基元数量减少近一半。

Conclusion: 该方法通过SuperFrustum和ResFit算法，成功实现了高保真且可编辑的3D形状分解，显著提升了IoU指标并减少了所需基元数量。

Abstract: We introduce a framework for converting 3D shapes into compact and editable assemblies of analytic primitives, directly addressing the persistent trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and parsimony. Our approach combines two key contributions: a novel primitive, termed SuperFrustum, and an iterative fiting algorithm, Residual Primitive Fitting (ResFit). SuperFrustum is an analytical primitive that is simultaneously (1) expressive, being able to model various common solids such as cylinders, spheres, cones & their tapered and bent forms, (2) editable, being compactly parameterized with 8 parameters, and (3) optimizable, with a sign distance field differentiable w.r.t. its parameters almost everywhere. ResFit is an unsupervised procedure that interleaves global shape analysis with local optimization, iteratively fitting primitives to the unexplained residual of a shape to discover a parsimonious yet accurate decompositions for each input shape. On diverse 3D benchmarks, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving IoU by over 9 points while using nearly half as many primitives as prior work. The resulting assemblies bridge the gap between dense 3D data and human-controllable design, producing high-fidelity and editable shape programs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了更高效的近似算法，用于加权有向图中的最小边割和顶点割问题，运行时间接近最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有算法在加权有向图中计算最小割时的高复杂度问题。

Method: 基于随机化算法，扩展了Chuzhoy等人提出的框架，并引入了新的黑盒归约技术。

Result: 新算法在多项式权重假设下，运行时间为O(m^{1+o(1)}/ε)，优于现有最优结果。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了在加权有向图中近似求解全局最小边割和顶点割的新算法，显著提高了运行效率。

Abstract: We develop new $(1+ε)$-approximation algorithms for finding the global minimum edge-cut in a directed edge-weighted graph, and for finding the global minimum vertex-cut in a directed vertex-weighted graph. Our algorithms are randomized, and have a running time of $O\left(m^{1+o(1)}/ε\right)$ on any $m$-edge $n$-vertex input graph, assuming all edge/vertex weights are polynomially-bounded. In particular, for any constant $ε>0$, our algorithms have an almost-optimal running time of $O\left(m^{1+o(1)}\right)$. The fastest previously-known running time for this setting, due to (Cen et al., FOCS 2021), is $\tilde{O}\left(\min\left\{n^2/ε^2,m^{1+o(1)}\sqrt{n}\right\}\right)$ for Minimum Edge-Cut, and $\tilde{O}\left(n^2/ε^2\right)$ for Minimum Vertex-Cut. Our results further extend to the rooted variants of the Minimum Edge-Cut and Minimum Vertex-Cut problems, where the algorithm is additionally given a root vertex $r$, and the goal is to find a minimum-weight cut separating any vertex from the root $r$. In terms of techniques, we build upon and extend a framework that was recently introduced by (Chuzhoy et al., SODA 2026) for solving the Minimum Vertex-Cut problem in unweighted directed graphs. Additionally, in order to obtain our result for the Global Minimum Vertex-Cut problem, we develop a novel black-box reduction from this problem to its rooted variant. Prior to our work, such reductions were only known for more restricted settings, such as when all vertex-weights are unit.

*Mohsen Ghaffari,Jaehyun Koo*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效动态图着色算法，适用于顺序、并行和分布式模型，显著提升了处理速度和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态图着色问题，尤其是在高动态性环境下（如并行和分布式系统）的实时性和效率需求。

Method: 采用随机算法，能够在不同模型（顺序、并行、分布式）中高效处理动态图更新。

Result: 在顺序模型中，每个更新处理时间为$O(1)$期望时间；在并行模型中，批量更新的每项更新工作量为$O(1)$期望值；在分布式模型中，每次更新仅导致$O(1)$节点暂时失去颜色，并在$O(\log n)$轮内恢复。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种高效的随机算法，能够在图动态更新（边插入和删除）时维持$(Δ+1)$着色，适用于顺序、并行和分布式模型。

Abstract: We present a simple randomized algorithm that can efficiently maintain a $(Δ+1)$ coloring as the graph undergoes edge insertion and deletion updates, where $Δ$ denotes an upper bound on the maximum degree. A key advantage is the algorithm's ability to process many updates simultaneously, which makes it naturally adaptable to the parallel and distributed models. Concretely, it gives a unified framework across the models, leading to the following results:
  - In the sequential setting, the algorithm processes each update in $O(1)$ expected time, worst-case. This matches and strengthens the results of Henzinger and Peng [TALG 2022] and Bhattacharya et al. [TALG 2022], who achieved an $O(1)$ bound but amortized (in expectation and with high probability, respectively), whose work was an improvement of the $O(\log Δ)$ expected amortized bound of Bhattacharya et al. [SODA'18].
  - In the parallel setting, the algorithm processes each (arbitrary size) batch of updates using $O(1)$ work per update in the batch in expectation, and in $\text{poly}(\log n)$ depth with high probability. This is, in a sense, an ideal parallelization of the above results.
  - In the distributed setting, the algorithm can maintain a coloring of the network graph as (potentially many) edges are added or deleted. The maintained coloring is always proper; it may become partial upon updates, i.e., some nodes may temporarily lose their colors, but quickly converges to a full, proper coloring. Concretely, each insertion and deletion causes at most $O(1)$ nodes to become uncolored, but this is resolved within $O(\log n)$ rounds with high probability (e.g., in the absence of further updates nearby--the precise guarantee is stronger, but technical). Importantly, the algorithm incurs only $O(1)$ expected message complexity and computation per update.

*Shivendra Agrawal,Jake Brawer,Ashutosh Naik,Alessandro Roncone,Bradley Hayes*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ShelfAware是一种语义粒子滤波器，通过类别级语义建模和逆向提议，在准静态环境中实现高成功率的全局定位，适用于移动机器人和视障辅助导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多室内工作空间是准静态的：全局布局稳定但局部语义不断变化，导致重复几何、动态杂乱和感知噪声，从而破坏基于视觉的定位。ShelfAware旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ShelfAware采用语义粒子滤波器，结合深度似然和类别中心的语义相似性，利用预计算的语义视点库在蒙特卡洛定位（MCL）中执行逆向语义提议，实现低成本、纯视觉硬件上的快速目标假设生成。

Result: 在语义密集的零售环境中，ShelfAware在四种条件下（推车安装、可穿戴、动态障碍和稀疏语义）的100次全局定位试验中，成功率达到96%（MCL为22%，AMCL为10%），平均收敛时间为1.91秒，所有条件下平移RMSE最低，并在80%的测试序列中保持稳定跟踪，同时实时运行于消费级笔记本电脑平台。

Conclusion: ShelfAware通过将场景语义视为对象类别的统计证据而非固定地标，解决了准静态环境中的几何混淆和语义漂移问题。该方法仅需视觉传感器和视觉惯性里程计（VIO），适用于仓库、实验室和零售环境中的移动机器人，并支持为视障人士提供即时启动的共享控制辅助导航。

Abstract: Many indoor workspaces are quasi-static: global layout is stable but local semantics change continually, producing repetitive geometry, dynamic clutter, and perceptual noise that defeat vision-based localization. We present ShelfAware, a semantic particle filter for robust global localization that treats scene semantics as statistical evidence over object categories rather than fixed landmarks. ShelfAware fuses a depth likelihood with a category-centric semantic similarity and uses a precomputed bank of semantic viewpoints to perform inverse semantic proposals inside MCL, yielding fast, targeted hypothesis generation on low-cost, vision-only hardware. Across 100 global-localization trials spanning four conditions (cart-mounted, wearable, dynamic obstacles, and sparse semantics) in a semantically dense, retail environment, ShelfAware achieves a 96% success rate (vs. 22% MCL and 10% AMCL) with a mean time-to-convergence of 1.91s, attains the lowest translational RMSE in all conditions, and maintains stable tracking in 80% of tested sequences, all while running in real time on a consumer laptop-class platform. By modeling semantics distributionally at the category level and leveraging inverse proposals, ShelfAware resolves geometric aliasing and semantic drift common to quasi-static domains. Because the method requires only vision sensors and VIO, it integrates as an infrastructure-free building block for mobile robots in warehouses, labs, and retail settings; as a representative application, it also supports the creation of assistive devices providing start-anytime, shared-control assistive navigation for people with visual impairments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 远程机器人操作中，操作者的情感状态可能影响机器人运动，但现有情感识别方法依赖生理信号或身体语言，限制了远程控制的灵活性。

Method: 利用机器学习系统分析远程控制机器人功能运动（尤其是手部动作）来推断操作者的情感状态。

Result: 系统在识别操作者情感状态方面达到83.3%的准确率。

Conclusion: 通过机器人功能运动推断操作者情感状态的系统在远程机器人操作和情感机器人领域具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: A remote robot operator's affective state can significantly impact the resulting robot's motions leading to unexpected consequences, even when the user follows protocol and performs permitted tasks. The recognition of a user operator's affective states in remote robot control scenarios is, however, underexplored. Current emotion recognition methods rely on reading the user's vital signs or body language, but the devices and user participation these measures require would add limitations to remote robot control. We demonstrate that the functional movements of a remote-controlled robotic avatar, which was not designed for emotional expression, can be used to infer the emotional state of the human operator via a machine-learning system. Specifically, our system achieved 83.3$\%$ accuracy in recognizing the user's emotional state expressed by robot movements, as a result of their hand motions. We discuss the implications of this system on prominent current and future remote robot operation and affective robotic contexts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有方法在复杂和非马尔可夫任务中的不足，提出了MGP框架以实现全局一致的预测和鲁棒的自适应执行能力。

Method: MGP通过离散化动作表示为令牌，并训练一个条件掩码变换器来并行生成令牌并快速优化低置信度令牌。提出了MGP-Short和MGP-Long两种采样范式。

Result: MGP在Meta-World和LIBERO基准测试中，平均成功率提高了9%，推理时间减少了35倍，动态和缺失观察环境中的成功率提高了60%，并解决了两个其他方法无法处理的非马尔可夫场景。

Conclusion: MGP框架在150个机器人操作任务中表现出色，显著提高了成功率并大幅减少了推理时间，特别是在动态和缺失观察环境中表现尤为突出。

Abstract: We present Masked Generative Policy (MGP), a novel framework for visuomotor imitation learning. We represent actions as discrete tokens, and train a conditional masked transformer that generates tokens in parallel and then rapidly refines only low-confidence tokens. We further propose two new sampling paradigms: MGP-Short, which performs parallel masked generation with score-based refinement for Markovian tasks, and MGP-Long, which predicts full trajectories in a single pass and dynamically refines low-confidence action tokens based on new observations. With globally coherent prediction and robust adaptive execution capabilities, MGP-Long enables reliable control on complex and non-Markovian tasks that prior methods struggle with. Extensive evaluations on 150 robotic manipulation tasks spanning the Meta-World and LIBERO benchmarks show that MGP achieves both rapid inference and superior success rates compared to state-of-the-art diffusion and autoregressive policies. Specifically, MGP increases the average success rate by 9% across 150 tasks while cutting per-sequence inference time by up to 35x. It further improves the average success rate by 60% in dynamic and missing-observation environments, and solves two non-Markovian scenarios where other state-of-the-art methods fail.

Motivation: 探讨机器人能力和关注度如何共同塑造认知信任，尤其是是否存在补偿机制。

Method: 采用2x2实验设计，评估机器人能力（高或低）和关注度（高或低）的不同组合对认知信任的影响。

Result: 高关注度可以弥补低能力，而缺乏关注度时，低能力会显著降低认知信任。

Conclusion: 研究强调了情感补偿机制在认知信任中的重要性，为传统基于能力的认知信任模型增添了新的考量层面。

Abstract: Cognitive trust and the belief that a robot is capable of accurately performing tasks, are recognized as central factors in fostering high-quality human-robot interactions. It is well established that performance factors such as the robot's competence and its reliability shape cognitive trust. Recent studies suggest that affective factors, such as robotic attentiveness, also play a role in building cognitive trust. This work explores the interplay between these two factors that shape cognitive trust. Specifically, we evaluated whether different combinations of robotic competence and attentiveness introduce a compensatory mechanism, where one factor compensates for the lack of the other. In the experiment, participants performed a search task with a robotic dog in a 2x2 experimental design that included two factors: competence (high or low) and attentiveness (high or low). The results revealed that high attentiveness can compensate for low competence. Participants who collaborated with a highly attentive robot that performed poorly reported trust levels comparable to those working with a highly competent robot. When the robot did not demonstrate attentiveness, low competence resulted in a substantial decrease in cognitive trust. The findings indicate that building cognitive trust in human-robot interaction may be more complex than previously believed, involving emotional processes that are typically overlooked. We highlight an affective compensatory mechanism that adds a layer to consider alongside traditional competence-based models of cognitive trust.

Motivation: 当前的非凸制导和控制方法依赖于大量专家输入（如航点、约束、任务时间线等），限制了实际交会任务中的操作可扩展性。

Method: SAGES（语义自主导航引擎）是一种轨迹生成框架，将自然语言命令转换为反映高层意图并尊重非凸约束的航天器轨迹。

Result: 在两个实验场景中，SAGES可靠地生成了与人类命令一致的轨迹，实现了超过90%的语义行为一致性。

Conclusion: SAGES框架标志着向语言条件化、约束感知的航天器轨迹生成迈出了第一步，通过直观的自然语言命令减少了专家负担，使操作员能够交互式地指导安全性和行为。

Abstract: Reliable real-time trajectory generation is essential for future autonomous spacecraft. While recent progress in nonconvex guidance and control is paving the way for onboard autonomous trajectory optimization, these methods still rely on extensive expert input (e.g., waypoints, constraints, mission timelines, etc.), which limits the operational scalability in real rendezvous missions.This paper introduces SAGES (Semantic Autonomous Guidance Engine for Space), a trajectory-generation framework that translates natural-language commands into spacecraft trajectories that reflect high-level intent while respecting nonconvex constraints. Experiments in two settings -- fault-tolerant proximity operations with continuous-time constraint enforcement and a free-flying robotic platform -- demonstrate that SAGES reliably produces trajectories aligned with human commands, achieving over 90\% semantic-behavioral consistency across diverse behavior modes. Ultimately, this work marks an initial step toward language-conditioned, constraint-aware spacecraft trajectory generation, enabling operators to interactively guide both safety and behavior through intuitive natural-language commands with reduced expert burden.

TL;DR: UPETrack是一种几何驱动的DLO实时跟踪框架，通过UPE算法高效处理遮挡，无需物理建模或标记，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DLOs的高维配置空间、非线性动力学和频繁部分遮挡是实时跟踪的主要障碍，UPETrack旨在克服这些限制。

Method: UPETrack框架分为两个阶段：(1) 基于GMM和EM算法的可见段跟踪，(2) 采用UPE算法预测遮挡区域。UPE通过局部线性组合位移项、近端线性约束项和历史曲率项，利用DLO的几何连续性和时间演化模式，实现了遮挡节点的稳定估计。

Result: 实验结果表明，UPETrack在定位精度和计算效率上均优于TrackDLO和CDCPD2两种先进算法。

Conclusion: UPETrack框架通过几何驱动的UPE算法，在无需物理建模、虚拟仿真或视觉标记的情况下，实现了对DLOs的高效实时跟踪，显著提升了定位精度和计算效率。

Abstract: Real-time state tracking of Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs) is critical for enabling robotic manipulation of DLOs in industrial assembly, medical procedures, and daily-life applications. However, the high-dimensional configuration space, nonlinear dynamics, and frequent partial occlusions present fundamental barriers to robust real-time DLO tracking. To address these limitations, this study introduces UPETrack, a geometry-driven framework based on Unidirectional Position Estimation (UPE), which facilitates tracking without the requirement for physical modeling, virtual simulation, or visual markers. The framework operates in two phases: (1) visible segment tracking is based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) fitted via the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, and (2) occlusion region prediction employing UPE algorithm we proposed. UPE leverages the geometric continuity inherent in DLO shapes and their temporal evolution patterns to derive a closed-form positional estimator through three principal mechanisms: (i) local linear combination displacement term, (ii) proximal linear constraint term, and (iii) historical curvature term. This analytical formulation allows efficient and stable estimation of occluded nodes through explicit linear combinations of geometric components, eliminating the need for additional iterative optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that UPETrack surpasses two state-of-the-art tracking algorithms, including TrackDLO and CDCPD2, in both positioning accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Learning dexterous bimanual manipulation policies critically depends on large-scale, high-quality demonstrations, yet current paradigms face inherent trade-offs: teleoperation provides physically grounded data but is prohibitively labor-intensive, while simulation-based synthesis scales efficiently but suffers from sim-to-real gaps. We present BiDemoSyn, a framework that synthesizes contact-rich, physically feasible bimanual demonstrations from a single real-world example. The key idea is to decompose tasks into invariant coordination blocks and variable, object-dependent adjustments, then adapt them through vision-guided alignment and lightweight trajectory optimization. This enables the generation of thousands of diverse and feasible demonstrations within several hour, without repeated teleoperation or reliance on imperfect simulation. Across six dual-arm tasks, we show that policies trained on BiDemoSyn data generalize robustly to novel object poses and shapes, significantly outperforming recent baselines. By bridging the gap between efficiency and real-world fidelity, BiDemoSyn provides a scalable path toward practical imitation learning for complex bimanual manipulation without compromising physical grounding.

Abstract: Embodied agents operating in open environments must translate high-level instructions into grounded, executable behaviors, often requiring coordinated use of both hands. While recent foundation models offer strong semantic reasoning, existing robotic task planners remain predominantly unimanual and fail to address the spatial, geometric, and coordination challenges inherent to bimanual manipulation in scene-agnostic settings. We present a unified framework for scene-agnostic bimanual task planning that bridges high-level reasoning with 3D-grounded two-handed execution. Our approach integrates three key modules. Visual Point Grounding (VPG) analyzes a single scene image to detect relevant objects and generate world-aligned interaction points. Bimanual Subgoal Planner (BSP) reasons over spatial adjacency and cross-object accessibility to produce compact, motion-neutralized subgoals that exploit opportunities for coordinated two-handed actions. Interaction-Point-Driven Bimanual Prompting (IPBP) binds these subgoals to a structured skill library, instantiating synchronized unimanual or bimanual action sequences that satisfy hand-state and affordance constraints. Together, these modules enable agents to plan semantically meaningful, physically feasible, and parallelizable two-handed behaviors in cluttered, previously unseen scenes. Experiments show that it produces coherent, feasible, and compact two-handed plans, and generalizes to cluttered scenes without retraining, demonstrating robust scene-agnostic affordance reasoning for bimanual tasks.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种轻量级QuadPlane系统，专为长距离操作设计，能够在动态、非结构化且GPS受限的环境中实现自主着陆。

Abstract: QuadPlanes combine the range efficiency of fixed-wing aircraft with the maneuverability of multi-rotor platforms for long-range autonomous missions. In GPS-denied or cluttered urban environments, perception-based landing is vital for reliable operation. Unlike structured landing zones, real-world sites are unstructured and highly variable, requiring strong generalization capabilities from the perception system. Deep neural networks (DNNs) provide a scalable solution for learning landing site features across diverse visual and environmental conditions. While perception-driven landing has been shown in simulation, real-world deployment introduces significant challenges. Payload and volume constraints limit high-performance edge AI devices like the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, which are crucial for real-time detection and control. Accurate pose estimation during descent is necessary, especially in the absence of GPS, and relies on dependable visual-inertial odometry. Achieving this with limited edge AI resources requires careful optimization of the entire deployment framework. The flight characteristics of large QuadPlanes further complicate the problem. These aircraft exhibit high inertia, reduced thrust vectoring, and slow response times further complicate stable landing maneuvers. This work presents a lightweight QuadPlane system for efficient vision-based autonomous landing and visual-inertial odometry, specifically developed for long-range QuadPlane operations such as aerial monitoring. It describes the hardware platform, sensor configuration, and embedded computing architecture designed to meet demanding real-time, physical constraints.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving frameworks face persistent challenges in generalization, training efficiency, and interpretability. While recent methods leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through supervised learning on large-scale datasets to improve reasoning, they often lack robustness in novel scenarios. Conversely, reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches enhance adaptability but remain data-inefficient and lack transparent decision-making. % contribution To address these limitations, we propose COVLM-RL, a novel end-to-end driving framework that integrates Critical Object-oriented (CO) reasoning with VLM-guided RL. Specifically, we design a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategy that enables the VLM to reason over critical traffic elements and generate high-level semantic decisions, effectively transforming multi-view visual inputs into structured semantic decision priors. These priors reduce the input dimensionality and inject task-relevant knowledge into the RL loop, accelerating training and improving policy interpretability. However, bridging high-level semantic guidance with continuous low-level control remains non-trivial. To this end, we introduce a consistency loss that encourages alignment between the VLM's semantic plans and the RL agent's control outputs, enhancing interpretability and training stability. Experiments conducted in the CARLA simulator demonstrate that COVLM-RL significantly improves the success rate by 30\% in trained driving environments and by 50\% in previously unseen environments, highlighting its strong generalization capability.

Motivation: 现有的精确负载操纵方法通常依赖额外传感器测量电缆方向或负载姿态，增加了系统成本和复杂性。本研究旨在回答一个基本问题：在多源干扰下，仅使用无人机里程计信息，负载姿态是否可观测？

Method: 本研究采用可观测性秩准则分析了两无人机-杆系统的可观测性，并设计了一种基于扰动观测器的误差状态扩展卡尔曼滤波器，用于在流形$(\mathbb{R}^3)^2\times(TS^2)^3$上进行状态和扰动估计。

Conclusion: 该论文证明了在仅使用无人机里程计信息的情况下，当存在两种或更少类型的集总干扰时，整个系统是可观测的。这为设计更经济、更鲁棒的系统提供了理论基础，并通过减少传感器数量实现了成本效益。

Abstract: Cooperative suspended aerial transportation is highly susceptible to multi-source disturbances such as aerodynamic effects and thrust uncertainties. To achieve precise load manipulation, existing methods often rely on extra sensors to measure cable directions or the payload's pose, which increases the system cost and complexity. A fundamental question remains: is the payload's pose observable under multi-source disturbances using only the drones' odometry information? To answer this question, this work focuses on the two-drone-bar system and proves that the whole system is observable when only two or fewer types of lumped disturbances exist by using the observability rank criterion. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present such a conclusion and this result paves the way for more cost-effective and robust systems by minimizing their sensor suites. Next, to validate this analysis, we consider the situation where the disturbances are only exerted on the drones, and develop a composite disturbance filtering scheme. A disturbance observer-based error-state extended Kalman filter is designed for both state and disturbance estimation, which renders improved estimation performance for the whole system evolving on the manifold $(\mathbb{R}^3)^2\times(TS^2)^3$. Our simulation and experimental tests have validated that it is possible to fully estimate the state and disturbance of the system with only odometry information of the drones.

Abstract: Robots that learn manipulation skills from everyday human videos could acquire broad capabilities without tedious robot data collection. We propose a video-to-video translation framework that converts ordinary human-object interaction videos into motion-consistent robot manipulation videos with realistic, physically grounded interactions. Our approach does not require any paired human-robot videos for training only a set of unpaired robot videos, making the system easy to scale. We introduce a transferable representation that bridges the embodiment gap: by inpainting the robot arm in training videos to obtain a clean background and overlaying a simple visual cue (a marker and arrow indicating the gripper's position and orientation), we can condition a generative model to insert the robot arm back into the scene. At test time, we apply the same process to human videos (inpainting the person and overlaying human pose cues) and generate high-quality robot videos that mimic the human's actions. We fine-tune a SOTA video diffusion model (Wan 2.2) in an in-context learning manner to ensure temporal coherence and leveraging of its rich prior knowledge. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly more realistic and grounded robot motions compared to baselines, pointing to a promising direction for scaling up robot learning from unlabeled human videos.

Conclusion: PGF-MAPPO通过结合拓扑规划和反应控制，解决了稀疏奖励和局部极小值问题，并在大规模场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Collaborative pursuit-evasion in cluttered environments presents significant challenges due to sparse rewards and constrained Fields of View (FOV). Standard Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) often suffers from inefficient exploration and fails to scale to large scenarios. We propose PGF-MAPPO (Path-Guided Frontier MAPPO), a hierarchical framework bridging topological planning with reactive control. To resolve local minima and sparse rewards, we integrate an A*-based potential field for dense reward shaping. Furthermore, we introduce Directional Frontier Allocation, combining Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) with geometric angle suppression to enforce spatial dispersion and accelerate coverage. The architecture employs a parameter-shared decentralized critic, maintaining O(1) model complexity suitable for robotic swarms. Experiments demonstrate that PGF-MAPPO achieves superior capture efficiency against faster evaders. Policies trained on 10x10 maps exhibit robust zero-shot generalization to unseen 20x20 environments, significantly outperforming rule-based and learning-based baselines.

Conclusion: D$^2$GSLAM展示了在动态场景中卓越的建图和跟踪精度，同时具备精确的动态建模能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Dense Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) have demonstrated remarkable performance in static environments. However, dense SLAM in dynamic environments remains challenging. Most methods directly remove dynamic objects and focus solely on static scene reconstruction, which ignores the motion information contained in these dynamic objects. In this paper, we present D$^2$GSLAM, a novel dynamic SLAM system utilizing Gaussian representation, which simultaneously performs accurate dynamic reconstruction and robust tracking within dynamic environments. Our system is composed of four key components: (i) We propose a geometric-prompt dynamic separation method to distinguish between static and dynamic elements of the scene. This approach leverages the geometric consistency of Gaussian representation and scene geometry to obtain coarse dynamic regions. The regions then serve as prompts to guide the refinement of the coarse mask for achieving accurate motion mask. (ii) To facilitate accurate and efficient mapping of the dynamic scene, we introduce dynamic-static composite representation that integrates static 3D Gaussians with dynamic 4D Gaussians. This representation allows for modeling the transitions between static and dynamic states of objects in the scene for composite mapping and optimization. (iii) We employ a progressive pose refinement strategy that leverages both the multi-view consistency of static scene geometry and motion information from dynamic objects to achieve accurate camera tracking. (iv) We introduce a motion consistency loss, which leverages the temporal continuity in object motions for accurate dynamic modeling. Our D$^2$GSLAM demonstrates superior performance on dynamic scenes in terms of mapping and tracking accuracy, while also showing capability in accurate dynamic modeling.

Abstract: The development of athletic humanoid robots has gained significant attention as advances in actuation, sensing, and control enable increasingly dynamic, real-world capabilities. RoboCup, an international competition of fully autonomous humanoid robots, provides a uniquely challenging benchmark for such systems, culminating in the long-term goal of competing against human soccer players by 2050. This paper presents the hardware and software innovations underlying our team's victory in the RoboCup 2024 Adult-Sized Humanoid Soccer Competition. On the hardware side, we introduce an adult-sized humanoid platform built with lightweight structural components, high-torque quasi-direct-drive actuators, and a specialized foot design that enables powerful in-gait kicks while preserving locomotion robustness. On the software side, we develop an integrated perception and localization framework that combines stereo vision, object detection, and landmark-based fusion to provide reliable estimates of the ball, goals, teammates, and opponents. A mid-level navigation stack then generates collision-aware, dynamically feasible trajectories, while a centralized behavior manager coordinates high-level decision making, role selection, and kick execution based on the evolving game state. The seamless integration of these subsystems results in fast, precise, and tactically effective gameplay, enabling robust performance under the dynamic and adversarial conditions of real matches. This paper presents the design principles, system architecture, and experimental results that contributed to ARTEMIS's success as the 2024 Adult-Sized Humanoid Soccer champion.

Conclusion: 该方法通过多帧证据累积和自适应决策，显著提高了LiDAR闭环检测的精度，尤其在结构重复的室内环境中有效抑制了误报。

Abstract: We propose a descriptor-agnostic, multi-frame loop closure verification method that formulates LiDAR loop closure as a truncated Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT). Instead of deciding from a single descriptor comparison or using fixed thresholds with late-stage Iterative Closest Point (ICP) vetting, the verifier accumulates a short temporal stream of descriptor similarities between a query and each candidate. It then issues an accept/reject decision adaptively once sufficient multi-frame evidence has been observed, according to user-specified Type-I/II error design targets. This precision-first policy is designed to suppress false positives in structurally repetitive indoor environments. We evaluate the verifier on a five-sequence library dataset, using a fixed retrieval front-end with several representative LiDAR global descriptors. Performance is assessed via segment-level K-hit precision-recall and absolute trajectory error (ATE) and relative pose error (RPE) after pose graph optimization. Across descriptors, the sequential verifier consistently improves precision and reduces the impact of aliased loops compared with single-frame and heuristic multi-frame baselines. Our implementation and dataset will be released at: https://github.com/wanderingcar/snu_library_dataset.

Abstract: In recent years, many countries, including Japan, have rapidly aging populations, making the preservation of seniors' quality of life a significant concern. For elderly people with impaired physical abilities, support for toileting is one of the most important issues. This paper details the design, development, experimental assessment, and potential application of the gripper system, with a focus on the unique requirements and obstacles involved in aiding elderly or hemiplegic individuals in dressing and undressing trousers. The gripper we propose seeks to find the right balance between compliance and grasping forces, ensuring precise manipulation while maintaining a safe and compliant interaction with the users. The gripper's integration into a custom--built robotic manipulator system provides a comprehensive solution for assisting hemiplegic individuals in their dressing and undressing tasks. Experimental evaluations and comparisons with existing studies demonstrate the gripper's ability to successfully assist in both dressing and dressing of trousers in confined spaces with a high success rate. This research contributes to the advancement of assistive robotics, empowering elderly, and physically impaired individuals to maintain their independence and improve their quality of life.

Abstract: With the adoption of autonomous vehicles on our roads, we will witness a mixed-autonomy environment where autonomous and human-driven vehicles must learn to co-exist by sharing the same road infrastructure. To attain socially-desirable behaviors, autonomous vehicles must be instructed to consider the utility of other vehicles around them in their decision-making process. Particularly, we study the maneuver planning problem for autonomous vehicles and investigate how a decentralized reward structure can induce altruism in their behavior and incentivize them to account for the interest of other autonomous and human-driven vehicles. This is a challenging problem due to the ambiguity of a human driver's willingness to cooperate with an autonomous vehicle. Thus, in contrast with the existing works which rely on behavior models of human drivers, we take an end-to-end approach and let the autonomous agents to implicitly learn the decision-making process of human drivers only from experience. We introduce a multi-agent variant of the synchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm and train agents that coordinate with each other and can affect the behavior of human drivers to improve traffic flow and safety.

Abstract: This paper addresses the movement and placement of mobile agents to establish a communication network in initially unknown environments. We cast the problem in a computational-geometric framework by relating the coverage problem and line-of-sight constraints to the Cooperative Guard Art Gallery Problem, and introduce its partially observable variant, the Partially Observable Cooperative Guard Art Gallery Problem (POCGAGP). We then present two algorithms that solve POCGAGP: CADENCE, a centralized planner that incrementally selects 270 degree corners at which to deploy agents, and DADENCE, a decentralized scheme that coordinates agents using local information and lightweight messaging. Both approaches operate under partial observability and target simultaneous coverage and connectivity. We evaluate the methods in simulation across 1,500 test cases of varied size and structure, demonstrating consistent success in forming connected networks while covering and exploring unknown space. These results highlight the value of geometric abstractions for communication-driven exploration and show that decentralized policies are competitive with centralized performance while retaining scalability.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle (AV) navigation in the presence of Human-driven vehicles (HVs) is challenging, as HVs continuously update their policies in response to AVs. In order to navigate safely in the presence of complex AV-HV social interactions, the AVs must learn to predict these changes. Humans are capable of navigating such challenging social interaction settings because of their intrinsic knowledge about other agents behaviors and use that to forecast what might happen in the future. Inspired by humans, we provide our AVs the capability of anticipating future states and leveraging prediction in a cooperative reinforcement learning (RL) decision-making framework, to improve safety and robustness. In this paper, we propose an integration of two essential and earlier-presented components of AVs: social navigation and prediction. We formulate the AV decision-making process as a RL problem and seek to obtain optimal policies that produce socially beneficial results utilizing a prediction-aware planning and social-aware optimization RL framework. We also propose a Hybrid Predictive Network (HPN) that anticipates future observations. The HPN is used in a multi-step prediction chain to compute a window of predicted future observations to be used by the value function network (VFN). Finally, a safe VFN is trained to optimize a social utility using a sequence of previous and predicted observations, and a safety prioritizer is used to leverage the interpretable kinematic predictions to mask the unsafe actions, constraining the RL policy. We compare our prediction-aware AV to state-of-the-art solutions and demonstrate performance improvements in terms of efficiency and safety in multiple simulated scenarios.

Abstract: We present a novel modularized end-to-end framework for legged reactive navigation in complex dynamic environments using a single light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor. The system comprises four simulation-trained modules: three reinforcement-learning (RL) policies for locomotion, safety shielding, and navigation, and a transformer-based exteroceptive estimator that processes raw point-cloud inputs. This modular decomposition of complex legged motor-control tasks enables lightweight neural networks with simple architectures, trained using standard RL practices with targeted reward shaping and curriculum design, without reliance on heuristics or sophisticated policy-switching mechanisms. We conduct comprehensive ablations to validate our design choices and demonstrate improved robustness compared to existing approaches in challenging navigation tasks. The resulting reactive safe navigation (REASAN) system achieves fully onboard and real-time reactive navigation across both single- and multi-robot settings in complex environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数基于强化学习（RL）的无人机竞速方法针对固定、无障碍的赛道，而将泛化到未知、杂乱环境的问题基本未解决。这一挑战源于需要在竞速速度和碰撞避免之间取得平衡，有限的可行空间导致策略探索在训练中陷入局部最优，以及深度图中门与障碍物之间的感知模糊性——尤其是当门位置仅粗略指定时。

Conclusion: 该系统在计算受限的四旋翼上实现了敏捷飞行，同时对门位置误差保持鲁棒性，开发了一个可泛化的无人机竞速框架，能够在多样、部分未知和杂乱的环境中运行。

Abstract: Most reinforcement learning(RL)-based methods for drone racing target fixed, obstacle-free tracks, leaving the generalization to unknown, cluttered environments largely unaddressed. This challenge stems from the need to balance racing speed and collision avoidance, limited feasible space causing policy exploration trapped in local optima during training, and perceptual ambiguity between gates and obstacles in depth maps-especially when gate positions are only coarsely specified. To overcome these issues, we propose a two-phase learning framework: an initial soft-collision training phase that preserves policy exploration for high-speed flight, followed by a hard-collision refinement phase that enforces robust obstacle avoidance. An adaptive, noise-augmented curriculum with an asymmetric actor-critic architecture gradually shifts the policy's reliance from privileged gate-state information to depth-based visual input. We further impose Lipschitz constraints and integrate a track-primitive generator to enhance motion stability and cross-environment generalization. We evaluate our framework through extensive simulation and ablation studies, and validate it in real-world experiments on a computationally constrained quadrotor.

Conclusion: UrbanNav展示了利用大规模网络视频数据实现语言引导的城市导航的潜力，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Navigating complex urban environments using natural language instructions poses significant challenges for embodied agents, including noisy language instructions, ambiguous spatial references, diverse landmarks, and dynamic street scenes. Current visual navigation methods are typically limited to simulated or off-street environments, and often rely on precise goal formats, such as specific coordinates or images. This limits their effectiveness for autonomous agents like last-mile delivery robots navigating unfamiliar cities. To address these limitations, we introduce UrbanNav, a scalable framework that trains embodied agents to follow free-form language instructions in diverse urban settings. Leveraging web-scale city walking videos, we develop an scalable annotation pipeline that aligns human navigation trajectories with language instructions grounded in real-world landmarks. UrbanNav encompasses over 1,500 hours of navigation data and 3 million instruction-trajectory-landmark triplets, capturing a wide range of urban scenarios. Our model learns robust navigation policies to tackle complex urban scenarios, demonstrating superior spatial reasoning, robustness to noisy instructions, and generalization to unseen urban settings. Experimental results show that UrbanNav significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting the potential of large-scale web video data to enable language-guided, real-world urban navigation for embodied agents.

TL;DR: Super4DR是一个基于4D雷达的SLAM框架，通过学习和优化方法提升了在恶劣环境下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SLAM系统在恶劣光照和天气条件下表现不佳，4D雷达虽适合此类环境，但其稀疏和噪声点云限制了里程计估计和地图构建的准确性。

Method: 设计了基于聚类的里程计网络和分层自监督机制，以及使用3D高斯作为中间表示的地图优化方法。

Result: Super4DR在自监督方法中性能提升了67%，几乎匹配监督学习的里程计，并缩小了与LiDAR地图质量的差距。

Conclusion: Super4DR通过结合基于学习的里程计估计和高斯优化的地图构建，显著提升了在恶劣环境下的SLAM性能，几乎达到了监督学习的水平，并缩小了与LiDAR地图质量的差距。

Abstract: Conventional SLAM systems using visual or LiDAR data often struggle in poor lighting and severe weather. Although 4D radar is suited for such environments, its sparse and noisy point clouds hinder accurate odometry estimation, while the radar maps suffer from obscure and incomplete structures. Thus, we propose Super4DR, a 4D radar-centric framework for learning-based odometry estimation and gaussian-based map optimization. First, we design a cluster-aware odometry network that incorporates object-level cues from the clustered radar points for inter-frame matching, alongside a hierarchical self-supervision mechanism to overcome outliers through spatio-temporal consistency, knowledge transfer, and feature contrast. Second, we propose using 3D gaussians as an intermediate representation, coupled with a radar-specific growth strategy, selective separation, and multi-view regularization, to recover blurry map areas and those undetected based on image texture. Experiments show that Super4DR achieves a 67% performance gain over prior self-supervised methods, nearly matches supervised odometry, and narrows the map quality disparity with LiDAR while enabling multi-modal image rendering.

Motivation: 现有VLA模型主要依赖RGB信息，忽略了空间推理和操作中关键的几何线索。

Method: GLaD框架在预训练中通过知识蒸馏引入3D几何先验，将几何特征与LLM的隐藏状态对齐，而非仅蒸馏到视觉编码器。

Result: 在Bridge数据集上预训练的GLaD在四个LIBERO任务套件中平均成功率达94.1%，优于UniVLA（92.5%）。

Conclusion: GLaD通过几何感知的预训练显著提升了空间推理和策略泛化能力，无需依赖深度传感器或3D标注。

Abstract: Most existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely primarily on RGB information, while ignoring geometric cues crucial for spatial reasoning and manipulation. In this work, we introduce GLaD, a geometry-aware VLA framework that incorporates 3D geometric priors during pretraining through knowledge distillation. Rather than distilling geometric features solely into the vision encoder, we align the LLM's hidden states corresponding to visual tokens with features from a frozen geometry-aware vision transformer (VGGT), ensuring that geometric understanding is deeply integrated into the multimodal representations that drive action prediction. Pretrained on the Bridge dataset with this geometry distillation mechanism, GLaD achieves 94.1% average success rate across four LIBERO task suites, outperforming UniVLA (92.5%) which uses identical pretraining data. These results validate that geometry-aware pretraining enhances spatial reasoning and policy generalization without requiring explicit depth sensors or 3D annotations.

Conclusion: ReMoSPLAT通过二次规划和高斯Splat表示实现了移动机械臂的避障控制，性能接近依赖完美地面真实信息的控制器。

Abstract: Reactive control can gracefully coordinate the motion of the base and the arm of a mobile manipulator. However, incorporating an accurate representation of the environment to avoid obstacles without involving costly planning remains a challenge. In this work, we present ReMoSPLAT, a reactive controller based on a quadratic program formulation for mobile manipulation that leverages a Gaussian Splat representation for collision avoidance. By integrating additional constraints and costs into the optimisation formulation, a mobile manipulator platform can reach its intended end effector pose while avoiding obstacles, even in cluttered scenes. We investigate the trade-offs of two methods for efficiently calculating robot-obstacle distances, comparing a purely geometric approach with a rasterisation-based approach. Our experiments in simulation on both synthetic and real-world scans demonstrate the feasibility of our method, showing that the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to controllers that rely on perfect ground-truth information.

Abstract: Accurate water quality assessment requires spatially resolved sampling, yet most unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) can collect only a limited number of samples or rely on single-point sensors with poor representativeness. This work presents a solar-powered, fully autonomous USV featuring a novel syringe-based sampling architecture capable of acquiring 72 discrete, contamination-minimized water samples per mission. The vehicle incorporates a ROS 2 autonomy stack with GPS-RTK navigation, LiDAR and stereo-vision obstacle detection, Nav2-based mission planning, and long-range LoRa supervision, enabling dependable execution of sampling routes in unstructured environments. The platform integrates a behavior-tree autonomy architecture adapted from Nav2, enabling mission-level reasoning and perception-aware navigation. A modular 6x12 sampling system, controlled by distributed micro-ROS nodes, provides deterministic actuation, fault isolation, and rapid module replacement, achieving spatial coverage beyond previously reported USV-based samplers. Field trials in Achocalla Lagoon (La Paz, Bolivia) demonstrated 87% waypoint accuracy, stable autonomous navigation, and accurate physicochemical measurements (temperature, pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids) comparable to manually collected references. These results demonstrate that the platform enables reliable high-resolution sampling and autonomous mission execution, providing a scalable solution for aquatic monitoring in remote environments.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation requires both rich multimodal perception and effective learning frameworks to handle complex real-world tasks. See-through-skin (STS) sensors, which combine tactile and visual perception, offer promising sensing capabilities, while modern imitation learning provides powerful tools for policy acquisition. However, existing STS designs lack simultaneous multimodal perception and suffer from unreliable tactile tracking. Furthermore, integrating these rich multimodal signals into learning-based manipulation pipelines remains an open challenge. We introduce TacThru, an STS sensor enabling simultaneous visual perception and robust tactile signal extraction, and TacThru-UMI, an imitation learning framework that leverages these multimodal signals for manipulation. Our sensor features a fully transparent elastomer, persistent illumination, novel keyline markers, and efficient tracking, while our learning system integrates these signals through a Transformer-based Diffusion Policy. Experiments on five challenging real-world tasks show that TacThru-UMI achieves an average success rate of 85.5%, significantly outperforming the baselines of alternating tactile-visual (66.3%) and vision-only (55.4%). The system excels in critical scenarios, including contact detection with thin and soft objects and precision manipulation requiring multimodal coordination. This work demonstrates that combining simultaneous multimodal perception with modern learning frameworks enables more precise, adaptable robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于视觉的、数据驱动的框架，用于无人机（UAV）与无人地面车辆（UGV）的实时集成，特别是在GPS/GNSS不可用或受限的环境中，展示了在多智能体协调中的强健性能。

Abstract: The integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) is increasingly central to the development of intelligent autonomous systems for applications such as search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and logistics. However, precise coordination between these platforms in real-time scenarios presents major challenges, particularly when external localization infrastructure such as GPS or GNSS is unavailable or degraded [1]. This paper proposes a vision-based, data-driven framework for real-time UAV-UGV integration, with a focus on robust UGV detection and heading angle prediction for navigation and coordination. The system employs a fine-tuned YOLOv5 model to detect UGVs and extract bounding box features, which are then used by a lightweight artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate the UAV's required heading angle. A VICON motion capture system was used to generate ground-truth data during training, resulting in a dataset of over 13,000 annotated images collected in a controlled lab environment. The trained ANN achieves a mean absolute error of 0.1506° and a root mean squared error of 0.1957°, offering accurate heading angle predictions using only monocular camera inputs. Experimental evaluations achieve 95% accuracy in UGV detection. This work contributes a vision-based, infrastructure- independent solution that demonstrates strong potential for deployment in GPS/GNSS-denied environments, supporting reliable multi-agent coordination under realistic dynamic conditions. A demonstration video showcasing the system's real-time performance, including UGV detection, heading angle prediction, and UAV alignment under dynamic conditions, is available at: https://github.com/Kooroshraf/UAV-UGV-Integration

Abstract: Visual navigation has emerged as a practical alternative to traditional robotic navigation pipelines that rely on detailed mapping and path planning. However, constructing and maintaining 3D maps is often computationally expensive and memory-intensive. We address the problem of visual navigation when exploration videos of a large environment are available. The videos serve as a visual reference, allowing a robot to retrace the explored trajectories without relying on metric maps. Our proposed method, YOPO-Nav (You Only Pass Once), encodes an environment into a compact spatial representation composed of interconnected local 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models. During navigation, the framework aligns the robot's current visual observation with this representation and predicts actions that guide it back toward the demonstrated trajectory. YOPO-Nav employs a hierarchical design: a visual place recognition (VPR) module provides coarse localization, while the local 3DGS models refine the goal and intermediate poses to generate control actions. To evaluate our approach, we introduce the YOPO-Campus dataset, comprising 4 hours of egocentric video and robot controller inputs from over 6 km of human-teleoperated robot trajectories. We benchmark recent visual navigation methods on trajectories from YOPO-Campus using a Clearpath Jackal robot. Experimental results show YOPO-Nav provides excellent performance in image-goal navigation for real-world scenes on a physical robot. The dataset and code will be made publicly available for visual navigation and scene representation research.

Abstract: High-fidelity simulation has become essential to the design and control of soft robots, where large geometric deformations and complex contact interactions challenge conventional modeling tools. Recent advances in the field demand simulation frameworks that combine physical accuracy, computational scalability, and seamless integration with modern control and optimization pipelines. In this work, we present Py-DiSMech, a Python-based, open-source simulation framework for modeling and control of soft robotic structures grounded in the principles of Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG). By discretizing geometric quantities such as curvature and strain directly on meshes, Py-DiSMech captures the nonlinear deformation of rods, shells, and hybrid structures with high fidelity and reduced computational cost. The framework introduces (i) a fully vectorized NumPy implementation achieving order-of-magnitude speed-ups over existing geometry-based simulators; (ii) a penalty-energy-based fully implicit contact model that supports rod-rod, rod-shell, and shell-shell interactions; (iii) a natural-strain-based feedback-control module featuring a proportional-integral (PI) controller for shape regulation and trajectory tracking; and (iv) a modular, object-oriented software design enabling user-defined elastic energies, actuation schemes, and integration with machine-learning libraries. Benchmark comparisons demonstrate that Py-DiSMech substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art simulator Elastica in computational efficiency while maintaining physical accuracy. Together, these features establish Py-DiSMech as a scalable, extensible platform for simulation-driven design, control validation, and sim-to-real research in soft robotics.

Abstract: Towards human-robot coexistence, socially aware navigation is significant for mobile robots. Yet existing studies on this area focus mainly on path efficiency and pedestrian collision avoidance, which are essential but represent only a fraction of social navigation. Beyond these basics, robots must also comply with user instructions, aligning their actions to task goals and social norms expressed by humans. In this work, we present LISN-Bench, the first simulation-based benchmark for language-instructed social navigation. Built on Rosnav-Arena 3.0, it is the first standardized social navigation benchmark to incorporate instruction following and scene understanding across diverse contexts. To address this task, we further propose Social-Nav-Modulator, a fast-slow hierarchical system where a VLM agent modulates costmaps and controller parameters. Decoupling low-level action generation from the slower VLM loop reduces reliance on high-frequency VLM inference while improving dynamic avoidance and perception adaptability. Our method achieves an average success rate of 91.3%, which is greater than 63% than the most competitive baseline, with most of the improvements observed in challenging tasks such as following a person in a crowd and navigating while strictly avoiding instruction-forbidden regions.

Conclusion: TEAM-VLA 是一种无需重新训练的动态令牌压缩框架，有效加速了 VLA 模型的推理速度，同时保持了任务性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models pretrained on large-scale multimodal datasets have emerged as powerful foundations for robotic perception and control. However, their massive scale, often billions of parameters, poses significant challenges for real-time deployment, as inference becomes computationally expensive and latency-sensitive in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose Token Expand-and-Merge-VLA (TEAM-VLA), a training-free token compression framework that accelerates VLA inference while preserving task performance. TEAM-VLA introduces a dynamic token expansion mechanism that identifies and samples additional informative tokens in the spatial vicinity of attention-highlighted regions, enhancing contextual completeness. These expanded tokens are then selectively merged in deeper layers under action-aware guidance, effectively reducing redundancy while maintaining semantic coherence. By coupling expansion and merging within a single feed-forward pass, TEAM-VLA achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness, without any retraining or parameter updates. Extensive experiments on LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that TEAM-VLA consistently improves inference speed while maintaining or even surpassing the task success rate of full VLA models.

Conclusion: HiF-VLA 在 LIBERO-Long 和 CALVIN ABC-D 基准测试中超越了强基线，并在实际机器人长时程操作任务中表现出显著改进，证明了其在实际应用中的广泛有效性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently enabled robotic manipulation by grounding visual and linguistic cues into actions. However, most VLAs assume the Markov property, relying only on the current observation and thus suffering from temporal myopia that degrades long-horizon coherence. In this work, we view motion as a more compact and informative representation of temporal context and world dynamics, capturing inter-state changes while filtering static pixel-level noise. Building on this idea, we propose HiF-VLA (Hindsight, Insight, and Foresight for VLAs), a unified framework that leverages motion for bidirectional temporal reasoning. HiF-VLA encodes past dynamics through hindsight priors, anticipates future motion via foresight reasoning, and integrates both through a hindsight-modulated joint expert to enable a ''think-while-acting'' paradigm for long-horizon manipulation. As a result, HiF-VLA surpasses strong baselines on LIBERO-Long and CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks, while incurring negligible additional inference latency. Furthermore, HiF-VLA achieves substantial improvements in real-world long-horizon manipulation tasks, demonstrating its broad effectiveness in practical robotic settings.

Motivation: 现有的专家并行方法在处理内存受限的MoE服务时，通过平衡每个GPU处理的令牌数量来应对负载不均，但这种方法反而降低了性能。研究发现，平衡令牌数量会增加激活的专家数量，加剧内存压力。

To address load imbalance across GPUs in EP, existing approaches aim to balance the number of tokens each GPU processes. Surprisingly, we find that this objective degrades performance rather than improving it when processing is memory-bound - a common occurrence in MoE serving, especially in the decode phase. Our analysis reveals that balancing the number of tokens processed per GPU increases the number of activated experts, exacerbating memory pressure in the memory-bound regime.
  We propose Minimum Expert Token ROuting, a novel token-routing algorithm for high-performance expert-parallel MoE serving in the memory-bound regime that balances the number of activated experts per GPU rather than token counts. METRO achieves near-optimal routing quality with minimal computational overhead by jointly optimizing algorithmic efficiency and leveraging the GPU's parallel processing power. To guarantee routing quality, METRO also employs a novel allGather scheme to gather global top-k knowledge, which has minimal overhead compared to conventional allToAll. Our evaluation of METRO against EPLB on both real systems (vLLM over 8 A100 GPUs) and a proprietary simulator (8-16 B200 GPUs) shows that METRO reduces decode latency by 11 - 22%, and total token throughput by 3 - 21% for Qwen3 and DeepSeek-V3 serving, where prefill and decode phases are co-deployed. In addition, by trading latency headroom for throughput, METRO improves decode throughput by up to 4.11x over EPLB at a fixed decode SLO.

TL;DR: 提出了一种保护隐私的分布式视觉Transformer卸载框架，通过边缘协调器分割数据并分发到多个云服务器，防止完整图像泄露，在SAM上验证了其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉智能工具的高计算需求超出资源受限设备的处理能力，而传统的云卸载方案存在严重的隐私漏洞。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的分布式、分层卸载框架，利用本地可信边缘设备（如手机或Nvidia Jetson）作为边缘协调器，将视觉数据分割并分发到多个独立的云服务器上。

Result: 在Segment Anything Model (SAM)上的应用表明，该方法显著提升了内容隐私性，同时保持了接近基准的分割性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为边缘-云连续体中的视觉任务提供了一种可扩展且保护隐私的解决方案。

Abstract: Nowadays, visual intelligence tools have become ubiquitous, offering all kinds of convenience and possibilities. However, these tools have high computational requirements that exceed the capabilities of resource-constrained mobile and wearable devices. While offloading visual data to the cloud is a common solution, it introduces significant privacy vulnerabilities during transmission and server-side computation. To address this, we propose a novel distributed, hierarchical offloading framework for Vision Transformers (ViTs) that addresses these privacy challenges by design. Our approach uses a local trusted edge device, such as a mobile phone or an Nvidia Jetson, as the edge orchestrator. This orchestrator partitions the user's visual data into smaller portions and distributes them across multiple independent cloud servers. By design, no single external server possesses the complete image, preventing comprehensive data reconstruction. The final data merging and aggregation computation occurs exclusively on the user's trusted edge device. We apply our framework to the Segment Anything Model (SAM) as a practical case study, which demonstrates that our method substantially enhances content privacy over traditional cloud-based approaches. Evaluations show our framework maintains near-baseline segmentation performance while substantially reducing the risk of content reconstruction and user data exposure. Our framework provides a scalable, privacy-preserving solution for vision tasks in the edge-cloud continuum.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据集规模扩大到数十亿向量，磁盘向量搜索成为实际解决方案，但未来需要应对单个服务器无法处理的数据集规模。

Method: BatANN通过将查询的完整状态发送到存储邻域的机器上执行，改进了局部性，保持了单机对数搜索效率的同时，实现了接近线性的吞吐量扩展。

Result: 在10台服务器上，BatANN在1亿和10亿点数据集上分别实现了6.21-6.49倍和2.5-5.10倍的吞吐量提升，平均延迟低于6毫秒。

Conclusion: BatANN是一种分布式磁盘向量搜索系统，首次在开源领域实现了基于单一全局图的操作，显著提升了大规模数据集下的吞吐量和延迟性能。

Abstract: Vector search underpins modern information-retrieval systems, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and search engines over unstructured text and images. As datasets scale to billions of vectors, disk-based vector search has emerged as a practical solution. However, looking to the future, we need to anticipate datasets too large for any single server. We present BatANN, a distributed disk-based approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) system that retains the logarithmic search efficiency of a single global graph while achieving near-linear throughput scaling in the number of servers. Our core innovation is that when accessing a neighborhood which is stored on another machine, we send the full state of the query to the other machine to continue executing there for improved locality. On 100M- and 1B-point datasets at 0.95 recall using 10 servers, BatANN achieves 6.21-6.49x and 2.5-5.10x the throughput of the scatter-gather baseline, respectively, while maintaining mean latency below 6 ms. Moreover, we get these results on standard TCP. To our knowledge, BatANN is the first open-source distributed disk-based vector search system to operate over a single global graph.

Method: 设计了基于通用GPU工作者的WarmServe系统，采用预知未来工作负载的策略，包括避免预加载干扰的模型放置、主动预加载和零开销内存切换机制。

Result: 在真实数据集上的评估显示，WarmServe将TTFT提升至多50.8倍，并能处理比GPU共享系统多2.5倍的请求。

Conclusion: WarmServe通过预加载模型和优化GPU资源管理，显著提升了多LLM服务系统的推理性能，特别是在首次令牌时间（TTFT）上，同时提高了请求处理能力。

Abstract: Deploying multiple models within shared GPU clusters is promising for improving resource efficiency in large language model (LLM) serving. Existing multi-LLM serving systems optimize GPU utilization at the cost of worse inference performance, especially time-to-first-token (TTFT). We identify the root cause of such compromise as their unawareness of future workload characteristics. In contrast, recent analysis on real-world traces has shown the high periodicity and long-term predictability of LLM serving workloads.
  We propose universal GPU workers to enable one-for-many GPU prewarming that loads models with knowledge of future workloads. Based on universal GPU workers, we design and build WarmServe, a multi-LLM serving system that (1) mitigates cluster-wide prewarming interference by adopting an evict-aware model placement strategy, (2) prepares universal GPU workers in advance by proactive prewarming, and (3) manages GPU memory with a zero-overhead memory switching mechanism. Evaluation under real-world datasets shows that WarmServe improves TTFT by up to 50.8$\times$ compared to the state-of-the-art autoscaling-based system, while being capable of serving up to 2.5$\times$ more requests compared to the GPU-sharing system.

Abstract: Diverse scientific and engineering research areas deal with discrete, time-stamped changes in large systems of interacting delay differential equations. Simulating such complex systems at scale on high-performance computing clusters demands efficient management of communication and memory. Inspired by the human cerebral cortex -- a sparsely connected network of $\mathcal{O}(10^{10})$ neurons, each forming $\mathcal{O}(10^{3})$--$\mathcal{O}(10^{4})$ synapses and communicating via short electrical pulses called spikes -- we study the simulation of large-scale spiking neural networks for computational neuroscience research. This work presents a novel network construction method for multi-GPU clusters and upcoming exascale supercomputers using the Message Passing Interface (MPI), where each process builds its local connectivity and prepares the data structures for efficient spike exchange across the cluster during state propagation. We demonstrate scaling performance of two cortical models using point-to-point and collective communication, respectively.

Conclusion: PHWSOA 在云环境中表现出显著的性能提升，包括缩短任务完成时间、优化虚拟机负载平衡和降低成本，具有实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: Task scheduling is a critical research challenge in cloud computing, a transformative technology widely adopted across industries. Although numerous scheduling solutions exist, they predominantly optimize singular or limited metrics such as execution time or resource utilization often neglecting the need for comprehensive multi-objective optimization. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes the Pareto-based Hybrid Whale-Seagull Optimization Algorithm (PHWSOA). This algorithm synergistically combines the strengths of the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and the Seagull Optimization Algorithm (SOA), specifically mitigating WOA's limitations in local exploitation and SOA's constraints in global exploration. Leveraging Pareto dominance principles, PHWSOA simultaneously optimizes three key objectives: makespan, virtual machine (VM) load balancing, and economic cost. Key enhancements include: Halton sequence initialization for superior population diversity, a Pareto-guided mutation mechanism to avert premature convergence, and parallel processing for accelerated convergence. Furthermore, a dynamic VM load redistribution mechanism is integrated to improve load balancing during task execution. Extensive experiments conducted on the CloudSim simulator, utilizing real-world workload traces from NASA-iPSC and HPC2N, demonstrate that PHWSOA delivers substantial performance gains. Specifically, it achieves up to a 72.1% reduction in makespan, a 36.8% improvement in VM load balancing, and 23.5% cost savings. These results substantially outperform baseline methods including WOA, GA, PEWOA, and GCWOA underscoring PHWSOA's strong potential for enabling efficient resource management in practical cloud environments.

Motivation: 研究旨在解决GPU深度学习训练中普遍存在的straggler问题及其对TTA的影响。

Method: STAR系统引入了新的同步模式，结合启发式和机器学习方法选择最优同步模式，并重新分配资源以支持所选模式。

Result: 在AWS上的评估显示，STAR在PS和all-reduce架构中分别降低了48-84%和51-70%的TTA。

Conclusion: STAR系统通过新的同步模式和资源重新分配策略，显著降低了TTA，同时保持了SSGD的收敛精度。

Abstract: Despite the popularity of homogeneous GPU-based deep learning (DL) training, the prevalence, causes and impact of stragglers and the effectiveness of existing straggler mitigation approaches are still not well understood in this scenario due to limited research on these questions. To fill this gap, we conducted comprehensive experiments and found that stragglers remain widespread due to CPU and bandwidth usage imbalances. Additionally, existing mitigation methods that switch from synchronous stochastic gradient descent (SSGD) to asynchronous SGD (ASGD) may not improve Time-To-Accuracy (TTA) and can even generate more stragglers due to its higher resource consumption. To address these newly found problems, we propose the Straggler Tolerant And Resilient DL training system (STAR). STAR includes new synchronization modes that group workers for each parameter updating. It has a heuristic and an ML method to choose the optimal synchronization mode for minimizing TTA, and reallocates resources to support the selected mode while minimizing the impact on co-located jobs. Moreover, it proactively prevents stragglers by avoiding overloading the CPU and bandwidth resources in allocating PSs (which consume high CPU and bandwidth) and in gradient transmission. Our trace-driven evaluation on AWS shows that STAR generates 48-84% and 51-70% lower TTA than state-of-the-art systems in the PS and all-reduce architectures, respectively, while maintaining the converged accuracy of SSGD. The code for STAR is open-sourced.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（LLM）产生的幻觉如何影响用户对LLM的信任及用户与LLM的互动。

Method: 通过定性研究，对192名参与者进行了调查，基于Lee & See的校准信任模型和Afroogh等人的信任相关因素进行分析。

Result: 研究发现幻觉不会导致全面不信任，而是引发情境敏感的信任校准，确认了期望、先前经验、用户专业知识与领域知识作为用户相关信任因素，并发现直觉是幻觉检测中的额外因素。信任动态还受情境因素影响，特别是感知风险和决策风险。

Conclusion: 本文验证了递归信任校准过程，并将直觉作为用户相关信任因素纳入其中，提出了负责任和反思性使用LLM的实用建议。

Abstract: Hallucinations are outputs by Large Language Models (LLMs) that are factually incorrect yet appear plausible [1]. This paper investigates how such hallucinations influence users' trust in LLMs and users' interaction with LLMs. To explore this in everyday use, we conducted a qualitative study with 192 participants. Our findings show that hallucinations do not result in blanket mistrust but instead lead to context-sensitive trust calibration. Building on the calibrated trust model by Lee & See [2] and Afroogh et al.'s trust-related factors [3], we confirm expectancy [3], [4], prior experience [3], [4], [5], and user expertise & domain knowledge [3], [4] as userrelated (human) trust factors, and identify intuition as an additional factor relevant for hallucination detection. Additionally, we found that trust dynamics are further influenced by contextual factors, particularly perceived risk [3] and decision stakes [6]. Consequently, we validate the recursive trust calibration process proposed by Blöbaum [7] and extend it by including intuition as a user-related trust factor. Based on these insights, we propose practical recommendations for responsible and reflective LLM use.

Conclusion: AI TIPS框架直接解决了当前AI治理框架的三个关键挑战，提供了可操作的控制措施和系统化的实施方法。

Abstract: The deployment of AI systems faces three critical governance challenges that current frameworks fail to adequately address. First, organizations struggle with inadequate risk assessment at the use case level, exemplified by the Humana class action lawsuit and other high impact cases where an AI system deployed to production exhibited both significant bias and high error rates, resulting in improper healthcare claim denials. Each AI use case presents unique risk profiles requiring tailored governance, yet most frameworks provide one size fits all guidance. Second, existing frameworks like ISO 42001 and NIST AI RMF remain at high conceptual levels, offering principles without actionable controls, leaving practitioners unable to translate governance requirements into specific technical implementations. Third, organizations lack mechanisms for operationalizing governance at scale, with no systematic approach to embed trustworthy AI practices throughout the development lifecycle, measure compliance quantitatively, or provide role-appropriate visibility from boards to data scientists. We present AI TIPS, Artificial Intelligence Trust-Integrated Pillars for Sustainability 2.0, update to the comprehensive operational framework developed in 2019,four years before NIST's AI Risk Management Framework, that directly addresses these challenges.

Abstract: Understanding how humans and AI systems interpret ambiguous visual stimuli offers critical insight into the nature of perception, reasoning, and decision-making. This paper examines image labeling performance across human participants and deep neural networks, focusing on low-resolution, perceptually degraded stimuli. Drawing from computational cognitive science, cognitive architectures, and connectionist-symbolic hybrid models, we contrast human strategies such as analogical reasoning, shape-based recognition, and confidence modulation with AI's feature-based processing. Grounded in Marr's tri-level hypothesis, Simon's bounded rationality, and Thagard's frameworks of representation and emotion, we analyze participant responses in relation to Grad-CAM visualizations of model attention. Human behavior is further interpreted through cognitive principles modeled in ACT-R and Soar, revealing layered and heuristic decision strategies under uncertainty. Our findings highlight key parallels and divergences between biological and artificial systems in representation, inference, and confidence calibration. The analysis motivates future neuro-symbolic architectures that unify structured symbolic reasoning with connectionist representations. Such architectures, informed by principles of embodiment, explainability, and cognitive alignment, offer a path toward AI systems that are not only performant but also interpretable and cognitively grounded.

Abstract: This chapter argues that the reliability of agentic and generative AI is chiefly an architectural property. We define agentic systems as goal-directed, tool-using decision makers operating in closed loops, and show how reliability emerges from principled componentisation (goal manager, planner, tool-router, executor, memory, verifiers, safety monitor, telemetry), disciplined interfaces (schema-constrained, validated, least-privilege tool calls), and explicit control and assurance loops. Building on classical foundations, we propose a practical taxonomy-tool-using agents, memory-augmented agents, planning and self-improvement agents, multi-agent systems, and embodied or web agents - and analyse how each pattern reshapes the reliability envelope and failure modes. We distil design guidance on typed schemas, idempotency, permissioning, transactional semantics, memory provenance and hygiene, runtime governance (budgets, termination conditions), and simulate-before-actuate safeguards.

Conclusion: Trio框架通过整合片段建模、强化学习和蒙特卡洛树搜索，显著提升了分子设计的效率和药理学特性，超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Drug discovery is a time-consuming and expensive process, with traditional high-throughput and docking-based virtual screening hampered by low success rates and limited scalability. Recent advances in generative modelling, including autoregressive, diffusion, and flow-based approaches, have enabled de novo ligand design beyond the limits of enumerative screening. Yet these models often suffer from inadequate generalization, limited interpretability, and an overemphasis on binding affinity at the expense of key pharmacological properties, thereby restricting their translational utility. Here we present Trio, a molecular generation framework integrating fragment-based molecular language modeling, reinforcement learning, and Monte Carlo tree search, for effective and interpretable closed-loop targeted molecular design. Through the three key components, Trio enables context-aware fragment assembly, enforces physicochemical and synthetic feasibility, and guides a balanced search between the exploration of novel chemotypes and the exploitation of promising intermediates within protein binding pockets.

*Emanuele La Malfa,Ping Zhu,Samuele Marro,Sara Bernardini,Michael Wooldridge*

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLMs的端到端规划框架，能够自动将自然语言规范转换为PDDL模型并生成可读性强的最终计划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统规划系统中人类规范转换为PDDL模型时的模糊性和矛盾问题，以及LLMs在小规模规划问题中的局限性。

Method: 通过一个由LLMs驱动的协调器和多个子模块（代理）组成的框架，将自然语言的人类规范转换为PDDL模型，并迭代优化以解决时间约束、最优性及规范中的模糊和矛盾问题。

Result: 框架在多个领域和任务（如Google NaturalPlan、PlanBench、Blocksworld和Tower of Hanoi）中表现出灵活性和有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了如何利用LLMs实现端到端的规划支持，无需人工干预，并能与多种PDDL规划引擎和验证器集成。

Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for planning supported by verifiers. An orchestrator receives a human specification written in natural language and converts it into a PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) model, where the domain and problem are iteratively refined by sub-modules (agents) to address common planning requirements, such as time constraints and optimality, as well as ambiguities and contradictions that may exist in the human specification. The validated domain and problem are then passed to an external planning engine to generate a plan. The orchestrator and agents are powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and require no human intervention at any stage of the process. Finally, a module translates the final plan back into natural language to improve human readability while maintaining the correctness of each step. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our framework across various domains and tasks, including the Google NaturalPlan benchmark and PlanBench, as well as planning problems like Blocksworld and the Tower of Hanoi (where LLMs are known to struggle even with small instances). Our framework can be integrated with any PDDL planning engine and validator (such as Fast Downward, LPG, POPF, VAL, and uVAL, which we have tested) and represents a significant step toward end-to-end planning aided by LLMs.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种在连续动作空间中使用高斯过程回归来优化多线程统计信息聚合的方法，实验证明其在多个领域中优于现有策略，且推理时间增加有限。

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search is a cornerstone algorithm for online planning, and its root-parallel variant is widely used when wall clock time is limited but best performance is desired. In environments with continuous action spaces, how to best aggregate statistics from different threads is an important yet underexplored question. In this work, we introduce a method that uses Gaussian Process Regression to obtain value estimates for promising actions that were not trialed in the environment. We perform a systematic evaluation across 6 different domains, demonstrating that our approach outperforms existing aggregation strategies while requiring a modest increase in inference time.

Conclusion: 本文强调了多智能体路径规划（MAPF）算法在现实世界部署中的关键设计选择，并指出了未来研究方向以推动实际应用。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithms are increasingly deployed in industrial warehouses and automated manufacturing facilities, where robots must operate reliably under real-world physical constraints. However, existing MAPF evaluation frameworks typically rely on simplified robot models, leaving a substantial gap between algorithmic benchmarks and practical performance. Recent frameworks such as SMART, incorporate kinodynamic modeling and offer the MAPF community a platform for large-scale, realistic evaluation. Building on this capability, this work investigates how key planner design choices influence performance under realistic execution settings. We systematically study three fundamental factors: (1) the relationship between solution optimality and execution performance, (2) the sensitivity of system performance to inaccuracies in kinodynamic modeling, and (3) the interaction between model accuracy and plan optimality. Empirically, we examine these factors to understand how these design choices affect performance in realistic scenarios. We highlight open challenges and research directions to steer the community toward practical, real-world deployment.

Motivation: 现代AI加速器的规模庞大，传统故障评估方法面临高昂计算成本和关键故障模式覆盖不足的问题。

Method: RIFT将复杂的最坏情况故障搜索转化为序列决策问题，结合混合敏感性分析进行搜索空间剪枝，并利用强化学习生成最小化、高影响力的测试套件。

Result: 在NVIDIA A100 GPU上评估的十亿参数大语言模型工作负载中，RIFT实现了2.2倍的故障评估加速，测试向量量减少了99%，同时获得更优的故障覆盖率。

Conclusion: RIFT框架通过结合强化学习和混合敏感性分析，显著提升了AI加速器的故障评估效率和覆盖率，同时为硬件保护策略提供了可操作的数据。

Abstract: The massive scale of modern AI accelerators presents critical challenges to traditional fault assessment methodologies, which face prohibitive computational costs and provide poor coverage of critical failure modes. This paper introduces RIFT (Reinforcement Learning-guided Intelligent Fault Targeting), a scalable framework that automates the discovery of minimal, high-impact fault scenarios for efficient design-time fault assessment. RIFT transforms the complex search for worst-case faults into a sequential decision-making problem, combining hybrid sensitivity analysis for search space pruning with reinforcement learning to intelligently generate minimal, high-impact test suites. Evaluated on billion-parameter Large Language Model (LLM) workloads using NVIDIA A100 GPUs, RIFT achieves a \textbf{2.2$\times$} fault assessment speedup over evolutionary methods and reduces the required test vector volume by over \textbf{99\%} compared to random fault injection, all while achieving \textbf{superior fault coverage}. The proposed framework also provides actionable data to enable intelligent hardware protection strategies, demonstrating that RIFT-guided selective error correction code provides a \textbf{12.8$\times$} improvement in \textbf{cost-effectiveness} (coverage per unit area) compared to uniform triple modular redundancy protection. RIFT automatically generates UVM-compliant verification artifacts, ensuring its findings are directly actionable and integrable into commercial RTL verification workflows.

Motivation: 旨在统一概念空间、社会认识论和AI价值对齐的见解，通过结构兼容性而非共享信息或理性来理解意义保存。

Method: 通过将每个代理表示为个性化的价值空间，并利用线性解释映射来形式化信念的传播，提出了一个结构标准来评估信念的可理解性、误解和消亡。

Result: 提出了“无零空间领导条件”，将领导力定义为表征可达性而非说服或权威的属性，并解释了抽象存在如何在多样认知几何中传播、变异或消失。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个认知几何框架，用于分析异构代理之间的信念、动机和影响动态，强调了结构兼容性在意义保存中的核心作用。

Abstract: This paper develops a geometric framework for modeling belief, motivation, and influence across cognitively heterogeneous agents. Each agent is represented by a personalized value space, a vector space encoding the internal dimensions through which the agent interprets and evaluates meaning. Beliefs are formalized as structured vectors-abstract beings-whose transmission is mediated by linear interpretation maps. A belief survives communication only if it avoids the null spaces of these maps, yielding a structural criterion for intelligibility, miscommunication, and belief death.
  Within this framework, I show how belief distortion, motivational drift, counterfactual evaluation, and the limits of mutual understanding arise from purely algebraic constraints. A central result-"the No-Null-Space Leadership Condition"-characterizes leadership as a property of representational reachability rather than persuasion or authority. More broadly, the model explains how abstract beings can propagate, mutate, or disappear as they traverse diverse cognitive geometries.
  The account unifies insights from conceptual spaces, social epistemology, and AI value alignment by grounding meaning preservation in structural compatibility rather than shared information or rationality. I argue that this cognitive-geometric perspective clarifies the epistemic boundaries of influence in both human and artificial systems, and offers a general foundation for analyzing belief dynamics across heterogeneous agents.

Motivation: 评估AI代理与人类网络安全专业人员在实时企业环境中的表现差异，探索AI在网络安全领域的潜力与局限。

Method: 通过在一个大型大学网络（约8000台主机）上比较10名网络安全专家、6个现有AI代理和新型代理框架ARTEMIS的表现进行评估。ARTEMIS具备动态提示生成、任意子代理和自动漏洞分类功能。

Result: ARTEMIS总体排名第二，发现9个有效漏洞，提交有效率为82%，优于10名人类参与者中的9名。现有代理如Codex和CyAgent表现较差。

Conclusion: AI代理如ARTEMIS在系统枚举、并行利用和成本方面具有优势，但在误报率和基于GUI的任务上仍存在不足。

Abstract: We present the first comprehensive evaluation of AI agents against human cybersecurity professionals in a live enterprise environment. We evaluate ten cybersecurity professionals alongside six existing AI agents and ARTEMIS, our new agent scaffold, on a large university network consisting of ~8,000 hosts across 12 subnets. ARTEMIS is a multi-agent framework featuring dynamic prompt generation, arbitrary sub-agents, and automatic vulnerability triaging. In our comparative study, ARTEMIS placed second overall, discovering 9 valid vulnerabilities with an 82% valid submission rate and outperforming 9 of 10 human participants. While existing scaffolds such as Codex and CyAgent underperformed relative to most human participants, ARTEMIS demonstrated technical sophistication and submission quality comparable to the strongest participants. We observe that AI agents offer advantages in systematic enumeration, parallel exploitation, and cost -- certain ARTEMIS variants cost $18/hour versus $60/hour for professional penetration testers. We also identify key capability gaps: AI agents exhibit higher false-positive rates and struggle with GUI-based tasks.

Method: 提出SCOPE（Subgoal-COnditioned Pretraining for Efficient planning），一种一次性分层规划器，仅在初始化时利用LLM生成的子目标预训练轻量级学生模型。

Result: 在TextCraft环境中，SCOPE的成功率为0.56，优于ADaPT的0.52，且推理时间从164.4秒降至3.0秒。

Conclusion: SCOPE方法通过一次性利用LLM生成的子目标进行预训练，显著提高了规划效率，尽管牺牲了一定的解释性和子目标最优性，但在TextCraft环境中表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Long-term planning in complex, text-based environments presents significant challenges due to open-ended action spaces, ambiguous observations, and sparse feedback. Recent research suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode rich semantic knowledge about the world, which can be valuable for guiding agents in high-level reasoning and planning across both embodied and purely textual settings. However, existing approaches often depend heavily on querying LLMs during training and inference, making them computationally expensive and difficult to deploy efficiently. In addition, these methods typically employ a pretrained, unaltered LLM whose parameters remain fixed throughout training, providing no opportunity for adaptation to the target task. To address these limitations, we introduce SCOPE (Subgoal-COnditioned Pretraining for Efficient planning), a one-shot hierarchical planner that leverages LLM-generated subgoals only at initialization to pretrain a lightweight student model. Unlike prior approaches that distill LLM knowledge by repeatedly prompting the model to adaptively generate subgoals during training, our method derives subgoals directly from example trajectories. This design removes the need for repeated LLM queries, significantly improving efficiency, though at the cost of reduced explainability and potentially suboptimal subgoals. Despite their suboptimality, our results on the TextCraft environment show that LLM-generated subgoals can still serve as a strong starting point for hierarchical goal decomposition in text-based planning tasks. Compared to the LLM-based hierarchical agent ADaPT (Prasad et al., 2024), which achieves a 0.52 success rate, our method reaches 0.56 and reduces inference time from 164.4 seconds to just 3.0 seconds.

Motivation: 研究如何在概率图模型理论中引入函子视角，以区分语法和语义修改。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个范畴框架，将道德化和三角化建模为贝叶斯网络和马尔可夫网络之间的函子，强调了语法和语义修改的区别。

Abstract: Moralisation and Triangulation are transformations allowing to switch between different ways of factoring a probability distribution into a graphical model. Moralisation allows to view a Bayesian network (a directed model) as a Markov network (an undirected model), whereas triangulation addresses the opposite direction. We present a categorical framework where these transformations are modelled as functors between a category of Bayesian networks and one of Markov networks. The two kinds of network (the objects of these categories) are themselves represented as functors from a `syntax' domain to a `semantics' codomain. Notably, moralisation and triangulation can be defined inductively on such syntax via functor pre-composition. Moreover, while moralisation is fully syntactic, triangulation relies on semantics. This leads to a discussion of the variable elimination algorithm, reinterpreted here as a functor in its own right, that splits the triangulation procedure in two: one purely syntactic, the other purely semantic. This approach introduces a functorial perspective into the theory of probabilistic graphical models, which highlights the distinctions between syntactic and semantic modifications.

Motivation: 现代程序通常需要操作系统和 libc 支持，而现有 zkVMs 通过维护语言特定运行时的分支并静态链接到应用中，导致版本混乱和可信计算基础过大。

Method: ZeroOS 采用模块化设计，允许开发者使用现成的工具链编译和链接仅需的 Linux ABI 子集，任何 zkVM 团队均可通过编写 ZeroOS 引导程序轻松集成。

Result: ZeroOS 减少了维护负担，统一了 zkVM 生态系统，并提供了开源实现。

Conclusion: ZeroOS 是一个模块化的库操作系统（libOS），旨在解决 zkVMs 在兼容性和维护负担上的问题，通过允许开发者仅链接其 vApp 所需的 Linux ABI 子集，减少可信计算基础并统一 zkVM 生态系统。

Abstract: zkVMs promise general-purpose verifiable computation through ISA-level compatibility with modern programs and toolchains. However, compatibility extends further than just the ISA; modern programs often cannot run or even compile without an operating system and libc. zkVMs attempt to address this by maintaining forks of language-specific runtimes and statically linking them into applications to create self-contained unikernels, but this ad-hoc approach leads to version hell and burdens verifiable applications (vApps) with an unnecessarily large trusted computing base. We solve this problem with ZeroOS, a modular library operating system (libOS) for vApp unikernels; vApp developers can use off-the-shelf toolchains to compile and link only the exact subset of the Linux ABI their vApp needs. Any zkVM team can easily leverage the ZeroOS ecosystem by writing a ZeroOS bootloader for their platform, resulting in a reduced maintainence burden and unifying the entire zkVM ecosystem with consolidated development and audit resources. ZeroOS is free and open-sourced at https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/ZeroOS.

Method: Tyche采用蒙特卡洛树搜索波束跳变（MCTS-BH）算法计算照明模式，并结合滑动窗口和剪枝技术降低计算时间；同时使用贪婪波束跳变（G-BH）算法提供临时解决方案。

Conclusion: Tyche框架通过结合MCTS-BH和G-BH算法，显著提升了高吞吐量卫星的波束跳变效率，实现了实时计算和高吞吐量的双重目标。

Abstract: High-Throughput Satellites (HTS) use beam hopping to handle non-uniform and time-varying ground traffic demand. A significant technical challenge in beam hopping is the computation of effective illumination patterns. Traditional algorithms, like the genetic algorithm, require over 300 seconds to compute a single illumination pattern for just 37 cells, whereas modern HTS typically covers over 300 cells, rendering current methods impractical for real-world applications. Advanced approaches, such as multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, face convergence issues when the number of cells exceeds 40. In this paper, we introduce Tyche, a hybrid computation framework designed to address this challenge. Tyche incorporates a Monte Carlo Tree Search Beam Hopping (MCTS-BH) algorithm for computing illumination patterns and employs sliding window and pruning techniques to significantly reduce computation time. Specifically, MCTS-BH can compute one illumination pattern for 37 cells in just 12 seconds. To ensure real-time computation, we use a Greedy Beam Hopping (G-BH) algorithm, which provides a provisional solution while MCTS-BH completes its computation in the background. Our evaluation results show that MCTS-BH can increase throughput by up to 98.76%, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing solutions.

Motivation: 为了解决LEO卫星高移动性和FOV限制导致的域划分效率低下问题，以及集中式和分布式控制架构的局限性。

Method: Eunomia采用三步域划分框架，包括运动感知的FOV分割、基于控制开销关系图的谱聚类流量负载均衡，以及通过Kuhn-Munkres算法优化控制器分配。

Result: 实验结果显示，Eunomia将请求丢失率降低高达58.3%，控制开销减少50.3%，算法执行时间缩短77.7%。

Conclusion: Eunomia框架通过结合地面站和MEO卫星的混合控制平面，显著降低了控制平面延迟，减少了请求丢失和控制开销，并在算法执行时间上表现出色。

Abstract: With the rise of mega-satellite constellations, the integration of hierarchical non-terrestrial and terrestrial networks has become a cornerstone of 6G coverage enhancements. In these hierarchical satellite networks, controllers manage satellite switches within their assigned domains. However, the high mobility of LEO satellites and field-of-view (FOV) constraints pose fundamental challenges to efficient domain partitioning. Centralized control approaches face scalability bottlenecks, while distributed architectures with onboard controllers often disregard FOV limitations, leading to excessive signaling overhead. LEO satellites outside a controller's FOV require an average of five additional hops, resulting in a 10.6-fold increase in response time. To address these challenges, we propose Eunomia, a three-step domain-partitioning framework that leverages movement-aware FOV segmentation within a hybrid control plane combining ground stations and MEO satellites. Eunomia reduces control plane latency by constraining domains to FOV-aware regions and ensures single-hop signaling. It further balances traffic load through spectral clustering on a Control Overhead Relationship Graph and optimizes controller assignment via the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm. We implement Eunomia on the Plotinus emulation platform with realistic constellation parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that Eunomia reduces request loss by up to 58.3%, control overhead by up to 50.3\%, and algorithm execution time by 77.7% significantly outperforming current state-of-the-art solutions.

Motivation: 解决LEO卫星网络因动态拓扑变化和严重链路故障导致的路由不稳定问题。

Method: 采用分层路由方案，结合收敛无关的地理路由和收敛隔离的路由，并自适应切换有状态和无状态转发模式。

Result: 在30%随机链路故障下，可达性提升2倍，路由可用性接近100%，控制消息和FIB更新开销低于OSPF的0.2%，路由计算时间减少≥36%，延迟抖动降低≥50%。

Conclusion: BlockFLEX架构通过分层路由方案和自适应转发模式，显著提升了LEO卫星网络的鲁棒性和性能，在链路故障情况下仍保持高可达性和低开销。

Abstract: This paper presents \textbf{BlockFLEX}, an adaptive and survivable architecture with a hierarchical routing scheme for Low Earth Orbit satellite networks, designed to address dynamic topology changes and severe link failures.
  By organizing satellites into autonomous blocks, BlockFLEX establishes a survivable underlay network that masks network volatility and offers a stable overlay view. The architecture employs a hierarchical routing scheme integrating both convergence-free geographic routing and convergence-isolated routing. Furthermore, BlockFLEX adaptively switches between stateful and stateless forwarding modes, enabling efficient, resilient, and stable routing via a dedicated protection mechanism and an optimized source satellite selection algorithm.
  Experimental evaluations on current operational LEO satellite networks (LSNs) demonstrate that under scenarios with up to 30\% random link failures, the proposed method achieves a $2\times$ improvement in reachability compared to current leading schemes, while maintaining near-100\% routing availability. Moreover, the overhead of control messages and forwarding information base (FIB) updates remains below $0.2\%$ of that in OSPF, accompanied by a $\geq 36\%$ reduction in routing computation time and a $\geq 50\%$ decrease in latency jitter.

Conclusion: M3Net通过图神经网络架构显著提升了多性能指标预测的准确性，为网络数字孪生（NDT）提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: The rise of 5G/6G network technologies promises to enable applications like autonomous vehicles and virtual reality, resulting in a significant increase in connected devices and necessarily complicating network management. Even worse, these applications often have strict, yet heterogeneous, performance requirements across metrics like latency and reliability. Much recent work has thus focused on developing the ability to predict network performance. However, traditional methods for network modeling, like discrete event simulators and emulation, often fail to balance accuracy and scalability. Network Digital Twins (NDTs), augmented by machine learning, present a viable solution by creating virtual replicas of physical networks for real- time simulation and analysis. State-of-the-art models, however, fall short of full-fledged NDTs, as they often focus only on a single performance metric or simulated network data. We introduce M3Net, a Multi-Metric Mixture-of-experts (MoE) NDT that uses a graph neural network architecture to estimate multiple performance metrics from an expanded set of network state data in a range of scenarios. We show that M3Net significantly enhances the accuracy of flow delay predictions by reducing the MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) from 20.06% to 17.39%, while also achieving 66.47% and 78.7% accuracy on jitter and packets dropped for each flow

Abstract: In-network machine learning enables real-time classification directly on network hardware, offering consistently low inference latency. However, current solutions are limited by strict hardware constraints, scarce on-device resources, and poor usability, making them impractical for ML developers and cloud operators. To this end, we propose ACORN, an end-to-end system that automates the distributed deployment of practical machine learning models across the network. ACORN provides a fully automated pipeline that loads and deploys Python ML models on network devices using an optimized deployment plan from an ILP planner. To support larger models under hardware constraints and allow runtime programmability, ACORN adopts a novel data plane representation for Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine models. We implement ACORN prototype in P4 and run it on real programmable hardware. Our evaluation shows ACORN can deploy classification ML models with 2-4x more features than state-of-the-art solutions, while imposing negligible overhead on network performance and traffic. We will make our data plane program, model translator, optimizer, and all related scripts publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BP路由在无线多跳网络中虽然具有分布式操作和最大队列稳定性的优势，但仍存在启动慢、随机游走、最后一包问题和带宽利用率不足等缺点。

Method: 提出了一种最大效用（MaxU）链路共享方法，该方法允许链路共享，避免了传统排他性商品选择的问题。

Result: 数值结果表明，MaxU SP-BP显著缓解了最后一包问题，并略微扩展了网络容量区域。

Conclusion: 通过重新审视BP背后的Lyapunov漂移理论，证明了传统排他性商品选择的非必要性，并提出了一种最大效用（MaxU）链路共享方法，在不增加控制消息开销的情况下扩展了性能范围。

Abstract: Backpressure (BP) routing and scheduling is an established resource allocation method for wireless multi-hop networks, noted for its fully distributed operation and maximum queue stability. Recent advances in shortest path-biased BP routing (SP-BP) mitigate shortcomings such as slow startup and random walks, yet exclusive link-level commodity selection still causes last-packet problem and bandwidth underutilization. By revisiting the Lyapunov drift theory underlying BP, we show that the legacy exclusive commodity selection is unnecessary, and propose a Maximum Utility (MaxU) link-sharing method to expand its performance envelope without increasing control message overhead. Numerical results show that MaxU SP-BP substantially mitigates the last-packet problem and slightly expands the network capacity region.

TL;DR: 研究探索了LLMs在源代码漏洞检测中的表现，提出Double Fine-tuning方法并测试Test-Time fine-tuning，发现微调效果显著，Llama模型潜力大，但提示工程效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着软件开发周期的加速，软件漏洞数量持续增加，自动化源代码漏洞检测（CVD）变得至关重要。研究旨在探索当前性能最强的AI模型——大语言模型（LLMs）在CVD任务中的表现，并通过先进技术提升其效果。

Method: 研究利用开源的Llama-3.1 8B模型，结合BigVul和PrimeVul数据集的源代码样本，探索了多种微调和提示工程设置，特别是提出了Double Fine-tuning方法和测试了Test-Time fine-tuning方法。

Result: 研究发现微调对任务解决至关重要，Double Fine-tuning方法表现优异，Llama模型在CVD任务中具有潜力。提示工程效果不佳，但检索增强生成（RAG）表现较好。

Conclusion: 研究表明，微调对于解决源代码漏洞检测任务至关重要，特别是提出的Double Fine-tuning方法表现优异，同时Llama模型在该任务中展现出潜力。尽管提示工程效果不佳，但检索增强生成（RAG）作为示例选择技术表现较好。研究部分问题已解答，但仍有许多未来工作方向。

Abstract: The significant increase in software production, driven by the acceleration of development cycles over the past two decades, has led to a steady rise in software vulnerabilities, as shown by statistics published yearly by the CVE program. The automation of the source code vulnerability detection (CVD) process has thus become essential, and several methods have been proposed ranging from the well established program analysis techniques to the more recent AI-based methods. Our research investigates Large Language Models (LLMs), which are considered among the most performant AI models to date, for the CVD task. The objective is to study their performance and apply different state-of-the-art techniques to enhance their effectiveness for this task. We explore various fine-tuning and prompt engineering settings. We particularly suggest one novel approach for fine-tuning LLMs which we call Double Fine-tuning, and also test the understudied Test-Time fine-tuning approach. We leverage the recent open-source Llama-3.1 8B, with source code samples extracted from BigVul and PrimeVul datasets. Our conclusions highlight the importance of fine-tuning to resolve the task, the performance of Double tuning, as well as the potential of Llama models for CVD. Though prompting proved ineffective, Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) performed relatively well as an example selection technique. Overall, some of our research questions have been answered, and many are still on hold, which leaves us many future work perspectives.

TL;DR: ARTEMIS是一种无需代码的进化优化平台，通过语义感知遗传操作联合优化LLM代理配置，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的优化方法要么过于复杂，要么孤立处理组件，忽视了关键互依赖性，导致LLM代理性能不佳。

Method: ARTEMIS通过语义感知的遗传操作联合优化代理配置，自动发现可配置组件，从执行日志中提取性能信号，并在无需架构修改的情况下进化配置。

Result: 在四个代表性代理系统上的评估显示，ARTEMIS显著提升了性能：ALE Agent的接受率提高了13.6%，Mini-SWE Agent性能提升了10.1%，CrewAI Agent减少了36.9%的评估令牌数，MathTales-Teacher Agent在GSM8K上的准确率提高了22%。

Conclusion: ARTEMIS是一种无需代码的进化优化平台，能够通过语义感知的遗传操作联合优化代理配置，显著提升LLM代理的性能，适用于商业和本地模型。

Abstract: Agentic AI systems built on large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential for automating complex workflows, from software development to customer support. However, LLM agents often underperform due to suboptimal configurations; poorly tuned prompts, tool descriptions, and parameters that typically require weeks of manual refinement. Existing optimization methods either are too complex for general use or treat components in isolation, missing critical interdependencies.
  We present ARTEMIS, a no-code evolutionary optimization platform that jointly optimizes agent configurations through semantically-aware genetic operators. Given only a benchmark script and natural language goals, ARTEMIS automatically discovers configurable components, extracts performance signals from execution logs, and evolves configurations without requiring architectural modifications.
  We evaluate ARTEMIS on four representative agent systems: the \emph{ALE Agent} for competitive programming on AtCoder Heuristic Contest, achieving a \textbf{$13.6\%$ improvement} in acceptance rate; the \emph{Mini-SWE Agent} for code optimization on SWE-Perf, with a statistically significant \textbf{10.1\% performance gain}; and the \emph{CrewAI Agent} for cost and mathematical reasoning on Math Odyssey, achieving a statistically significant \textbf{$36.9\%$ reduction} in the number of tokens required for evaluation. We also evaluate the \emph{MathTales-Teacher Agent} powered by a smaller open-source model (Qwen2.5-7B) on GSM8K primary-level mathematics problems, achieving a \textbf{22\% accuracy improvement} and demonstrating that ARTEMIS can optimize agents based on both commercial and local models.

TL;DR: TritonForge是一个自动化Triton内核优化的框架，通过分析、分析和迭代转换提升性能，平均提升1.76倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高性能GPU内核优化是现代机器学习工作负载中的关键但劳动密集型任务，TritonForge旨在通过自动化优化流程降低开发者的专业门槛。

Method: TritonForge整合了内核分析、运行时分析和迭代代码转换，利用LLM辅助代码推理和转换，但框架本身是模型无关的。

Result: 在多种内核类型和GPU架构上，TritonForge实现了最高5倍的性能提升，平均成功率为1.76倍。

Conclusion: TritonForge为自动化GPU内核优化提供了一个模块化且模型无关的框架，通过数据驱动的分析和迭代代码转换，显著提升了性能，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: High-performance GPU kernel optimization remains a critical yet labor-intensive task in modern machine learning workloads. Although Triton, a domain-specific language for GPU programming, enables developers to write efficient kernels with concise code, achieving expert-level performance still requires deep understanding of GPU architectures and low-level performance trade-offs. We present TritonForge, a profiling-guided framework for automated Triton kernel optimization. TritonForge integrates kernel analysis, runtime profiling, and iterative code transformation to streamline the optimization process. By incorporating data-driven feedback from profiling results, the system identifies performance bottlenecks, proposes targeted code modifications, and evaluates their impact automatically. While our prototype leverages large language models (LLMs) to assist in code reasoning and transformation, the framework remains modular and model-agnostic. Across diverse kernel types and GPU architectures, TritonForge achieves up to 5x performance improvement over baseline implementations and on average 1.76x of the cases are successful, providing a foundation for future research in automated GPU performance optimization.

TL;DR: 提出两阶段缺陷优先级变更预测方法，通过实验验证其有效性，发现模型在不同项目和优先级上表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺陷优先级的手动评估过程繁琐且依赖主观判断，容易导致错误的优先级变更，从而阻碍缺陷的及时修复。目前缺乏关于缺陷优先级变更预测的研究。

Method: 提出了一种基于缺陷修复演化特征和类别不平衡处理策略的两阶段缺陷报告优先级变更预测方法，将缺陷生命周期分为缺陷报告和缺陷修复两个阶段，并为每个阶段构建了预测模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的缺陷修复演化特征和类别不平衡处理策略能有效提升预测模型的性能。缺陷报告阶段预测模型的F1-score达到0.798，缺陷修复阶段预测模型的F1-weighted和F1-macro分别为0.712和0.613。

Conclusion: 研究发现，尽管模型在不同项目间的表现差异较大，但整体得分仍然不错。同时，模型在不同优先级上的预测性能保持相对一致的高水平。

Abstract: Bug fixing is a critical activity in the software development process. In issue tracking systems such as JIRA, each bug report is assigned a priority level to indicate the urgency and importance level of the bug. The priority may change during the bug fixing process, indicating that the urgency and importance level of the bug will change with the bug fixing. However, manually evaluating priority changes for bugs is a tedious process that heavily relies on the subjective judgment of developers and project managers, leading to incorrect priority changes and thus hindering timely bug fixes. Given the lack of research on bug priority change prediction, we propose a novel two-phase bug report priority change prediction method based on bug fixing evolution features and class imbalance handling strategy. Specifically, we divided the bug lifecycle into two phases: bug reporting and bug fixing, and constructed bug priority change prediction models for each phase. To evaluate the performance of our method, we conducted experiments on a bug dataset constructed from 32 non-trivial Apache projects. The experimental results show that our proposed bug fixing evolution features and the adopted class imbalance handling strategy can effectively improve the performance of prediction models. The F1-score of the prediction model constructed for the bug reporting phase reached 0.798, while the F1-weighted and F1-macro of the prediction model constructed for the bug fixing phase were 0.712 and 0.613, respectively. Furthermore, we explored the cross-project applicability of our prediction models and their performance at different priority levels. The findings indicate large variations in model performance across different projects, although the overall scores remain decent. Meanwhile, the predictive performance across various priority levels remained relatively consistently high.

TL;DR: 研究发现，当前基于LLM设计的代理框架在搭配SLM时效率低下，能源浪费严重。框架架构是能耗主因，但SLM的有限推理能力导致能源无效消耗。未来需转向主动管理SLM弱点的架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM为基础的自主代理在软件工程中依赖大型专有模型，限制了本地部署。这引发了对小型语言模型（SLM）的兴趣，但其在复杂代理框架中的实际效果和效率尚不明确。

Method: 我们在固定硬件上对四种领先的自主代理框架（SWE-Agent、OpenHands、Mini SWE Agent、AutoCodeRover）使用两种SLM（Gemma-3 4B、Qwen-3 1.7B）进行了控制性评估，测量了每种配置下150次运行的能源、持续时间、令牌使用和内存消耗。

Result: 研究发现，框架架构是能源消耗的主要驱动因素。最耗能的框架AutoCodeRover（Gemma）平均能耗是最节能框架OpenHands（Gemma）的9.4倍，但这些能源大多被浪费。任务解决率接近零，表明当前框架与SLM搭配时，大量能源被用于无效的推理循环。SLM的有限推理能力是成功的主要瓶颈，而框架设计则是效率的瓶颈。

Conclusion: 当前基于大型语言模型（LLM）设计的自主代理框架在搭配小型语言模型（SLM）时效率低下。研究发现，框架架构是能源消耗的主要驱动因素，但由于SLM的有限推理能力，这些能源大多被浪费。可行的低能耗解决方案需要从被动编排转向主动管理SLM弱点的架构。

Abstract: Context. LLM-based autonomous agents in software engineering rely on large, proprietary models, limiting local deployment. This has spurred interest in Small Language Models (SLMs), but their practical effectiveness and efficiency within complex agentic frameworks for automated issue resolution remain poorly understood.
  Goal. We investigate the performance, energy efficiency, and resource consumption of four leading agentic issue resolution frameworks when deliberately constrained to using SLMs. We aim to assess the viability of these systems for this task in resource-limited settings and characterize the resulting trade-offs.
  Method. We conduct a controlled evaluation of four leading agentic frameworks (SWE-Agent, OpenHands, Mini SWE Agent, AutoCodeRover) using two SLMs (Gemma-3 4B, Qwen-3 1.7B) on the SWE-bench Verified Mini benchmark. On fixed hardware, we measure energy, duration, token usage, and memory over 150 runs per configuration.
  Results. We find that framework architecture is the primary driver of energy consumption. The most energy-intensive framework, AutoCodeRover (Gemma), consumed 9.4x more energy on average than the least energy-intensive, OpenHands (Gemma). However, this energy is largely wasted. Task resolution rates were near-zero, demonstrating that current frameworks, when paired with SLMs, consume significant energy on unproductive reasoning loops. The SLM's limited reasoning was the bottleneck for success, but the framework's design was the bottleneck for efficiency.
  Conclusions. Current agentic frameworks, designed for powerful LLMs, fail to operate efficiently with SLMs. We find that framework architecture is the primary driver of energy consumption, but this energy is largely wasted due to the SLMs' limited reasoning. Viable low-energy solutions require shifting from passive orchestration to architectures that actively manage SLM weaknesses.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新颖的可解释工作流分析方法，通过将挖掘的工作流转化为逻辑规范并利用自动定理证明器分析属性，结合Shapley值量化工作流元素的贡献。实验证明该方法能识别关键节点、揭示冗余并暴露有害结构，对软件工程实践有直接应用价值。

Abstract: Workflow mining discovers hierarchical process trees from event logs, but it remains unclear why such models satisfy or violate logical properties, or how individual elements contribute to overall behavior. We propose to translate mined workflows into logical specifications and analyze properties such as satisfiability, liveness, and safety with automated theorem provers. On this basis, we adapt Shapley values from cooperative game theory to attribute outcomes to workflow elements and quantify their contributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that this combination identifies critical nodes, reveals redundancies, and exposes harmful structures. This outlines a novel direction for explainable workflow analysis with direct relevance to software engineering practice, supporting compliance checks, process optimization, redundancy reduction, and the design of next-generation process mining tools.

Abstract: System engineering has been shifting from document-centric to model-based approaches, where assets are becoming more and more digital. Although digitisation conveys several benefits, it also brings several concerns (e.g., storage and access) and opportunities. In the context of Cyber- Physical Systems (CPS), we have experts from various domains executing complex workflows and manipulating models in a plethora of different formalisms, each with their own methods, techniques and tools. Storing knowledge on these workflows can reduce considerable effort during system development not only to allow their repeatability and replicability but also to access and reason on data generated by their execution. In this work, we propose a framework to manage modelling artefacts generated from workflow executions. The basic workflow concepts, related formalisms and artefacts are formally defined in an ontology specified in OML (Ontology Modelling Language). This ontology enables the construction of a knowledge graph that contains system engineering data to which we can apply reasoning. We also developed several tools to support system engineering during the design of workflows, their enactment, and artefact storage, considering versioning, querying and reasoning on the stored data. These tools also hide the complexity of manipulating the knowledge graph directly. Finally, we have applied our proposed framework in a real-world system development scenario of a drivetrain smart sensor system. Results show that our proposal not only helped the system engineer with fundamental difficulties like storage and versioning but also reduced the time needed to access relevant information and new knowledge that can be inferred from the knowledge graph.

Conclusion: LogICL框架通过将大型语言模型的推理能力蒸馏到轻量级编码器中，成功解决了跨域日志异常检测中的语义鸿沟问题，实现了快速部署和高性能检测。

Abstract: Effective log anomaly detection is critical to sustaining reliability in large-scale IT infrastructures. Transformer-based models require substantial resources and labeled data, exacerbating the cold-start problem in target domains where logs are scarce. Existing cross-domain methods leverage source logs but struggle with generalization due to reliance on surface lexical similarity, failing to capture latent semantic equivalence amid structural divergences. To address this, we propose LogICL, a framework distilling Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning into a lightweight encoder for cross-domain anomaly detection. During training, LogICL constructs a delta matrix measuring the utility of demonstrations selected via Maximal Marginal Relevance relative to zero-shot inference. The encoder is optimized via a multi-objective loss comprising an ICL-Guided term that aligns representations based on reasoning assistance utility, maximum mean discrepancy for domain alignment, and supervised contrastive loss. At inference, the optimized encoder retrieves reasoning-aware demonstrations using semantic similarity and delta scores, enabling frozen-LLM in-context learning with Chain-of-Thought for accurate and interpretable detection. Experiments on few-shot and zero-shot cross-domain benchmarks confirm LogICL achieves state-of-the-art performance across heterogeneous systems. Further analysis via visualizations and case studies confirms LogICL bridges the semantic gap beyond surface lexical similarity, effectively capturing latent semantic equivalence for rapid deployment.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在代码生成中表现优异，但 Chain-of-Thought (CoT) 提示的作用机制尚不明确，因此需要系统性研究其有效性。

Method: 通过系统实证和信息论研究，评估了五种 CoT 范式（Zero-Shot、Zero-Shot CoT、Self-Planning、Structured CoT、Reasoning-CoT）在六个 Python 基准、一个多语言基准（12 种编程语言）和六种模型（7B 到 480B 参数）上的表现，使用条件互信息 $I(Y;C|X)$ 作为分析工具。

Conclusion: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) 提示在代码生成中表现优异，但效果取决于模型能力、语言类型系统和任务复杂度。高质量的结构化 CoT 能显著提升准确性，而简单的 Zero-Shot CoT 可能适得其反。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on code generation, but the mechanisms by which Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps remain unclear. We present a systematic empirical and information-theoretic study of CoT effectiveness in neural code generation, evaluating five paradigms (Zero-Shot, Zero-Shot CoT, Self-Planning, Structured CoT, Reasoning-CoT) across six Python benchmarks, a multilingual benchmark with 12 programming languages, and six models from 7B to 480B parameters, using conditional mutual information $I(Y;C|X)$ as a conceptual lens. Our results show that externally guided CoT consistently outperforms direct generation, with structured methods improving Pass@1 by 5--12\% on average while using substantially fewer tokens than reflective reasoning, and that CoT benefits depend on language type systems and model capacity. We further find that reasoning \emph{quality} is critical: high-quality structured CoT from strong generators yields significantly higher accuracy than lightweight alternatives with the same template, whereas naive Zero-Shot CoT can even degrade performance. These findings provide practical guidance for choosing CoT strategies based on model capacity, language characteristics, and task complexity.

Abstract: The recent convergence of pervasive computing and machine learning has given rise to numerous services, impacting almost all areas of economic and social activity. However, the use of AI techniques precludes certain standard software development practices, which emphasize rigorous testing to ensure the elimination of all bugs and adherence to well-defined specifications. ML models are trained on numerous high-dimensional examples rather than being manually coded. Consequently, the boundaries of their operating range are uncertain, and they cannot guarantee absolute error-free performance. In this paper, we propose to quantify uncertainty in ML-based systems. To achieve this, we propose to adapt and jointly utilize a set of selected techniques to evaluate the relevance of model predictions at runtime. We apply and evaluate these proposals in the highly heterogeneous and evolving domain of Human Activity Recognition (HAR). The results presented demonstrate the relevance of the approach, and we discuss in detail the assistance provided to domain experts.
