Our approach combines two key contributions: a novel primitive, termed SuperFrustum, and an iterative fiting algorithm, Residual Primitive Fitting (ResFit). SuperFrustum is an analytical primitive that is simultaneously (1) expressive, being able to model various common solids such as cylinders, spheres, cones & their tapered and bent forms, (2) editable, being compactly parameterized with 8 parameters, and (3) optimizable, with a sign distance field differentiable w.r.t. its parameters almost everywhere. ResFit is an unsupervised procedure that interleaves global shape analysis with local optimization, iteratively fitting primitives to the unexplained residual of a shape to discover a parsimonious yet accurate decompositions for each input shape. On diverse 3D benchmarks, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving IoU by over 9 points while using nearly half as many primitives as prior work. The resulting assemblies bridge the gap between dense 3D data and human-controllable design, producing high-fidelity and editable shape programs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSuperFrustum\u57fa\u5143\u548cResFit\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u76843D\u5f62\u72b6\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b33D\u5f62\u72b6\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4e14\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u65b0\u578b\u57fa\u5143SuperFrustum\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u62df\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5ResFit\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u5f62\u72b6\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u4f18\u5316\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u7b80\u6d01\u5206\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u76843D\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cIoU\u63d0\u5347\u4e869\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u57fa\u5143\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd1\u4e00\u534a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7SuperFrustum\u548cResFit\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4e14\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u76843D\u5f62\u72b6\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86IoU\u6307\u6807\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6240\u9700\u57fa\u5143\u6570\u91cf\u3002"}}

WonderZoom addresses this through two key innovations: (1) scale-adaptive Gaussian surfels for generating and real-time rendering of multi-scale 3D scenes, and (2) a progressive detail synthesizer that iteratively generates finer-scale 3D contents. Our approach enables users to \"zoom into\" a 3D region and auto-regressively synthesize previously non-existent fine details from landscapes to microscopic features.

The automation of the source code vulnerability detection (CVD) process has thus become essential, and several methods have been proposed ranging from the well established program analysis techniques to the more recent AI-based methods. Our research investigates Large Language Models (LLMs), which are considered among the most performant AI models to date, for the CVD task. The objective is to study their performance and apply different state-of-the-art techniques to enhance their effectiveness for this task. We explore various fine-tuning and prompt engineering settings. We particularly suggest one novel approach for fine-tuning LLMs which we call Double Fine-tuning, and also test the understudied Test-Time fine-tuning approach. We leverage the recent open-source Llama-3.1 8B, with source code samples extracted from BigVul and PrimeVul datasets. Our conclusions highlight the importance of fine-tuning to resolve the task, the performance of Double tuning, as well as the potential of Llama models for CVD. Though prompting proved ineffective, Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) performed relatively well as an example selection technique.

Our analysis reveals that balancing the number of tokens processed per GPU increases the number of activated experts, exacerbating memory pressure in the memory-bound regime.\n  We propose Minimum Expert Token ROuting, a novel token-routing algorithm for high-performance expert-parallel MoE serving in the memory-bound regime that balances the number of activated experts per GPU rather than token counts. METRO achieves near-optimal routing quality with minimal computational overhead by jointly optimizing algorithmic efficiency and leveraging the GPU's parallel processing power. To guarantee routing quality, METRO also employs a novel allGather scheme to gather global top-k knowledge, which has minimal overhead compared to conventional allToAll. Our evaluation of METRO against EPLB on both real systems (vLLM over 8 A100 GPUs) and a proprietary simulator (8-16 B200 GPUs) shows that METRO reduces decode latency by 11 - 22%, and total token throughput by 3 - 21% for Qwen3 and DeepSeek-V3 serving, where prefill and decode phases are co-deployed. In addition, by trading latency headroom for throughput, METRO improves decode throughput by up to 4.11x over EPLB at a fixed decode SLO.", "AI": {"tldr": "METRO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u4ee4\u724c\u8def\u7531\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u8861\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u91cf\u800c\u975e\u4ee4\u724c\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5185\u5b58\u53d7\u9650MoE\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e76\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5185\u5b58\u53d7\u9650\u7684MoE\u670d\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u8861\u6bcf\u4e2aGPU\u5904\u7406\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u6570\u91cf\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0d\u5747\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u53cd\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4ee4\u724c\u6570\u91cf\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u52a0\u5267\u5185\u5b58\u538b\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMinimum Expert Token ROuting (METRO)\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u4ee4\u724c\u8def\u7531\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5229\u7528GPU\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u8def\u7531\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cMETRO\u8fd8\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u65b0\u9896\u7684allGather\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u6536\u96c6\u5168\u5c40top-k\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "METRO\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08vLLM over 8 A100 GPUs\uff09\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff088-16 B200 GPUs\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0eEPLB\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8611-22%\uff0c\u603b\u4ee4\u724c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863-21%\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u727a\u7272\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f59\u91cf\u6362\u53d6\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0cMETRO\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u89e3\u7801SLO\u4e0b\u5c06\u89e3\u7801\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe4.11\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "METRO\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u8861\u6bcf\u4e2aGPU\u4e0a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u91cf\u800c\u975e\u4ee4\u724c\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e76\u884cMoE\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u89e3\u7801\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002"}}

However, compatibility extends further than just the ISA; modern programs often cannot run or even compile without an operating system and libc. zkVMs attempt to address this by maintaining forks of language-specific runtimes and statically linking them into applications to create self-contained unikernels, but this ad-hoc approach leads to version hell and burdens verifiable applications (vApps) with an unnecessarily large trusted computing base. We solve this problem with ZeroOS, a modular library operating system (libOS) for vApp unikernels; vApp developers can use off-the-shelf toolchains to compile and link only the exact subset of the Linux ABI their vApp needs. Any zkVM team can easily leverage the ZeroOS ecosystem by writing a ZeroOS bootloader for their platform, resulting in a reduced maintainence burden and unifying the entire zkVM ecosystem with consolidated development and audit resources.

A significant technical challenge in beam hopping is the computation of effective illumination patterns. Traditional algorithms, like the genetic algorithm, require over 300 seconds to compute a single illumination pattern for just 37 cells, whereas modern HTS typically covers over 300 cells, rendering current methods impractical for real-world applications. Advanced approaches, such as multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, face convergence issues when the number of cells exceeds 40. In this paper, we introduce Tyche, a hybrid computation framework designed to address this challenge. Tyche incorporates a Monte Carlo Tree Search Beam Hopping (MCTS-BH) algorithm for computing illumination patterns and employs sliding window and pruning techniques to significantly reduce computation time. Specifically, MCTS-BH can compute one illumination pattern for 37 cells in just 12 seconds. To ensure real-time computation, we use a Greedy Beam Hopping (G-BH) algorithm, which provides a provisional solution while MCTS-BH completes its computation in the background.

We present ShelfAware, a semantic particle filter for robust global localization that treats scene semantics as statistical evidence over object categories rather than fixed landmarks. ShelfAware fuses a depth likelihood with a category-centric semantic similarity and uses a precomputed bank of semantic viewpoints to perform inverse semantic proposals inside MCL, yielding fast, targeted hypothesis generation on low-cost, vision-only hardware. Across 100 global-localization trials spanning four conditions (cart-mounted, wearable, dynamic obstacles, and sparse semantics) in a semantically dense, retail environment, ShelfAware achieves a 96% success rate (vs. 22% MCL and 10% AMCL) with a mean time-to-convergence of 1.91s, attains the lowest translational RMSE in all conditions, and maintains stable tracking in 80% of tested sequences, all while running in real time on a consumer laptop-class platform. By modeling semantics distributionally at the category level and leveraging inverse proposals, ShelfAware resolves geometric aliasing and semantic drift common to quasi-static domains. Because the method requires only vision sensors and VIO, it integrates as an infrastructure-free building block for mobile robots in warehouses, labs, and retail settings; as a representative application, it also supports the creation of assistive devices providing start-anytime, shared-control assistive navigation for people with visual impairments.", "AI": {"tldr": "ShelfAware\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u4e49\u7c92\u5b50\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c7b\u522b\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u9006\u5411\u63d0\u8bae\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u9759\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u89c6\u969c\u8f85\u52a9\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u5ba4\u5185\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u662f\u51c6\u9759\u6001\u7684\uff1a\u5168\u5c40\u5e03\u5c40\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f46\u5c40\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u590d\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u6742\u4e71\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7834\u574f\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002ShelfAware\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "ShelfAware\u91c7\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u7c92\u5b50\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f3c\u7136\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u89c6\u70b9\u5e93\u5728\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff08MCL\uff09\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u9006\u5411\u8bed\u4e49\u63d0\u8bae\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u76ee\u6807\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u96f6\u552e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cShelfAware\u5728\u56db\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u63a8\u8f66\u5b89\u88c5\u3001\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u969c\u788d\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u8bed\u4e49\uff09\u7684100\u6b21\u5168\u5c40\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe\u523096%\uff08MCL\u4e3a22%\uff0cAMCL\u4e3a10%\uff09\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6536\u655b\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a1.91\u79d2\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5e73\u79fbRMSE\u6700\u4f4e\uff0c\u5e76\u572880%\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fd0\u884c\u4e8e\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7535\u8111\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "conclusion": "ShelfAware\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u573a\u666f\u8bed\u4e49\u89c6\u4e3a\u5bf9\u8c61\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bc1\u636e\u800c\u975e\u56fa\u5b9a\u5730\u6807\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u51c6\u9759\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6df7\u6dc6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9700\u89c6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u60ef\u6027\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\uff08VIO\uff09\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4ed3\u5e93\u3001\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u548c\u96f6\u552e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4e3a\u89c6\u969c\u4eba\u58eb\u63d0\u4f9b\u5373\u65f6\u542f\u52a8\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u63a7\u5236\u8f85\u52a9\u5bfc\u822a\u3002"}}

Submitted to STOC 2026", "summary": "We develop new $(1+\u03b5)$-approximation algorithms for finding the global minimum edge-cut in a directed edge-weighted graph, and for finding the global minimum vertex-cut in a directed vertex-weighted graph. Our algorithms are randomized, and have a running time of $O\\left(m^{1+o(1)}/\u03b5\\right)$ on any $m$-edge $n$-vertex input graph, assuming all edge/vertex weights are polynomially-bounded. In particular, for any constant $\u03b5>0$, our algorithms have an almost-optimal running time of $O\\left(m^{1+o(1)}\\right)$. The fastest previously-known running time for this setting, due to (Cen et al., FOCS 2021), is $\\tilde{O}\\left(\\min\\left\\{n^2/\u03b5^2,m^{1+o(1)}\\sqrt{n}\\right\\}\\right)$ for Minimum Edge-Cut, and $\\tilde{O}\\left(n^2/\u03b5^2\\right)$ for Minimum Vertex-Cut. Our results further extend to the rooted variants of the Minimum Edge-Cut and Minimum Vertex-Cut problems, where the algorithm is additionally given a root vertex $r$, and the goal is to find a minimum-weight cut separating any vertex from the root $r$. In terms of techniques, we build upon and extend a framework that was recently introduced by (Chuzhoy et al., SODA 2026) for solving the Minimum Vertex-Cut problem in unweighted directed graphs. Additionally, in order to obtain our result for the Global Minimum Vertex-Cut problem, we develop a novel black-box reduction from this problem to its rooted variant.

This paper investigates how such hallucinations influence users' trust in LLMs and users' interaction with LLMs. To explore this in everyday use, we conducted a qualitative study with 192 participants. Our findings show that hallucinations do not result in blanket mistrust but instead lead to context-sensitive trust calibration. Building on the calibrated trust model by Lee & See [2] and Afroogh et al.'s trust-related factors [3], we confirm expectancy [3], [4], prior experience [3], [4], [5], and user expertise & domain knowledge [3], [4] as userrelated (human) trust factors, and identify intuition as an additional factor relevant for hallucination detection. Additionally, we found that trust dynamics are further influenced by contextual factors, particularly perceived risk [3] and decision stakes [6]. Consequently, we validate the recursive trust calibration process proposed by Bl\u00f6baum [7] and extend it by including intuition as a user-related trust factor.

Given only a benchmark script and natural language goals, ARTEMIS automatically discovers configurable components, extracts performance signals from execution logs, and evolves configurations without requiring architectural modifications.\n  We evaluate ARTEMIS on four representative agent systems: the \\emph{ALE Agent} for competitive programming on AtCoder Heuristic Contest, achieving a \\textbf{$13.6\\%$ improvement} in acceptance rate; the \\emph{Mini-SWE Agent} for code optimization on SWE-Perf, with a statistically significant \\textbf{10.1\\% performance gain}; and the \\emph{CrewAI Agent} for cost and mathematical reasoning on Math Odyssey, achieving a statistically significant \\textbf{$36.9\\%$ reduction} in the number of tokens required for evaluation. We also evaluate the \\emph{MathTales-Teacher Agent} powered by a smaller open-source model (Qwen2.5-7B) on GSM8K primary-level mathematics problems, achieving a \\textbf{22\\% accuracy improvement} and demonstrating that ARTEMIS can optimize agents based on both commercial and local models.", "AI": {"tldr": "ARTEMIS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u9057\u4f20\u64cd\u4f5c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u8fc7\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5b64\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "ARTEMIS\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9057\u4f20\u64cd\u4f5c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ece\u6267\u884c\u65e5\u5fd7\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6027\u80fd\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u5316\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cARTEMIS\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff1aALE Agent\u7684\u63a5\u53d7\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8613.6%\uff0cMini-SWE Agent\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e8610.1%\uff0cCrewAI Agent\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8636.9%\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee4\u724c\u6570\uff0cMathTales-Teacher Agent\u5728GSM8K\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8622%\u3002", "conclusion": "ARTEMIS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9057\u4f20\u64cd\u4f5c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5546\u4e1a\u548c\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

However, these tools have high computational requirements that exceed the capabilities of resource-constrained mobile and wearable devices. While offloading visual data to the cloud is a common solution, it introduces significant privacy vulnerabilities during transmission and server-side computation. To address this, we propose a novel distributed, hierarchical offloading framework for Vision Transformers (ViTs) that addresses these privacy challenges by design. Our approach uses a local trusted edge device, such as a mobile phone or an Nvidia Jetson, as the edge orchestrator. This orchestrator partitions the user's visual data into smaller portions and distributes them across multiple independent cloud servers. By design, no single external server possesses the complete image, preventing comprehensive data reconstruction. The final data merging and aggregation computation occurs exclusively on the user's trusted edge device. We apply our framework to the Segment Anything Model (SAM) as a practical case study, which demonstrates that our method substantially enhances content privacy over traditional cloud-based approaches. Evaluations show our framework maintains near-baseline segmentation performance while substantially reducing the risk of content reconstruction and user data exposure. Our framework provides a scalable, privacy-preserving solution for vision tasks in the edge-cloud continuum.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u5378\u8f7d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fb9\u7f18\u534f\u8c03\u5668\u5206\u5272\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u5206\u53d1\u5230\u591a\u4e2a\u4e91\u670d\u52a1\u5668\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u5b8c\u6574\u56fe\u50cf\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u5728SAM\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u667a\u80fd\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u8d85\u51fa\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4e91\u5378\u8f7d\u65b9\u6848\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u3001\u5206\u5c42\u5378\u8f7d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u672c\u5730\u53ef\u4fe1\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\uff08\u5982\u624b\u673a\u6216Nvidia Jetson\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u534f\u8c03\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5272\u5e76\u5206\u53d1\u5230\u591a\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u4e91\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0a\u3002", "result": "\u5728Segment Anything Model (SAM)\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5185\u5bb9\u9690\u79c1\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18-\u4e91\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In these hierarchical satellite networks, controllers manage satellite switches within their assigned domains. However, the high mobility of LEO satellites and field-of-view (FOV) constraints pose fundamental challenges to efficient domain partitioning. Centralized control approaches face scalability bottlenecks, while distributed architectures with onboard controllers often disregard FOV limitations, leading to excessive signaling overhead. LEO satellites outside a controller's FOV require an average of five additional hops, resulting in a 10.6-fold increase in response time. To address these challenges, we propose Eunomia, a three-step domain-partitioning framework that leverages movement-aware FOV segmentation within a hybrid control plane combining ground stations and MEO satellites. Eunomia reduces control plane latency by constraining domains to FOV-aware regions and ensures single-hop signaling. It further balances traffic load through spectral clustering on a Control Overhead Relationship Graph and optimizes controller assignment via the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm. We implement Eunomia on the Plotinus emulation platform with realistic constellation parameters.

A key advantage is the algorithm's ability to process many updates simultaneously, which makes it naturally adaptable to the parallel and distributed models. Concretely, it gives a unified framework across the models, leading to the following results:\n  - In the sequential setting, the algorithm processes each update in $O(1)$ expected time, worst-case. This matches and strengthens the results of Henzinger and Peng [TALG 2022] and Bhattacharya et al. [TALG 2022], who achieved an $O(1)$ bound but amortized (in expectation and with high probability, respectively), whose work was an improvement of the $O(\\log \u0394)$ expected amortized bound of Bhattacharya et al. [SODA'18].\n  - In the parallel setting, the algorithm processes each (arbitrary size) batch of updates using $O(1)$ work per update in the batch in expectation, and in $\\text{poly}(\\log n)$ depth with high probability. This is, in a sense, an ideal parallelization of the above results.\n  - In the distributed setting, the algorithm can maintain a coloring of the network graph as (potentially many) edges are added or deleted. The maintained coloring is always proper; it may become partial upon updates, i.e., some nodes may temporarily lose their colors, but quickly converges to a full, proper coloring. Concretely, each insertion and deletion causes at most $O(1)$ nodes to become uncolored, but this is resolved within $O(\\log n)$ rounds with high probability (e.g., in the absence of further updates nearby--the precise guarantee is stronger, but technical).

First, organizations struggle with inadequate risk assessment at the use case level, exemplified by the Humana class action lawsuit and other high impact cases where an AI system deployed to production exhibited both significant bias and high error rates, resulting in improper healthcare claim denials. Each AI use case presents unique risk profiles requiring tailored governance, yet most frameworks provide one size fits all guidance. Second, existing frameworks like ISO 42001 and NIST AI RMF remain at high conceptual levels, offering principles without actionable controls, leaving practitioners unable to translate governance requirements into specific technical implementations. Third, organizations lack mechanisms for operationalizing governance at scale, with no systematic approach to embed trustworthy AI practices throughout the development lifecycle, measure compliance quantitatively, or provide role-appropriate visibility from boards to data scientists.

To address this, we propose IMAgent, an open-source vision agent trained via end-to-end reinforcement learning dedicated for complex multi-image tasks. By leveraging a multi-agent system, we generate challenging and visually-rich multi-image QA pairs to fully activate the tool-use potential of the base VLM. Through manual verification, we obtain MIFG-QA, comprising 10k samples for training and evaluation. With deeper reasoning steps, VLMs may increasingly ignore visual inputs. We therefore develop two specialized tools for visual reflection and confirmation, allowing the model to proactively reallocate its attention to image content during inference. Benefiting from our well-designed action-trajectory two-level mask strategy, IMAgent achieves stable tool use behavior via pure RL training without requiring costly supervised fine-tuning data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMAgent maintains strong performance on existing single-image benchmarks while achieving substantial improvements on our proposed multi-image dataset, with our analysis providing actionable insights for the research community.

As datasets scale to billions of vectors, disk-based vector search has emerged as a practical solution. However, looking to the future, we need to anticipate datasets too large for any single server. We present BatANN, a distributed disk-based approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) system that retains the logarithmic search efficiency of a single global graph while achieving near-linear throughput scaling in the number of servers. Our core innovation is that when accessing a neighborhood which is stored on another machine, we send the full state of the query to the other machine to continue executing there for improved locality.

With globally coherent prediction and robust adaptive execution capabilities, MGP-Long enables reliable control on complex and non-Markovian tasks that prior methods struggle with. Extensive evaluations on 150 robotic manipulation tasks spanning the Meta-World and LIBERO benchmarks show that MGP achieves both rapid inference and superior success rates compared to state-of-the-art diffusion and autoregressive policies. Specifically, MGP increases the average success rate by 9% across 150 tasks while cutting per-sequence inference time by up to 35x.

This bias is extremely critical in large multicultural cities, especially where biometrics play a major role in smart city infrastructure. The entanglement can cause demographic attributes to overshadow identity cues in the embedding space, resulting in disparities in verification performance across different demographic groups. To address this issue, we propose a novel strategy, Unified Text-Image Embedding (UTIE), which aims to induce demographic ambiguity in face embeddings by enriching them with information related to other demographic groups. This encourages face embeddings to emphasize identity-relevant features and thus promotes fairer verification performance across groups. UTIE leverages the zero-shot capabilities and cross-modal semantic alignment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Given that VLMs are naturally trained to align visual and textual representations, we enrich the facial embeddings of each demographic group with text-derived demographic features extracted from other demographic groups.

In issue tracking systems such as JIRA, each bug report is assigned a priority level to indicate the urgency and importance level of the bug. The priority may change during the bug fixing process, indicating that the urgency and importance level of the bug will change with the bug fixing. However, manually evaluating priority changes for bugs is a tedious process that heavily relies on the subjective judgment of developers and project managers, leading to incorrect priority changes and thus hindering timely bug fixes. Given the lack of research on bug priority change prediction, we propose a novel two-phase bug report priority change prediction method based on bug fixing evolution features and class imbalance handling strategy. Specifically, we divided the bug lifecycle into two phases: bug reporting and bug fixing, and constructed bug priority change prediction models for each phase. To evaluate the performance of our method, we conducted experiments on a bug dataset constructed from 32 non-trivial Apache projects. The experimental results show that our proposed bug fixing evolution features and the adopted class imbalance handling strategy can effectively improve the performance of prediction models. The F1-score of the prediction model constructed for the bug reporting phase reached 0.798, while the F1-weighted and F1-macro of the prediction model constructed for the bug fixing phase were 0.712 and 0.613, respectively. Furthermore, we explored the cross-project applicability of our prediction models and their performance at different priority levels.

It is well established that performance factors such as the robot's competence and its reliability shape cognitive trust. Recent studies suggest that affective factors, such as robotic attentiveness, also play a role in building cognitive trust. This work explores the interplay between these two factors that shape cognitive trust. Specifically, we evaluated whether different combinations of robotic competence and attentiveness introduce a compensatory mechanism, where one factor compensates for the lack of the other. In the experiment, participants performed a search task with a robotic dog in a 2x2 experimental design that included two factors: competence (high or low) and attentiveness (high or low). The results revealed that high attentiveness can compensate for low competence. Participants who collaborated with a highly attentive robot that performed poorly reported trust levels comparable to those working with a highly competent robot. When the robot did not demonstrate attentiveness, low competence resulted in a substantial decrease in cognitive trust. The findings indicate that building cognitive trust in human-robot interaction may be more complex than previously believed, involving emotional processes that are typically overlooked.

We present \\textbf{Consist-Retinex}, the first framework adapting consistency modeling to Retinex-based low-light enhancement. Our key insight is that conditional enhancement requires fundamentally different training dynamics than unconditional generation standard consistency training focuses on low-noise regions near the data manifold, while conditional mapping critically depends on large-noise regimes that bridge degraded inputs to enhanced outputs. We introduce two core innovations: (1) a \\textbf{dual-objective consistency loss} combining temporal consistency with ground-truth alignment under randomized time sampling, providing full-spectrum supervision for stable convergence; and (2) an \\textbf{adaptive noise-emphasized sampling strategy} that prioritizes training on large-noise regions essential for one-step conditional generation.

This has spurred interest in Small Language Models (SLMs), but their practical effectiveness and efficiency within complex agentic frameworks for automated issue resolution remain poorly understood.\n  Goal. We investigate the performance, energy efficiency, and resource consumption of four leading agentic issue resolution frameworks when deliberately constrained to using SLMs. We aim to assess the viability of these systems for this task in resource-limited settings and characterize the resulting trade-offs.\n  Method. We conduct a controlled evaluation of four leading agentic frameworks (SWE-Agent, OpenHands, Mini SWE Agent, AutoCodeRover) using two SLMs (Gemma-3 4B, Qwen-3 1.7B) on the SWE-bench Verified Mini benchmark. On fixed hardware, we measure energy, duration, token usage, and memory over 150 runs per configuration.\n  Results. We find that framework architecture is the primary driver of energy consumption. The most energy-intensive framework, AutoCodeRover (Gemma), consumed 9.4x more energy on average than the least energy-intensive, OpenHands (Gemma). However, this energy is largely wasted. Task resolution rates were near-zero, demonstrating that current frameworks, when paired with SLMs, consume significant energy on unproductive reasoning loops. The SLM's limited reasoning was the bottleneck for success, but the framework's design was the bottleneck for efficiency.\n  Conclusions.

This paper examines image labeling performance across human participants and deep neural networks, focusing on low-resolution, perceptually degraded stimuli. Drawing from computational cognitive science, cognitive architectures, and connectionist-symbolic hybrid models, we contrast human strategies such as analogical reasoning, shape-based recognition, and confidence modulation with AI's feature-based processing. Grounded in Marr's tri-level hypothesis, Simon's bounded rationality, and Thagard's frameworks of representation and emotion, we analyze participant responses in relation to Grad-CAM visualizations of model attention. Human behavior is further interpreted through cognitive principles modeled in ACT-R and Soar, revealing layered and heuristic decision strategies under uncertainty. Our findings highlight key parallels and divergences between biological and artificial systems in representation, inference, and confidence calibration. The analysis motivates future neuro-symbolic architectures that unify structured symbolic reasoning with connectionist representations. Such architectures, informed by principles of embodiment, explainability, and cognitive alignment, offer a path toward AI systems that are not only performant but also interpretable and cognitively grounded.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eAI\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u89c6\u89c9\u523a\u6fc0\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u53cc\u65b9\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4fe1\u5fc3\u6821\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5f02\u540c\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u7cca\u89c6\u89c9\u523a\u6fc0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u8ba8\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u5229\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8fde\u63a5\u4e3b\u4e49-\u7b26\u53f7\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u7c7b\u6bd4\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u4fe1\u5fc3\u8c03\u8282\uff09\u4e0eAI\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5904\u7406\u3002\u901a\u8fc7Grad-CAM\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408ACT-R\u548cSoar\u7b49\u8ba4\u77e5\u539f\u5219\u5206\u6790\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eAI\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4fe1\u5fc3\u6821\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5f02\u540c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u51b3\u7b56\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u89c6\u89c9\u523a\u6fc0\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4fe1\u5fc3\u6821\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5f02\u540c\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8fde\u63a5\u4e3b\u4e49\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e2\u9ad8\u6548\u53c8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Recently, deep learning based Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) approaches have greatly improved recognition accuracy. However, their large model sizes and high computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. While model pruning offers a general solution for complexity reduction, existing weight, channel, and layer pruning techniques struggle to concurrently optimize compression rate, hardware acceleration, and recognition accuracy. To this end, in this paper, we introduce HSCP, a Hierarchical Spectral Clustering Pruning framework that combines layer pruning with channel pruning to achieve extreme compression, high performance, and efficient inference. In the first stage, HSCP employs spectral clustering guided by Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) to identify and remove redundant layers. Subsequently, the same strategy is applied to the channel dimension to eliminate a finer redundancy. To ensure robustness, we further employ a noise-robust fine-tuning strategy. Experiments on the UAV-M100 benchmark demonstrate that HSCP outperforms existing channel and layer pruning methods. Specifically, HSCP achieves $86.39\\%$ parameter reduction and $84.44\\%$ FLOPs reduction on ResNet18 while improving accuracy by $1.49\\%$ compared to the unpruned baseline, and maintains superior robustness even in low signal-to-noise ratio environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "HSCP\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u7ea7\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u526a\u679d\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5c04\u9891\u6307\u7eb9\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u548c\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u9760\u4fe1\u53f7\u7279\u5f81\u4e14\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60RFFI\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u3002", "method": "HSCP\u91c7\u7528\u5c42\u7ea7\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CKA\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u8fdb\u884c\u5197\u4f59\u5c42\u548c\u901a\u9053\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u786e\u4fdd\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728UAV-M100\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cHSCP\u5728ResNet18\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8686.39%\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\u548c84.44%FLOPs\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u53471.49%\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u8d8a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HSCP\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5c42\u7ea7\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u526a\u679d\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5c04\u9891\u6307\u7eb9\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

Although numerous scheduling solutions exist, they predominantly optimize singular or limited metrics such as execution time or resource utilization often neglecting the need for comprehensive multi-objective optimization. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes the Pareto-based Hybrid Whale-Seagull Optimization Algorithm (PHWSOA). This algorithm synergistically combines the strengths of the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and the Seagull Optimization Algorithm (SOA), specifically mitigating WOA's limitations in local exploitation and SOA's constraints in global exploration. Leveraging Pareto dominance principles, PHWSOA simultaneously optimizes three key objectives: makespan, virtual machine (VM) load balancing, and economic cost. Key enhancements include: Halton sequence initialization for superior population diversity, a Pareto-guided mutation mechanism to avert premature convergence, and parallel processing for accelerated convergence. Furthermore, a dynamic VM load redistribution mechanism is integrated to improve load balancing during task execution. Extensive experiments conducted on the CloudSim simulator, utilizing real-world workload traces from NASA-iPSC and HPC2N, demonstrate that PHWSOA delivers substantial performance gains. Specifically, it achieves up to a 72.1% reduction in makespan, a 36.8% improvement in VM load balancing, and 23.5% cost savings.

However, the high-dimensional configuration space, nonlinear dynamics, and frequent partial occlusions present fundamental barriers to robust real-time DLO tracking. To address these limitations, this study introduces UPETrack, a geometry-driven framework based on Unidirectional Position Estimation (UPE), which facilitates tracking without the requirement for physical modeling, virtual simulation, or visual markers. The framework operates in two phases: (1) visible segment tracking is based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) fitted via the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, and (2) occlusion region prediction employing UPE algorithm we proposed. UPE leverages the geometric continuity inherent in DLO shapes and their temporal evolution patterns to derive a closed-form positional estimator through three principal mechanisms: (i) local linear combination displacement term, (ii) proximal linear constraint term, and (iii) historical curvature term. This analytical formulation allows efficient and stable estimation of occluded nodes through explicit linear combinations of geometric components, eliminating the need for additional iterative optimization.

We define agentic systems as goal-directed, tool-using decision makers operating in closed loops, and show how reliability emerges from principled componentisation (goal manager, planner, tool-router, executor, memory, verifiers, safety monitor, telemetry), disciplined interfaces (schema-constrained, validated, least-privilege tool calls), and explicit control and assurance loops. Building on classical foundations, we propose a practical taxonomy-tool-using agents, memory-augmented agents, planning and self-improvement agents, multi-agent systems, and embodied or web agents - and analyse how each pattern reshapes the reliability envelope and failure modes. We distil design guidance on typed schemas, idempotency, permissioning, transactional semantics, memory provenance and hygiene, runtime governance (budgets, termination conditions), and simulate-before-actuate safeguards.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7ae0\u4ece\u67b6\u6784\u89d2\u5ea6\u63a2\u8ba8\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u63a5\u53e3\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u7c7b\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bf9\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u63d0\u70bc\u51fa\u5b9e\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u5357\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5176\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u95ed\u73af\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u76ee\u6807\u7ba1\u7406\u5668\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u8def\u7531\u5668\u7b49\uff09\u548c\u63a5\u53e3\u539f\u5219\uff08\u5982\u6a21\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u6700\u5c0f\u6743\u9650\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u5178\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u5357\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee3\u7406\u7b49\uff09\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff08\u5982\u7c7b\u578b\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u5e42\u7b49\u6027\u3001\u6743\u9650\u7ba1\u7406\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6bcf\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bf9\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7ae0\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e3b\u8981\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5176\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u63a5\u53e3\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u4fdd\u969c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Although digitisation conveys several benefits, it also brings several concerns (e.g., storage and access) and opportunities. In the context of Cyber- Physical Systems (CPS), we have experts from various domains executing complex workflows and manipulating models in a plethora of different formalisms, each with their own methods, techniques and tools. Storing knowledge on these workflows can reduce considerable effort during system development not only to allow their repeatability and replicability but also to access and reason on data generated by their execution. In this work, we propose a framework to manage modelling artefacts generated from workflow executions. The basic workflow concepts, related formalisms and artefacts are formally defined in an ontology specified in OML (Ontology Modelling Language). This ontology enables the construction of a knowledge graph that contains system engineering data to which we can apply reasoning. We also developed several tools to support system engineering during the design of workflows, their enactment, and artefact storage, considering versioning, querying and reasoning on the stored data. These tools also hide the complexity of manipulating the knowledge graph directly. Finally, we have applied our proposed framework in a real-world system development scenario of a drivetrain smart sensor system.

We present BiDemoSyn, a framework that synthesizes contact-rich, physically feasible bimanual demonstrations from a single real-world example. The key idea is to decompose tasks into invariant coordination blocks and variable, object-dependent adjustments, then adapt them through vision-guided alignment and lightweight trajectory optimization.

Transformer-based models require substantial resources and labeled data, exacerbating the cold-start problem in target domains where logs are scarce. Existing cross-domain methods leverage source logs but struggle with generalization due to reliance on surface lexical similarity, failing to capture latent semantic equivalence amid structural divergences. To address this, we propose LogICL, a framework distilling Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning into a lightweight encoder for cross-domain anomaly detection. During training, LogICL constructs a delta matrix measuring the utility of demonstrations selected via Maximal Marginal Relevance relative to zero-shot inference. The encoder is optimized via a multi-objective loss comprising an ICL-Guided term that aligns representations based on reasoning assistance utility, maximum mean discrepancy for domain alignment, and supervised contrastive loss. At inference, the optimized encoder retrieves reasoning-aware demonstrations using semantic similarity and delta scores, enabling frozen-LLM in-context learning with Chain-of-Thought for accurate and interpretable detection. Experiments on few-shot and zero-shot cross-domain benchmarks confirm LogICL achieves state-of-the-art performance across heterogeneous systems.

To fill this gap, we conducted comprehensive experiments and found that stragglers remain widespread due to CPU and bandwidth usage imbalances. Additionally, existing mitigation methods that switch from synchronous stochastic gradient descent (SSGD) to asynchronous SGD (ASGD) may not improve Time-To-Accuracy (TTA) and can even generate more stragglers due to its higher resource consumption. To address these newly found problems, we propose the Straggler Tolerant And Resilient DL training system (STAR). STAR includes new synchronization modes that group workers for each parameter updating. It has a heuristic and an ML method to choose the optimal synchronization mode for minimizing TTA, and reallocates resources to support the selected mode while minimizing the impact on co-located jobs.

While recent foundation models offer strong semantic reasoning, existing robotic task planners remain predominantly unimanual and fail to address the spatial, geometric, and coordination challenges inherent to bimanual manipulation in scene-agnostic settings. We present a unified framework for scene-agnostic bimanual task planning that bridges high-level reasoning with 3D-grounded two-handed execution. Our approach integrates three key modules. Visual Point Grounding (VPG) analyzes a single scene image to detect relevant objects and generate world-aligned interaction points. Bimanual Subgoal Planner (BSP) reasons over spatial adjacency and cross-object accessibility to produce compact, motion-neutralized subgoals that exploit opportunities for coordinated two-handed actions. Interaction-Point-Driven Bimanual Prompting (IPBP) binds these subgoals to a structured skill library, instantiating synchronized unimanual or bimanual action sequences that satisfy hand-state and affordance constraints. Together, these modules enable agents to plan semantically meaningful, physically feasible, and parallelizable two-handed behaviors in cluttered, previously unseen scenes. Experiments show that it produces coherent, feasible, and compact two-handed plans, and generalizes to cluttered scenes without retraining, demonstrating robust scene-agnostic affordance reasoning for bimanual tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u53cc\u81c2\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u70b9\u63a5\u5730\u3001\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u70b9\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u53cc\u81c2\u884c\u4e3a\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6742\u4e71\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u591a\u4e3a\u5355\u81c2\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u573a\u666f\u65e0\u5173\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u53cc\u81c2\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u6311\u6218\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e3D\u63a5\u5730\u7684\u53cc\u81c2\u6267\u884c\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u70b9\u63a5\u5730\uff08VPG\uff09\u3001\u53cc\u81c2\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u89c4\u5212\uff08BSP\uff09\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u70b9\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u53cc\u81c2\u63d0\u793a\uff08IPBP\uff09\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002VPG\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u76f8\u5173\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u4e16\u754c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u70b9\uff1bBSP\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u90bb\u63a5\u548c\u8de8\u5bf9\u8c61\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\uff1bIPBP\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6280\u80fd\u5e93\u7ed1\u5b9a\uff0c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u5355\u81c2\u6216\u53cc\u81c2\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u3001\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u53cc\u81c2\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u672a\u7ecf\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u6742\u4e71\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u573a\u666f\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u53cc\u81c2\u4efb\u52a1\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u573a\u666f\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u53cc\u81c2\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u70b9\u63a5\u5730\u3001\u53cc\u81c2\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u70b9\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u53cc\u81c2\u63d0\u793a\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u3001\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u53ef\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u7684\u53cc\u81c2\u884c\u4e3a\u89c4\u5212\u3002"}}

The validated domain and problem are then passed to an external planning engine to generate a plan. The orchestrator and agents are powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and require no human intervention at any stage of the process. Finally, a module translates the final plan back into natural language to improve human readability while maintaining the correctness of each step.

We present a systematic empirical and information-theoretic study of CoT effectiveness in neural code generation, evaluating five paradigms (Zero-Shot, Zero-Shot CoT, Self-Planning, Structured CoT, Reasoning-CoT) across six Python benchmarks, a multilingual benchmark with 12 programming languages, and six models from 7B to 480B parameters, using conditional mutual information $I(Y;C|X)$ as a conceptual lens. Our results show that externally guided CoT consistently outperforms direct generation, with structured methods improving Pass@1 by 5--12\\% on average while using substantially fewer tokens than reflective reasoning, and that CoT benefits depend on language type systems and model capacity. We further find that reasoning \\emph{quality} is critical: high-quality structured CoT from strong generators yields significantly higher accuracy than lightweight alternatives with the same template, whereas naive Zero-Shot CoT can even degrade performance. These findings provide practical guidance for choosing CoT strategies based on model capacity, language characteristics, and task complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u5316 CoT \u63d0\u793a\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf CoT \u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46 Chain-of-Thought (CoT) \u63d0\u793a\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u8bc1\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd CoT \u8303\u5f0f\uff08Zero-Shot\u3001Zero-Shot CoT\u3001Self-Planning\u3001Structured CoT\u3001Reasoning-CoT\uff09\u5728\u516d\u4e2a Python \u57fa\u51c6\u3001\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u51c6\uff0812 \u79cd\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\uff09\u548c\u516d\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff087B \u5230 480B \u53c2\u6570\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f $I(Y;C|X)$ \u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316 CoT \u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347 Pass@1 5-12%\uff0c\u4e14\u6bd4\u53cd\u601d\u63a8\u7406\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u7684 token\u3002CoT \u7684\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u8bed\u8a00\u7c7b\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316 CoT \u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) \u63d0\u793a\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u7c7b\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316 CoT \u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u7b80\u5355\u7684 Zero-Shot CoT \u53ef\u80fd\u9002\u5f97\u5176\u53cd\u3002"}}

In GPS-denied or cluttered urban environments, perception-based landing is vital for reliable operation. Unlike structured landing zones, real-world sites are unstructured and highly variable, requiring strong generalization capabilities from the perception system. Deep neural networks (DNNs) provide a scalable solution for learning landing site features across diverse visual and environmental conditions. While perception-driven landing has been shown in simulation, real-world deployment introduces significant challenges. Payload and volume constraints limit high-performance edge AI devices like the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, which are crucial for real-time detection and control. Accurate pose estimation during descent is necessary, especially in the absence of GPS, and relies on dependable visual-inertial odometry. Achieving this with limited edge AI resources requires careful optimization of the entire deployment framework. The flight characteristics of large QuadPlanes further complicate the problem. These aircraft exhibit high inertia, reduced thrust vectoring, and slow response times further complicate stable landing maneuvers. This work presents a lightweight QuadPlane system for efficient vision-based autonomous landing and visual-inertial odometry, specifically developed for long-range QuadPlane operations such as aerial monitoring. It describes the hardware platform, sensor configuration, and embedded computing architecture designed to meet demanding real-time, physical constraints.

However, in 3D domains, the design space grows exponentially, rendering exhaustive grid-based searches infeasible. Recent advances in deep learning have accelerated inverse design by providing powerful generative priors and differentiable surrogate models. Nevertheless, current methods tend to approximate the 3D design space using 2D projections or fine-tune existing 3D shapes. These approaches sacrifice volumetric detail and constrain design exploration, preventing true 3D design from scratch. In this paper, we propose a 3D Inverse Design (3DID) framework that directly navigates the 3D design space by coupling a continuous latent representation with a physics-aware optimization strategy. We first learn a unified physics-geometry embedding that compactly captures shape and physical field data in a continuous latent space.

While recent methods leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through supervised learning on large-scale datasets to improve reasoning, they often lack robustness in novel scenarios. Conversely, reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches enhance adaptability but remain data-inefficient and lack transparent decision-making. % contribution To address these limitations, we propose COVLM-RL, a novel end-to-end driving framework that integrates Critical Object-oriented (CO) reasoning with VLM-guided RL. Specifically, we design a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategy that enables the VLM to reason over critical traffic elements and generate high-level semantic decisions, effectively transforming multi-view visual inputs into structured semantic decision priors. These priors reduce the input dimensionality and inject task-relevant knowledge into the RL loop, accelerating training and improving policy interpretability. However, bridging high-level semantic guidance with continuous low-level control remains non-trivial. To this end, we introduce a consistency loss that encourages alignment between the VLM's semantic plans and the RL agent's control outputs, enhancing interpretability and training stability. Experiments conducted in the CARLA simulator demonstrate that COVLM-RL significantly improves the success rate by 30\\% in trained driving environments and by 50\\% in previously unseen environments, highlighting its strong generalization capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "COVLM-RL\u7ed3\u5408VLM\u548cRL\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u51b3\u7b56\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86Chain-of-Thought\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u51b3\u7b56\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u786e\u4fddVLM\u8bed\u4e49\u8ba1\u5212\u4e0eRL\u63a7\u5236\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728CARLA\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\uff0cCOVLM-RL\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u73af\u5883\u548c\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u4e8630%\u548c50%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "COVLM-RL\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408Critical Object-oriented\u63a8\u7406\u4e0eVLM-guided RL\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing methods are limited by transfer settings that assume homogeneous domains or heterogeneous scenarios with only co-occurring categories. When label spaces do not overlap, they further rely on complete source-domain coverage and therefore overlook critical target-private information. To overcome these limitations and enable knowledge transfer in fully heterogeneous settings, we propose Cross-scene Knowledge Integration (CKI), a framework that explicitly incorporates target-private knowledge during transfer. CKI includes: (1) Alignment of Spectral Characteristics (ASC) to reduce spectral discrepancies through domain-agnostic projection; (2) Cross-scene Knowledge Sharing Preference (CKSP), which resolves semantic mismatch via a Source Similarity Mechanism (SSM); and (3) Complementary Information Integration (CII) to maximize the use of target-specific complementary cues. Extensive experiments verify that CKI achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong stability across diverse cross-scene HSI scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "CKI\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u8c31\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u504f\u597d\u548c\u4e92\u8865\u4fe1\u606f\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f02\u6784HSI\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u91cd\u53e0\u65f6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6e90\u57df\u5b8c\u5168\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u79c1\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "CKI\u5305\u62ec\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1aASC\u7528\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u5149\u8c31\u5dee\u5f02\uff0cCKSP\u901a\u8fc7SSM\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0cCII\u5219\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5229\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5b9a\u4e92\u8865\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cCKI\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8de8\u573a\u666fHSI\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CKI\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u6574\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u79c1\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u5f02\u6784\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8de8\u573a\u666fHSI\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

To achieve precise load manipulation, existing methods often rely on extra sensors to measure cable directions or the payload's pose, which increases the system cost and complexity. A fundamental question remains: is the payload's pose observable under multi-source disturbances using only the drones' odometry information? To answer this question, this work focuses on the two-drone-bar system and proves that the whole system is observable when only two or fewer types of lumped disturbances exist by using the observability rank criterion. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present such a conclusion and this result paves the way for more cost-effective and robust systems by minimizing their sensor suites. Next, to validate this analysis, we consider the situation where the disturbances are only exerted on the drones, and develop a composite disturbance filtering scheme. A disturbance observer-based error-state extended Kalman filter is designed for both state and disturbance estimation, which renders improved estimation performance for the whole system evolving on the manifold $(\\mathbb{R}^3)^2\\times(TS^2)^3$.

We propose a video-to-video translation framework that converts ordinary human-object interaction videos into motion-consistent robot manipulation videos with realistic, physically grounded interactions. Our approach does not require any paired human-robot videos for training only a set of unpaired robot videos, making the system easy to scale. We introduce a transferable representation that bridges the embodiment gap: by inpainting the robot arm in training videos to obtain a clean background and overlaying a simple visual cue (a marker and arrow indicating the gripper's position and orientation), we can condition a generative model to insert the robot arm back into the scene. At test time, we apply the same process to human videos (inpainting the person and overlaying human pose cues) and generate high-quality robot videos that mimic the human's actions. We fine-tune a SOTA video diffusion model (Wan 2.2) in an in-context learning manner to ensure temporal coherence and leveraging of its rich prior knowledge. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly more realistic and grounded robot motions compared to baselines, pointing to a promising direction for scaling up robot learning from unlabeled human videos.

Each agent is represented by a personalized value space, a vector space encoding the internal dimensions through which the agent interprets and evaluates meaning. Beliefs are formalized as structured vectors-abstract beings-whose transmission is mediated by linear interpretation maps. A belief survives communication only if it avoids the null spaces of these maps, yielding a structural criterion for intelligibility, miscommunication, and belief death.\n  Within this framework, I show how belief distortion, motivational drift, counterfactual evaluation, and the limits of mutual understanding arise from purely algebraic constraints. A central result-\"the No-Null-Space Leadership Condition\"-characterizes leadership as a property of representational reachability rather than persuasion or authority. More broadly, the model explains how abstract beings can propagate, mutate, or disappear as they traverse diverse cognitive geometries.\n  The account unifies insights from conceptual spaces, social epistemology, and AI value alignment by grounding meaning preservation in structural compatibility rather than shared information or rationality. I argue that this cognitive-geometric perspective clarifies the epistemic boundaries of influence in both human and artificial systems, and offers a general foundation for analyzing belief dynamics across heterogeneous agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u5f02\u6784\u4ee3\u7406\u95f4\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u3001\u52a8\u673a\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7ed3\u6784\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u5728\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u6982\u5ff5\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u548cAI\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u800c\u975e\u5171\u4eab\u4fe1\u606f\u6216\u7406\u6027\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u610f\u4e49\u4fdd\u5b58\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u6620\u5c04\u6765\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u6807\u51c6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7684\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u3001\u8bef\u89e3\u548c\u6d88\u4ea1\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u201c\u65e0\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u9886\u5bfc\u6761\u4ef6\u201d\uff0c\u5c06\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u8868\u5f81\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u800c\u975e\u8bf4\u670d\u6216\u6743\u5a01\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u62bd\u8c61\u5b58\u5728\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u591a\u6837\u8ba4\u77e5\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\u4f20\u64ad\u3001\u53d8\u5f02\u6216\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8ba4\u77e5\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u5f02\u6784\u4ee3\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u3001\u52a8\u673a\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u5728\u610f\u4e49\u4fdd\u5b58\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Standard Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) often suffers from inefficient exploration and fails to scale to large scenarios. We propose PGF-MAPPO (Path-Guided Frontier MAPPO), a hierarchical framework bridging topological planning with reactive control. To resolve local minima and sparse rewards, we integrate an A*-based potential field for dense reward shaping. Furthermore, we introduce Directional Frontier Allocation, combining Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) with geometric angle suppression to enforce spatial dispersion and accelerate coverage.

ARTEMIS is a multi-agent framework featuring dynamic prompt generation, arbitrary sub-agents, and automatic vulnerability triaging. In our comparative study, ARTEMIS placed second overall, discovering 9 valid vulnerabilities with an 82% valid submission rate and outperforming 9 of 10 human participants. While existing scaffolds such as Codex and CyAgent underperformed relative to most human participants, ARTEMIS demonstrated technical sophistication and submission quality comparable to the strongest participants.

To overcome these shortcomings, we propose diffusion model regularized implicit neural representation framework for MAR.

However, dense SLAM in dynamic environments remains challenging. Most methods directly remove dynamic objects and focus solely on static scene reconstruction, which ignores the motion information contained in these dynamic objects. In this paper, we present D$^2$GSLAM, a novel dynamic SLAM system utilizing Gaussian representation, which simultaneously performs accurate dynamic reconstruction and robust tracking within dynamic environments. Our system is composed of four key components: (i) We propose a geometric-prompt dynamic separation method to distinguish between static and dynamic elements of the scene. This approach leverages the geometric consistency of Gaussian representation and scene geometry to obtain coarse dynamic regions. The regions then serve as prompts to guide the refinement of the coarse mask for achieving accurate motion mask. (ii) To facilitate accurate and efficient mapping of the dynamic scene, we introduce dynamic-static composite representation that integrates static 3D Gaussians with dynamic 4D Gaussians. This representation allows for modeling the transitions between static and dynamic states of objects in the scene for composite mapping and optimization. (iii) We employ a progressive pose refinement strategy that leverages both the multi-view consistency of static scene geometry and motion information from dynamic objects to achieve accurate camera tracking. (iv) We introduce a motion consistency loss, which leverages the temporal continuity in object motions for accurate dynamic modeling.

Lithography defect data from semiconductor industry are rarely accessible for research use, resulting in a shortage of publicly available datasets. To address this bottleneck in lithography, this study proposes a novel methodology for generating large-scale, physically valid defect datasets with pixel-level annotations. The framework begins with the ab initio synthesis of defect layouts using controllable, physics-constrained mathematical morphology operations (erosion and dilation) applied to the original design-level layout. These synthesized layouts, together with their defect-free counterparts, are fabricated into physical samples via high-fidelity digital micromirror device (DMD)-based lithography. Optical micrographs of the synthesized defect samples and their defect-free references are then compared to create consistent defect delineation annotations. Using this methodology, we constructed a comprehensive dataset of 3,530 Optical micrographs containing 13,365 annotated defect instances including four classes: bridge, burr, pinch, and contamination. Each defect instance is annotated with a pixel-accurate segmentation mask, preserving full contour and geometry. The segmentation-based Mask R-CNN achieves AP@0.5 of 0.980, 0.965, and 0.971, compared with 0.740, 0.719, and 0.717 for Faster R-CNN on bridge, burr, and pinch classes, representing a mean AP@0.5 improvement of approximately 34%. For the contamination class, Mask R-CNN achieves an AP@0.5 roughly 42% higher than Faster R-CNN.

RoboCup, an international competition of fully autonomous humanoid robots, provides a uniquely challenging benchmark for such systems, culminating in the long-term goal of competing against human soccer players by 2050. This paper presents the hardware and software innovations underlying our team's victory in the RoboCup 2024 Adult-Sized Humanoid Soccer Competition. On the hardware side, we introduce an adult-sized humanoid platform built with lightweight structural components, high-torque quasi-direct-drive actuators, and a specialized foot design that enables powerful in-gait kicks while preserving locomotion robustness. On the software side, we develop an integrated perception and localization framework that combines stereo vision, object detection, and landmark-based fusion to provide reliable estimates of the ball, goals, teammates, and opponents. A mid-level navigation stack then generates collision-aware, dynamically feasible trajectories, while a centralized behavior manager coordinates high-level decision making, role selection, and kick execution based on the evolving game state. The seamless integration of these subsystems results in fast, precise, and tactically effective gameplay, enabling robust performance under the dynamic and adversarial conditions of real matches.

Recent research suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode rich semantic knowledge about the world, which can be valuable for guiding agents in high-level reasoning and planning across both embodied and purely textual settings. However, existing approaches often depend heavily on querying LLMs during training and inference, making them computationally expensive and difficult to deploy efficiently. In addition, these methods typically employ a pretrained, unaltered LLM whose parameters remain fixed throughout training, providing no opportunity for adaptation to the target task. To address these limitations, we introduce SCOPE (Subgoal-COnditioned Pretraining for Efficient planning), a one-shot hierarchical planner that leverages LLM-generated subgoals only at initialization to pretrain a lightweight student model. Unlike prior approaches that distill LLM knowledge by repeatedly prompting the model to adaptively generate subgoals during training, our method derives subgoals directly from example trajectories. This design removes the need for repeated LLM queries, significantly improving efficiency, though at the cost of reduced explainability and potentially suboptimal subgoals. Despite their suboptimality, our results on the TextCraft environment show that LLM-generated subgoals can still serve as a strong starting point for hierarchical goal decomposition in text-based planning tasks.

A preliminary version of this work was presented at CALCO 2025, under the title \"An Algebraic Approach to Moralisation and Triangulation of Probabilistic Graphical Models''", "summary": "Moralisation and Triangulation are transformations allowing to switch between different ways of factoring a probability distribution into a graphical model. Moralisation allows to view a Bayesian network (a directed model) as a Markov network (an undirected model), whereas triangulation addresses the opposite direction. We present a categorical framework where these transformations are modelled as functors between a category of Bayesian networks and one of Markov networks. The two kinds of network (the objects of these categories) are themselves represented as functors from a `syntax' domain to a `semantics' codomain. Notably, moralisation and triangulation can be defined inductively on such syntax via functor pre-composition. Moreover, while moralisation is fully syntactic, triangulation relies on semantics. This leads to a discussion of the variable elimination algorithm, reinterpreted here as a functor in its own right, that splits the triangulation procedure in two: one purely syntactic, the other purely semantic. This approach introduces a functorial perspective into the theory of probabilistic graphical models, which highlights the distinctions between syntactic and semantic modifications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7528\u8303\u7574\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u9053\u5fb7\u5316\u548c\u4e09\u89d2\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u51fd\u5b50\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fee\u6539\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u6982\u7387\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u51fd\u5b50\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fee\u6539\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8303\u7574\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9053\u5fb7\u5316\u548c\u4e09\u89d2\u5316\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u51fd\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u51fd\u5b50\u9884\u7ec4\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u5f52\u7eb3\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u9053\u5fb7\u5316\u548c\u4e09\u89d2\u5316\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u51fd\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf\u6d88\u9664\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51fd\u5b50\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8303\u7574\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9053\u5fb7\u5316\u548c\u4e09\u89d2\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7f51\u7edc\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51fd\u5b50\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u533a\u522b\u3002"}}

Current attention/similarity-based compression algorithms suffer from either position bias or class imbalance, leading to significant accuracy degradation. They also fail to generalize to shallow LLM layers, which exhibit weaker cross-modal interactions. To address this, we extend token compression to the visual encoder through an effective iterative merging scheme that is orthogonal in spatial axes to accelerate the computation across the entire VLM. Furthermoer, we integrate a spectrum pruning unit into LLM through an attention/similarity-free low-pass filter, which gradually prunes redundant visual tokens and is fully compatible to modern FlashAttention. On this basis, we propose Lossless Ultimate Vision tokens Compression (LUVC) framework. LUVC systematically compresses visual tokens until complete elimination at the final layer of LLM, so that the high-dimensional visual features are gradually fused into the multimodal queries.

To attain socially-desirable behaviors, autonomous vehicles must be instructed to consider the utility of other vehicles around them in their decision-making process. Particularly, we study the maneuver planning problem for autonomous vehicles and investigate how a decentralized reward structure can induce altruism in their behavior and incentivize them to account for the interest of other autonomous and human-driven vehicles. This is a challenging problem due to the ambiguity of a human driver's willingness to cooperate with an autonomous vehicle. Thus, in contrast with the existing works which rely on behavior models of human drivers, we take an end-to-end approach and let the autonomous agents to implicitly learn the decision-making process of human drivers only from experience.

For the case of Angola, the classifier we propose opens the possibility of reinforcing the national security system based on the database of target individuals (disappeared, criminals, etc.) and the video sequences of the Integrated Public Security Centre (CISP).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9a\u4f4d\u76ee\u6807\u4e2a\u4f53\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u56fd\u5bb6\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u591a\u5bf9\u8c61\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u76ee\u6807\u89d2\u8272\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u7279\u5b9a\u89d2\u8272\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u4ece\u516c\u5171\u6216\u79c1\u4eba\u56fe\u50cf\u5e93\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u76ee\u6807\u4e2a\u4f53\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u54e5\u62c9\u56fd\u5bb6\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u4e2a\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u5b9e\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ece\u76ee\u6807\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u54e5\u62c9\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u3002"}}

We then present two algorithms that solve POCGAGP: CADENCE, a centralized planner that incrementally selects 270 degree corners at which to deploy agents, and DADENCE, a decentralized scheme that coordinates agents using local information and lightweight messaging. Both approaches operate under partial observability and target simultaneous coverage and connectivity. We evaluate the methods in simulation across 1,500 test cases of varied size and structure, demonstrating consistent success in forming connected networks while covering and exploring unknown space.

In order to navigate safely in the presence of complex AV-HV social interactions, the AVs must learn to predict these changes. Humans are capable of navigating such challenging social interaction settings because of their intrinsic knowledge about other agents behaviors and use that to forecast what might happen in the future. Inspired by humans, we provide our AVs the capability of anticipating future states and leveraging prediction in a cooperative reinforcement learning (RL) decision-making framework, to improve safety and robustness. In this paper, we propose an integration of two essential and earlier-presented components of AVs: social navigation and prediction. We formulate the AV decision-making process as a RL problem and seek to obtain optimal policies that produce socially beneficial results utilizing a prediction-aware planning and social-aware optimization RL framework. We also propose a Hybrid Predictive Network (HPN) that anticipates future observations. The HPN is used in a multi-step prediction chain to compute a window of predicted future observations to be used by the value function network (VFN). Finally, a safe VFN is trained to optimize a social utility using a sequence of previous and predicted observations, and a safety prioritizer is used to leverage the interpretable kinematic predictions to mask the unsafe actions, constraining the RL policy.

LiDAR is widely used in construction because it offers advantages over camera-based systems, performing reliably in cluttered and dynamically changing conditions. Yet most public datasets for 3D perception are derived from densely fused scans with uniform sampling and complete visibility, conditions that do not reflect real construction sites. Field data are often collected as isolated single-station LiDAR views, constrained by safety requirements, limited access, and ongoing operations. These factors lead to radial density decay, fragmented geometry, and view-dependent visibility-characteristics that remain underrepresented in existing datasets. This paper presents SIP, Site in Pieces, a dataset created to reflect the practical constraints of LiDAR acquisition during construction. SIP provides indoor and outdoor scenes captured with a terrestrial LiDAR scanner and annotated at the point level using a taxonomy tailored to construction environments: A. Built Environment, B. Construction Operations, and C. Site Surroundings. The dataset includes both structural components and slender temporary objects such as scaffolding, MEP piping, and scissor lifts, where sparsity caused by occlusion and fragmented geometry make segmentation particularly challenging. The scanning protocol, annotation workflow, and quality control procedures establish a consistent foundation for the dataset. SIP is openly available with a supporting Git repository, offering adaptable class configurations that streamline adoption within modern 3D deep learning frameworks. By providing field data that retain real-world sensing characteristics, SIP enables robust benchmarking and contributes to advancing construction-oriented 3D vision tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "SIP\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cd\u6620\u5efa\u7b51\u5de5\u5730LiDAR\u91c7\u96c6\u5b9e\u9645\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5ba4\u5185\u5916\u573a\u666f\u7684\u70b9\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u652f\u63013D\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u591a\u6765\u81ea\u5bc6\u96c6\u878d\u5408\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u91c7\u6837\u5747\u5300\u4e14\u89c6\u91ce\u5b8c\u6574\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u5efa\u7b51\u5de5\u5730\u7684LiDAR\u91c7\u96c6\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5982\u5f84\u5411\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8870\u51cf\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u788e\u7247\u5316\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\uff09\u3002", "method": "SIP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f7f\u7528\u5730\u9762LiDAR\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\u6355\u83b7\u5ba4\u5185\u5916\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u4e3a\u5efa\u7b51\u73af\u5883\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u5728\u70b9\u7ea7\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u6ce8\u3002\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u62ec\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u7ec6\u957f\u4e34\u65f6\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u626b\u63cf\u534f\u8bae\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u7a0b\u5e8f\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6027\u3002", "result": "SIP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4fdd\u7559\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u6027\u7684\u73b0\u573a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u73b0\u4ee33D\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u56e0\u906e\u6321\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u788e\u7247\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "SIP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u5efa\u7b51\u5de5\u5730LiDAR\u91c7\u96c6\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u5efa\u7b51\u76843D\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002"}}

This challenge stems from the need to balance racing speed and collision avoidance, limited feasible space causing policy exploration trapped in local optima during training, and perceptual ambiguity between gates and obstacles in depth maps-especially when gate positions are only coarsely specified. To overcome these issues, we propose a two-phase learning framework: an initial soft-collision training phase that preserves policy exploration for high-speed flight, followed by a hard-collision refinement phase that enforces robust obstacle avoidance. An adaptive, noise-augmented curriculum with an asymmetric actor-critic architecture gradually shifts the policy's reliance from privileged gate-state information to depth-based visual input. We further impose Lipschitz constraints and integrate a track-primitive generator to enhance motion stability and cross-environment generalization. We evaluate our framework through extensive simulation and ablation studies, and validate it in real-world experiments on a computationally constrained quadrotor. The system achieves agile flight while remaining robust to gate-position errors, developing a generalizable drone racing framework with the capability to operate in diverse, partially unknown and cluttered environments. https://yufengsjtu.github.io/MasterRacing.github.io/", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f6f\u786c\u78b0\u649e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u6742\u4e71\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7ade\u901f\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u901f\u98de\u884c\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u969c\u788d\u907f\u514d\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u591a\u6570\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7ade\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\u9488\u5bf9\u56fa\u5b9a\u3001\u65e0\u969c\u788d\u7684\u8d5b\u9053\uff0c\u800c\u5c06\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u77e5\u3001\u6742\u4e71\u73af\u5883\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u57fa\u672c\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u6e90\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u5728\u7ade\u901f\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u78b0\u649e\u907f\u514d\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u6709\u9650\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b56\u7565\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u9677\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u4e2d\u95e8\u4e0e\u969c\u788d\u7269\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u2014\u2014\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5f53\u95e8\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4ec5\u7c97\u7565\u6307\u5b9a\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u521d\u59cb\u7684\u8f6f\u78b0\u649e\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u901f\u98de\u884c\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u662f\u786c\u78b0\u649e\u7cbe\u70bc\u9636\u6bb5\u4ee5\u5f3a\u5316\u969c\u788d\u7269\u907f\u514d\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u6f14\u5458-\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u9010\u6e10\u5c06\u7b56\u7565\u4f9d\u8d56\u4ece\u7279\u6743\u95e8\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u65bd\u52a0Lipschitz\u7ea6\u675f\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u8f68\u8ff9\u57fa\u5143\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u8fd0\u52a8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u654f\u6377\u98de\u884c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u95e8\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7ade\u901f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u591a\u6837\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u672a\u77e5\u548c\u6742\u4e71\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u3002"}}

However, deploying state-of-the-art deep learning models like ConvNeXtV2-Large in clinical settings is hindered by their computational demands. Therefore, it is desirable to develop efficient models that maintain high diagnostic performance while enabling real-time deployment. In this study, a novel knowledge distillation framework, termed KD-OCT, is proposed to compress a high-performance ConvNeXtV2-Large teacher model, enhanced with advanced augmentations, stochastic weight averaging, and focal loss, into a lightweight EfficientNet-B2 student for classifying normal, drusen, and CNV cases. KD-OCT employs real-time distillation with a combined loss balancing soft teacher knowledge transfer and hard ground-truth supervision. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on the Noor Eye Hospital (NEH) dataset using patient-level cross-validation. Experimental results demonstrate that KD-OCT outperforms comparable multi-scale or feature-fusion OCT classifiers in efficiency- accuracy balance, achieving near-teacher performance with substantial reductions in model size and inference time. Despite the compression, the student model exceeds most existing frameworks, facilitating edge deployment for AMD screening.

This limits their effectiveness for autonomous agents like last-mile delivery robots navigating unfamiliar cities. To address these limitations, we introduce UrbanNav, a scalable framework that trains embodied agents to follow free-form language instructions in diverse urban settings. Leveraging web-scale city walking videos, we develop an scalable annotation pipeline that aligns human navigation trajectories with language instructions grounded in real-world landmarks. UrbanNav encompasses over 1,500 hours of navigation data and 3 million instruction-trajectory-landmark triplets, capturing a wide range of urban scenarios. Our model learns robust navigation policies to tackle complex urban scenarios, demonstrating superior spatial reasoning, robustness to noisy instructions, and generalization to unseen urban settings.

This is a challenging problem because images of the same place may appear quite different for reasons including seasonal changes, weather illumination, structural changes to the environment, as well as transient pedestrian or vehicle traffic. Papers focusing on generating image descriptors for VPR report their results using metrics such as recall@K and ROC curves. However, for a robot implementation, determining which matches are sufficiently good is often reduced to a manually set threshold.

Our experiments in simulation on both synthetic and real-world scans demonstrate the feasibility of our method, showing that the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to controllers that rely on perfect ground-truth information.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReMoSPLAT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u9ad8\u65afSplat\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u907f\u969c\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u907f\u514d\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u8868\u793a\u73af\u5883\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u7684\u907f\u969c\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u9ad8\u65afSplat\u8868\u793a\u7684ReMoSPLAT\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u907f\u969c\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5730\u9762\u771f\u5b9e\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "ReMoSPLAT\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u9ad8\u65afSplat\u8868\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u7684\u907f\u969c\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5730\u9762\u771f\u5b9e\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3002"}}

For instance, the prompt \"egg noodle\" may result in images that incorrectly contain both eggs and noodles as separate entities. Multi-noun food categories are common in real-world datasets and account for a large portion of entries in benchmarks such as UEC-256. These compound names often cause generative models to misinterpret the semantics, producing unintended ingredients or objects. This is due to insufficient multi-noun category related knowledge in the text encoder and misinterpretation of multi-noun relationships, leading to incorrect spatial layouts.

Existing approaches typically encode camera trajectories through relative or ambiguous representations, limiting explicit geometric control. We introduce GimbalDiffusion, a framework that enables camera control grounded in physical-world coordinates, using gravity as a global reference. Instead of describing motion relative to previous frames, our method defines camera trajectories in an absolute coordinate system, allowing precise and interpretable control over camera parameters without requiring an initial reference frame. We leverage panoramic 360-degree videos to construct a wide variety of camera trajectories, well beyond the predominantly straight, forward-facing trajectories seen in conventional video data. To further enhance camera guidance, we introduce null-pitch conditioning, an annotation strategy that reduces the model's reliance on text content when conflicting with camera specifications (e.g., generating grass while the camera points towards the sky). Finally, we establish a benchmark for camera-aware video generation by rebalancing SpatialVID-HQ for comprehensive evaluation under wide camera pitch variation.

In contrast, multi-image super-resolution (MISR) aims to improve the (optical) resolution by constraining the super-resolution process with multiple views taken with sub-pixel shifts. Here, we propose SuperF, a test-time optimization approach for MISR that leverages coordinate-based neural networks, also called neural fields. Their ability to represent continuous signals with an implicit neural representation (INR) makes them an ideal fit for the MISR task.\n  The key characteristic of our approach is to share an INR for multiple shifted low-resolution frames and to jointly optimize the frame alignment with the INR. Our approach advances related INR baselines, adopted from burst fusion for layer separation, by directly parameterizing the sub-pixel alignment as optimizable affine transformation parameters and by optimizing via a super-sampled coordinate grid that corresponds to the output resolution. Our experiments yield compelling results on simulated bursts of satellite imagery and ground-level images from handheld cameras, with upsampling factors of up to 8. A key advantage of SuperF is that this approach does not rely on any high-resolution training data.", "AI": {"tldr": "SuperF\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u573a\u548c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5e27\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0eINR\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u5e38\u53d7\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6280\u672f\u3001\u5927\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u6210\u672c\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u201c\u5e7b\u89c9\u201d\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff08MISR\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u7ea6\u675f\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002", "method": "SuperF\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5750\u6807\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u795e\u7ecf\u573a\uff09\u548c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5e27\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\uff08INR\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5b50\u50cf\u7d20\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e3a\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4eff\u5c04\u53d8\u6362\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u91c7\u6837\u5750\u6807\u7f51\u683c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u536b\u661f\u548c\u624b\u6301\u76f8\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u7206\u53d1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u8fbe8\u500d\u7684\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u56e0\u5b50\u3002", "conclusion": "SuperF\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5750\u6807\u57fa\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5e27\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0eINR\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff08MISR\uff09\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u536b\u661f\u548c\u624b\u6301\u76f8\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u3002"}}

See-through-skin (STS) sensors, which combine tactile and visual perception, offer promising sensing capabilities, while modern imitation learning provides powerful tools for policy acquisition.

Furthermore, integrating these rich multimodal signals into learning-based manipulation pipelines remains an open challenge. We introduce TacThru, an STS sensor enabling simultaneous visual perception and robust tactile signal extraction, and TacThru-UMI, an imitation learning framework that leverages these multimodal signals for manipulation. Our sensor features a fully transparent elastomer, persistent illumination, novel keyline markers, and efficient tracking, while our learning system integrates these signals through a Transformer-based Diffusion Policy. Experiments on five challenging real-world tasks show that TacThru-UMI achieves an average success rate of 85.5%, significantly outperforming the baselines of alternating tactile-visual (66.3%) and vision-only (55.4%).

However, precise coordination between these platforms in real-time scenarios presents major challenges, particularly when external localization infrastructure such as GPS or GNSS is unavailable or degraded [1]. This paper proposes a vision-based, data-driven framework for real-time UAV-UGV integration, with a focus on robust UGV detection and heading angle prediction for navigation and coordination. The system employs a fine-tuned YOLOv5 model to detect UGVs and extract bounding box features, which are then used by a lightweight artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate the UAV's required heading angle. A VICON motion capture system was used to generate ground-truth data during training, resulting in a dataset of over 13,000 annotated images collected in a controlled lab environment. The trained ANN achieves a mean absolute error of 0.1506\u00b0 and a root mean squared error of 0.1957\u00b0, offering accurate heading angle predictions using only monocular camera inputs.

However, constructing and maintaining 3D maps is often computationally expensive and memory-intensive. We address the problem of visual navigation when exploration videos of a large environment are available. The videos serve as a visual reference, allowing a robot to retrace the explored trajectories without relying on metric maps. Our proposed method, YOPO-Nav (You Only Pass Once), encodes an environment into a compact spatial representation composed of interconnected local 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models. During navigation, the framework aligns the robot's current visual observation with this representation and predicts actions that guide it back toward the demonstrated trajectory. YOPO-Nav employs a hierarchical design: a visual place recognition (VPR) module provides coarse localization, while the local 3DGS models refine the goal and intermediate poses to generate control actions. To evaluate our approach, we introduce the YOPO-Campus dataset, comprising 4 hours of egocentric video and robot controller inputs from over 6 km of human-teleoperated robot trajectories. We benchmark recent visual navigation methods on trajectories from YOPO-Campus using a Clearpath Jackal robot. Experimental results show YOPO-Nav provides excellent performance in image-goal navigation for real-world scenes on a physical robot.

Recent advances in the field demand simulation frameworks that combine physical accuracy, computational scalability, and seamless integration with modern control and optimization pipelines. In this work, we present Py-DiSMech, a Python-based, open-source simulation framework for modeling and control of soft robotic structures grounded in the principles of Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG). By discretizing geometric quantities such as curvature and strain directly on meshes, Py-DiSMech captures the nonlinear deformation of rods, shells, and hybrid structures with high fidelity and reduced computational cost. The framework introduces (i) a fully vectorized NumPy implementation achieving order-of-magnitude speed-ups over existing geometry-based simulators; (ii) a penalty-energy-based fully implicit contact model that supports rod-rod, rod-shell, and shell-shell interactions; (iii) a natural-strain-based feedback-control module featuring a proportional-integral (PI) controller for shape regulation and trajectory tracking; and (iv) a modular, object-oriented software design enabling user-defined elastic energies, actuation schemes, and integration with machine-learning libraries. Benchmark comparisons demonstrate that Py-DiSMech substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art simulator Elastica in computational efficiency while maintaining physical accuracy.

Unlike classical continual learning where classes are disjoint, CCZSL is more complex as attributes and objects may reoccur across sessions while compositions remain unique. Built on a frozen VLM backbone, we propose the first Prompt-based Continual Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (PromptCCZSL) framework that retains prior knowledge through recency-weighted multi-teacher distillation. It employs session-aware compositional prompts to fuse multimodal features for new compositions, while attribute and object prompts are learned through session-agnostic fusion to maintain global semantic consistency, which is further stabilized by a Cosine Anchor Loss (CAL) to preserve prior knowledge. To enhance adaptation in the current session, an Orthogonal Projection Loss (OPL) ensures that new attribute and object embeddings remain distinct from previous ones, preventing overlap, while an Intra-Session Diversity Loss (IDL) promotes variation among current-session embeddings for richer, more discriminative representations. We also introduce a comprehensive protocol that jointly measures catastrophic forgetting and compositional generalization.

Yet existing studies on this area focus mainly on path efficiency and pedestrian collision avoidance, which are essential but represent only a fraction of social navigation. Beyond these basics, robots must also comply with user instructions, aligning their actions to task goals and social norms expressed by humans. In this work, we present LISN-Bench, the first simulation-based benchmark for language-instructed social navigation. Built on Rosnav-Arena 3.0, it is the first standardized social navigation benchmark to incorporate instruction following and scene understanding across diverse contexts. To address this task, we further propose Social-Nav-Modulator, a fast-slow hierarchical system where a VLM agent modulates costmaps and controller parameters. Decoupling low-level action generation from the slower VLM loop reduces reliance on high-frequency VLM inference while improving dynamic avoidance and perception adaptability. Our method achieves an average success rate of 91.3%, which is greater than 63% than the most competitive baseline, with most of the improvements observed in challenging tasks such as following a person in a crowd and navigating while strictly avoiding instruction-forbidden regions.

While recent generative approaches have attempted to model progression, key mismatches remain: disease dynamics are inherently continuous and monotonic, yet latent representations are often scattered, lacking semantic structure, and diffusion-based models disrupt continuity with random denoising process. In this work, we propose to treat the disease dynamic as a velocity field and leverage Flow Matching (FM) to align the temporal evolution of patient data. Unlike prior methods, it captures the intrinsic dynamic of disease, making the progression more interpretable. However, a key challenge remains: in latent space, Auto-Encoders (AEs) do not guarantee alignment across patients or correlation with clinical-severity indicators (e.g., age and disease conditions). To address this, we propose to learn patient-specific latent alignment, which enforces patient trajectories to lie along a specific axis, with magnitude increasing monotonically with disease severity. This leads to a consistent and semantically meaningful latent space. Together, we present $\u0394$-LFM, a framework for modeling patient-specific latent progression with flow matching.

To address this, we propose Token Expand-and-Merge-VLA (TEAM-VLA), a training-free token compression framework that accelerates VLA inference while preserving task performance. TEAM-VLA introduces a dynamic token expansion mechanism that identifies and samples additional informative tokens in the spatial vicinity of attention-highlighted regions, enhancing contextual completeness.

By coupling expansion and merging within a single feed-forward pass, TEAM-VLA achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness, without any retraining or parameter updates.

Existing zero-shot approaches leverage 2D vision-language models (VLMs) by converting 3D spatial information (SI) into forms amenable to VLM processing, typically as composite inputs such as specified view renderings or video sequences with overlaid object markers. However, this VLM + SI paradigm yields entangled visual representations that compel the VLM to process entire cluttered cues, making it hard to exploit spatial semantic relationships effectively. In this work, we propose a new VLM x SI paradigm that externalizes the 3D SI into a form enabling the VLM to incrementally retrieve only what it needs during reasoning. We instantiate this paradigm with a novel View-on-Graph (VoG) method, which organizes the scene into a multi-modal, multi-layer scene graph and allows the VLM to operate as an active agent that selectively accesses necessary cues as it traverses the scene. This design offers two intrinsic advantages: (i) by structuring 3D context into a spatially and semantically coherent scene graph rather than confounding the VLM with densely entangled visual inputs, it lowers the VLM's reasoning difficulty; and (ii) by actively exploring and reasoning over the scene graph, it naturally produces transparent, step-by-step traces for interpretable 3DVG. Extensive experiments show that VoG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, establishing structured scene exploration as a promising strategy for advancing zero-shot 3DVG.", "AI": {"tldr": "VoG\u901a\u8fc7\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u67093D\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u7ea0\u7f20\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08VLM + SI\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u4e3a\u66f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faView-on-Graph\uff08VoG\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c063D\u573a\u666f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u573a\u666f\u56fe\uff0c\u4f7fVLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u4ee3\u7406\u9010\u6b65\u68c0\u7d22\u5fc5\u8981\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "VoG\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c3D\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u573a\u666f\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "VoG\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c3D\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

However, most VLAs assume the Markov property, relying only on the current observation and thus suffering from temporal myopia that degrades long-horizon coherence. In this work, we view motion as a more compact and informative representation of temporal context and world dynamics, capturing inter-state changes while filtering static pixel-level noise. Building on this idea, we propose HiF-VLA (Hindsight, Insight, and Foresight for VLAs), a unified framework that leverages motion for bidirectional temporal reasoning. HiF-VLA encodes past dynamics through hindsight priors, anticipates future motion via foresight reasoning, and integrates both through a hindsight-modulated joint expert to enable a ''think-while-acting'' paradigm for long-horizon manipulation. As a result, HiF-VLA surpasses strong baselines on LIBERO-Long and CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks, while incurring negligible additional inference latency.

Nowadays, event cameras are becoming more widely adopted as they surpass RGB cameras in capturing facial expression changes due to their high temporal resolution, low latency, computational efficiency, and robustness in low-light conditions. Despite these advantages, event-based approaches still encounter practical challenges, particularly in adopting mainstream deep learning models. Traditional deep learning methods for facial expression analysis are energy-intensive, making them difficult to deploy on edge computing devices and thereby increasing costs, especially for high-frequency, dynamic, event vision-based approaches. To address this challenging issue, we proposed the CS3D framework by decomposing the Convolutional 3D method to reduce the computational complexity and energy consumption. Additionally, by utilizing soft spiking neurons and a spatial-temporal attention mechanism, the ability to retain information is enhanced, thus improving the accuracy of facial expression detection. Experimental results indicate that our proposed CS3D method attains higher accuracy on multiple datasets compared to architectures such as the RNN, Transformer, and C3D, while the energy consumption of the CS3D method is just 21.97\\% of the original C3D required on the same device.", "AI": {"tldr": "CS3D\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u5728\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u5728\u6355\u6349\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u53d8\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8eRGB\u76f8\u673a\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CS3D\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3Convolutional 3D\u65b9\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8f6f\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "CS3D\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6bd4RNN\u3001Transformer\u548cC3D\u7b49\u67b6\u6784\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u8017\u4ec5\u4e3a\u539f\u59cbC3D\u768421.97%\u3002", "conclusion": "CS3D\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3Convolutional 3D\u65b9\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u8f6f\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

This study presents a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for early CKD detection from CT kidney images, complemented by class balancing using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and interpretability via Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM).

For text-to-PSD generation, OmniPSD arranges multiple target layers spatially into a single canvas and learns their compositional relationships through spatial attention, producing semantically coherent and hierarchically structured layers. For image-to-PSD decomposition, it performs iterative in-context editing, progressively extracting and erasing textual and foreground components to reconstruct editable PSD layers from a single flattened image. An RGBA-VAE is employed as an auxiliary representation module to preserve transparency without affecting structure learning.

However, one of the major remaining challenges lies in modeling long-range motion-contained dynamic videos, where a naive extension of existing methods leads to severe memory explosion, temporal flickering, and failure to handle appearing or disappearing occlusions over time. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 4DGS framework characterized by an Anchor Relay-based Bidirectional Blending (ARBB) mechanism, named MoRel, which enables temporally consistent and memory-efficient modeling of long-range dynamic scenes. Our method progressively constructs locally canonical anchor spaces at key-frame time index and models inter-frame deformations at the anchor level, enhancing temporal coherence. By learning bidirectional deformations between KfA and adaptively blending them through learnable opacity control, our approach mitigates temporal discontinuities and flickering artifacts. We further introduce a Feature-variance-guided Hierarchical Densification (FHD) scheme that effectively densifies KfA's while keeping rendering quality, based on an assigned level of feature-variance. To effectively evaluate our model's capability to handle real-world long-range 4D motion, we newly compose long-range 4D motion-contained dataset, called SelfCap$_{\\text{LR}}$. It has larger average dynamic motion magnitude, captured at spatially wider spaces, compared to previous dynamic video datasets. Overall, our MoRel achieves temporally coherent and flicker-free long-range 4D reconstruction while maintaining bounded memory usage, demonstrating both scalability and efficiency in dynamic Gaussian-based representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoRel\u901a\u8fc7ARBB\u548cFHD\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e864DGS\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u4e0e\u95ea\u70c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67094DGS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u7206\u70b8\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u95ea\u70c1\u53ca\u906e\u6321\u5904\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u951a\u70b9\u4e2d\u7ee7\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u6df7\u5408\uff08ARBB\uff09\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u5dee\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u5bc6\u96c6\u5316\uff08FHD\uff09\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u6784\u5efa\u5c40\u90e8\u89c4\u8303\u951a\u70b9\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u5efa\u6a21\u5e27\u95f4\u53d8\u5f62\u3002", "result": "MoRel\u5728SelfCap$_{\\text{LR}}$\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u76844D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4e14\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u6301\u3002", "conclusion": "MoRel\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7ARBB\u673a\u5236\u548cFHD\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u7206\u70b8\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u95ea\u70c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, the existing T2I alignment benchmarks predominantly focus on short prompt scenarios and only provide MOS or Likert scale annotations. This inherent limitation hinders the development of long T2I evaluators, particularly in terms of the interpretability of alignment. In this study, we contribute LongT2IBench, which comprises 14K long text-image pairs accompanied by graph-structured human annotations. Given the detail-intensive nature of long prompts, we first design a Generate-Refine-Qualify annotation protocol to convert them into textual graph structures that encompass entities, attributes, and relations. Through this transformation, fine-grained alignment annotations are achieved based on these granular elements. Finally, the graph-structed annotations are converted into alignment scores and interpretations to facilitate the design of T2I evaluation models. Based on LongT2IBench, we further propose LongT2IExpert, a LongT2I evaluator that enables multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to provide both quantitative scores and structured interpretations through an instruction-tuning process with Hierarchical Alignment Chain-of-Thought (CoT).

However, little attention has been paid to the color space in which the network is learning the radiance field representation. Inspired by the BiIlluminant Dichromatic Reflection (BIDR) model, which suggests that a logarithmic transformation simplifies the separation of illumination and reflectance, we hypothesize that log RGB space enables NeRF to learn a more compact and effective representation of scene appearance. To test this, we captured approximately 30 videos using a GoPro camera, ensuring linear data recovery through inverse encoding. We trained NeRF models under various color space interpretations linear, sRGB, GPLog, and log RGB by converting each network output to a common color space before rendering and loss computation, enforcing representation learning in different color spaces. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that using a log RGB color space consistently improves rendering quality, exhibits greater robustness across scenes, and performs particularly well in low light conditions while using the same bit-depth input images.

To facilitate a more efficient and accessible diagnostic approach for PD, we propose a dynamic facial expression analysis-based PD auxiliary diagnosis method. This method targets hypomimia, a characteristic clinical symptom of PD, by analyzing two manifestations: reduced facial expressivity and facial rigidity, thereby facilitating the diagnosis process. We develop a multimodal facial expression analysis network to extract expression intensity features during patients' performance of various facial expressions. This network leverages the CLIP architecture to integrate visual and textual features while preserving the temporal dynamics of facial expressions.

While this line of work excels at reconstructing 3D geometry, the outputs are not colored 3D models, thus 3D colorization is required for visualization. Recent 3D colorization studies address this problem by distilling 2D image colorization models. However, these approaches suffer from an inherent inconsistency of 2D image models. This results in colors being averaged during training, leading to monotonous and oversimplified results, particularly in complex 360\u00b0 scenes. In contrast, we aim to preserve color diversity by generating a new set of consistently colorized training views, thereby bypassing the averaging process. Nevertheless, eliminating the averaging process introduces a new challenge: ensuring strict multi-view consistency across these colorized views. To achieve this, we propose LoGoColor, a pipeline designed to preserve color diversity by eliminating this guidance-averaging process with a `Local-Global' approach: we partition the scene into subscenes and explicitly tackle both inter-subscene and intra-subscene consistency using a fine-tuned multi-view diffusion model. We demonstrate that our method achieves quantitatively and qualitatively more consistent and plausible 3D colorization on complex 360\u00b0 scenes than existing methods, and validate its superior color diversity using a novel Color Diversity Index.", "AI": {"tldr": "LoGoColor\u901a\u8fc7'\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40'\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742360\u00b0\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f183D\u8272\u5f69\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u8272\u5f69\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u8272\u5f69\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d562D\u56fe\u50cf\u8272\u5f69\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u800c\u5b58\u5728\u8272\u5f69\u5e73\u5747\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u679c\u5355\u8c03\u4e14\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742360\u00b0\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u7ec4\u65b0\u7684\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u8272\u5f69\u5316\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u56fe\u6765\u4fdd\u7559\u8272\u5f69\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLoGoColor\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u91c7\u7528'\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40'\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u573a\u666f\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u5b50\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u5b50\u573a\u666f\u95f4\u548c\u5b50\u573a\u666f\u5185\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u590d\u6742360\u00b0\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cLoGoColor\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u5408\u7406\u76843D\u8272\u5f69\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8272\u5f69\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6307\u6570\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LoGoColor\u901a\u8fc7\u5176'\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40'\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u590d\u6742360\u00b0\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u5408\u7406\u76843D\u8272\u5f69\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8272\u5f69\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6307\u6570\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

Time-lapse imaging enables continuous, non-invasive monitoring of embryo development, yet most automated assessment methods rely solely on conventional morphokinetic features and overlook emerging biomarkers. Cytoplasmic Strings, thin filamentous structures connecting the inner cell mass and trophectoderm in expanded blastocysts, have been associated with faster blastocyst formation, higher blastocyst grades, and improved viability. However, CS assessment currently depends on manual visual inspection, which is labor-intensive, subjective, and severely affected by detection and subtle visual appearance. In this work, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first computational framework for CS analysis in human IVF embryos. We first design a human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline to curate a biologically validated CS dataset from TLI videos, comprising 13,568 frames with highly sparse CS-positive instances. Building on this dataset, we propose a two-stage deep learning framework that (i) classifies CS presence at the frame level and (ii) localizes CS regions in positive cases. To address severe imbalance and feature uncertainty, we introduce the Novel Uncertainty-aware Contractive Embedding (NUCE) loss, which couples confidence-aware reweighting with an embedding contraction term to form compact, well-separated class clusters. NUCE consistently improves F1-score across five transformer backbones, while RF-DETR-based localization achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection performance for thin, low-contrast CS structures.

Code available at https://github.com/SonghanWu/yolov8n-SPTS", "summary": "This paper focuses on the key issue in autonomous driving: small target recognition in dynamic perception. Existing algorithms suffer from poor detection performance due to missing small target information, scale imbalance, and occlusion. We propose an improved YOLOv8n-SPTS model, which enhances the detection accuracy of small traffic targets through three key innovations: First, optimizing the feature extraction module. In the Backbone Bottleneck structure of YOLOv8n, 4 traditional convolution modules are replaced with Space-to-Depth Convolution (SPD-Conv) modules. This module retains fine-grained information through space-to-depth conversion, reduces information loss, and enhances the ability to capture features of low-resolution small targets. Second, enhancing feature fusion capability. The Spatial Pyramid Pooling - Fast Cross Stage Partial Connection (SPPFCSPC) module is introduced to replace the original SPPF module, integrating the multi-scale feature extraction from Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) and the feature fusion mechanism of Cross Stage Partial Connection (CSP), thereby improving the model's contextual understanding of complex scenes and multi-scale feature expression ability. Third, designing a dedicated detection structure for small targets. A Triple-Stage Feature Pyramid (TSFP) structure is proposed, which adds a 160*160 small target detection head to the original detection heads to fully utilize high-resolution features in shallow layers; meanwhile, redundant large target detection heads are removed to balance computational efficiency. Comparative experiments on the VisDrone2019-DET dataset show that YOLOv8n-SPTS model ranks first in precision (61.9%), recall (48.3%), mAP@0.5 (52.6%), and mAP@0.5:0.95 (32.6%).

To address this gap, we introduce VABench, a comprehensive and multi-dimensional benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities of synchronous audio-video generation. VABench encompasses three primary task types: text-to-audio-video (T2AV), image-to-audio-video (I2AV), and stereo audio-video generation. It further establishes two major evaluation modules covering 15 dimensions.

While lightweight baseline models such as U-Net, U-Net++, and PraNet offer advantages in terms of easy deployment and low computational cost, they struggle to deal with the above issues, leading to limited segmentation performance. In contrast, large-scale vision foundation models such as SAM, DINOv2, OneFormer, and Mask2Former have exhibited impressive generalization performance across natural image domains. However, their direct transfer to medical imaging tasks (e.g., colonoscopic polyp segmentation) is not straightforward, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale datasets and lack of domain-specific knowledge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel distillation framework, Polyp-DiFoM, that transfers the rich representations of foundation models into lightweight segmentation baselines, allowing efficient and accurate deployment in clinical settings. In particular, we infuse semantic priors from the foundation models into canonical architectures such as U-Net and U-Net++ and further perform frequency domain encoding for enhanced distillation, corroborating their generalization capability. Extensive experiments are performed across five benchmark datasets, such as Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ClinicDB, ETIS, ColonDB, and CVC-300. Notably, Polyp-DiFoM consistently outperforms respective baseline models significantly, as well as the state-of-the-art model, with nearly 9 times reduced computation overhead.

Koutsomitropoulos"], "title": "Hands-on Evaluation of Visual Transformers for Object Recognition and Detection", "comment": null, "summary": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for computer vision sometimes struggle with understanding images in a global context, as they mainly focus on local patterns. On the other hand, Vision Transformers (ViTs), inspired by models originally created for language processing, use self-attention mechanisms, which allow them to understand relationships across the entire image. In this paper, we compare different types of ViTs (pure, hierarchical, and hybrid) against traditional CNN models across various tasks, including object recognition, detection, and medical image classification. We conduct thorough tests on standard datasets like ImageNet for image classification and COCO for object detection. Additionally, we apply these models to medical imaging using the ChestX-ray14 dataset.

To evaluate this hypothesis, we design and validate an efficient post-training and inference framework that enhances a video MLLM's reasoning capability. Our framework enables models to operate on compressed visual tokens and generate brief reasoning traces prior to answering. The resulting models achieve substantially improved inference efficiency, deliver competitive performance across diverse benchmarks, and avoid reliance on manual CoT annotations or supervised fine-tuning. Collectively, our results suggest that long, human-like CoT reasoning may not be necessary for general video reasoning, and that concise reasoning can be both effective and efficient.

However, modeling the listener is exceptionally challenging: direct audio-driven training fails, producing stiff, static listening motions. This failure stems from a fundamental imbalance: the speaker's motion is strongly driven by speech audio, while the listener's motion primarily follows an internal motion prior and is only loosely guided by external speech. This challenge has led most methods to focus on speak-only generation. The only prior attempt at joint generation relies on extra speaker's motion to produce the listener. This design is not end-to-end, thereby hindering the real-time applicability. To address this limitation, we present UniLS, the first end-to-end framework for generating unified speak-listen expressions, driven by only dual-track audio. Our method introduces a novel two-stage training paradigm. Stage 1 first learns the internal motion prior by training an audio-free autoregressive generator, capturing the spontaneous dynamics of natural facial motion. Stage 2 then introduces the dual-track audio, fine-tuning the generator to modulate the learned motion prior based on external speech cues. Extensive evaluations show UniLS achieves state-of-the-art speaking accuracy. More importantly, it delivers up to 44.1\\% improvement in listening metrics, generating significantly more diverse and natural listening expressions.

Recently, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods have been employed to reconstruct the avatars. However, they often produce unsatisfactory photo-realistic results because of insufficient geometrical details related to body motion, such as clothing wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a 3DGS-based human avatar modeling framework, termed as Relightable and Dynamic Gaussian Avatar (RnD-Avatar), that presents accurate pose-variant deformation for high-fidelity geometrical details. To achieve this, we introduce dynamic skinning weights that define the human avatar's articulation based on pose while also learning additional deformations induced by body motion. We also introduce a novel regularization to capture fine geometric details under sparse visual cues.

Furthermore, from an approximation theoretical perspective, we explore the reasons why U-shaped networks are prone to hallucinations.

However, applying these models to long-video understanding remains computationally intensive. Dense frame encoding generates excessive visual tokens, leading to high memory consumption, redundant computation, and limited scalability in real-world applications. This inefficiency highlights a key limitation of the traditional process-then-reason paradigm, which analyzes visual streams exhaustively before semantic reasoning. To address this challenge, we introduce Video-QTR (Query-Driven Temporal Reasoning), a lightweight framework that redefines video comprehension as a query-guided reasoning process. Instead of encoding every frame, Video-QTR dynamically allocates perceptual resources based on the semantic intent of the query, creating an adaptive feedback loop between reasoning and perception. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks: MSVD-QA, Activity Net-QA, Movie Chat, and Video MME demonstrate that Video-QTR achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing input frame consumption by up to 73%.

However, their training on sensitive patient data raises critical privacy and compliance challenges under regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR, which enforce the \"right to be forgotten\". Unlearning, the process of tuning models to selectively remove the influence of specific training data points, offers a potential solution, yet its effectiveness in complex medical settings remains underexplored. To systematically study this, we introduce MedForget, a Hierarchy-Aware Multimodal Unlearning Testbed with explicit retain and forget splits and evaluation sets containing rephrased variants. MedForget models hospital data as a nested hierarchy (Institution -> Patient -> Study -> Section), enabling fine-grained assessment across eight organizational levels. The benchmark contains 3840 multimodal (image, question, answer) instances, each hierarchy level having a dedicated unlearning target, reflecting distinct unlearning challenges. Experiments with four SOTA unlearning methods on three tasks (generation, classification, cloze) show that existing methods struggle to achieve complete, hierarchy-aware forgetting without reducing diagnostic performance. To test whether unlearning truly deletes hierarchical pathways, we introduce a reconstruction attack that progressively adds hierarchical level context to prompts. Models unlearned at a coarse granularity show strong resistance, while fine-grained unlearning leaves models vulnerable to such reconstruction.

This paper proposes FUSER, the first feed-forward multiview registration transformer that jointly processes all scans in a unified, compact latent space to directly predict global poses without any pairwise estimation. To maintain tractability, FUSER encodes each scan into low-resolution superpoint features via a sparse 3D CNN that preserves absolute translation cues, and performs efficient intra- and inter-scan reasoning through a Geometric Alternating Attention module. Particularly, we transfer 2D attention priors from off-the-shelf foundation models to enhance 3D feature interaction and geometric consistency. Building upon FUSER, we further introduce FUSER-DF, an SE(3)$^N$ diffusion refinement framework to correct FUSER's estimates via denoising in the joint SE(3)$^N$ space. FUSER acts as a surrogate multiview registration model to construct the denoiser, and a prior-conditioned SE(3)$^N$ variational lower bound is derived for denoising supervision.

Currently, sRGB-based WB editing for post-ISP WB correction is widely used to address color constancy failures in the ISP pipeline when the original camera RAW is unavailable. However, additive color models (e.g., sRGB) are inherently limited by fixed nonlinear transformations and entangled color channels, which often impede their generalization to complex lighting conditions.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for WB correction that leverages a perception-inspired Learnable HSI (LHSI) color space. Built upon a cylindrical color model that naturally separates luminance from chromatic components, our framework further introduces dedicated parameters to enhance this disentanglement and learnable mapping to adaptively refine the flexibility. Moreover, a new Mamba-based network is introduced, which is tailored to the characteristics of the proposed LHSI color space.\n  Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting the potential of perception-inspired color space design in computational photography.

Subdural hematoma (SDH) is a common neurosurgical emergency, with increasing incidence in aging populations. Rapid and accurate identification is essential to guide timely intervention, yet existing automated tools focus primarily on detection and provide limited interpretability or spatial localization. There remains a need for transparent, high-performing systems that integrate multimodal clinical and imaging information to support real-time decision-making.\n  Methods. We developed a multimodal deep-learning framework that integrates structured clinical variables, a 3D convolutional neural network trained on CT volumes, and a transformer-enhanced 2D segmentation model for SDH detection and localization. Using 25,315 head CT studies from Hartford HealthCare (2015--2024), of which 3,774 (14.9\\%) contained clinician-confirmed SDH, tabular models were trained on demographics, comorbidities, medications, and laboratory results. Imaging models were trained to detect SDH and generate voxel-level probability maps. A greedy ensemble strategy combined complementary predictors.\n  Findings. Clinical variables alone provided modest discriminatory power (AUC 0.75). Convolutional models trained on CT volumes and segmentation-derived maps achieved substantially higher accuracy (AUCs 0.922 and 0.926). The multimodal ensemble integrating all components achieved the best overall performance (AUC 0.9407; 95\\% CI, 0.930--0.951) and produced anatomically meaningful localization maps consistent with known SDH patterns.\n  Interpretation. This multimodal, interpretable framework provides rapid and accurate SDH detection and localization, achieving high detection performance and offering transparent, anatomically grounded outputs. Integration into radiology workflows could streamline triage, reduce time to intervention, and improve consistency in SDH management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eSDH\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u548c\u6210\u50cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u3001\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "SDH\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5916\u79d1\u6025\u75c7\uff0c\u5728\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u4eba\u7fa4\u4e2d\u53d1\u75c5\u7387\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u5feb\u901f\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6307\u5bfc\u53ca\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u9650\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6216\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002\u9700\u8981\u900f\u660e\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e34\u5e8a\u548c\u6210\u50cf\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e34\u5e8a\u53d8\u91cf\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eCT\u4f53\u79ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u76843D\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7528\u4e8eSDH\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684Transformer\u589e\u5f3a\u76842D\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8625,315\u4f8b\u5934CT\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d3,774\u4f8b\uff0814.9%\uff09\u5305\u542b\u4e34\u5e8a\u786e\u8ba4\u7684SDH\u3002\u8868\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e8e\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u3001\u5408\u5e76\u75c7\u3001\u836f\u7269\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u6210\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4bSDH\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u4f53\u7d20\u7ea7\u6982\u7387\u56fe\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u8d2a\u5a6a\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u7ec4\u5408\u4e92\u8865\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u4e34\u5e8a\u53d8\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9002\u5ea6\u7684\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff08AUC 0.75\uff09\u3002\u57fa\u4e8eCT\u4f53\u79ef\u548c\u5206\u5272\u884d\u751f\u56fe\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff08AUC\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.922\u548c0.926\uff09\u3002\u6574\u5408\u6240\u6709\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u96c6\u6210\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff08AUC 0.9407\uff1b95% CI\uff0c0.930--0.951\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u4e0e\u5df2\u77e5SDH\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u4e0a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u51c6\u786e\u7684SDH\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u6574\u5408\u5230\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u7b80\u5316\u5206\u8bca\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5e72\u9884\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8SDH\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

Although recent studies have explored hyperbolic representations for better tackling the representation gap between different views, they focus primarily on instance-level alignment and neglect global semantic consistency, rendering them vulnerable to view-specific information (\\textit{e.g.}, noise and cross-view discrepancies). To this end, this paper proposes a novel Wasserstein-Aligned Hyperbolic (WAH) framework for multi-view clustering. Specifically, our method exploits a view-specific hyperbolic encoder for each view to embed features into the Lorentz manifold for hierarchical semantic modeling.

Our key idea is to generate cross-view consistent image pairs that are well-aligned with the source and target point clouds, enabling geometry-color feature fusion to facilitate robust matching. To ensure high-quality matching, the generated image pair should feature both 2D-3D geometric consistency and cross-view texture consistency. To achieve this, we introduce Match-ControlNet, a matching-specific, controllable 2D generative model. Specifically, it leverages the depth-conditioned generation capability of ControlNet to produce images that are geometrically aligned with depth maps derived from point clouds, ensuring 2D-3D geometric consistency. Additionally, by incorporating a coupled conditional denoising scheme and coupled prompt guidance, Match-ControlNet further promotes cross-view feature interaction, guiding texture consistency generation.

Due to the lack of ground-truth paired swapping data, prior methods typically train on cross-frame pairs of the same person within a video and rely on mask-based inpainting to mitigate identity leakage. Beyond potential boundary artifacts, this paradigm struggles to recover essential cues occluded by the mask, such as facial pose, expressions, and motion dynamics. To address these issues, we prompt a video editing model to synthesize new heads for existing videos as fake swapping inputs, while maintaining frame-synchronized facial poses and expressions. This yields HeadSwapBench, the first cross-identity paired dataset for video head swapping, which supports both training (\\TrainNum{} videos) and benchmarking (\\TestNum{} videos) with genuine outputs. Leveraging this paired supervision, we propose DirectSwap, a mask-free, direct video head-swapping framework that extends an image U-Net into a video diffusion model with a motion module and conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce the Motion- and Expression-Aware Reconstruction (MEAR) loss, which reweights the diffusion loss per pixel using frame-difference magnitudes and facial-landmark proximity, thereby enhancing cross-frame coherence in motion and expressions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectSwap achieves state-of-the-art visual quality, identity fidelity, and motion and expression consistency across diverse in-the-wild video scenes.

To extract these features, we design the Motion and Appearance Feature Extractor (MAFE), which disentangles motion and appearance representations from videos. Feature learning is further enhanced by two auxiliary objectives: a re-identification loss guided by pseudo appearance features and an optical flow loss guided by pseudo flow fields. Evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, MCDM achieves competitive video generation performance, producing temporally coherent and clinically realistic sequences without reliance on manual labels.

However, these models often neglect fine-grained details, such as which kind of anomalies, like \"hole\", \"cut\", \"scratch\" that could provide more specific insight into the nature of anomalies. We argue that recognizing fine-grained anomaly types 1) enriches the representation of \"abnormal\" with structured semantics, narrowing the gap between coarse anomaly signals and fine-grained defect categories; 2) enables manufacturers to understand the root causes of the anomaly and implement more targeted and appropriate corrective measures quickly. While incorporating such detailed semantic information is crucial, designing handcrafted prompts for each defect type is both time-consuming and susceptible to human bias. For this reason, we introduce DAPO, a novel approach for Defect-aware Prompt Optimization based on progressive tuning for the zero-shot multi-type and binary anomaly detection and segmentation under distribution shifts. Our approach aligns anomaly-relevant image features with their corresponding text semantics by learning hybrid defect-aware prompts with both fixed textual anchors and learnable token embeddings. We conducted experiments on public benchmarks (MPDD, VisA, MVTec-AD, MAD, and Real-IAD) and an internal dataset.

Multispectral images (MSIs) capture additional spectral cues across multiple bands, offering a promising alternative. However, the lack of training data has been the primary bottleneck to exploiting the potential of MSIs. To address this gap, we introduce the first large-scale dataset for Multispectral Object Detection in Aerial images (MODA), which comprises 14,041 MSIs and 330,191 annotations across diverse, challenging scenarios, providing a comprehensive data foundation for this field. Furthermore, to overcome challenges inherent to aerial object detection using MSIs, we propose OSSDet, a framework that integrates spectral and spatial information with object-aware cues.

CNN-based SSL struggles to capture disease patterns that evolve continuously along leaf structures, while transformer-based SSL introduces quadratic attention cost from high-resolution patches. To address these limitations, we propose StateSpace-SSL, a linear-time SSL framework that employs a Vision Mamba state-space encoder to model long-range lesion continuity through directional scanning across the leaf surface. A prototype-driven teacher-student objective aligns representations across multiple views, encouraging stable and lesion-aware features from labelled data. Experiments on three publicly available plant disease datasets show that StateSpace-SSL consistently outperforms the CNN- and transformer-based SSL baselines in various evaluation metrics.

However, due to the small size and the lack of intrinsic features of infrared small targets, the existing methods generally have the problem of inaccurate edge positioning and the target is easily submerged by the background. Therefore, we propose an innovative gradient-guided learning network (GGL-Net). Specifically, we are the first to explore the introduction of gradient magnitude images into the deep learning-based infrared small target detection method, which is conducive to emphasizing the edge details and alleviating the problem of inaccurate edge positioning of small targets. On this basis, we propose a novel dual-branch feature extraction network that utilizes the proposed gradient supplementary module (GSM) to encode raw gradient information into deeper network layers and embeds attention mechanisms reasonably to enhance feature extraction ability. In addition, we construct a two-way guidance fusion module (TGFM), which fully considers the characteristics of feature maps at different levels. It can facilitate the effective fusion of multi-scale feature maps and extract richer semantic information and detailed information through reasonable two-way guidance.

To assist in such planning, we address the challenge of predicting a patient-specific reconstruction target from a CT of the fractured tibia. Our ap- proach combines neural registration and autoencoder models. Specifically, we first train a modified spatial transformer network (STN) to register a raw CT to a standardized coordinate system of a jointly trained tibia prototype. Subsequently, various autoencoder (AE) architectures are trained to model healthy tibial varia- tions. Both the STN and AE models are further designed to be robust to masked input, allowing us to apply them to fractured CTs and decode to a prediction of the patient-specific healthy bone in standard coordinates. Our contributions include: i) a 3D-adapted STN for global spatial registration, ii) a comparative analysis of AEs for bone CT modeling, and iii) the extension of both to handle masked inputs for predictive generation of healthy bone structures.

However, these models often produce textual descriptions that contradict their final quality predictions, and the predicted scores can change unstably during inference - behaviors not aligned with human reasoning. To understand these issues, we analyze the factors that cause contradictory assessments and instability. We first estimate the relationship between the final quality predictions and the generated visual features, finding that the predictions are not fully grounded in the features and that the logical connection between them is weak. Moreover, decoding intermediate VLM layers shows that the model frequently relies on a limited set of candidate tokens, which contributes to prediction instability. To encourage more human-like reasoning, we introduce a two-stage tuning method that explicitly separates visual perception from quality inference. In the first stage, the model learns visual features; in the second, it infers quality solely from these features. Experiments on SPAQ and KONIQ demonstrate that our approach reduces prediction instability from 22.00% to 12.39% and achieves average gains of 0.3124/0.3507 in SRCC/PLCC across LIVE, CSIQ, SPAQ, and KONIQ compared to the baseline.

This raises an essential question: do MLLM-based IQA systems truly perceive the visual features that matter? To examine this issue, we introduce a low-level distortion perception task that requires models to classify specific distortion types.

Existing approaches mainly rely on uniform pixel-wise color mapping across entire images, neglecting the inherent color variations induced by image content. This limitation hinders existing approaches from achieving adaptive retouching that accommodates both diverse color distributions and user-defined style preferences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Content-Adaptive image retouching method guided by Attribute-based Text Representation (CA-ATP). Specifically, we propose a content-adaptive curve mapping module, which leverages a series of basis curves to establish multiple color mapping relationships and learns the corresponding weight maps, enabling content-aware color adjustments. The proposed module can capture color diversity within the image content, allowing similar color values to receive distinct transformations based on their spatial context. In addition, we propose an attribute text prediction module that generates text representations from multiple image attributes, which explicitly represent user-defined style preferences. These attribute-based text representations are subsequently integrated with visual features via a multimodal model, providing user-friendly guidance for image retouching.

We present UnReflectAnything, an RGB-only framework that removes highlights from a single image by predicting a highlight map together with a reflection-free diffuse reconstruction. The model uses a frozen vision transformer encoder to extract multi-scale features, a lightweight head to localize specular regions, and a token-level inpainting module that restores corrupted feature patches before producing the final diffuse image. To overcome the lack of paired supervision, we introduce a Virtual Highlight Synthesis pipeline that renders physically plausible specularities using monocular geometry, Fresnel-aware shading, and randomized lighting which enables training on arbitrary RGB images with correct geometric structure. UnReflectAnything generalizes across natural and surgical domains where non-Lambertian surfaces and non-uniform lighting create severe highlights and it achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks.

However, compared to meshes or radiance fields, existing multiview diffusion models offer limited appearance manipulation, particularly in terms of material, texture, or style.\n  In this paper, we present a lightweight adaptation technique for appearance transfer in multiview diffusion models. Our method learns to combine object identity from an input image with appearance cues rendered in a separate reference image, producing multi-view-consistent output that reflects the desired materials, textures, or styles. This allows explicit specification of appearance parameters at generation time while preserving the underlying object geometry and view coherence. We leverage three diffusion denoising processes responsible for generating the original object, the reference, and the target images, and perform reverse sampling to aggregate a small subset of layer-wise self-attention features from the object and the reference to influence the target generation. Our method requires only a few training examples to introduce appearance awareness to pretrained multiview models. The experiments show that our method provides a simple yet effective way toward multiview generation with diverse appearance, advocating the adoption of implicit generative 3D representations in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u8c61\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6750\u6599\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u6216\u6837\u5f0f\u7b49\u5916\u89c2\u64cd\u4f5c\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u50cf\u7f51\u683c\u6216\u8f90\u5c04\u573a\u90a3\u6837\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u6269\u6563\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u8d1f\u8d23\u751f\u6210\u539f\u59cb\u5bf9\u8c61\u3001\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5411\u91c7\u6837\u805a\u5408\u4e00\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u5c42\u95f4\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f71\u54cd\u76ee\u6807\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u4e3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5165\u5916\u89c2\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u57fa\u7840\u5bf9\u8c61\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

Our research concentrates on a fundamental sub-problem: the fine-grained classification of atomic interaction states, namely 'approaching', 'grabbing', and 'holding'. To this end, we introduce a structured data engineering process that converts raw videos from the MANIAC dataset into 27,476 statistical-kinematic feature vectors. Each vector encapsulates relational and dynamic properties from a short temporal window of motion. Our initial hypothesis posited that sequential modeling would be critical, leading us to compare static classifiers (MLPs) against temporal models (RNNs). Counter-intuitively, the key discovery occurred when we set the sequence length of a Bidirectional RNN to one (seq_length=1). This modification converted the network's function, compelling it to act as a high-capacity static feature encoder.

However, leveraging real-world imaging data in clinical research environments is still hampered by strict regulatory constraints, fragmented software infrastructure, and the challenges inherent in conducting large-cohort multicentre studies. This leads to projects that rely on ad-hoc toolchains that are hard to reproduce, difficult to scale beyond single institutions and poorly suited for collaboration between clinicians and data scientists. We present Kaapana, a comprehensive open-source platform for medical imaging research that is designed to bridge this gap. Rather than building single-use, site-specific tooling, Kaapana provides a modular, extensible framework that unifies data ingestion, cohort curation, processing workflows and result inspection under a common user interface. By bringing the algorithm to the data, it enables institutions to keep control over their sensitive data while still participating in distributed experimentation and model development. By integrating flexible workflow orchestration with user-facing applications for researchers, Kaapana reduces technical overhead, improves reproducibility and enables conducting large-scale, collaborative, multi-centre imaging studies. We describe the core concepts of the platform and illustrate how they can support diverse use cases, from local prototyping to nation-wide research networks.

Incorporating controllability in video generation further adds to the complexity. Existing controllable video generation approaches face a trade-off: sparse controls like keypoint trajectories are easy to specify but lack instance-awareness, while dense signals such as optical flow, depths or 3D meshes are informative but costly to obtain. We propose VHOI, a two-stage framework that first densifies sparse trajectories into HOI mask sequences, and then fine-tunes a video diffusion model conditioned on these dense masks. We introduce a novel HOI-aware motion representation that uses color encodings to distinguish not only human and object motion, but also body-part-specific dynamics. This design incorporates a human prior into the conditioning signal and strengthens the model's ability to understand and generate realistic HOI dynamics. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results in controllable HOI video generation. VHOI is not limited to interaction-only scenarios and can also generate full human navigation leading up to object interactions in an end-to-end manner.

However, their capability in understanding infrared images remains unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce IF-Bench, the first high-quality benchmark designed for evaluating multimodal understanding of infrared images. IF-Bench consists of 499 images sourced from 23 infrared datasets and 680 carefully curated visual question-answer pairs, covering 10 essential dimensions of image understanding. Based on this benchmark, we systematically evaluate over 40 open-source and closed-source MLLMs, employing cyclic evaluation, bilingual assessment, and hybrid judgment strategies to enhance the reliability of the results. Our analysis reveals how model scale, architecture, and inference paradigms affect infrared image comprehension, providing valuable insights for this area. Furthermore, we propose a training-free generative visual prompting (GenViP) method, which leverages advanced image editing models to translate infrared images into semantically and spatially aligned RGB counterparts, thereby mitigating domain distribution shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently yields significant performance improvements across a wide range of MLLMs. The benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/casiatao/IF-Bench.", "AI": {"tldr": "IF-Bench\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f3040+\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u7684GenViP\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u5728\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u9700\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86IF-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u548cGenViP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5faa\u73af\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u53cc\u8bed\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u5224\u65ad\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8640\u591a\u4e2aMLLMs\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0cGenViP\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "IF-Bench\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7GenViP\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9d\u8d35\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a fully automated Tip-and-Cue framework designed for satellite imaging tasking and scheduling.

Corresponding cues are the imaging tasks formulated in response, which incorporate sensor constraints, timing requirements, and utility functions. The system autonomously generates candidate tasks, optimizes their scheduling across multiple satellites using continuous utility functions that reflect the expected value of each observation, and processes the resulting imagery using artificial-intelligence-based models, including object detectors and vision-language models. Structured visual reports are generated to support both interpretability and the identification of new insights for downstream tasking. The efficacy of the framework is demonstrated through a maritime vessel tracking scenario, utilizing Automatic Identification System (AIS) data for trajectory prediction, targeted observations, and the generation of actionable outputs.

However, previous studies show that generated images often resemble the training data, and this problem becomes more severe as the model size increases. Memorizing training data can lead to legal challenges, including copyright infringement, violations of portrait rights, and trademark violations. Existing approaches to mitigating memorization mainly focus on manipulating the denoising sampling process to steer image embeddings away from the memorized embedding space or employ unlearning methods that require training on datasets containing specific sets of memorized concepts. However, existing methods often incur substantial computational overhead during sampling, or focus narrowly on removing one or more groups of target concepts, imposing a significant limitation on their scalability. To understand and mitigate these problems, our work, UniForget, offers a new perspective on understanding the root cause of memorization. Our work demonstrates that specific parts of the model are responsible for copyrighted content generation. By applying model pruning, we can effectively suppress the probability of generating copyrighted content without targeting specific concepts while preserving the general generative capabilities of the model.

Standard architectures utilizing stride-32 (P5) layers often fail to resolve narrow vessels, resulting in spatial feature dilution. In this work, we propose LiM-YOLO, a specialized detector designed to resolve these domain-specific conflicts. Based on a statistical analysis of ship scales, we introduce a Pyramid Level Shift Strategy that reconfigures the detection head to P2-P4. This shift ensures compliance with Nyquist sampling criteria for small objects while eliminating the computational redundancy of deep layers.

Created using style transfer techniques from 12 subject classification datasets, SMA provides a diverse and extensive set of 4800 groups, combining various subjects (objects, plants, animals, human actions, textures) with multiple styles. SMA enables flexible control over groups and classes, allowing us to configure datasets to reflect diverse benchmark scenarios. While ideally, data collection would capture extensive group diversity, practical constraints often make this infeasible. SMA addresses this by enabling large and configurable group structures through flexible control over styles, subject classes, and domains-allowing datasets to reflect a wide range of real-world benchmark scenarios. This design not only expands group and class diversity, but also opens new methodological directions for evaluating model performance across diverse group and domain configurations-including scenarios with many minority groups, varying group imbalance, and complex domain shifts-and for studying fairness, robustness, and adaptation under a broader range of realistic conditions. To demonstrate SMA's effectiveness, we implemented two benchmarks: (1) a novel OOD generalization and group fairness benchmark leveraging SMA's domain, class, and group diversity to evaluate existing benchmarks. Our findings reveal that while simple balancing and algorithms utilizing group information remain competitive as claimed in previous benchmarks, increasing group diversity significantly impacts fairness, altering the superiority and relative rankings of algorithms. We also propose to use \\textit{Top-M worst group accuracy} as a new hyperparameter tuning metric, demonstrating broader fairness during optimization and delivering better final worst-group accuracy for larger group diversity. (2) An unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) benchmark utilizing SMA's group diversity to evaluate UDA algorithms across more scenarios, offering a more comprehensive benchmark with lower error bars (reduced by 73\\% and 28\\% in closed-set setting and UniDA setting, respectively) compared to existing efforts.

Preprint version", "summary": "Estimating the 6-degrees-of-freedom (6DoF) pose of a spacecraft from a single image is critical for autonomous operations like in-orbit servicing and space debris removal. Existing state-of-the-art methods often rely on iterative Perspective-n-Point (PnP)-based algorithms, which are computationally intensive and ill-suited for real-time deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To overcome these limitations, we propose FastPose-ViT, a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architecture that directly regresses the 6DoF pose. Our approach processes cropped images from object bounding boxes and introduces a novel mathematical formalism to map these localized predictions back to the full-image scale. This formalism is derived from the principles of projective geometry and the concept of \"apparent rotation\", where the model predicts an apparent rotation matrix that is then corrected to find the true orientation. We demonstrate that our method outperforms other non-PnP strategies and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art PnP-based techniques on the SPEED dataset. Furthermore, we validate our model's suitability for real-world space missions by quantizing it and deploying it on power-constrained edge hardware.

A prominent interest pertains to the integration of an image prompt adapter to facilitate zero-shot PT2I without test-time fine-tuning. However, current methods grapple with three fundamental challenges: 1. the elusive equilibrium between Concept Preservation (CP) and Prompt Following (PF), 2. the difficulty in retaining fine-grained concept details in reference images, and 3. the restricted scalability to extend to multi-subject personalization. To tackle these challenges, we present Dynamic Image Prompt Adapter (DynaIP), a cutting-edge plugin to enhance the fine-grained concept fidelity, CP-PF balance, and subject scalability of SOTA T2I multimodal diffusion transformers (MM-DiT) for PT2I generation. Our key finding is that MM-DiT inherently exhibit decoupling learning behavior when injecting reference image features into its dual branches via cross attentions. Based on this, we design an innovative Dynamic Decoupling Strategy that removes the interference of concept-agnostic information during inference, significantly enhancing the CP-PF balance and further bolstering the scalability of multi-subject compositions. Moreover, we identify the visual encoder as a key factor affecting fine-grained CP and reveal that the hierarchical features of commonly used CLIP can capture visual information at diverse granularity levels. Therefore, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts Feature Fusion Module to fully leverage the hierarchical features of CLIP, remarkably elevating the fine-grained concept fidelity while also providing flexible control of visual granularity.

The critical challenges are how to model the spectral prior distribution and spectral variability.

Considering the key challenges and the advantages of the Bayesian framework, a novel method using a diffusion posterior sampler for semiblind unmixing, denoted as DPS4Un, is proposed to deal with these challenges with the following features: (1) we view the pretrained conditional spectrum diffusion model as a posterior sampler, which can combine the learned endmember prior with observation to get the refined abundance distribution. (2) Instead of using the existing spectral library as prior, which may raise bias, we establish the image-based endmember bundles within superpixels, which are used to train the endmember prior learner with diffusion model. Superpixels make sure the sub-scene is more homogeneous. (3) Instead of using the image-level data consistency constraint, the superpixel-based data fidelity term is proposed. (4) The endmember is initialized as Gaussian noise for each superpixel region, DPS4Un iteratively updates the abundance and endmember, contributing to spectral variability modeling.

We introduce a novel benchmarking framework centered on synthetically generated PDFs with precise LaTeX ground truth, enabling systematic control over layout, formulas, and content characteristics. A key methodological contribution is pioneering LLM-as-a-judge for semantic formula assessment, combined with a robust two-stage matching pipeline that handles parser output inconsistencies. Through human validation on 250 formula pairs (750 ratings from 30 evaluators), we demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation achieves substantially higher correlation with human judgment (Pearson r=0.78) compared to CDM (r=0.34) and text similarity (r~0). Evaluating 20+ contemporary PDF parsers (including specialized OCR models, vision-language models, and rule-based approaches) across 100 synthetic documents with 2,000+ formulas reveals significant performance disparities. Our findings provide crucial insights for practitioners selecting parsers for downstream applications and establish a robust, scalable methodology that enables reproducible evaluation of PDF formula extraction quality.

This direction offers efficient rendering and seamless integration with diffusion-based pipelines. However, these methods face a fundamental limitation: The VAE latent space lacks multi-view consistency, leading to blurred textures and missing details during 3D reconstruction. Existing approaches attempt to address this by fine-tuning the VAE, at the cost of reconstruction quality, or by relying on pre-trained diffusion models to recover fine-grained details, at the risk of some hallucinations. We present Splatent, a diffusion-based enhancement framework designed to operate on top of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in the latent space of VAEs. Our key insight departs from the conventional 3D-centric view: rather than reconstructing fine-grained details in 3D space, we recover them in 2D from input views through multi-view attention mechanisms. This approach preserves the reconstruction quality of pretrained VAEs while achieving faithful detail recovery. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, Splatent establishes a new state-of-the-art for VAE latent radiance field reconstruction.

We attribute this gap to two factors: 1) existing datasets are inadequate for training and evaluating reasoning-aware video editing, and 2) an inherent disconnect between the models' reasoning and editing capabilities, which prevents the rich understanding from effectively instructing the editing process. Bridging this gap requires an integrated framework that connects reasoning with visual transformation. To address this gap, we introduce the Reason-Informed Video Editing (RVE) task, which requires reasoning about physical plausibility and causal dynamics during editing. To support systematic evaluation, we construct RVE-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with two complementary subsets: Reasoning-Informed Video Editing and In-Context Video Generation. These subsets cover diverse reasoning dimensions and real-world editing scenarios. Building upon this foundation, we propose the ReViSE, a Self-Reflective Reasoning (SRF) framework that unifies generation and evaluation within a single architecture.

However, these methods degrade sharply under sparse-view settings, where limited observations lead to severe ambiguity between geometry, reflectance, and lighting. We introduce GAINS (Gaussian-based Inverse rendering from Sparse multi-view captures), a two-stage inverse rendering framework that leverages learning-based priors to stabilize geometry and material estimation. GAINS first refines geometry using monocular depth/normal and diffusion priors, then employs segmentation, intrinsic image decomposition (IID), and diffusion priors to regularize material recovery. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that GAINS significantly improves material parameter accuracy, relighting quality, and novel-view synthesis compared to state-of-the-art Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods, especially under sparse-view settings.
