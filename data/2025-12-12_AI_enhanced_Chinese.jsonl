But this benchmark may overlap with model training data. If that is true, scores may reflect training recall, not issue-solving skill. To study this, we test two Claude models that frequently appear in top-performing agents submitted to the benchmark. We ask them to find relevant files using only issue text, and then issue text plus file paths. We then run the same setup on BeetleBox and SWE-rebench. Despite both benchmarks involving popular open-source Python projects, models performed 3 times better on SWE-Bench-Verified. They were also 6 times better at finding edited files, without any additional context about the projects themselves. This gap suggests the models may have seen many SWE-Bench-Verified tasks during training. As a result, scores on this benchmark may not reflect an agent's ability to handle real software issues, yet it continues to be used in ways that can misrepresent progress and lead to choices that favour agents that use certain models over strong agent design. Our setup tests the localization step with minimal context to the extent that the task should be logically impossible to solve.

We show that the underlying idea generalizes to a broad class of dynamic programs with local dependencies on directed acyclic graphs (DP DAGs). Modeling a DP as deterministic time evolution over a topologically ordered DAG with frontier width $\u03c9$ and bounded in-degree, and assuming a max-type semiring with deterministic tie breaking, we prove that in a standard offline random-access model any such DP admits deterministic traceback in space $O(\u03c9\\log T + (\\log T)^{O(1)})$ cells over a fixed finite alphabet, where $T$ is the number of states. Our construction replaces backward dynamic programs by forward-only recomputation and organizes the time order into a height-compressed recursion tree whose nodes expose small \"middle frontiers'' across which every optimal path must pass. The framework yields near-optimal traceback bounds for asymmetric and banded sequence alignment, one-dimensional recurrences, and dynamic-programming formulations on graphs of bounded pathwidth. We also show that an $\u03a9(\u03c9)$ space term (in bits) is unavoidable in forward single-pass models and discuss conjectured $\\sqrt{T}$-type barriers in streaming settings, supporting the view that space-efficient traceback is a structural property of width-bounded DP DAGs rather than a peculiarity of grid-based algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e86Hirschberg\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u5177\u6709\u5c40\u90e8\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u904d\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ffd\u8e2a\u56de\u9000\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63a8\u5e7fHirschberg\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u5177\u6709\u5c40\u90e8\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u904d\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06DP\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u6709\u5e8f\u7684DAG\u4e0a\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u524d\u5411\u91cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u66ff\u4ee3\u540e\u5411\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u9ad8\u5ea6\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u6811\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u79bb\u7ebf\u968f\u673a\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4efb\u4f55\u6b64\u7c7bDP\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u6709\u9650\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u4e0a\u4ee5$O(\u03c9\\log T + (\\log T)^{O(1)})$\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8ffd\u8e2a\u56de\u9000\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ffd\u8e2a\u56de\u9000\u662f\u5bbd\u5ea6\u53d7\u9650\u7684DP DAGs\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Recent dynamic view synthesis methods achieve high-quality rendering but often produce physically implausible motions. We introduce NeHaD, a neural deformation field for dynamic Gaussian Splatting governed by Hamiltonian mechanics. Our key observation is that existing methods using MLPs to predict deformation fields introduce inevitable biases, resulting in unnatural dynamics. By incorporating physics priors, we achieve robust and realistic dynamic scene rendering. Hamiltonian mechanics provides an ideal framework for modeling Gaussian deformation fields due to their shared phase-space structure, where primitives evolve along energy-conserving trajectories. We employ Hamiltonian neural networks to implicitly learn underlying physical laws governing deformation. Meanwhile, we introduce Boltzmann equilibrium decomposition, an energy-aware mechanism that adaptively separates static and dynamic Gaussians based on their spatial-temporal energy states for flexible rendering. To handle real-world dissipation, we employ second-order symplectic integration and local rigidity regularization as physics-informed constraints for robust dynamics modeling. Additionally, we extend NeHaD to adaptive streaming through scale-aware mipmapping and progressive optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NeHaD achieves physically plausible results with a rendering quality-efficiency trade-off. To our knowledge, this is the first exploration leveraging Hamiltonian mechanics for neural Gaussian deformation, enabling physically realistic dynamic scene rendering with streaming capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeHaD\u9996\u6b21\u5229\u7528\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u9ad8\u65af\u53d8\u5f62\u573a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u5b9e\u52a8\u6001\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6d41\u5f0f\u4f20\u8f93\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u4f46\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u5bfc\u81f4\u53d8\u5f62\u573a\u9884\u6d4b\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u53d8\u5f62\u573a\u7684\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Boltzmann\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u89e3\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u79bb\u9759\u6001\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u9ad8\u65af\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u9636\u8f9b\u79ef\u5206\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u521a\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5904\u7406\u5b9e\u9645\u8017\u6563\u3002", "result": "NeHaD\u5728\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6d41\u5f0f\u4f20\u8f93\u3002", "conclusion": "NeHaD\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u529b\u5b66\u548cBoltzmann\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u9ad8\u65af\u53d8\u5f62\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6d41\u5f0f\u4f20\u8f93\u3002"}}

Such capabilities are vital for enabling seamless and responsive interaction in emerging technologies like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), where understanding user gaze is key to immersion and interface design. Neuromorphic sensors and spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative, yet existing SNN approaches are either too specialized or fall short of the performance of modern ANN architectures. This paper presents a neuromorphic version of top-performing event-based eye-tracking models, replacing their recurrent and attention modules with lightweight LIF layers and exploiting depth-wise separable convolutions to reduce model complexity. Our models obtain 3.7-4.1px mean error, approaching the accuracy of the application-specific neuromorphic system, Retina (3.24px), while reducing model size by 20x and theoretical compute by 850x, compared to the closest ANN variant of the proposed model. These efficient variants are projected to operate at an estimated 3.9-4.9 mW with 3 ms latency at 1 kHz.

We've developed ExaCraft, an AI system that generates personalized examples by adapting to the learner's dynamic context. Through the Google Gemini AI and Python Flask API, accessible via a Chrome extension, ExaCraft combines user-defined profiles (including location, education, profession, and complexity preferences) with real-time analysis of learner behavior. This ensures examples are both culturally relevant and tailored to individual learning needs. The system's core innovation is its ability to adapt to five key aspects of the learning context: indicators of struggle, mastery patterns, topic progression history, session boundaries, and learning progression signals.

In this paper, we introduce, BinSeek, the first two-stage cross-modal retrieval framework for stripped binary code analysis. It consists of two models: BinSeekEmbedding is trained on large-scale dataset to learn the semantic relevance of the binary code and the natural language description, furthermore, BinSeek-Reranker learns to carefully judge the relevance of the candidate code to the description with context augmentation. To this end, we built an LLM-based data synthesis pipeline to automate training construction, also deriving a domain benchmark for future research.

As corollaries of our results, we obtain efficient algorithms for approximating the number of satisfying assignments of conjunctive normal form formulae and the dimension of satisfying subspaces of quantum satisfiability formulae.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c07\u5c55\u5f00\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8ba1\u6570\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u5f15\u7406\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4ea4\u96c6\u6982\u7387\u548c\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ea4\u96c6\u7ef4\u6570\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5408\u53d6\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c40\u90e8\u5f15\u7406\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u81ea\u7136\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8ba1\u6570\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4ea4\u96c6\u6982\u7387\u548c\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ea4\u96c6\u7ef4\u6570\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7c07\u5c55\u5f00\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4ea4\u6362\u6295\u5f71\u4eea\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6295\u5f71\u4eea\u5206\u522b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5b8c\u5168\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u4eff\u5c04\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u4e3a\u4ea4\u6362\u6295\u5f71\u4eea\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b8c\u5168\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u6295\u5f71\u4eea\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u5168\u5c40\u5305\u542b-\u6392\u9664\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u8c31\u95f4\u9699\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u4eff\u5c04\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c07\u5c55\u5f00\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8ba1\u6570\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u5f15\u7406\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u81ea\u7136\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5b8c\u5168\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u4eff\u5c04\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff09\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u6295\u5f71\u4eea\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5408\u53d6\u8303\u5f0f\u516c\u5f0f\u6ee1\u8db3\u8d4b\u503c\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u516c\u5f0f\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u6570\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose HeRD, a hierarchical reinforcement learning-diffusion policy that decomposes pushing tasks into two levels: high-level goal selection and low-level trajectory generation. We employ a high-level reinforcement learning (RL) agent to select intermediate spatial goals, and a low-level goal-conditioned diffusion model to generate feasible, efficient trajectories to reach them.\n  This architecture combines the long-term reward maximizing behaviour of RL with the generative capabilities of diffusion models. We evaluate our method in a 2D simulation environment and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline in success rate, path efficiency, and generalization across multiple environment configurations.

Accepted to CVPR 2025. Please visit our project page at https://kaist-viclab.github.io/ABBSPO_site/", "summary": "Weakly supervised oriented object detection (WS-OOD) has gained attention as a cost-effective alternative to fully supervised methods, providing both efficiency and high accuracy. Among weakly supervised approaches, horizontal bounding box (HBox)-supervised OOD stands out for its ability to directly leverage existing HBox annotations while achieving the highest accuracy under weak supervision settings. This paper introduces adaptive bounding box scaling and symmetry-prior-based orientation prediction, called ABBSPO, a framework for WS-OOD. Our ABBSPO addresses limitations of previous HBox-supervised OOD methods, which compare ground truth (GT) HBoxes directly with the minimum circumscribed rectangles of predicted RBoxes, often leading to inaccurate scale estimation. To overcome this, we propose: (i) Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling (ABBS), which appropriately scales GT HBoxes to optimize for the size of each predicted RBox, ensuring more accurate scale prediction; and (ii) a Symmetric Prior Angle (SPA) loss that exploits inherent symmetry of aerial objects for self-supervised learning, resolving issues in previous methods where learning collapses when predictions for all three augmented views (original, rotated, and flipped) are consistently incorrect. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ABBSPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "ABBSPO\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u5bf9\u79f0\u5148\u9a8c\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u5b9a\u5411\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709HBox\u76d1\u7763OOD\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2dGT HBoxes\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4bRBoxes\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u65f6\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u7f29\u653e\uff08ABBS\uff09\u548c\u5bf9\u79f0\u5148\u9a8c\u89d2\u5ea6\uff08SPA\uff09\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u4f18\u5316GT HBoxes\u7684\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u7684RBoxes\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5229\u7528\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "ABBSPO\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ABBSPO\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u5bf9\u79f0\u5148\u9a8c\u89d2\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u5b9a\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The framework allows administrators to express access control policies in plain language, which are then translated into vendor specific configurations. A compact schema bound intermediate representation separates human intent from device syntax and in the current prototype compiles to Palo Alto PAN OS command line configuration while remaining extensible to other platforms. Large language models are used only as assistive parsers that generate typed intermediate representation objects, while compilation and enforcement remain deterministic. The prototype integrates three validation layers, namely a static linter that checks structural and vendor specific constraints, a safety gate that blocks overly permissive rules such as any to any allows, and a Batfish based simulator that validates configuration syntax and referential integrity against a synthetic device model.

Although the problems of enumerating maximal $k$-defective cliques and searching a maximum $k$-defective clique have been extensively studied, existing algorithms suffer from limitations such as the combinatorial explosion of small partial solutions and sub-optimal search spaces. To address these limitations, we propose a novel clique-first branch-and-bound framework that first generates cliques and then adds missing edges. Furthermore, we introduce a new pivoting technique that achieves a search space size of $\\mathcal{O}(3^{\\frac{n}{3}} \\cdot n^k)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the input graph. We prove that the worst-case number of maximal $k$-defective cliques is $\u03a9(3^{\\frac{n}{3}} \\cdot n^k)$ when $k$ is a constant, establishing that our algorithm's search space is worst-case optimal. Leveraging the diameter-two property of defective cliques, we further reduce the search space size to $\\mathcal{O}(n \\cdot 3^{\\frac\u03b4{3}} \\cdot (\u03b4\u0394)^k)$, where $\u03b4$ is the degeneracy and $\u0394$ is the maximum degree of the input graph. We also propose an efficient framework for maximum $k$-defective clique search based on our branch-and-bound, together with practical techniques to reduce the search space. Experiments on real-world benchmark datasets with more than 1 million edges demonstrate that each of our proposed algorithms for maximal $k$-defective clique enumeration and maximum $k$-defective clique search outperforms the respective state-of-the-art algorithms by up to four orders of magnitude in terms of processing time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684$k$-\u7f3a\u9677\u56e2\u679a\u4e3e\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7clique-first\u5206\u652f\u5b9a\u754c\u548cpivoting\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf$k$-\u7f3a\u9677\u56e2\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u7206\u70b8\u548c\u6b21\u4f18\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684clique-first\u5206\u652f\u5b9a\u754c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u751f\u6210\u56e2\uff0c\u518d\u6dfb\u52a0\u7f3a\u5931\u8fb9\uff1b\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684pivoting\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u767e\u4e07\u8fb9\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\u5feb\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eclique-first\u5206\u652f\u5b9a\u754c\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u5927$k$-\u7f3a\u9677\u56e2\u679a\u4e3e\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002"}}

We investigate a fundamental question: what aspect of the target representation matters for generation, its \\textit{global} \\revision{semantic} information (e.g., measured by ImageNet-1K accuracy) or its spatial structure (i.e. pairwise cosine similarity between patch tokens)? Prevalent wisdom holds that stronger global semantic performance leads to better generation as a target representation. To study this, we first perform a large-scale empirical analysis across 27 different vision encoders and different model scales. The results are surprising; spatial structure, rather than global performance, drives the generation performance of a target representation. To further study this, we introduce two straightforward modifications, which specifically accentuate the transfer of \\emph{spatial} information. We replace the standard MLP projection layer in REPA with a simple convolution layer and introduce a spatial normalization layer for the external representation. Surprisingly, our simple method (implemented in $<$4 lines of code), termed iREPA, consistently improves convergence speed of REPA, across a diverse set of vision encoders, model sizes, and training variants (such as REPA, REPA-E, Meanflow, JiT etc). %, etc. Our work motivates revisiting the fundamental working mechanism of representational alignment and how it can be leveraged for improved training of generative models.

Inverse kinematics algorithms can solve this in a fast, reactive framework, but these techniques are underutilised over the more computationally expensive offline planning methods. We propose a novel algorithm to solve functionally redundant inverse kinematics for robotic manipulation utilising a task space decomposition approach, the damped least-squares method and Halley's method to achieve fast and robust solutions with reduced joint motion. We evaluate our methodology in the case of toolpath optimisation in a cold spray coating application on a non-planar surface.

To evaluate CloudFix, we curated a dataset of 282 real-world AWS access control policies extracted from forum posts and augmented them with synthetically generated request sets based on real scenarios. Our experimental results show that CloudFix improves repair accuracy over a Baseline implementation across varying request sizes.

By doing so, we combine the bidirectional and refining capabilities of the former with the strong linguistic structure provided by the latter. To showcase its effectiveness, we present Show, Suggest and Tell (SST), which achieves State-of-the-Art results on COCO, among models in a similar setting. In particular, SST achieves 125.1 CIDEr-D on the COCO dataset without Reinforcement Learning, outperforming both autoregressive and diffusion model State-of-the-Art results by 1.5 and 2.5 points.

In the first stage, we employ large language models (LLMs) to independently evaluate retrieved articles and compute an aggregated agreement score that reflects the overall evidence stance. When this score indicates insufficient consensus-falling below a predefined threshold-the system proceeds to a second stage.

However, this approach does not extend to wireless multi-hop networks, where the assumptions of fixed link capacity and linear cost structure collapse due to contention for shared spectrum resources. The key challenge is that the long-term capacity of a wireless link becomes a non-linear function of its network context, including network topology, link quality, and the traffic assigned to neighboring links. In this work, we pursue a new direction of modeling wireless network under randomized medium access control by developing an analytical network digital twin (NDT) that predicts link duty cycles from network context. We generalize randomized contention as finding a Maximal Independent Set (MIS) on the conflict graph using weighted Luby's algorithm, derive an analytical model of link duty cycles, and introduce an iterative procedure that resolves the circular dependency among duty cycle, link capacity, and contention probability. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed NDT accurately predicts link duty cycles and congestion patterns with up to a 5000x speedup over packet-level simulation, and enables us to optimize link scheduling using gradient descent for reduced congestion and radio footprint.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\uff08NDT\uff09\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u94fe\u8def\u5360\u7a7a\u6bd4\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6709\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u8def\u7531\u548c\u6d41\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u6210\u672c\u6d41\u516c\u5f0f\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u7ebf\u591a\u8df3\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5171\u4eab\u9891\u8c31\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u5bfc\u81f4\u56fa\u5b9a\u94fe\u8def\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u6210\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u5931\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u52a0\u6743Luby\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u56fe\u4e0a\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u5927\u72ec\u7acb\u96c6\uff08MIS\uff09\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u94fe\u8def\u5360\u7a7a\u6bd4\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u8fed\u4ee3\u7a0b\u5e8f\u89e3\u51b3\u5360\u7a7a\u6bd4\u3001\u94fe\u8def\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u6982\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684NDT\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u94fe\u8def\u5360\u7a7a\u6bd4\u548c\u62e5\u585e\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u5305\u7ea7\u6a21\u62df\u5feb5000\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u4f18\u5316\u94fe\u8def\u8c03\u5ea6\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u62e5\u585e\u548c\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u8db3\u8ff9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u53d1\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\uff08NDT\uff09\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u94fe\u8def\u5360\u7a7a\u6bd4\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u62e5\u585e\u548c\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u8db3\u8ff9\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether existing approaches can effectively leverage such hybrid queries, particularly in cross-language contexts. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study of representative code models and reveal three challenges: (1) insufficient semantic understanding; (2) inefficient fusion in hybrid code retrieval; and (3) weak generalization in cross-language scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose UniCoR, a novel self-supervised framework that learns Unified Code Representations framework designed to learn unified and robust code representations. Firstly, we design a multi-perspective supervised contrastive learning module to enhance semantic understanding and modality fusion. It aligns representations from multiple perspectives, including code-to-code, natural language-to-code, and natural language-to-natural language, enforcing the model to capture a semantic essence among modalities. Secondly, we introduce a representation distribution consistency learning module to improve cross-language generalization, which explicitly aligns the feature distributions of different programming languages, enabling language-agnostic representation learning. Extensive experiments on both empirical benchmark and large-scale benchmark show that UniCoR outperforms all baseline models, achieving an average improvement of 8.64% in MRR and 11.54% in MAP over the best-performing baseline.

In this setting, all edges of the input graph are randomly partitioned between Alice and Bob, and the state-of-the-art result is a fairly involved $5/6$-approximation protocol that is based on the computation of edge-degree constrained subgraphs [Azarmehr, Behnezhad, ICALP'23]. Our protocol also immediately yields a $3/4$-approximation in the fully robust setting. One may wonder whether an improved analysis of our protocol in the fully robust setting is possible: While we cannot rule this out, we give an instance where our protocol only achieves a $0.832 < 5/6 = 0.83$-approximation.

Among systems leveraging this, magnetic field-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems are particularly attractive because they can provide positioning information and build a magnetic field map on the fly. Moreover, they have bounded error within mapped regions. However, state-of-the-art methods typically require low-drift odometry data provided by visual odometry or a wheel encoder, etc. This is because these systems need to minimize/reduce positioning errors while exploring, which happens when they are in unmapped regions. To address these limitations, this work proposes a loosely coupled and a tightly coupled inertial magnetic SLAM (IM-SLAM) system. The proposed systems use commonly available low-cost sensors: an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a magnetometer array, and a barometer. The use of non-visual data provides a significant advantage over visual-based systems, making it robust to low-visibility conditions. Both systems employ state-space representations, and magnetic field models on different scales. The difference lies in how they use a local and global magnetic field model. The loosely coupled system uses these models separately in two state-space models, while the tightly coupled system integrates them into one state-space model. Experiment results show that the tightly coupled IM-SLAM system achieves lower positioning errors than the loosely coupled system in most scenarios, with typical errors on the order of meters per 100 meters traveled. These results demonstrate the feasiblity of developing a full 3D IM-SLAM systems using low-cost sensors and the potential of applying these systems in emergency response scenarios such as mine/fire rescue.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cdIM-SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u677e\u6563\u8026\u5408\u548c\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5b9e\u73b03D\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5efa\u56fe\uff0c\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u80fd\u89c1\u5ea6\u5e94\u6025\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u78c1SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u4f4e\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u89c6\u89c9\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u6216\u8f6e\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5728\u672a\u6620\u5c04\u533a\u57df\u63a2\u7d22\u65f6\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u7684SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u80fd\u89c1\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u677e\u6563\u8026\u5408\u548c\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\u7684\u60ef\u6027\u78c1SLAM\uff08IM-SLAM\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u60ef\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u5355\u5143\uff08IMU\uff09\u3001\u78c1\u529b\u8ba1\u9635\u5217\u548c\u6c14\u538b\u8ba1\u7b49\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3002\u677e\u6563\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5206\u522b\u4f7f\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u78c1\u573a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u5219\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408IM-SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u5178\u578b\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a\u6bcf100\u7c73\u884c\u8fdb\u7c73\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5f00\u53d1\u5b8c\u65743D IM-SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u77ff\u4e95/\u706b\u707e\u6551\u63f4\u7b49\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, in the context of decentralized data access within Web3.0, it is imperative to cope with efficiency concerns caused by the replication of redundant data, as well as security vulnerabilities caused by data inconsistency. To address these challenges, we develop a Trustworthy Decentralized Cooperative Caching (TDC-Cache) framework for Web3.0 to ensure efficient caching and enhance system resilience against adversarial threats. This framework features a two-layer architecture, wherein the Decentralized Oracle Network (DON) layer serves as a trusted intermediary platform for decentralized caching, bridging the contents from decentralized storage and the content requests from users. In light of the complexity of Web3.0 network topologies and data flows, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Decentralized Caching (DRL-DC) for TDC-Cache to dynamically optimize caching strategies of distributed oracles. Furthermore, we develop a Proof of Cooperative Learning (PoCL) consensus to maintain the consistency of decentralized caching decisions within DON. Experimental results show that, compared with existing approaches, the proposed framework reduces average access latency by 20%, increases the cache hit rate by at most 18%, and improves the average success consensus rate by 10%.

While recent foundation models for echocardiography can achieve strong performance on individual perceptual subtasks such as view classification, segmentation, or disease prediction, they typically operate in isolation and do not provide a unified, clinically coherent assessment. In this work, we introduce Echo-CoPilot, a multi-view, multi-task agent that uses a large language model to orchestrate a suite of specialized echocardiography tools. Within a ReAct-style loop, the agent decomposes clinician queries, invokes tools for view recognition, cardiac structure segmentation, measurement and disease prediction, and report synthesis, and integrates their outputs into guideline-aware answers and narrative summaries.

While datasets such as LMSYS-Chat-1M and WildChat capture real-world user-LLM conversations, few studies systematically explore the mechanisms of human-LLM collaboration in coding scenarios. What tortuous paths do users experience during the interaction process? How well do the LLMs follow instructions? Are users satisfied? In this paper, we conduct an empirical analysis on human-LLM coding collaboration using LMSYS-Chat-1M and WildChat datasets to explore the human-LLM collaboration mechanism, LLMs' instruction following ability, and human satisfaction. This study yields interesting findings: 1) Task types shape interaction patterns(linear, star and tree), with code quality optimization favoring linear patterns, design-driven tasks leaning toward tree structures, and queries preferring star patterns; 2) Bug fixing and code refactoring pose greater challenges to LLMs' instruction following, with non-compliance rates notably higher than in information querying; 3) Code quality optimization and requirements-driven development tasks show lower user satisfaction, whereas structured knowledge queries and algorithm designs yield higher levels. These insights offer recommendations for improving LLM interfaces and user satisfaction in coding collaborations, while highlighting avenues for future research on adaptive dialogue systems.

The Contextual Reward Machine reduces task complexity by decomposing grasping tasks into manageable sub-tasks. Each sub-task is associated with a stage-specific context, including a reward function, an action space, and a state abstraction function. This contextual information enables efficient intra-stage guidance and improves learning efficiency by reducing the state-action space and guiding exploration within clearly defined boundaries. In addition, transition rewards are introduced to encourage or penalize transitions between stages which guides the model toward desirable stage sequences and further accelerates convergence. When integrated with the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, the proposed method achieved a 95% success rate across 1,000 simulated grasping tasks encompassing diverse objects, affordances, and grasp topologies. It outperformed the state-of-the-art methods in both learning speed and success rate. The approach was transferred to a real robot, where it achieved a success rate of 83.3% in 60 grasping tasks over six affordances.

Speculative decoding has emerged as a promising technique to accelerate LLM inference by using lightweight draft models to generate candidate tokens, which are subsequently verified by a larger, more accurate model. However, ensuring both high goodput (the effective rate of accepted tokens) and fairness across multiple draft servers cooperating with a central verification server remains an open challenge. This paper introduces GOODSPEED, a novel distributed inference framework that optimizes goodput through adaptive speculative decoding. GOODSPEED employs a central verification server that coordinates a set of heterogeneous draft servers, each running a small language model to generate speculative tokens. To manage resource allocation effectively, GOODSPEED incorporates a gradient scheduling algorithm that dynamically assigns token verification tasks, maximizing a logarithmic utility function to ensure proportional fairness across servers. By processing speculative outputs from all draft servers in parallel, the framework enables efficient collaboration between the verification server and distributed draft generators, streamlining both latency and throughput. Through rigorous fluid sample path analysis, we show that GOODSPEED converges to the optimal goodput allocation in steady-state conditions and maintains near-optimal performance with provably bounded error under dynamic workloads.

Neverthe- less, these models still encounter difficulties in achieving human-like composi- tional generalization. In this study, we propose a new method called Independent Density Estimation (IDE) to tackle this challenge. IDE aims to learn the connec- tion between individual words in a sentence and the corresponding features in an image, enabling compositional generalization. We build two models based on the philosophy of IDE.

Specifically, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) have forced the community to focus on users' data privacy. Despite the vast amount of data on developer issues available in GitHub repositories, there is a lack of empirical evidence on the issues developers of Open Source Software discuss to comply with privacy legislation. Method: In this work, we examine such discussions by mining and analyzing 32,820 issues from GitHub repositories. We partially analyzed the dataset automatically to identify law user rights and principles indicated, and manually analyzed a sample of 1,186 issues based on the type of concern addressed. Results: We devised 24 discussion categories placed in six clusters: features/bugs, consent-related, documentation, data storing/sharing, adaptability, and general compliance. Our results show that developers mainly focus on specific user rights from the legislation (right to erasure, right to opt-out, right to access), addressing other rights less frequently, while most discussions concern user consent, user rights functionality, bugs and cookies management. Conclusion: The created taxonomy can help practitioners understand which issues are discussed for law compliance, so that they ensure they address them first in their systems. In addition, the educational community can reshape curricula to better educate future engineers on the privacy law concerns raised, and the research community can identify gaps and areas for improvement to support and accelerate data privacy law compliance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790GitHub\u4e0a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7279\u5b9a\u9690\u79c1\u6743\u5229\uff08\u5982\u5220\u9664\u6743\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u9000\u51fa\u6743\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u4f18\u5148\u89e3\u51b3\u5408\u89c4\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1GitHub\u4ed3\u5e93\u4e2d\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u5173\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5173\u4e8e\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8ba8\u8bba\u4ee5\u9075\u5b88\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u6316\u6398\u548c\u5206\u6790GitHub\u4ed3\u5e93\u4e2d\u768432,820\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u6765\u68c0\u67e5\u6b64\u7c7b\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u90e8\u5206\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7528\u6237\u6743\u5229\u548c\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u624b\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u4e861,186\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6240\u6d89\u53ca\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e8624\u4e2a\u8ba8\u8bba\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5206\u4e3a\u516d\u4e2a\u96c6\u7fa4\uff1a\u529f\u80fd/\u9519\u8bef\u3001\u540c\u610f\u76f8\u5173\u3001\u6587\u6863\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u50a8/\u5171\u4eab\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u822c\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7acb\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u7528\u6237\u6743\u5229\uff08\u5220\u9664\u6743\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u9000\u51fa\u6743\u3001\u8bbf\u95ee\u6743\uff09\uff0c\u8f83\u5c11\u8ba8\u8bba\u5176\u4ed6\u6743\u5229\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u8ba8\u8bba\u6d89\u53ca\u7528\u6237\u540c\u610f\u3001\u7528\u6237\u6743\u5229\u529f\u80fd\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u548ccookie\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u7406\u89e3\u54ea\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5408\u89c4\u800c\u8ba8\u8bba\u7684\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u786e\u4fdd\u4ed6\u4eec\u9996\u5148\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6559\u80b2\u754c\u53ef\u4ee5\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6559\u80b2\u672a\u6765\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u5173\u4e8e\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u754c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u5dee\u8ddd\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u7684\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3002"}}

Under review", "summary": "We propose Conformal Lie-group Action Prediction Sets (CLAPS), a symmetry-aware conformal prediction-based algorithm that constructs, for a given action, a set guaranteed to contain the resulting system configuration at a user-defined probability. Our assurance holds under both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, non-asymptotically, and does not require strong assumptions about the true system dynamics, the uncertainty sources, or the quality of the approximate dynamics model. Typically, uncertainty quantification is tackled by making strong assumptions about the error distribution or magnitude, or by relying on uncalibrated uncertainty estimates - i.e., with no link to frequentist probabilities - which are insufficient for safe control. Recently, conformal prediction has emerged as a statistical framework capable of providing distribution-free probabilistic guarantees on test-time prediction accuracy. While current conformal methods treat robots as Euclidean points, many systems have non-Euclidean configurations, e.g., some mobile robots have SE(2). In this work, we rigorously analyze configuration errors using Lie groups, extending previous Euclidean Space theoretical guarantees to SE(2). Our experiments on a simulated JetBot, and on a real MBot, suggest that by considering the configuration space's structure, our symmetry-informed nonconformity score leads to more volume-efficient prediction regions which represent the underlying uncertainty better than existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "CLAPS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Lie\u7fa4\u7406\u8bba\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u914d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u57df\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u5e03\u6216\u5927\u5c0f\u505a\u51fa\u5f3a\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u672a\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u8003\u8651\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u914d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u79f0\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5CLAPS\uff0c\u5229\u7528Lie\u7fa4\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u914d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5c06\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6269\u5c55\u5230SE(2)\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62dfJetBot\u548c\u771f\u5b9eMBot\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCLAPS\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u914d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u57df\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CLAPS\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u914d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5bf9\u79f0\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u975e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

John"], "title": "Design Space Exploration of DMA based Finer-Grain Compute Communication Overlap", "comment": null, "summary": "As both ML training and inference are increasingly distributed, parallelization techniques that shard (divide) ML model across GPUs of a distributed system, are often deployed. With such techniques, there is a high prevalence of data-dependent communication and computation operations where communication is exposed, leaving as high as 1.7x ideal performance on the table. Prior works harness the fact that ML model state and inputs are already sharded, and employ careful overlap of individual computation/communication shards. While such coarse-grain overlap is promising, in this work, we instead make a case for finer-grain compute-communication overlap which we term FiCCO, where we argue for finer-granularity, one-level deeper overlap than at shard-level, to unlock compute/communication overlap for a wider set of network topologies, finer-grain dataflow and more. We show that FiCCO opens up a wider design space of execution schedules than possible at shard-level alone. At the same time, decomposition of ML operations into smaller operations (done in both shard-based and finer-grain techniques) causes operation-level inefficiency losses. To balance the two, we first present a detailed characterization of these inefficiency losses, then present a design space of FiCCO schedules, and finally overlay the schedules with concomitant inefficiency signatures. Doing so helps us design heuristics that frameworks and runtimes can harness to select bespoke FiCCO schedules based on the nature of underlying ML operations. Finally, to further minimize contention inefficiencies inherent with operation overlap, we offload communication to GPU DMA engines. We evaluate several scenarios from realistic ML deployments and demonstrate that our proposed bespoke schedules deliver up to 1.6x speedup and our heuristics provide accurate guidance in 81% of unseen scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "FiCCO\u6280\u672f\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u91cd\u53e0\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fML\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fML\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u91cd\u53e0\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FiCCO\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u91cd\u53e0\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ea7\u6548\u7387\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b01.6\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u572881%\u7684\u672a\u89c1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7FiCCO\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fML\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

A key requirement for these systems is their ability to accurately follow user instructions. We present Precise Automatically Checked Instruction Following In Code (PACIFIC), a novel framework designed to automatically generate benchmarks that rigorously assess sequential instruction-following and code dry-running capabilities in LLMs, while allowing control over benchmark difficulty. PACIFIC produces benchmark variants with clearly defined expected outputs, enabling straightforward and reliable evaluation through simple output comparisons. In contrast to existing approaches that often rely on tool usage or agentic behavior, our work isolates and evaluates the LLM's intrinsic ability to reason through code behavior step-by-step without execution (dry running) and to follow instructions. Furthermore, our framework mitigates training data contamination by facilitating effortless generation of novel benchmark variations. We validate our framework by generating a suite of benchmarks spanning a range of difficulty levels and evaluating multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate that PACIFIC can produce increasingly challenging benchmarks that effectively differentiate instruction-following and dry running capabilities, even among advanced models.

Recently, agricultural robots have been developed to detect and remove weeds using mechanical tools or precise herbicide sprays. Mechanical weeding is inefficient over large fields, and herbicides harm the soil ecosystem. Laser weeding with mobile robots has emerged as a sustainable alternative in precision farming. In this paper, we present an autonomous weeding robot that uses controlled exposure to a low energy laser beam for weed removal. The proposed robot is six-wheeled with a novel double four-bar suspension for higher stability. The laser is guided towards the detected weeds by a three-dimensional linear actuation mechanism. Field tests have demonstrated the robot's capability to navigate agricultural terrains effectively by overcoming obstacles up to 15 cm in height. At an optimal speed of 42.5 cm/s, the robot achieves a weed detection rate of 86.2\\% and operating time of 87 seconds per meter. The laser actuation mechanism maintains a minimal mean positional error of 1.54 mm, combined with a high hit rate of 97\\%, ensuring effective and accurate weed removal. This combination of speed, accuracy, and efficiency highlights the robot's potential for significantly enhancing precision farming practices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u6fc0\u5149\u675f\u8fdb\u884c\u6742\u8349\u6e05\u9664\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u9664\u8349\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7cbe\u51c6\u519c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7cbe\u51c6\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u68b0\u9664\u8349\u5728\u5927\u9762\u79ef\u519c\u7530\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u800c\u9664\u8349\u5242\u5bf9\u571f\u58e4\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u5bb3\uff0c\u6fc0\u5149\u9664\u8349\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u5e94\u8fd0\u800c\u751f\u3002", "method": "\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u91c7\u7528\u516d\u8f6e\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u914d\u5907\u65b0\u578b\u53cc\u56db\u6746\u60ac\u6302\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u7ef4\u7ebf\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u5f15\u5bfc\u6fc0\u5149\u5bf9\u51c6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u6742\u8349\u3002", "result": "\u7530\u95f4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u4ee542.5\u5398\u7c73/\u79d2\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u6709\u6548\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u6742\u8349\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u8fbe86.2%\uff0c\u6fc0\u5149\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u4ec5\u4e3a1.54\u6beb\u7c73\uff0c\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe97%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u81ea\u4e3b\u9664\u8349\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u5149\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u6742\u8349\u6e05\u9664\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u7cbe\u51c6\u519c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We present RLTune, an application-agnostic reinforcement learning (RL)-based scheduling framework that dynamically prioritizes and allocates DL jobs on heterogeneous GPU clusters. RLTune integrates RL-driven prioritization with MILP-based job-to-node mapping to optimize system-wide objectives such as job completion time (JCT), queueing delay, and resource utilization. Trained on large-scale production traces from Microsoft Philly, Helios, and Alibaba, RLTune improves GPU utilization by up to 20%, reduces queueing delay by up to 81%, and shortens JCT by as much as 70 percent.

Despite their broad utility in drug discovery and protein engineering, the technical complexity of MD setup, encompassing parameterization, input preparation, and software configuration, remains a major barrier for widespread and efficient usage. Agentic LLMs have demonstrated their capacity to autonomously execute multi-step scientific processes, and to date, they have not successfully been used to automate protein-ligand MD workflows. Here, we present DynaMate, a modular multi-agent framework that autonomously designs and executes complete MD workflows for both protein and protein-ligand systems, and offers free energy binding affinity calculations with the MM/PB(GB)SA method. The framework integrates dynamic tool use, web search, PaperQA, and a self-correcting behavior. DynaMate comprises three specialized modules, interacting to plan the experiment, perform the simulation, and analyze the results.

However, achieving both high load capacity and adaptive compliance in a compact form remains challenging. This paper presents an under-actuated tendon-driven robotic finger (UTRF) featuring a synchronous tendon routing that mechanically couples all joints with fixed angular velocity ratios, enabling the entire finger to be actuated by a single actuator. This approach significantly reduces the number of actuators required in multi-finger hands, resulting in a lighter and more compact structure without sacrificing stiffness or compliance. The kinematic and static models of the finger are derived, incorporating tendon elasticity to predict structural stiffness. A single-finger prototype was fabricated and tested under static loading, showing an average deflection prediction error of 1.0 mm (0.322% of total finger length) and a measured stiffness of 1.2x10^3 N/m under a 3 kg tip load. Integration into a five-finger robotic hand (UTRF-RoboHand) demonstrates effective object manipulation across diverse scenarios, confirming that the proposed routing achieves predictable stiffness and reliable grasping performance with a minimal actuator count.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540c\u6b65\u808c\u8171\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u68b0\u624b\u6307\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u6267\u884c\u5668\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u6267\u884c\u5668\u6570\u91cf\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d1f\u8f7d\u548c\u987a\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u7d27\u51d1\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d1f\u8f7d\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u987a\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u6307\u673a\u68b0\u624b\u7684\u6267\u884c\u5668\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u6b65\u808c\u8171\u8def\u7531\u673a\u68b0\u8026\u5408\u6240\u6709\u5173\u8282\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\uff0c\u4f7f\u6574\u4e2a\u624b\u6307\u53ef\u7531\u5355\u4e2a\u6267\u884c\u5668\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u808c\u8171\u5f39\u6027\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u548c\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u6784\u521a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u6307\u539f\u578b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\u5e73\u5747\u504f\u8f6c\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a1.0\u6beb\u7c73\uff08\u603b\u6307\u957f\u76840.322%\uff09\uff0c\u57283\u516c\u65a4\u5c16\u7aef\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u6d4b\u5f97\u521a\u5ea6\u4e3a1.2x10^3 N/m\uff0c\u4e94\u6307\u673a\u68b0\u624b\uff08UTRF-RoboHand\uff09\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7269\u4f53\u64cd\u63a7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u808c\u8171\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d1f\u8f7d\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u987a\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6267\u884c\u5668\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6307\u673a\u68b0\u624b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Screening mammography reduces mortality, yet interpretation still suffers from substantial false negatives and false positives, and model accuracy often degrades when deployed across scanners, modalities, and patient populations. We propose a simple conditioning signal aimed at improving external performance based on a wavelet based vectorization of persistent homology. Using topological data analysis, we summarize image structure that persists across intensity thresholds and convert this information into spatial, multi scale maps that are provably stable to small intensity perturbations. These maps are integrated into a two stage detection pipeline through input level channel concatenation.

With these key features, we build two challenging robot benchmarks: (1) a multimodal instruction-following task, where a robot must follow vision-language navigation instructions to reach a destination in the presence of pedestrians and traffic; and (2) a multi-agent search task, where two robots must communicate to cooperatively locate and meet each other. Unlike existing benchmarks, these two new benchmarks comprehensively evaluate a wide range of critical robot capacities in realistic scenarios, including (1) multimodal instructions grounding, (2) 3D spatial reasoning in large environments, (3) safe, long-range navigation with people and traffic, (4) multi-robot collaboration, and (5) grounded communication.

While recent vision-language large models demonstrate strong reasoning abilities, they often underperform task-specific panoramic small models in VLN tasks. To address this, we propose CLASH (Collaborative Large-Small Hierarchy), a VLN-CE framework that integrates a reactive small-model planner (RSMP) with a reflective large-model reasoner (RLMR). RSMP adopts a causal-learning-based dual-branch architecture to enhance generalization, while RLMR leverages panoramic visual prompting with chain-of-thought reasoning to support interpretable spatial understanding and navigation. We further introduce an uncertainty-aware collaboration mechanism (UCM) that adaptively fuses decisions from both models. For obstacle avoidance, in simulation, we replace the rule-based controller with a fully learnable point-goal policy, and in real-world deployment, we design a LiDAR-based clustering module for generating navigable waypoints and pair it with an online SLAM-based local controller. CLASH achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) results (ranking 1-st) on the VLN-CE leaderboard, significantly improving SR and SPL on the test-unseen set over the previous SoTA methods.

However, existing Locally Repairable Codes (LRCs) exhibit structural limitations in this setting: inflated local groups increase single-node repair cost, multi-node failures frequently trigger expensive global repair, and reliability degrades sharply. We identify a key root cause: local and global parity blocks are designed independently, preventing them from cooperating during repair. We present Cascaded Parity LRCs (CP-LRCs), a new family of wide stripe LRCs that embed structured dependency between parity blocks by decomposing a global parity block across all local parity blocks. This creates a cascaded parity group that preserves MDS-level fault tolerance while enabling low-bandwidth single-node and multi-node repairs. We provide a general coefficient-generation framework, develop repair algorithms exploiting cascading, and instantiate the design with CP-Azure and CP-Uniform.

Traditional approaches-running the full model on-device or offloading to the cloud face trade-offs in latency, bandwidth, and privacy. Splitting the inference workload between the edge and the cloud offers a balanced solution, but transmitting intermediate features to enable such splitting introduces new bandwidth challenges. To address this, the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) initiated the Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) standard, establishing a bitstream syntax and codec pipeline tailored for compressing intermediate features. This paper presents the design and performance of the Feature Coding Test Model (FCTM), showing significant bitrate reductions-averaging 85.14%-across multiple vision tasks while preserving accuracy.

By clustering clients and training cluster-specific models, CFL enables personalized models tailored to groups of heterogeneous clients. However, conventional CFL approaches suffer from fragmented learning for training independent global models for each cluster and fail to take advantage of collective cluster insights. This paper advocates a shift to hierarchical CFL, allowing bi-level aggregation to train cluster-specific models at the edge and a unified global model at the cloud. This shift improves training efficiency yet might introduce communication challenges. To this end, we propose CFLHKD, a novel personalization scheme for integrating hierarchical cluster knowledge into CFL. Built upon multi-teacher knowledge distillation, CFLHKD enables inter-cluster knowledge sharing while preserving cluster-specific personalization. CFLHKD adopts a bi-level aggregation to bridge the gap between local and global learning.

Most prior work uses natural language to express chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before producing driving actions. However, text may not be the most efficient representation for reasoning. In this work, we present Latent-CoT-Drive (LCDrive): a model that expresses CoT in a latent language that captures possible outcomes of the driving actions being considered. Our approach unifies CoT reasoning and decision making by representing both in an action-aligned latent space. Instead of natural language, the model reasons by interleaving (1) action-proposal tokens, which use the same vocabulary as the model's output actions; and (2) world model tokens, which are grounded in a learned latent world model and express future outcomes of these actions.

Pathways Towards Unifying AI Safety and Ethics Research", "comment": "Accepted for presentation at IASEAI 2026", "summary": "While much research in artificial intelligence (AI) has focused on scaling capabilities, the accelerating pace of development makes countervailing work on producing harmless, \"aligned\" systems increasingly urgent. Yet research on alignment has diverged along two largely parallel tracks: safety--centered on scaled intelligence, deceptive or scheming behaviors, and existential risk--and ethics--focused on present harms, the reproduction of social bias, and flaws in production pipelines. Although both communities warn of insufficient investment in alignment, they disagree on what alignment means or ought to mean. As a result, their efforts have evolved in relative isolation, shaped by distinct methodologies, institutional homes, and disciplinary genealogies.\n  We present a large-scale, quantitative study showing the structural split between AI safety and AI ethics. Using a bibliometric and co-authorship network analysis of 6,442 papers from twelve major ML and NLP conferences (2020-2025), we find that over 80% of collaborations occur within either the safety or ethics communities, and cross-field connectivity is highly concentrated: roughly 5% of papers account for more than 85% of bridging links. Removing a small number of these brokers sharply increases segregation, indicating that cross-disciplinary exchange depends on a handful of actors rather than broad, distributed collaboration. These results show that the safety-ethics divide is not only conceptual but institutional, with implications for research agendas, policy, and venues. We argue that integrating technical safety work with normative ethics--via shared benchmarks, cross-institutional venues, and mixed-method methodologies--is essential for building AI systems that are both robust and just.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u732e\u8ba1\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86AI\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5206\u88c2\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6574\u5408\u5bf9\u6784\u5efa\u7a33\u5065\u516c\u6b63AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u5bf9\u9f50\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u4e24\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u5e76\u884c\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u4e24\u8005\u5728\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u5bf9\u5b64\u7acb\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u88c2\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u732e\u8ba1\u91cf\u548c\u5408\u8457\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e8612\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981ML\u548cNLP\u4f1a\u8bae\uff082020-2025\u5e74\uff09\u76846,442\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc780%\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6216\u4f26\u7406\u793e\u533a\u5185\u90e8\uff0c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u8fde\u63a5\u9ad8\u5ea6\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c5%\u7684\u8bba\u6587\u8d21\u732e\u4e8685%\u7684\u6865\u6881\u94fe\u63a5\u3002\u79fb\u9664\u5c11\u6570\u5173\u952e\u8282\u70b9\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u9694\u79bb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u5c06\u6280\u672f\u5b89\u5168\u5de5\u4f5c\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u4f26\u7406\u7ed3\u5408\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u57fa\u51c6\u3001\u8de8\u673a\u6784\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u65e2\u7a33\u5065\u53c8\u516c\u6b63\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Learning process takes time. Babies start learning to move in the restricted liquid area called placenta. Children often are limited by underdeveloped body. Even adults are not allowed to participate in complex competitions right away. However, with robots, when learning from scratch, we often don't have the privilege of waiting for dozen millions of steps. \"Swaddling\" regularization is responsible for restraining an agent in rapid but unstable development penalizing action strength in a specific way not affecting actions directly. The Symphony, Transitional-policy Deterministic Actor and Critic algorithm, is a concise combination of different ideas for possibility of training humanoid robots from scratch with Sample Efficiency, Sample Proximity and Safety of Actions in mind. It is no secret that continuous increase in Gaussian noise without appropriate smoothing is harmful for motors and gearboxes. Compared to Stochastic algorithms, we set a limited parametric noise and promote a reduced strength of actions, safely increasing entropy, since the actions are kind of immersed in weaker noise. When actions require more extreme values, actions rise above the weak noise. Training becomes empirically much safer for both the environment around and the robot's mechanisms. We use Fading Replay Buffer: using a fixed formula containing the hyperbolic tangent, we adjust the batch sampling probability: the memory contains a recent memory and a long-term memory trail. Fading Replay Buffer allows us to use Temporal Advantage when we improve the current Critic Network prediction compared to the exponential moving average. Temporal Advantage allows us to update Actor and Critic in one pass, as well as combine Actor and Critic in one Object and implement their Losses in one line.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSymphony\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u52a8\u4f5c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65b0\u578b\u56de\u653e\u7f13\u51b2\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7f13\u6162\u4e14\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u751f\u7406\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u800c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u5e38\u9700\u5feb\u901f\u4f46\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528'Swaddling'\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9650\u5236\u52a8\u4f5c\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Fading Replay Buffer\u548cTemporal Advantage\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f18\u5316Actor\u548cCritic\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u968f\u673a\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0cSymphony\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7'Symphony'\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408'Sample Efficiency, Sample Proximity\u548cSafety of Actions'\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u96f6\u5f00\u59cb\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u5730\u8bad\u7ec3\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002"}}

By freeing up GPU memory, ESS effectively decoupling batch-size scaling from GPU memory constraints.

Consequently, this paradigm is bandwidth intensive, scales poorly, and exposes raw images to third parties. Recent efforts in the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) redesigned the pipeline for machine-to-machine communication: Video Coding for Machines (VCM) is designed to apply task-aware coding tools in the pixel domain, and Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) is designed to compress intermediate neural features to reduce bitrate, preserve privacy, and support compute offload. Experiments show that FCM is capable of maintaining accuracy close to edge inference while significantly reducing bitrate. Additional analysis of H.26X codecs used as inner codecs in FCM reveals that H.265/High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) and H.266/Versatile Video Coding (VVC) achieve almost identical machine task performance, with an average BD-Rate increase of 1.39% when VVC is replaced with HEVC. In contrast, H.264/Advanced Video Coding (AVC) yields an average BD-Rate increase of 32.28% compared to VVC. However, for the tracking task, the impact of codec choice is minimal, with HEVC outperforming VVC and achieving BD Rate of -1.81% and 8.79% for AVC, indicating that existing hardware for already deployed codecs can support machine-to-machine communication without degrading performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faVCM\u548cFCM\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cFCM\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u786c\u4ef6\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff08\u5982HEVC\uff09\u53ef\u652f\u6301\u673a\u5668\u901a\u4fe1\u800c\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u673a\u5668\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e26\u5bbd\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u4e14\u9690\u79c1\u66b4\u9732\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aVCM\uff08\u50cf\u7d20\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u7f16\u7801\u5de5\u5177\uff09\u548cFCM\uff08\u538b\u7f29\u4e2d\u95f4\u795e\u7ecf\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u3001\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u5378\u8f7d\uff09\u3002", "result": "FCM\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8fb9\u7f18\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u3002H.265/HEVC\u548cH.266/VVC\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u51e0\u4e4e\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u800cH.264/AVC\u76f8\u6bd4VVC\u7684BD-Rate\u589e\u52a0\u4e8632.28%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u90e8\u7f72\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff08\u5982HEVC\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u673a\u5668\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u800c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002"}}

The system uses chest-mounted IMU-based PDR as the motion backbone and integrates absolute updates from GNSS outdoors and UWB indoors. To enhance transition robustness and mitigate urban GNSS degradation, we introduce a lightweight map-based feasibility constraint derived from OpenStreetMap building footprints, treating most building interiors as non-navigable while allowing motion inside a designated UWB-instrumented building. The framework is implemented in ROS 2 and runs in real time on a wearable platform, with visualization in Foxglove.

However, we identify a fundamental limitation in the standard DPO formulation because it relies on the Bradley-Terry model to aggregate diverse evaluation axes like aesthetic quality and semantic alignment into a single scalar reward. This aggregation creates a reward conflict where the model is forced to unlearn desirable features of a specific dimension if they appear in a globally non-preferred sample. To address this issue, we propose Multi Reward Conditional DPO (MCDPO). This method resolves reward conflicts by introducing a disentangled Bradley-Terry objective. MCDPO explicitly injects a preference outcome vector as a condition during training, which allows the model to learn the correct optimization direction for each reward axis independently within a single network. We further introduce dimensional reward dropout to ensure balanced optimization across dimensions. Extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and SDXL demonstrate that MCDPO achieves superior performance on benchmarks.

Current methods often rely on costly LLM-based techniques (e.g. annotating dataset differences) or dense embedding models (e.g. for clustering), which lack control over the properties of interest. We propose using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to create SAE embeddings: representations whose dimensions map to interpretable concepts. Through four data analysis tasks, we show that SAE embeddings are more cost-effective and reliable than LLMs and more controllable than dense embeddings. Using the large hypothesis space of SAEs, we can uncover insights such as (1) semantic differences between datasets and (2) unexpected concept correlations in documents. For instance, by comparing model responses, we find that Grok-4 clarifies ambiguities more often than nine other frontier models. Relative to LLMs, SAE embeddings uncover bigger differences at 2-8x lower cost and identify biases more reliably. Additionally, SAE embeddings are controllable: by filtering concepts, we can (3) cluster documents along axes of interest and (4) outperform dense embeddings on property-based retrieval. Using SAE embeddings, we study model behavior with two case studies: investigating how OpenAI model behavior has changed over time and finding \"trigger\" phrases learned by Tulu-3 (Lambert et al., 2024) from its training data.

Despite the availability of powerful open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and their pretraining data, the SSFSL literature largely neglects these open-source resources. In contrast, the related area few-shot learning (FSL) has already exploited them to boost performance. Arguably, to achieve auto-annotation in the real world, SSFSL should leverage such open-source resources. To this end, we start by applying established SSL methods to finetune a VLM. Counterintuitively, they significantly underperform FSL baselines. Our in-depth analysis reveals the root cause: VLMs produce rather ''flat'' distributions of softmax probabilities. This results in zero utilization of unlabeled data and weak supervision signals. We address this issue with embarrassingly simple techniques: classifier initialization and temperature tuning. They jointly increase the confidence scores of pseudo-labels, improving the utilization rate of unlabeled data, and strengthening supervision signals. Building on this, we propose: Stage-Wise Finetuning with Temperature Tuning (SWIFT), which enables existing SSL methods to effectively finetune a VLM on limited labeled data, abundant unlabeled data, and task-relevant but noisy data retrieved from the VLM's pretraining set. Extensive experiments on five SSFSL benchmarks show that SWIFT outperforms recent FSL and SSL methods by $\\sim$5 accuracy points.

We introduce a novel neural fusion framework for ranging inertial odometry which involves a graph attention UWB network and a recurrent neural inertial network. Our graph net learns scene-relevant ranging patterns and adapts to any number of anchors or tags, realizing accurate positioning without calibration.

While recent benchmarks advance AIGC video detection, they overlook a critical factor: many state-of-the-art generative models embed digital watermarks in outputs, and detectors may partially rely on these patterns. To evaluate this influence, we present RobustSora, the benchmark designed to assess watermark robustness in AIGC video detection. We systematically construct a dataset of 6,500 videos comprising four types: Authentic-Clean (A-C), Authentic-Spoofed with fake watermarks (A-S), Generated-Watermarked (G-W), and Generated-DeWatermarked (G-DeW). Our benchmark introduces two evaluation tasks: Task-I tests performance on watermark-removed AI videos, while Task-II assesses false alarm rates on authentic videos with fake watermarks. Experiments with ten models spanning specialized AIGC detectors, transformer architectures, and MLLM approaches reveal performance variations of 2-8pp under watermark manipulation. Transformer-based models show consistent moderate dependency (6-8pp), while MLLMs exhibit diverse patterns (2-8pp).

This work analyzes conspiratorial narratives in Singapore-based Telegram groups, showing that such content is woven into everyday discussions rather than confined to isolated echo chambers. We propose a two-stage computational framework. First, we fine-tune RoBERTa-large to classify messages as conspiratorial or not, achieving an F1-score of 0.866 on 2,000 expert-labeled messages. Second, we build a signed belief graph in which nodes represent messages and edge signs reflect alignment in belief labels, weighted by textual similarity. We introduce a Signed Belief Graph Neural Network (SiBeGNN) that uses a Sign Disentanglement Loss to learn embeddings that separate ideological alignment from stylistic features.\n  Using hierarchical clustering on these embeddings, we identify seven narrative archetypes across 553,648 messages: legal topics, medical concerns, media discussions, finance, contradictions in authority, group moderation, and general chat. SiBeGNN yields stronger clustering quality (cDBI = 8.38) than baseline methods (13.60 to 67.27), supported by 88 percent inter-rater agreement in expert evaluations. Our analysis shows that conspiratorial messages appear not only in clusters focused on skepticism or distrust, but also within routine discussions of finance, law, and everyday matters. These findings challenge common assumptions about online radicalization by demonstrating that conspiratorial discourse operates within ordinary social interaction. The proposed framework advances computational methods for belief-driven discourse analysis and offers applications for stance detection, political communication studies, and content moderation policy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u65b0\u52a0\u5761Telegram\u7fa4\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u9634\u8c0b\u8bba\u53d9\u4e8b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff08RoBERTa\u5206\u7c7b\u548cSiBeGNN\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u9634\u8c0b\u8bba\u8bdd\u8bed\u878d\u5165\u65e5\u5e38\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5728\u7ebf\u6fc0\u8fdb\u5316\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u9634\u8c0b\u8bba\u8bdd\u8bed\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u901a\u4fe1\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4f20\u64ad\u96be\u4ee5\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5206\u6790\u65b0\u52a0\u5761Telegram\u7fa4\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u9634\u8c0b\u8bba\u53d9\u4e8b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5982\u4f55\u878d\u5165\u65e5\u5e38\u8ba8\u8bba\u800c\u975e\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\u56de\u97f3\u5ba4\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u5fae\u8c03RoBERTa-large\u4ee5\u5206\u7c7b\u6d88\u606f\u662f\u5426\u4e3a\u9634\u8c0b\u8bba\u5185\u5bb9\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e26\u7b26\u53f7\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5e26\u7b26\u53f7\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08SiBeGNN\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4ee5\u5206\u79bb\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u98ce\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e03\u79cd\u53d9\u4e8b\u539f\u578b\u3002SiBeGNN\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u8d28\u91cf\uff08cDBI = 8.38\uff09\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0813.60\u81f367.27\uff09\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fbe88%\u3002\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u9634\u8c0b\u8bba\u6d88\u606f\u4e0d\u4ec5\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u6000\u7591\u6216\u4e0d\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd8\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u65e5\u5e38\u91d1\u878d\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7b49\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u6fc0\u8fdb\u5316\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9634\u8c0b\u8bba\u8bdd\u8bed\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u65e5\u5e38\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4fe1\u5ff5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bdd\u8bed\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7acb\u573a\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u653f\u6cbb\u4f20\u64ad\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u653f\u7b56\u3002"}}

However, 3D graph convolution (3D-GC) methods only focus on local geometry and depth information, making them vulnerable to complex objects and visual ambiguities. To address this, we present THE-Pose, a novel category-level 6D pose estimation framework that leverages a topological prior via surface embedding and hybrid graph fusion. Specifically, we extract consistent and invariant topological features from the image domain, effectively overcoming the limitations inherent in existing 3D-GC based methods. Our Hybrid Graph Fusion (HGF) module adaptively integrates the topological features with point-cloud features, seamlessly bridging 2D image context and 3D geometric structure.

We introduce AgriRegion, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed specifically for high-fidelity, region-aware agricultural advisory. Unlike standard RAG approaches that rely solely on semantic similarity, AgriRegion incorporates a geospatial metadata injection layer and a region-prioritized re-ranking mechanism. By restricting the knowledge base to verified local agricultural extension services and enforcing geo-spatial constraints during retrieval, AgriRegion ensures that the advice regarding planting schedules, pest control, and fertilization is locally accurate. We create a novel benchmark dataset, AgriRegion-Eval, which comprises 160 domain-specific questions across 12 agricultural subfields.

Training of novice pilots is protracted due to the lack of functional and easily accessible training simulators. Moreover, work on parafoil trajectory planning suitable for aiding human training remains limited. To bridge this gap, we study the problem of computing safe trajectories for human-piloted parafoil flight and examine how such trajectories fare against human-generated solutions. For the algorithmic part, we adapt the sampling-based motion planner Stable Sparse RRT (SST) by Li et al., to cope with the problem constraints while minimizing the bank angle (control effort) as a proxy for safety. We then compare the computer-generated solutions with data from human-generated parafoil flight, where the algorithm offers a relative cost improvement of 20\\%-80\\% over the performance of the human pilot. We observe that human pilots tend to, first, close the horizontal distance to the landing area, and then address the vertical gap by spiraling down to the suitable altitude for starting a landing maneuver. The algorithm considered here makes smoother and more gradual descents, arriving at the landing area at the precise altitude necessary for the final approach while maintaining safety constraints. Overall, the study demonstrates the potential of computer-generated guidelines, rather than traditional rules of thumb, which can be integrated into future simulators to train pilots for safer and more cost-effective flights.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u964d\u843d\u4f1e\u5b89\u5168\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u64cd\u63a7\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e20%-80%\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6307\u5357\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u591a\u6570\u8df3\u4f1e\u4e8b\u6545\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u964d\u843d\u4f1e\u64cd\u63a7\u548c\u7740\u9646\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u6e90\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u64cd\u63a7\u5224\u65ad\u5931\u8bef\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u529f\u80fd\u5b8c\u5584\u4e14\u6613\u7528\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u65b0\u624b\u98de\u884c\u5458\u57f9\u8bad\u5468\u671f\u957f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8f85\u52a9\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u964d\u843d\u4f1e\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u5668Stable Sparse RRT (SST)\u8fdb\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u503e\u659c\u89d2\uff08\u63a7\u5236\u6210\u672c\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u964d\u843d\u4f1e\u98de\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u76f8\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u98de\u884c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u76f8\u5bf9\u6539\u558420%-80%\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u98de\u884c\u5458\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5148\u6c34\u5e73\u63a5\u8fd1\u7740\u9646\u533a\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u87ba\u65cb\u4e0b\u964d\u8c03\u6574\u9ad8\u5ea6\uff1b\u800c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u6e10\u8fdb\u7684\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u6ee1\u8db3\u7740\u9646\u9ad8\u5ea6\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u6307\u5357\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6cd5\u5219\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u6574\u5408\u5230\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bad\u7ec3\u98de\u884c\u5458\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u7684\u98de\u884c\u3002"}}

The imaging noise, artifacts, and the deformation and motion of the heart pose challenges to segmentation algorithms. While existing methods based on convolutional neural networks, Transformers, and space-time memory networks have improved segmentation accuracy, they often struggle with the trade-off between capturing long-range spatiotemporal dependencies and maintaining computational efficiency with fine-grained feature representation. In this paper, we introduce GDKVM, a novel architecture for echocardiography video segmentation. The model employs Linear Key-Value Association (LKVA) to effectively model inter-frame correlations, and introduces Gated Delta Rule (GDR) to efficiently store intermediate memory states. Key-Pixel Feature Fusion (KPFF) module is designed to integrate local and global features at multiple scales, enhancing robustness against boundary blurring and noise interference. We validated GDKVM on two mainstream echocardiography video datasets (CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic) and compared it with various state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that GDKVM outperforms existing approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy and robustness, while ensuring real-time performance.

The 2025 FMTI introduces new indicators related to data acquisition, usage data, and monitoring and evaluates companies like Alibaba, DeepSeek, and xAI for the first time. The 2024 FMTI reported that transparency was improving, but the 2025 FMTI finds this progress has deteriorated: the average score out of 100 fell from 58 in 2024 to 40 in 2025. Companies are most opaque about their training data and training compute as well as the post-deployment usage and impact of their flagship models. In spite of this general trend, IBM stands out as a positive outlier, scoring 95, in contrast to the lowest scorers, xAI and Midjourney, at just 14. The five members of the Frontier Model Forum we score end up in the middle of the Index: we posit that these companies avoid reputational harms from low scores but lack incentives to be transparency leaders. As policymakers around the world increasingly mandate certain types of transparency, this work reveals the current state of transparency for foundation model developers, how it may change given newly enacted policy, and where more aggressive policy interventions are necessary to address critical information deficits.", "AI": {"tldr": "2025\u5e74\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u520640\uff0cIBM\u6700\u9ad8\uff0895\u5206\uff09\uff0c\u653f\u7b56\u5e72\u9884\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5b9e\u8df5\u5982\u4f55\u6f14\u53d8\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e74\u5ea6\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u6307\u6570\uff08FMTI\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u5982\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u636e\u548c\u76d1\u63a7\u3002", "result": "2025\u5e74\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5e73\u5747\u5206\u4ece2024\u5e74\u768458\u964d\u81f340\uff0cIBM\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0895\u5206\uff09\uff0cxAI\u548cMidjourney\u6700\u4f4e\uff0814\u5206\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u653f\u7b56\u5e72\u9884\u9700\u52a0\u5f3a\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

Regarding robot task planning, the vast majority of existing studies focus on the application of large models in single-task scenarios and for single robot types.

Thus, the proposed LEO-RobotAgent framework is designed with a streamlined structure as much as possible, enabling large models to independently think, plan, and act within this clear framework. We provide a modular and easily registrable toolset, allowing large models to flexibly call various tools to meet different requirements. Meanwhile, the framework incorporates a human-robot interaction mechanism, enabling the algorithm to collaborate with humans like a partner.

Our key innovation lies in modelling cluster centres and semantic prototypes of known classes by jointly optimising known class image and text features, and a dualphase discovery mechanism that dynamically separates known or novel samples via semantic affinity thresholds and adaptive clustering.

Frontier video models can enable generation of realistic observations and environment interactions in a scalable and general manner. However, the use of video models in robotics has been limited primarily to in-distribution evaluations, i.e., scenarios that are similar to ones used to train the policy or fine-tune the base video model. In this report, we demonstrate that video models can be used for the entire spectrum of policy evaluation use cases in robotics: from assessing nominal performance to out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and probing physical and semantic safety. We introduce a generative evaluation system built upon a frontier video foundation model (Veo). The system is optimized to support robot action conditioning and multi-view consistency, while integrating generative image-editing and multi-view completion to synthesize realistic variations of real-world scenes along multiple axes of generalization. We demonstrate that the system preserves the base capabilities of the video model to enable accurate simulation of scenes that have been edited to include novel interaction objects, novel visual backgrounds, and novel distractor objects. This fidelity enables accurately predicting the relative performance of different policies in both nominal and OOD conditions, determining the relative impact of different axes of generalization on policy performance, and performing red teaming of policies to expose behaviors that violate physical or semantic safety constraints.

Long-LRM notably scales this paradigm to 32 input images at $950\\times540$ resolution, achieving 360\u00b0 scene-level reconstruction in a single forward pass. However, directly predicting millions of Gaussian parameters at once remains highly error-sensitive: small inaccuracies in positions or other attributes lead to noticeable blurring, particularly in fine structures such as text. In parallel, implicit representation methods such as LVSM and LaCT have demonstrated significantly higher rendering fidelity by compressing scene information into model weights rather than explicit Gaussians, and decoding RGB frames using the full transformer or TTT backbone. However, this computationally intensive decompression process for every rendered frame makes real-time rendering infeasible. These observations raise key questions: Is the deep, sequential \"decompression\" process necessary? Can we retain the benefits of implicit representations while enabling real-time performance? We address these questions with Long-LRM++, a model that adopts a semi-explicit scene representation combined with a lightweight decoder. Long-LRM++ matches the rendering quality of LaCT on DL3DV while achieving real-time 14 FPS rendering on an A100 GPU, overcoming the speed limitations of prior implicit methods. Our design also scales to 64 input views at the $950\\times540$ resolution, demonstrating strong generalization to increased input lengths.

However, existing work often neglects to incorporate state-of-the-art robust teachers. Through extensive analysis, we find that stronger teachers do not necessarily yield more robust students-a phenomenon known as robust saturation. While typically attributed to capacity gaps, we show that such explanations are incomplete. Instead, we identify adversarial transferability-the fraction of student-crafted adversarial examples that remain effective against the teacher-as a key factor in successful robustness transfer. Based on this insight, we propose Sample-wise Adaptive Adversarial Distillation (SAAD), which reweights training examples by their measured transferability without incurring additional computational cost. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet show that SAAD consistently improves AutoAttack robustness over prior methods.

However, recent progress has primarily focused on low-level visual consistency across shots, neglecting how transitions are designed and how cinematographic language contributes to coherent narrative expression. This often leads to mere sequential shot changes without intentional film-editing patterns. To address this limitation, we propose ShotDirector, an efficient framework that integrates parameter-level camera control and hierarchical editing-pattern-aware prompting. Specifically, we adopt a camera control module that incorporates 6-DoF poses and intrinsic settings to enable precise camera information injection. In addition, a shot-aware mask mechanism is employed to introduce hierarchical prompts aware of professional editing patterns, allowing fine-grained control over shot content. Through this design, our framework effectively combines parameter-level conditions with high-level semantic guidance, achieving film-like controllable shot transitions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we construct ShotWeaver40K, a dataset that captures the priors of film-like editing patterns, and develop a set of evaluation metrics for controllable multi-shot video generation.

We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including state stability, bounded approximation errors, and universal approximation.

We propose a semantic compositional diffusion transformer that factorizes transitions into robot-, object-, obstacle-, and objective-specific components and learns their interactions through attention. Once trained on a limited subset of tasks, we show that our model can zero-shot generate high-quality transitions from which we can learn control policies for unseen task combinations. Then, we introduce an iterative self-improvement procedure in which synthetic data is validated via offline reinforcement learning and incorporated into subsequent training rounds.

We implement a dual-branch conditioning framework, one optimized for CT intensity driven scattering in volumetric data and the other for real-world RGB scenes through normalized camera embeddings. To address scale ambiguity and maintain structural realism, we present a hybrid pose agnostic anchoring method that adaptively samples scene depth and material transitions, functioning as stable pivots during scene distillation.

Evaluations on the Mip-NeRF 360, RealEstate10K, and DeepDRR datasets indicate superior SSIM and LPIPS performance, while runtime assessments confirm its viability for interactive applications.

In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability framework to systematically analyze the internal mechanisms of VLMs, focusing on the functional roles of attention heads in multimodal reasoning. To this end, we introduce CogVision, a dataset that decomposes complex multimodal questions into step-by-step subquestions designed to simulate human reasoning through a chain-of-thought paradigm, with each subquestion associated with specific receptive or cognitive functions such as high-level visual reception and inference. Using a probing-based methodology, we identify attention heads that specialize in these functions and characterize them as functional heads. Our analysis across diverse VLM families reveals that these functional heads are universally sparse, vary in number and distribution across functions, and mediate interactions and hierarchical organization. Furthermore, intervention experiments demonstrate their critical role in multimodal reasoning: removing functional heads leads to performance degradation, while emphasizing them enhances accuracy. These findings provide new insights into the cognitive organization of VLMs and suggest promising directions for designing models with more human-aligned perceptual and reasoning abilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790VLMs\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u529f\u80fd\u5934\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ed1\u7bb1\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u63ed\u793aVLMs\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u5de5\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u89d2\u8272\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5f15\u5165CogVision\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u9010\u6b65\u7684\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a2\u6d4b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e13\u95e8\u6267\u884c\u7279\u5b9a\u529f\u80fd\uff08\u5982\u9ad8\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u63a5\u6536\u548c\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u529f\u80fd\u5934\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u529f\u80fd\u5934\u5728VLMs\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u56e0\u529f\u80fd\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5e72\u9884\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u79fb\u9664\u529f\u80fd\u5934\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5b83\u4eec\u5219\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u89d2\u8272\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u529f\u80fd\u5934\u5728VLMs\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u56e0\u529f\u80fd\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We propose a reinforcement learning approach enabling a drone to navigate unknown three-dimensional tubes without any prior knowledge of their geometry, relying solely on local observations from LiDAR and a conditional visual detection of the tube center. In contrast, the Pure Pursuit algorithm, used as a deterministic baseline, benefits from explicit access to the centerline, creating an information asymmetry designed to assess the ability of RL to compensate for the absence of a geometric model. The agent is trained through a progressive Curriculum Learning strategy that gradually exposes it to increasingly curved geometries, where the tube center frequently disappears from the visual field. A turning-negotiation mechanism, based on the combination of direct visibility, directional memory, and LiDAR symmetry cues, proves essential for ensuring stable navigation under such partial observability conditions. Experiments show that the PPO policy acquires robust and generalizable behavior, consistently outperforming the deterministic controller despite its limited access to geometric information. Validation in a high-fidelity 3D environment further confirms the transferability of the learned behavior to a continuous physical dynamics.\n  The proposed approach thus provides a complete framework for autonomous navigation in unknown tubular environments and opens perspectives for industrial, underground, or medical applications where progressing through narrow and weakly perceptive conduits represents a central challenge.", "AI": {"tldr": "A reinforcement learning method enables drones to navigate unknown 3D tubes using LiDAR and visual cues, outperforming deterministic approaches despite limited geometric info.", "motivation": "Autonomous drone navigation in confined tubular environments is challenging due to geometric constraints, wall proximity, and perceptual limitations.", "method": "The method involves a reinforcement learning approach using LiDAR and conditional visual detection of the tube center, trained via Curriculum Learning and a turning-negotiation mechanism.", "result": "The PPO policy outperforms the deterministic Pure Pursuit algorithm, demonstrating robust and generalizable behavior in high-fidelity 3D environments.", "conclusion": "The proposed reinforcement learning approach offers a complete framework for autonomous drone navigation in unknown tubular environments, with potential applications in industrial, underground, or medical settings."}}

However, their practical development is severely hindered by the substantial training overhead. We recognize two key issues that contribute to the overhead: (1) the quadratic computational burden from processing long-horizon historical observations as massive sequences of tokens, and (2) the exploration-efficiency trade-off in DAgger, i.e., a data aggregation process of collecting agent-explored trajectories. While more exploration yields effective error-recovery trajectories for handling test-time distribution shifts, it comes at the cost of longer trajectory lengths for both training and inference. To address these challenges, we propose Efficient-VLN, a training-efficient VLN model. Specifically, to mitigate the token processing burden, we design two efficient memory mechanisms: a progressive memory that dynamically allocates more tokens to recent observations, and a learnable recursive memory that utilizes the key-value cache of learnable tokens as the memory state. Moreover, we introduce a dynamic mixed policy to balance the exploration-efficiency trade-off. Extensive experiments show that Efficient-VLN achieves state-of-the-art performance on R2R-CE (64.2% SR) and RxR-CE (67.0% SR).

By taking aspiration from international standards and Australia's National Framework for AI Assurance initiative, this work demonstrates that trustworthiness can be systematically incorporated (by engineering) into AI systems, ensuring the execution fabric remains verifiable, transparent, reproducible and under meaningful human control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56AI\u7f16\u6392\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5341\u5927\u6807\u51c6\u6574\u5408\u6cbb\u7406\uff0c\u786e\u4fddAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5236\u5ea6\u95ee\u8d23\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u6269\u5927\uff0c\u4ec5\u9760\u4f26\u7406\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u6cbb\u7406\u5d4c\u5165\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6267\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u2018\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7f16\u6392AI\u7684\u5341\u5927\u6807\u51c6\u2019\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u5ba1\u8ba1\u548c\u6765\u6e90\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u2018\u63a7\u5236\u9762\u677f\u2019\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6574\u4e2aAI\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3001\u5176\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u603b\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684AI\u534f\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684AI\u7f16\u6392\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u7a0b\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u878d\u5165AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u4e14\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u4e0b\u3002"}}

Integrating these signals is challenging due to their fundamental frequency and informational disparities. In this work, we propose ImplicitRDP, a unified end-to-end visual-force diffusion policy that integrates visual planning and reactive force control within a single network. We introduce Structural Slow-Fast Learning, a mechanism utilizing causal attention to simultaneously process asynchronous visual and force tokens, allowing the policy to perform closed-loop adjustments at the force frequency while maintaining the temporal coherence of action chunks. Furthermore, to mitigate modality collapse where end-to-end models fail to adjust the weights across different modalities, we propose Virtual-target-based Representation Regularization. This auxiliary objective maps force feedback into the same space as the action, providing a stronger, physics-grounded learning signal than raw force prediction. Extensive experiments on contact-rich tasks demonstrate that ImplicitRDP significantly outperforms both vision-only and hierarchical baselines, achieving superior reactivity and success rates with a streamlined training pipeline.

To address these issues, we propose InfoCom, an information-aware framework establishing the pioneering theoretical foundation for communication-efficient collaborative perception via extended Information Bottleneck principles. Departing from mainstream feature manipulation, InfoCom introduces a novel information purification paradigm that theoretically optimizes the extraction of minimal sufficient task-critical information under Information Bottleneck constraints.

Vision-language models such as CONCH offer rich semantic alignment and morphology-aware representations, while modern segmentation backbones like SegFormer preserve fine-grained spatial cues. However, combining these complementary strengths remains challenging, especially under weak supervision and without dense annotations. We propose a prototype learning framework for WSSS in histopathological images that integrates morphology-aware representations from CONCH, multi-scale structural cues from SegFormer, and text-guided semantic alignment to produce prototypes that are simultaneously semantically discriminative and spatially coherent. To effectively leverage these heterogeneous sources, we introduce text-guided prototype initialization that incorporates pathology descriptions to generate more complete and semantically accurate pseudo-masks. A structural distillation mechanism transfers spatial knowledge from SegFormer to preserve fine-grained morphological patterns and local tissue boundaries during prototype learning. Our approach produces high-quality pseudo masks without pixel-level annotations, improves localization completeness, and enhances semantic consistency across tissue types.

While existing Safe Offline RL methods typically enforce soft expected-cost constraints, they do not guarantee forward invariance. Conversely, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide rigorous safety guarantees but usually depend on expert-designed barrier functions or full knowledge of the system dynamics. We introduce Value-Guided Offline Control Barrier Functions (V-OCBF), a framework that learns a neural CBF entirely from offline demonstrations. Unlike prior approaches, V-OCBF does not assume access to the dynamics model; instead, it derives a recursive finite-difference barrier update, enabling model-free learning of a barrier that propagates safety information over time. Moreover, V-OCBF incorporates an expectile-based objective that avoids querying the barrier on out-of-distribution actions and restricts updates to the dataset-supported action set. The learned barrier is then used with a Quadratic Program (QP) formulation to synthesize real-time safe control. Across multiple case studies, V-OCBF yields substantially fewer safety violations than baseline methods while maintaining strong task performance, highlighting its scalability for offline synthesis of safety-critical controllers without online interaction or hand-engineered barriers.", "AI": {"tldr": "V-OCBF\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u795e\u7ecf\u63a7\u5236\u5c4f\u969c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5728\u7ebf\u4ea4\u4e92\u6216\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5c4f\u969c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4ec5\u5f3a\u5236\u8f6f\u9884\u671f\u6210\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u524d\u5411\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff1b\u800c\u63a7\u5236\u5c4f\u969c\u51fd\u6570\uff08CBFs\uff09\u867d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e25\u683c\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5c4f\u969c\u51fd\u6570\u6216\u5b8c\u6574\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "V-OCBF\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u5c4f\u969c\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u671f\u671b\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u79bb\u7ebf\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u795e\u7ecf\u63a7\u5236\u5c4f\u969c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\uff08QP\uff09\u516c\u5f0f\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u65f6\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0cV-OCBF\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "V-OCBF\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u795e\u7ecf\u63a7\u5236\u5c4f\u969c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5728\u7ebf\u4ea4\u4e92\u6216\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5c4f\u969c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

General Scene Adaptation for VLN (GSA-VLN) shifts the focus from zero-shot generalization to continual, environment-specific adaptation, narrowing the gap between static benchmarks and real-world deployment. However, current GSA-VLN frameworks exclude user feedback, relying solely on unsupervised adaptation from repeated environmental exposure. In practice, user feedback offers natural and valuable supervision that can significantly enhance adaptation quality. We introduce a user-feedback-driven adaptation framework that extends GSA-VLN by systematically integrating human interactions into continual learning. Our approach converts user feedback-navigation instructions and corrective signals-into high-quality, environment-aligned training data, enabling efficient and realistic adaptation. A memory-bank warm-start mechanism further reuses previously acquired environmental knowledge, mitigating cold-start degradation and ensuring stable redeployment.

Moreover, unlike other recent methods for 4D reconstruction from monocular RGB videos, Any4D can process additional modalities and sensors such as RGB-D frames, IMU-based egomotion, and Radar Doppler measurements, when available. One of the key innovations that allows for such a flexible framework is a modular representation of a 4D scene; specifically, per-view 4D predictions are encoded using a variety of egocentric factors (depthmaps and camera intrinsics) represented in local camera coordinates, and allocentric factors (camera extrinsics and scene flow) represented in global world coordinates.

Token reduction, while extensively explored for video-only LLMs, is insufficient for the audio-visual domain, as these unimodal methods cannot leverage audio-visual cross-modal synergies. Furthermore, the distinct and dynamic information densities of audio and video render static budgets per modality suboptimal. How to perform token reduction on a joint audio-visual stream thus remains an unaddressed bottleneck. To fill this gap, we introduce EchoingPixels, a framework inspired by the coexistence and interaction of visuals and sound in real-world scenes. The core of our framework is the Cross-Modal Semantic Sieve (CS2), a module enabling early audio-visual interaction. Instead of compressing modalities independently, CS2 co-attends to the joint multimodal stream and reduces tokens from an entire combined pool of audio-visual tokens rather than using fixed budgets per modality. This single-pool approach allows it to adaptively allocate the token budget across both modalities and dynamically identify salient tokens in concert. To ensure this aggressive reduction preserves the vital temporal modeling capability, we co-design a Synchronization-Augmented RoPE (Sync-RoPE) to maintain critical temporal relationships for the sparsely selected tokens.

A widely used approach is the ratio-of-densities method, which defines a time-indexed target path by reweighting probability-density trajectories from multiple models with positive, or in some cases, negative exponents. This construction, however, harbors a critical and previously unformalized failure mode: Marginal Path Collapse, where intermediate densities become non-normalizable even though endpoints remain valid. Collapse arises systematically when composing heterogeneous models trained on different noise schedules or datasets, including a common setting in molecular design where de-novo, conformer, and pocket-conditioned models must be combined for tasks such as flexible-pose scaffold decoration. We provide a novel and complete solution for the problem. First, we derive a simple path existence criterion that predicts exactly when collapse occurs from noise schedules and exponents alone. Second, we introduce Adaptive path Correction with Exponents (ACE), which extends Feynman-Kac steering to time-varying exponents and guarantees a valid probability path. On a synthetic 2D benchmark and on flexible-pose scaffold decoration, ACE eliminates collapse and enables high-guidance compositional generation, improving distributional and docking metrics over constant-exponent baselines and even specialized task-specific scaffold decoration models.

These models can serve as backbones for region-of-interest (ROI) image analysis or patch-level feature extractors in whole-slide images (WSIs) based on multiple instance learning (MIL). Existing pathology foundation models (PFMs) are typically pre-trained on Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) stained pathology images. However, images with special stains, such as immunohistochemistry, are also frequently used in clinical practice. PFMs pre-trained mainly on H\\&E-stained images may be limited in clinical applications involving special stains. To address this issue, we propose StainNet, a specialized foundation model for special stains based on the vision transformer (ViT) architecture. StainNet adopts a self-distillation SSL approach and is trained on over 1.4 million patch images cropping from 20,231 publicly available special staining WSIs in the HISTAI database.

Federated unlearning has therefore emerged as a research frontier, aiming to remove a specific party's contribution from the learned model while preserving the utility of the remaining parties. However, most unlearning techniques focus on Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL), where data are partitioned by samples. In contrast, Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) allows organizations that possess complementary feature spaces to train a joint model without sharing raw data. The resulting feature-partitioned architecture renders HFL-oriented unlearning methods ineffective. In this paper, we propose REMISVFU, a plug-and-play representation misdirection framework that enables fast, client-level unlearning in splitVFL systems. When a deletion request arrives, the forgetting party collapses its encoder output to a randomly sampled anchor on the unit sphere, severing the statistical link between its features and the global model. To maintain utility for the remaining parties, the server jointly optimizes a retention loss and a forgetting loss, aligning their gradients via orthogonal projection to eliminate destructive interference. Evaluations on public benchmarks show that REMISVFU suppresses back-door attack success to the natural class-prior level and sacrifices only about 2.5% points of clean accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "REMISVFU\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5782\u76f4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5782\u76f4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08VFL\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5e73\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08HFL\uff09\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86REMISVFU\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\u574d\u584c\u5230\u5355\u4f4d\u7403\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u968f\u673a\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4fdd\u7559\u635f\u5931\u548c\u9057\u5fd8\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71\u5bf9\u9f50\u68af\u5ea6\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u7834\u574f\u6027\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cREMISVFU\u5c06\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6291\u5236\u5230\u81ea\u7136\u7c7b\u5148\u9a8c\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4ec5\u727a\u7272\u7ea62.5%\u7684\u5e72\u51c0\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "REMISVFU\u6846\u67b6\u5728splitVFL\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u5ba2\u6237\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5207\u65ad\u4e86\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5269\u4f59\u65b9\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u3002"}}

Existing imputation-based methods attempt to estimate missing views to restore data associations, but indiscriminate imputation often introduces noise and bias, especially when the available information is insufficient. Imputation-free methods avoid this risk by relying solely on observed data, but struggle under severe incompleteness due to the lack of cross-view complementarity. To address this issue, we propose Informativeness-based Selective imputation Multi-View Clustering (ISMVC). Our method evaluates the imputation-relevant informativeness of each missing position based on intra-view similarity and cross-view consistency, and selectively imputes only when sufficient support is available. Furthermore, we integrate this selection with a variational autoencoder equipped with a mixture-of-Gaussians prior to learn clustering-friendly latent representations. By performing distribution-level imputation, ISMVC not only stabilizes the aggregation of posterior distributions but also explicitly models imputation uncertainty, enabling robust fusion and preventing overconfident reconstructions. Compared with existing cautious imputation strategies that depend on training dynamics or model feedback, our method is lightweight, data-driven, and model-agnostic. It can be readily integrated into existing IMC models as a plug-in module.

To address this challenge, we propose EmerFlow, a novel LLM-empowered representation learning framework that generates distinctive embeddings for emerging items.

Segmenting these filaments in biological images is a fundamental step for quantitative analysis. Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the performance of filament segmentation. However, there is a big challenge in acquiring high quality pixel-level annotated dataset for filamentous structures, as the dense distribution and geometric properties of filaments making manual annotation extremely laborious and time-consuming.

However, building agents for these tasks faces a critical bottleneck: the reliance on ever-expanding interaction history incurs substantial context overhead. Existing context management and compression techniques often fail to preserve vital semantic information, leading to degraded task performance. We propose AgentProg, a program-guided approach for agent context management that reframes the interaction history as a program with variables and control flow. By organizing information according to the structure of program, this structure provides a principled mechanism to determine which information should be retained and which can be discarded. We further integrate a global belief state mechanism inspired by Belief MDP framework to handle partial observability and adapt to unexpected environmental changes. Experiments on AndroidWorld and our extended long-horizon task suite demonstrate that AgentProg has achieved the state-of-the-art success rates on these benchmarks.

They ig- nore the entropy intervention during the RL sampling that can boost the performance of GRPO by improving the di- versity of responses. In this paper, we propose Selective- adversarial Entropy Intervention, namely SaEI, which en- hances policy entropy by distorting the visual input with the token-selective adversarial objective coming from the en- tropy of sampled responses. Specifically, we first propose entropy-guided adversarial sampling (EgAS) that formu- lates the entropy of sampled responses as an adversarial ob- jective. Then, the corresponding adversarial gradient can be used to attack the visual input for producing adversarial samples, allowing the policy model to explore a larger an- swer space during RL sampling. Then, we propose token- selective entropy computation (TsEC) to maximize the ef- fectiveness of adversarial attack in EgAS without distorting factual knowledge within VLMs. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets show that our proposed method can greatly improve policy exploration via entropy intervention, to boost reasoning capabilities.

Additionally, practical sequential planning often involves non-optimal (erroneous) steps, challenging VLMs to detect and correct such steps. We propose Corrective Sequential Planning Benchmark (CoSPlan) to evaluate VLMs in error-prone, vision-based sequential planning tasks across 4 domains: maze navigation, block rearrangement, image reconstruction,and object reorganization. CoSPlan assesses two key abilities: Error Detection (identifying non-optimal action) and Step Completion (correcting and completing action sequences to reach the goal). Despite using state-of-the-art reasoning techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and Scene Graphs, VLMs (e.g. Intern-VLM and Qwen2) struggle on CoSPlan, failing to leverage contextual cues to reach goals.

To this end, we introduce OmniZoo, a large-scale animal motion dataset spanning 140 species and 32,979 sequences, enriched with multimodal annotations. Building on OmniZoo, we propose a generalized autoregressive motion generation framework capable of producing text-driven motions for arbitrary skeletal topologies. Central to our model is a Topology-aware Skeleton Embedding Module that encodes geometric and structural properties of any skeleton into a shared token space, enabling seamless fusion with textual semantics.

However, existing approaches often rely on 2D encoders that neglect the inherent volumetric nature of the data. We propose TranSamba, a hybrid Transformer-Mamba architecture designed to capture 3D context for weakly supervised volumetric medical segmentation. TranSamba augments a standard Vision Transformer backbone with Cross-Plane Mamba blocks, which leverage the linear complexity of state space models for efficient information exchange across neighboring slices. The information exchange enhances the pairwise self-attention within slices computed by the Transformer blocks, directly contributing to the attention maps for object localization.

We present mmCounter, which accurately counts static people in dense indoor spaces (up to three people per square meter). mmCounter achieves this by extracting ultra-low frequency (< 1 Hz) signals, primarily from breathing and micro-scale body movements such as slight torso shifts, and applying novel signal processing techniques to differentiate these subtle signals from background noise and nearby static objects. Our problem differs significantly from existing studies on breathing rate estimation, which assume the number of people is known a priori. In contrast, mmCounter utilizes a novel multi-stage signal processing pipeline to extract relevant low-frequency sources along with their spatial information and map these sources to individual people, enabling accurate counting. Extensive evaluations in various environments demonstrate that mmCounter delivers an 87% average F1 score and 0.6 mean absolute error in familiar environments, and a 60% average F1 score and 1.1 mean absolute error in previously untested environments.

Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms single-agent baselines, producing diverse and structurally valid environments from natural language descriptions.

In this work, we make the first attempt to build a medalist-level LLM agent for geometry and present InternGeometry. InternGeometry overcomes the heuristic limitations in geometry by iteratively proposing propositions and auxiliary constructions, verifying them with a symbolic engine, and reflecting on the engine's feedback to guide subsequent proposals. A dynamic memory mechanism enables InternGeometry to conduct more than two hundred interactions with the symbolic engine per problem. To further accelerate learning, we introduce Complexity-Boosting Reinforcement Learning (CBRL), which gradually increases the complexity of synthesized problems across training stages. Built on InternThinker-32B, InternGeometry solves 44 of 50 IMO geometry problems (2000-2024), exceeding the average gold medalist score (40.9), using only 13K training examples, just 0.004% of the data used by AlphaGeometry 2, demonstrating the potential of LLM agents on expert-level geometry tasks. InternGeometry can also propose novel auxiliary constructions for IMO problems that do not appear in human solutions. We will release the model, data, and symbolic engine to support future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "InternGeometry\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u8fbe\u5230IMO\u91d1\u724c\u6c34\u5e73\u7684LLM\u51e0\u4f55\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5185\u5b58\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5373\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709AI\u51e0\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u4e2d\u56e0\u8f85\u52a9\u6784\u9020\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u8584\u5f31\u800c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u63d0\u51fa\u547d\u9898\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u6784\u9020\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u7b26\u53f7\u5f15\u64ce\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u9988\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u5185\u5b58\u673a\u5236\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CBRL\uff09\u52a0\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "InternGeometry\u89e3\u51b3\u4e8644/50\u7684IMO\u51e0\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\uff082000-2024\uff09\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u91d1\u724c\u5f97\u4e3b\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u7ee9\uff0840.9\uff09\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752813K\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff08AlphaGeometry 2\u76840.004%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "InternGeometry\u5c55\u793a\u4e86LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u51e0\u4f55\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u7c7b\u91d1\u724c\u5f97\u4e3b\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u7ee9\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u4e3aIMO\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u6784\u9020\u3002"}}

While methods that crop salient regions of an image offer a partial solution, we identify a critical limitation they introduce: \"Contextual Blindness\". This failure occurs due to structural disconnect between high-fidelity details (from the crop) and the broader global context (from the original image), even when all necessary visual information is present. We argue that this limitation stems not from a lack of information 'Quantity', but from a lack of 'Structural Diversity' in the model's input. To resolve this, we propose Visual Funnel, a training-free, two-step approach. Visual Funnel first performs Contextual Anchoring to identify the region of interest in a single forward pass. It then constructs an Entropy-Scaled Portfolio that preserves the hierarchical context - ranging from focal detail to broader surroundings - by dynamically determining crop sizes based on attention entropy and refining crop centers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Visual Funnel significantly outperforms naive single-crop and unstructured multi-crop baselines. Our results further validate that simply adding more unstructured crops provides limited or even detrimental benefits, confirming that the hierarchical structure of our portfolio is key to resolving Contextual Blindness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Visual Funnel\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u88c1\u526a\u89e3\u51b3MLLMs\u7684'Contextual Blindness'\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "MLLMs\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\u611f\u77e5\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u88c1\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bfc\u81f4'Contextual Blindness'\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Visual Funnel\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e24\u6b65\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u8fdb\u884cContextual Anchoring\u5b9a\u4f4d\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6784\u5efaEntropy-Scaled Portfolio\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u71b5\u52a8\u6001\u786e\u5b9a\u88c1\u526a\u5927\u5c0f\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5fc3\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVisual Funnel\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u88c1\u526a\u548c\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u88c1\u526a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "Visual Funnel\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7684\u88c1\u526a\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MLLMs\u4e2d\u7684'Contextual Blindness'\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

The core technical challenge of LVMR stems from the computational infeasibility of processing entire lengthy videos in a single pass. This limitation has established a 'Search-then-Refine' approach, where candidates are rapidly narrowed down, and only those portions are analyzed, as the dominant paradigm for LVMR. However, existing approaches to this paradigm face severe limitations. Conventional supervised learning suffers from limited scalability and poor generalization, despite substantial resource consumption. Yet, existing zero-shot methods also fail, facing a dual challenge: (1) their heuristic strategies cause a 'search' phase candidate explosion, and (2) the 'refine' phase, which is vulnerable to semantic discrepancy, requires high-cost VLMs for verification, incurring significant computational overhead. We propose \\textbf{P}oint-\\textbf{to}-\\textbf{S}pan (P2S), a novel training-free framework to overcome this challenge of inefficient 'search' and costly 'refine' phases. P2S overcomes these challenges with two key innovations: an 'Adaptive Span Generator' to prevent the search phase candidate explosion, and 'Query Decomposition' to refine candidates without relying on high-cost VLM verification.

Traditional design methodologies that blend human expertise with specialized simulation tools scale poorly with the increasing system complexity. Recent studies adopt generative artificial intelligence to design plausible human-centric indoor layouts. However, they do not consider the underlying physics, making them unsuitable for the DC design that sets quantifiable operational objectives and strict physical constraints. To bridge the gap, we propose Phythesis, a novel framework that synergizes large language models (LLMs) and physics-guided evolutionary optimization to automate simulation-ready (SimReady) scene synthesis for energy-efficient DC design. Phythesis employs an iterative bi-level optimization architecture, where (i) the LLM-driven optimization level generates physically plausible three-dimensional layouts and self-criticizes them to refine the scene topology, and (ii) the physics-informed optimization level identifies the optimal asset parameters and selects the best asset combination. Experiments on three generation scales show that Phythesis achieves 57.3% generation success rate increase and 11.5% power usage effectiveness (PUE) improvement, compared with the vanilla LLM-based solution.", "AI": {"tldr": "Phythesis\u7ed3\u5408LLMs\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u80fd\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u65e5\u76ca\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709AI\u65b9\u6848\u672a\u8003\u8651\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u62ecLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5c42\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u4f18\u5316\u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cPhythesis\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548cPUE\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u4e8657.3%\u548c11.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "Phythesis\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408LLMs\u548c\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, its performance heavily relies on dense, high-quality input imagery, an assumption that is often violated in real-world applications, where data is typically sparse and motion-blurred. These two issues create a vicious cycle: sparse views ignore the multi-view constraints necessary to resolve motion blur, while motion blur erases high-frequency details crucial for aligning the limited views. Thus, reconstruction often fails catastrophically, with fragmented views and a low-frequency bias. To break this cycle, we introduce CoherentGS, a novel framework for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from sparse and blurry images. Our key insight is to address these compound degradations using a dual-prior strategy. Specifically, we combine two pre-trained generative models: a specialized deblurring network for restoring sharp details and providing photometric guidance, and a diffusion model that offers geometric priors to fill in unobserved regions of the scene. This dual-prior strategy is supported by several key techniques, including a consistency-guided camera exploration module that adaptively guides the generative process, and a depth regularization loss that ensures geometric plausibility. We evaluate CoherentGS through both quantitative and qualitative experiments on synthetic and real-world scenes, using as few as 3, 6, and 9 input views. Our results demonstrate that CoherentGS significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for this challenging task.

Although a range of clustering methods have been developed, most focus exclusively on intrinsic cellular structure and ignore the pivotal role of cell-gene associations, which limits their ability to distinguish closely related cell types. To this end, we propose a Refinement Contrastive Learning framework (scRCL) that explicitly incorporates cell-gene interactions to derive more informative representations. Specifically, we introduce two contrastive distribution alignment components that reveal reliable intrinsic cellular structures by effectively exploiting cell-cell structural relationships. Additionally, we develop a refinement module that integrates gene-correlation structure learning to enhance cell embeddings by capturing underlying cell-gene associations. This module strengthens connections between cells and their associated genes, refining the representation learning to exploiting biologically meaningful relationships. Extensive experiments on several single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cell-type identification accuracy.

However, the fusion of 4D millimeter wave radar and LiDAR remains unexplored. Unlike LiDAR, radar is cheaper, more robust in various weather conditions and can detect point-wise velocity, making it a valuable complement to LiDAR. However, radar inputs pose challenges due to noise, low resolution, and sparsity. Moreover, there is currently no dataset that combines LiDAR and radar data specifically for scene flow estimation. To address this gap, we construct a Radar-LiDAR scene flow dataset based on a public real-world automotive dataset. We propose an effective preprocessing strategy for radar denoising and scene flow label generation, deriving more reliable flow ground truth for radar points out of the object boundaries. Additionally, we introduce RaLiFlow, the first joint scene flow learning framework for 4D radar and LiDAR, which achieves effective radar-LiDAR fusion through a novel Dynamic-aware Bidirectional Cross-modal Fusion (DBCF) module and a carefully designed set of loss functions. The DBCF module integrates dynamic cues from radar into the local cross-attention mechanism, enabling the propagation of contextual information across modalities. Meanwhile, the proposed loss functions mitigate the adverse effects of unreliable radar data during training and enhance the instance-level consistency in scene flow predictions from both modalities, particularly for dynamic foreground areas.

CAPTAIN first applies frequency-based noise initialization to reduce the tendency to replicate memorized patterns early in the denoising process.

In minimally invasive procedures, where visual input is the sole intraoperative modality, establishing precise pixel-level correspondences between endoscopic frames is critical for 3D reconstruction, camera tracking, and scene interpretation. However, the surgical domain presents distinct challenges: weak perspective cues, non-Lambertian tissue reflections, and complex, deformable anatomy degrade the performance of conventional computer vision techniques. While Deep Learning models have shown strong performance in natural scenes, their features are not inherently suited for fine-grained matching in surgical images and require targeted adaptation to meet the demands of this domain. This research presents a novel Deep Learning pipeline for establishing feature correspondences in endoscopic image pairs, alongside a self-supervised optimization framework for model training. The proposed methodology leverages a novel-view synthesis pipeline to generate ground-truth inlier correspondences, subsequently utilized for mining triplets within a contrastive learning paradigm. Through this self-supervised approach, we augment the DINOv2 backbone with an additional Transformer layer, specifically optimized to produce embeddings that facilitate direct matching through cosine similarity thresholding. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our pipeline surpasses state-of-the-art methodologies on the SCARED datasets improved matching precision and lower epipolar error compared to the related work.

By incorporating intermediate exit branches into the architecture, they provide less computation for simpler samples, which is particularly beneficial for resource-constrained devices where energy consumption is crucial. However, designing early-exit networks is a challenging and time-consuming process due to the need to balance efficiency and performance. Recent works have utilized Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to design more efficient early-exit networks, aiming to reduce average latency while improving model accuracy by determining the best positions and number of exit branches in the architecture. Another important factor affecting the efficiency and accuracy of early-exit networks is the depth and types of layers in the exit branches. In this paper, we use hardware-aware NAS to strengthen exit branches, considering both accuracy and efficiency during optimization. Our performance evaluation on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets demonstrates that our proposed framework, which considers varying depths and layers for exit branches along with adaptive threshold tuning, designs early-exit networks that achieve higher accuracy with the same or lower average number of MACs compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5NAS\u4f18\u5316\u65e9\u9000\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e9\u9000\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4f46\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5NAS\u6280\u672f\u4f18\u5316\u65e9\u9000\u5206\u652f\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u5c42\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9608\u503c\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u3001CIFAR-100\u548cSVHN\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u65e9\u9000\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6216\u66f4\u4f4eMACs\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5NAS\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51fa\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6216\u66f4\u4f4e\u5e73\u5747MACs\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u65e9\u9000\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, LiDAR-based point cloud acquisition is often affected by various disturbances, resulting in a large number of noise points that degrade the accuracy of subsequent point cloud object detection and recognition. Moreover, existing point cloud denoising methods typically sacrifice computational efficiency in pursuit of higher denoising accuracy, or, conversely, improve processing speed at the expense of preserving object boundaries and fine structural details, making it difficult to simultaneously achieve high denoising accuracy, strong edge preservation, and real-time performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an adaptive dual-weight gravitational-based point cloud denoising method. First, an octree is employed to perform spatial partitioning of the global point cloud, enabling parallel acceleration. Then, within each leaf node, adaptive voxel-based occupancy statistics and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) density estimation are applied to rapidly remove clearly isolated and low-density noise points, thereby reducing the effective candidate set. Finally, a gravitational scoring function that combines density weights with adaptive distance weights is constructed to finely distinguish noise points from object points. Experiments conducted on the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository, the Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions (CADC) dataset, and in-house FMCW LiDAR point clouds acquired in our laboratory demonstrate that, compared with existing methods, the proposed approach achieves consistent improvements in F1, PSNR, and Chamfer Distance (CD) across various noise conditions while reducing the single-frame processing time, thereby validating its high accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance in multi-noise scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53cc\u6743\u91cd\u5f15\u529b\u70b9\u4e91\u53bb\u566a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u516b\u53c9\u6811\u7a7a\u95f4\u5212\u5206\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u53bb\u566a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u70b9\u4e91\u91c7\u96c6\u5e38\u53d7\u5e72\u6270\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u70b9\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u540e\u7eed\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u53bb\u566a\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u53bb\u566a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u5f3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u516b\u53c9\u6811\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5c40\u70b9\u4e91\u7a7a\u95f4\u5212\u5206\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u884c\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f53\u7d20\u5360\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u548ck\u8fd1\u90bb\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5feb\u901f\u53bb\u9664\u5b64\u7acb\u548c\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u70b9\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u5408\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8ddd\u79bb\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u7cbe\u7ec6\u533a\u5206\u566a\u58f0\u70b9\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728F1\u3001PSNR\u548cChamfer Distance\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5355\u5e27\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53cc\u6743\u91cd\u5f15\u529b\u70b9\u4e91\u53bb\u566a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u566a\u58f0\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, millions use LLMs for personal advice on high-stakes topics like finance and health, where harms are context-dependent rather than universal. While frameworks like the OECD's AI classification recognize the need to assess individual risks, user-welfare safety evaluations remain underdeveloped. We argue that developing such evaluations is non-trivial due to fundamental questions about accounting for user context in evaluation design. In this exploratory study, we evaluated advice on finance and health from GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across user profiles of varying vulnerability. First, we demonstrate that evaluators must have access to rich user context: identical LLM responses were rated significantly safer by context-blind evaluators than by those aware of user circumstances, with safety scores for high-vulnerability users dropping from safe (5/7) to somewhat unsafe (3/7). One might assume this gap could be addressed by creating realistic user prompts containing key contextual information. However, our second study challenges this: we rerun the evaluation on prompts containing context users report they would disclose, finding no significant improvement. Our work establishes that effective user-welfare safety evaluation requires evaluators to assess responses against diverse user profiles, as realistic user context disclosure alone proves insufficient, particularly for vulnerable populations. By demonstrating a methodology for context-aware evaluation, this study provides both a starting point for such assessments and foundational evidence that evaluating individual welfare demands approaches distinct from existing universal-risk frameworks.

Existing research primarily focuses on video-level classification, leaving the practically crucial task of temporal localisation, identifying when hateful segments occur, largely unaddressed.

MultiHateLoc incorporates (1) modality-aware temporal encoders to model heterogeneous sequential patterns, including a tailored text-based preprocessing module for feature enhancement; (2) dynamic cross-modal fusion to adaptively emphasise the most informative modality at each moment and a cross-modal contrastive alignment strategy to enhance multimodal feature consistency; (3) a modality-aware MIL objective to identify discriminative segments under video-level supervision.

However, many medical VLMs rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which optimizes next-token prediction without evaluating answer quality. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) can incorporate task-specific feedback, and its combination with explicit intermediate reasoning (\"thinking\") has demonstrated substantial gains on verifiable math and coding tasks. To investigate the effects of RL and thinking in a CXR VLM, we perform large-scale SFT on CXR data to build an updated RadVLM based on Qwen3-VL, followed by a cold-start SFT stage that equips the model with basic thinking ability. We then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with clinically grounded, task-specific rewards for report generation and visual grounding, and run matched RL experiments on both domain-specific and general-domain Qwen3-VL variants, with and without thinking. Across these settings, we find that while strong SFT remains crucial for high base performance, RL provides additional gains on both tasks, whereas explicit thinking does not appear to further improve results.

A significant domain gap causes advanced models to fail in wild terrains due to two key issues: lack of large-scale vectorized datasets and structural weakness in prevailing methods. Models such as SAM-Road employ a node-centric paradigm that reasons at sparse endpoints, making them fragile to occlusions and ambiguous junctions in off-road scenes, leading to topological errors.This work addresses these limitations in two complementary ways. First, we release WildRoad, a gloabal off-road road network dataset constructed efficiently with a dedicated interactive annotation tool tailored for road-network labeling. Second, we introduce MaGRoad (Mask-aware Geodesic Road network extractor), a path-centric framework that aggregates multi-scale visual evidence along candidate paths to infer connectivity robustly.Extensive experiments show that MaGRoad achieves state-of-the-art performance on our challenging WildRoad benchmark while generalizing well to urban datasets. A streamlined pipeline also yields roughly 2.5x faster inference, improving practical applicability.

ReMe innovates across the memory lifecycle via three mechanisms: 1) $\\textit{multi-faceted distillation}$, which extracts fine-grained experiences by recognizing success patterns, analyzing failure triggers and generating comparative insights; 2) $\\textit{context-adaptive reuse}$, which tailors historical insights to new contexts via scenario-aware indexing; and 3) $\\textit{utility-based refinement}$, which autonomously adds valid memories and prunes outdated ones to maintain a compact, high-quality experience pool. Extensive experiments on BFCL-V3 and AppWorld demonstrate that ReMe establishes a new state-of-the-art in agent memory system.

General-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) shows promise but lacks domain-specific reliability. We evaluated the performance of CA-GPT, a novel large model deployed on an AI-OCT system, against that of the general-purpose ChatGPT-5 and junior physicians for OCT-guided PCI planning and assessment.\n  Methods: In this single-center analysis of 96 patients who underwent OCT-guided PCI, the procedural decisions generated by the CA-GPT, ChatGPT-5, and junior physicians were compared with an expert-derived procedural record. Agreement was assessed using ten pre-specified metrics across pre-PCI and post-PCI phases.\n  Results: For pre-PCI planning, CA-GPT demonstrated significantly higher median agreement scores (5[IQR 3.75-5]) compared to both ChatGPT-5 (3[2-4], P<0.001) and junior physicians (4[3-4], P<0.001). CA-GPT significantly outperformed ChatGPT-5 across all individual pre-PCI metrics and showed superior performance to junior physicians in stent diameter (90.3% vs. 72.2%, P<0.05) and length selection (80.6% vs. 52.8%, P<0.01). In post-PCI assessment, CA-GPT maintained excellent overall agreement (5[4.75-5]), significantly higher than both ChatGPT-5 (4[4-5], P<0.001) and junior physicians (5[4-5], P<0.05). Subgroup analysis confirmed CA-GPT's robust performance advantage in complex scenarios.\n  Conclusion: The CA-GPT-based AI-OCT system achieved superior decision-making agreement versus a general-purpose large language model and junior physicians across both PCI planning and assessment phases. This approach provides a standardized and reliable method for intravascular imaging interpretation, demonstrating significant potential to augment operator expertise and optimize OCT-guided PCI.", "AI": {"tldr": "CA-GPT\u5728OCT\u5f15\u5bfcPCI\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eChatGPT-5\u548c\u521d\u7ea7\u533b\u751f\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8840\u7ba1\u5185\u5f71\u50cf\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662fOCT\uff09\u6539\u5584\u4e86PCI\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u89e3\u8bfb\u4f9d\u8d56\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002\u901a\u7528AI\u867d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b0\u578b\u5927\u6a21\u578bCA-GPT\u5728AI-OCT\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5355\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7eb3\u516596\u540d\u63a5\u53d7OCT\u5f15\u5bfcPCI\u7684\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86CA-GPT\u3001ChatGPT-5\u548c\u521d\u7ea7\u533b\u751f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u752810\u9879\u9884\u8bbe\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u672f\u524d\u548c\u672f\u540e\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u672f\u524d\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\uff0cCA-GPT\u7684\u4e2d\u4f4d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8eChatGPT-5\u548c\u521d\u7ea7\u533b\u751f\uff1b\u5728\u672f\u540e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cCA-GPT\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eCA-GPT\u7684AI-OCT\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728PCI\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u521d\u7ea7\u533b\u751f\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8840\u7ba1\u5185\u5f71\u50cf\u89e3\u8bfb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\u4e13\u4e1a\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u4e86OCT\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684PCI\u3002"}}

Recently, Neural Collapse (NC) has been proposed as an emergent geometric property of deep neural networks (DNNs), providing valuable insights for TTA. In this work, we extend NC to the sample-wise level and discover a novel phenomenon termed Sample-wise Alignment Collapse (NC3+), demonstrating that a sample's feature embedding, obtained by a trained model, aligns closely with the corresponding classifier weight. Building on NC3+, we identify that the performance degradation stems from sample-wise misalignment in adaptation which exacerbates under larger distribution shifts. This indicates the necessity of realigning the feature embeddings with their corresponding classifier weights. However, the misalignment makes pseudo-labels unreliable under domain shifts. To address this challenge, we propose NCTTA, a novel feature-classifier alignment method with hybrid targets to mitigate the impact of unreliable pseudo-labels, which blends geometric proximity with predictive confidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of NCTTA in enhancing robustness to domain shifts.

Prior corrective approaches, such as Self-RAG, CRAG, and Adaptive-$k$, typically address this by \\textit{adding} more context or pruning existing lists. However, simply expanding the context window often leads to \\textbf{context dilution}, where distractors crowd out relevant information. We propose \\textbf{SEAL-RAG}, a training-free controller that adopts a \\textbf{``replace, don't expand''} strategy to fight context dilution under a fixed retrieval depth $k$. SEAL executes a (\\textbf{S}earch $\\rightarrow$ \\textbf{E}xtract $\\rightarrow$ \\textbf{A}ssess $\\rightarrow$ \\textbf{L}oop) cycle: it performs on-the-fly, entity-anchored extraction to build a live \\textit{gap specification} (missing entities/relations), triggers targeted micro-queries, and uses \\textit{entity-first ranking} to actively swap out distractors for gap-closing evidence. We evaluate SEAL-RAG against faithful re-implementations of Basic RAG, CRAG, Self-RAG, and Adaptive-$k$ in a shared environment on \\textbf{HotpotQA} and \\textbf{2WikiMultiHopQA}. On HotpotQA ($k=3$), SEAL improves answer correctness by \\textbf{+3--13 pp} and evidence precision by \\textbf{+12--18 pp} over Self-RAG. On 2WikiMultiHopQA ($k=5$), it outperforms Adaptive-$k$ by \\textbf{+8.0 pp} in accuracy and maintains \\textbf{96\\%} evidence precision compared to 22\\% for CRAG. These gains are statistically significant ($p<0.001$). By enforcing fixed-$k$ replacement, SEAL yields a predictable cost profile while ensuring the top-$k$ slots are optimized for precision rather than mere breadth.

The proposed method interprets a kinetic movement as a sequence of static poses, which are estimated from camera input using a pose-estimation neural network. Extracted body keypoints are transformed into trigonometric angle-based features and classified with lightweight supervised models to generate frame-level pose predictions and accuracy scores. To recognize full exercise movements and detect deviations from prescribed patterns, we employ a dynamic-programming scheme based on a modified Levenshtein distance algorithm, enabling robust sequence matching and localization of inaccuracies.

In realistic scenarios, variations across individuals, devices, environments, and time introduce significant distributional shifts for the same activities. Recent efforts attempt to solve this challenge by applying or adapting existing out-of-distribution (OOD) algorithms, but only in certain distribution shift scenarios (e.g., cross-device or cross-position), lacking comprehensive insights on the effectiveness of these algorithms. For instance, is OOD necessary to HAR? Which OOD algorithm performs the best? In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing HAROOD, a comprehensive benchmark for HAR in OOD settings. We define 4 OOD scenarios: cross-person, cross-position, cross-dataset, and cross-time, and build a testbed covering 6 datasets, 16 comparative methods (implemented with CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures), and two model selection protocols. Then, we conduct extensive experiments and present several findings for future research, e.g., no single method consistently outperforms others, highlighting substantial opportunity for advancement. Our codebase is highly modular and easy to extend for new datasets, algorithms, comparisons, and analysis, with the hope to facilitate the research in OOD-based HAR.

The separate-transform framework employs distinct transforms for intra-frame and inter-frame compression to yield impressive rate-distortion (R-D) performance but causes evident error propagation, while the unified-transform framework eliminates error propagation via shared transforms but is inferior in ME/MC in shared latent domains. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel unifiedtransform framework with dual-domain progressive temporal alignment and quality-conditioned mixture-of-expert (QCMoE) to enable quality-consistent and error-propagation-free streaming for learned video compression. Specifically, we propose dualdomain progressive temporal alignment for ME/MC that leverages coarse pixel-domain alignment and refined latent-domain alignment to significantly enhance temporal context modeling in a coarse-to-fine fashion. The coarse pixel-domain alignment efficiently handles simple motion patterns with optical flow estimated from a single reference frame, while the refined latent-domain alignment develops a Flow-Guided Deformable Transformer (FGDT) over latents from multiple reference frames to achieve long-term motion refinement (LTMR) for complex motion patterns. Furthermore, we design a QCMoE module for continuous bit-rate adaptation that dynamically assigns different experts to adjust quantization steps per pixel based on target quality and content rather than relies on a single quantization step. QCMoE allows continuous and consistent rate control with appealing R-D performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves competitive R-D performance compared with the state-of-the-arts, while successfully eliminating error propagation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u57df\u6e10\u8fdb\u5bf9\u9f50\u548cQCMoE\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u53d8\u6362\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u7387\u5931\u771f\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u8865\u507f\uff08ME/MC\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u53c8\u80fd\u6d88\u9664\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u53d8\u6362\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u57df\u6e10\u8fdb\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\uff08QCMoE\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d28\u91cf\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u65e0\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u6d41\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5305\u62ec\u53cc\u57df\u6e10\u8fdb\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u548cQCMoE\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7387\u5931\u771f\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u6bd4\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6210\u529f\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7387\u5931\u771f\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u3002"}}

We operationalize the common strategies in deliberation used by real content moderators into a human-in-the-loop framework called \"Agile Deliberation\" that explicitly supports evolving and subjective concepts. The system supports users in defining the concept for themselves by exposing them to borderline cases. The system does this with two deliberation stages: (1) concept scoping, which decomposes the initial concept into a structured hierarchy of sub-concepts, and (2) concept iteration, which surfaces semantically borderline examples for user reflection and feedback to iteratively align an image classifier with the user's evolving intent. Since concept deliberation is inherently subjective and interactive, we painstakingly evaluate the framework through 18 user sessions, each 1.5h long, rather than standard benchmarking datasets.

Most recent deep learning-based SFF methods typically operate in two stages: first, they extract focus volumes (a per pixel representation of focus likelihood across the focal stack) using heavy feature encoders; then, they estimate depth via a simple one-step aggregation technique that often introduces artifacts and amplifies noise in the depth map. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid framework. Our method computes multi-scale focus volumes traditionally using handcrafted Directional Dilated Laplacian (DDL) kernels, which capture long-range and directional focus variations to form robust focus volumes. These focus volumes are then fed into a lightweight, multi-scale GRU-based depth extraction module that iteratively refines an initial depth estimate at a lower resolution for computational efficiency. Finally, a learned convex upsampling module within our recurrent network reconstructs high-resolution depth maps while preserving fine scene details and sharp boundaries. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and traditional methods, achieving superior accuracy and generalization across diverse focal conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edfDDL\u6838\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7GRU\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eSFF\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728SFF\u4e2d\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u653e\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u624b\u5de5\u5236\u4f5c\u7684DDL\u6838\u8ba1\u7b97\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u805a\u7126\u4f53\u79ef\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684GRU\u6df1\u5ea6\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u5757\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u521d\u59cb\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u51f8\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u6a21\u5757\u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u805a\u7126\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5747\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

A pairwise preference-based approach is logically superior, providing a more rigorous and internally consistent basis for ranking, but its quadratic workload makes it impractical for human reviewers. We address this limitation using LLMs. Leveraging the uniquely well-curated proposals and publication records from three beamlines at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), we show that the LLM rankings correlate strongly with the human rankings (Spearman $\u03c1\\simeq 0.2-0.8$, improving to $\\geq 0.5$ after 10\\% outlier removal). Moreover, LLM performance is no worse than that of human reviewers in identifying proposals with high publication potential, while costing over two orders of magnitude less.

While prior research has mainly focused on improving decoders, the encoder's limited ability to extract meaningful features for unseen classes remains a key bottleneck. In this work, we introduce \\textit{Take a Peek} (TaP), a simple yet effective method that enhances encoder adaptability for both FSS and cross-domain FSS (CD-FSS). TaP leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the encoder on the support set with minimal computational overhead, enabling fast adaptation to novel classes while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing FSS pipelines. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks--including COCO $20^i$, Pascal $5^i$, and cross-domain datasets such as DeepGlobe, ISIC, and Chest X-ray--demonstrate that TaP consistently improves segmentation performance across diverse models and shot settings. Notably, TaP delivers significant gains in complex multi-class scenarios, highlighting its practical effectiveness in realistic settings.

Our method introduces learnable masks across multiple levels of granularity, from entire blocks to individual neurons, within a unified optimization objective. Granularity-specific sparsity penalties guide the pruning process, allowing a comprehensive compression in a single fine-tuning run. Empirically, our approach identifies circuits that are smaller in nodes than those discovered by prior methods; moreover, we demonstrate that many neurons deemed important by coarse methods are actually irrelevant, while still maintaining task performance.

Humans, in comparison, perceive complex scenes efficiently by dynamically scanning and focusing on salient regions in a sequential \"blink-like\" process. Motivated by this strategy, we first investigate whether MLLMs exhibit similar behavior. Our pilot analysis reveals that MLLMs naturally attend to different visual regions across layers and that selectively allocating more computation to salient tokens can enhance visual perception. Building on this insight, we propose Blink, a dynamic visual token resolution framework that emulates the human-inspired process within a single forward pass. Specifically, Blink includes two modules: saliency-guided scanning and dynamic token resolution. It first estimates the saliency of visual tokens in each layer based on the attention map, and extends important tokens through a plug-and-play token super-resolution (TokenSR) module. In the next layer, it drops the extended tokens when they lose focus. This dynamic mechanism balances broad exploration and fine-grained focus, thereby enhancing visual perception adaptively and efficiently. Extensive experiments validate Blink, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing visual perception and multimodal understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "Blink\u6846\u67b6\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u52a8\u6001\u805a\u7126\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u6001\u626b\u63cf\u548c\u805a\u7126\u663e\u8457\u533a\u57df\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5c1d\u8bd5\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Blink\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u663e\u8457\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u626b\u63cf\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4ee4\u724c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u4ee4\u724c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86Blink\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Blink\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the autoregressive Transformer architecture used by MLLMs requries tokenization on input images, which limits their ability to accurately ground objects within the 2D image space. This raises an important question: how can sequential language tokens be improved to better ground objects in 2D spatial space for MLLMs? To address this, we present a spatial representation method for grounding objects, namely GETok, that integrates a specialized vocabulary of learnable tokens into MLLMs. GETok first uses grid tokens to partition the image plane into structured spatial anchors, and then exploits offset tokens to enable precise and iterative refinement of localization predictions. By embedding spatial relationships directly into tokens, GETok significantly advances MLLMs in native 2D space reasoning without modifying the autoregressive architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GETok achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods across various referring tasks in both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "GETok\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdbMLLMs\u57282D\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u7528token\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\uff08\u7f51\u683c\u548c\u504f\u79fbtoken\uff09\u76f4\u63a5\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u56de\u5f52Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u5728MLLMs\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u7684token\u5316\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u57282D\u56fe\u50cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u5e8f\u5217\u8bed\u8a00token\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u57282D\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u8c61\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5GETok\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60token\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7f51\u683ctoken\u548c\u504f\u79fbtoken\uff0c\u4ee5\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u951a\u70b9\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9884\u6d4b\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u8c61\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGETok\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u6307\u4ee3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GETok\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u76f4\u63a5\u5d4c\u5165\u5230token\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86MLLMs\u5728\u539f\u751f2D\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u67b6\u6784\u3002"}}

However, robust ISLR is fundamentally constrained by data scarcity and the long-tail distribution of sign vocabulary, where gathering sufficient examples for thousands of unique signs is prohibitively expensive. Standard classification approaches struggle under these conditions, often overfitting to frequent classes while failing to generalize to rare ones. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Few-Shot Prototypical Network framework adapted for a skeleton based encoder. Unlike traditional classifiers that learn fixed decision boundaries, our approach utilizes episodic training to learn a semantic metric space where signs are classified based on their proximity to dynamic class prototypes. We integrate a Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) with a novel Multi-Scale Temporal Aggregation (MSTA) module to capture both rapid and fluid motion dynamics. Experimental results on the WLASL dataset demonstrate the superiority of this metric learning paradigm: our model achieves 43.75% Top-1 and 77.10% Top-5 accuracy on the test set. Crucially, this outperforms a standard classification baseline sharing the identical backbone architecture by over 13%, proving that the prototypical training strategy effectively outperforms in a data scarce situation where standard classification fails.

In this work, we reveal a critical insight: well-crafted feature extraction inherently encodes degradation-carrying information, and a symmetric U-Net architecture is sufficient to unleash these cues effectively. By aligning feature scales across encoder-decoder and enabling streamlined cross-scale propagation, our symmetric design preserves intrinsic degradation signals robustly, rendering simple additive fusion in skip connections sufficient for state-of-the-art performance. Our primary baseline, SymUNet, is built on this symmetric U-Net and achieves better results across benchmark datasets than existing approaches while reducing computational cost.

However, most existing SOD methods assume low-noise visual conditions, overlooking the degradation of segmentation accuracy caused by weather-induced noise in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a SOD framework tailored for diverse weather conditions, encompassing a specific encoder and a replaceable decoder. To enable handling of varying weather noises, we introduce a one-hot vector as a noise indicator to represent different weather types and design a Noise Indicator Fusion Module (NIFM). The NIFM takes both semantic features and the noise indicator as dual inputs and is inserted between consecutive stages of the encoder to embed weather-aware priors via adaptive feature modulation.

While large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising path to bridge this gap, existing methods often rely on costly, domain-specific training, and there is a lack of benchmarks to evaluate the practical utility of VLM-generated text in a zero-shot retrieval context. To address this research gap, we introduce the Remote Sensing Rich Text (RSRT) dataset, a new benchmark featuring multiple structured captions per image. Based on this dataset, we propose a fully training-free, text-only retrieval reference called TRSLLaVA. Our methodology reformulates cross-modal retrieval as a text-to-text (T2T) matching problem, leveraging rich text descriptions as queries against a database of VLM-generated captions within a unified textual embedding space. This approach completely bypasses model training or fine-tuning. Experiments on the RSITMD and RSICD benchmarks show our training-free method is highly competitive with state-of-the-art supervised models. For instance, on RSITMD, our method achieves a mean Recall of 42.62\\%, nearly doubling the 23.86\\% of the standard zero-shot CLIP baseline and surpassing several top supervised models.

Our key insight is that motion patterns, when aligned with contrastive vision-language representations, provide powerful semantic signals for recognizing and describing actions. Through unified training that combines global video-text alignment with fine-grained spatial correspondence, TCAM enables query-free discovery of multiple motion expressions via multi-head cross-attention.

While vision language models (VLMs) have significantly advanced this task, achieving reliable, high-quality parsing in real-world scenarios remains challenging. Common practice often selects the top-performing model on standard benchmarks. However, these benchmarks may carry dataset-specific biases, leading to inconsistent model rankings and limited correlation with real-world performance. Moreover, benchmark metrics typically provide only overall scores, which can obscure distinct error patterns in output. This raises a key challenge: how can we reliably and comprehensively assess document parsing quality in the wild? We address this problem with DOCR-Inspector, which formalizes document parsing assessment as fine-grained error detection and analysis. Leveraging VLM-as-a-Judge, DOCR-Inspector analyzes a document image and its parsed output, identifies all errors, assigns them to one of 28 predefined types, and produces a comprehensive quality assessment. To enable this capability, we construct DOCRcase-200K for training and propose the Chain-of-Checklist reasoning paradigm to enable the hierarchical structure of parsing quality assessment. For empirical validation, we introduce DOCRcaseBench, a set of 882 real-world document parsing cases with manual annotations. On this benchmark, DOCR-Inspector-7B outperforms commercial models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, as well as leading open-source models. Further experiments demonstrate that its quality assessments provide valuable guidance for parsing results refinement, making DOCR-Inspector both a practical evaluator and a driver for advancing document parsing systems at scale.

We introduce K-Track (Kalman-enhanced Tracking), a general-purpose, tracker-agnostic acceleration framework designed to bridge this deployment gap.

While traditional rule-based systems can react to these commands, they often struggle in dynamic environments, and end-to-end methods face challenges in complying with explicit navigation commands. To address this, we present NaviHydra, a controllable navigation-guided end-to-end model distilled from an existing rule-based simulator. Our framework accepts high-level navigation commands as control signals, generating trajectories that align with specified intentions. We utilize a Bird's Eye View (BEV) based trajectory gathering method to enhance the trajectory feature extraction.

While current models excel at capturing an object's surface geometry and appearance, they largely neglect its internal physical properties. This omission is critical, as properties like volumetric density are fundamental for predicting an object's center of mass, stability, and interaction dynamics in applications ranging from robotic manipulation to physical simulation. The primary bottleneck has been the absence of large-scale, real-world data. To bridge this gap, we introduce XDen-1K, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset designed for real-world physical property estimation, with a particular focus on volumetric density. The core of this dataset consists of 1,000 real-world objects across 148 categories, for which we provide comprehensive multi-modal data, including a high-resolution 3D geometric model with part-level annotations and a corresponding set of real-world biplanar X-ray scans. Building upon this data, we introduce a novel optimization framework that recovers a high-fidelity volumetric density field of each object from its sparse X-ray views. To demonstrate its practical value, we add X-ray images as a conditioning signal to an existing segmentation network and perform volumetric segmentation. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on downstream robotics tasks. The results show that leveraging the dataset can effectively improve the accuracy of center-of-mass estimation and the success rate of robotic manipulation.

However, these approaches often introduce high latency, elevated energy consumption, and deployment risks related to connectivity, cost, and data governance; factors that conflict with the practical constraints of real-world robotics, where compute is limited and on-device inference is frequently required. We introduce Geo6DPose, a lightweight, fully local, and training-free pipeline for zero-shot 6D pose estimation that trades model scale for geometric reliability. Our method combines foundation model visual features with a geometric filtering strategy: Similarity maps are computed between onboarded template DINO descriptors and scene patches, and mutual correspondences are established by projecting scene patch centers to 3D and template descriptors to the object model coordinate system. Final poses are recovered via correspondence-driven RANSAC and ranked using a weighted geometric alignment metric that jointly accounts for reprojection consistency and spatial support, improving robustness to noise, clutter, and partial visibility. Geo6DPose achieves sub-second inference on a single commodity GPU while matching the average recall of significantly larger zero-shot baselines (53.7 AR, 1.08 FPS).

Currently, efficient SMLM requires non-overlapping emitting fluorophores, leading to long acquisition times that hinders live-cell imaging. Recent deep-learning approaches can handle denser emissions, but they rely on variants of non-maximum suppression (NMS) layers, which are unfortunately non-differentiable and may discard true positives with their local fusion strategy. In this presentation, we reformulate the SMLM training objective as a set-matching problem, deriving an optimal-transport loss that eliminates the need for NMS during inference and enables end-to-end training.

The 3D Gaussian representation produced by SHARP can then be rendered in real time, yielding high-resolution photorealistic images for nearby views. The representation is metric, with absolute scale, supporting metric camera movements. Experimental results demonstrate that SHARP delivers robust zero-shot generalization across datasets.

While prior work has largely focused on pixel-level uncertainty, landmark-based segmentation offers inherent topological guarantees yet remains underexplored from an uncertainty perspective. In this work, we study uncertainty estimation for anatomical landmark-based segmentation on chest X-rays. Inspired by hybrid neural network architectures that combine standard image convolutional encoders with graph-based generative decoders, and leveraging their variational latent space, we derive two complementary measures: (i) latent uncertainty, captured directly from the learned distribution parameters, and (ii) predictive uncertainty, obtained by generating multiple stochastic output predictions from latent samples. Through controlled corruption experiments we show that both uncertainty measures increase with perturbation severity, reflecting both global and local degradation. We demonstrate that these uncertainty signals can identify unreliable predictions by comparing with manual ground-truth, and support out-of-distribution detection on the CheXmask dataset. More importantly, we release CheXmask-U (huggingface.co/datasets/mcosarinsky/CheXmask-U), a large scale dataset of 657,566 chest X-ray landmark segmentations with per-node uncertainty estimates, enabling researchers to account for spatial variations in segmentation quality when using these anatomical masks. Our findings establish uncertainty estimation as a promising direction to enhance robustness and safe deployment of landmark-based anatomical segmentation methods in chest X-ray.

However, we find that current VLMs struggle to understand fine-grained 3D spatial relationships which is a fundamental requirement for systems interacting with the physical world. To address this issue, we propose SpaceDrive, a spatial-aware VLM-based driving framework that treats spatial information as explicit positional encodings (PEs) instead of textual digit tokens, enabling joint reasoning over semantic and spatial representations. SpaceDrive employs a universal positional encoder to all 3D coordinates derived from multi-view depth estimation, historical ego-states, and text prompts. These 3D PEs are first superimposed to augment the corresponding 2D visual tokens. Meanwhile, they serve as a task-agnostic coordinate representation, replacing the digit-wise numerical tokens as both inputs and outputs for the VLM.

However, existing methods either rely on simple frame-by-frame monocular models, leading to temporal inconsistencies and inaccuracies, or use computationally demanding temporal modeling, unsuitable for real-time applications. These limitations significantly restrict general applicability and performance in practical settings. To address this, we propose VeloDepth, an efficient and robust online video depth estimation pipeline that effectively leverages spatiotemporal priors from previous depth predictions and performs deep feature propagation. Our method introduces a novel Propagation Module that refines and propagates depth features and predictions using flow-based warping coupled with learned residual corrections. In addition, our design structurally enforces temporal consistency, resulting in stable depth predictions across consecutive frames with improved efficiency. Comprehensive zero-shot evaluation on multiple benchmarks demonstrates the state-of-the-art temporal consistency and competitive accuracy of VeloDepth, alongside its significantly faster inference compared to existing video-based depth estimators.

However, these models typically treat understanding and generation separately, limiting the mutual benefits that could arise from interactive feedback between tasks. In this work, we reveal that motion assessment and refinement tasks act as crucial bridges to enable bidirectional knowledge flow between understanding and generation. Leveraging this insight, we propose Interleaved Reasoning for Motion Generation (IRMoGen), a novel paradigm that tightly couples motion generation with assessment and refinement through iterative text-motion dialogue. To realize this, we introduce IRG-MotionLLM, the first model that seamlessly interleaves motion generation, assessment, and refinement to improve generation performance. IRG-MotionLLM is developed progressively with a novel three-stage training scheme, initializing and subsequently enhancing native IRMoGen capabilities. To facilitate this development, we construct an automated data engine to synthesize interleaved reasoning annotations from existing text-motion datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: (i) Assessment and refinement tasks significantly improve text-motion alignment; (ii) Interleaving motion generation, assessment, and refinement steps yields consistent performance gains across training stages; and (iii) IRG-MotionLLM clearly outperforms the baseline model and achieves advanced performance on standard text-to-motion generation benchmarks. Cross-evaluator testing further validates its effectiveness.

However, CFD is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to integrate into large-scale clinical workflows. These limitations restrict the availability of labeled hemodynamic data for training AI models and hinder broad adoption of non-invasive, physiology based CAD assessment. To address these challenges, we develop an end to end pipeline that automates coronary geometry extraction from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), streamlines simulation data generation, and enables efficient learning of coronary blood pressure distributions. The pipeline reduces the manual burden associated with traditional CFD workflows while producing consistent training data. We further introduce a diffusion-based regression model designed to predict coronary blood pressure directly from CCTA derived features, bypassing the need for slow CFD computation during inference. Evaluated on a dataset of simulated coronary hemodynamics, the proposed model achieves state of the art performance, with an R2 of 64.42%, a root mean squared error of 0.0974, and a normalized RMSE of 0.154, outperforming several baseline approaches.

Each item is carefully designed and reviewed by 3DV experts with explanatory rationales to ensure precise, unambiguous grounding. Leveraging its diverse data sources and holistic task coverage, MMSI-Video-Bench also supports three domain-oriented sub-benchmarks (Indoor Scene Perception Bench, Robot Bench and Grounding Bench) for targeted capability assessment. We evaluate 25 strong open-source and proprietary MLLMs, revealing a striking human--AI gap: many models perform near chance, and the best reasoning model lags humans by nearly 60%. We further find that spatially fine-tuned models still fail to generalize effectively on our benchmark. Fine-grained error analysis exposes systematic failures in geometric reasoning, motion grounding, long-horizon prediction, and cross-video correspondence. We also show that typical frame-sampling strategies transfer poorly to our reasoning-intensive benchmark, and that neither 3D spatial cues nor chain-of-thought prompting yields meaningful gains.

Existing approaches often rely on random or static patch selection, leading to the inclusion of redundant or non-informative regions that degrade performance. To address this, we propose a Graph Laplacian Attention-Based Transformer (GLAT) integrated with an Iterative Refinement Module (IRM) to enhance both feature learning and spatial consistency. The IRM iteratively refines patch selection by leveraging a pretrained ResNet50 for local feature extraction and a foundation model in no-gradient mode for importance scoring, ensuring only the most relevant tissue regions are preserved. The GLAT models tissue-level connectivity by constructing a graph where patches serve as nodes, ensuring spatial consistency through graph Laplacian constraints and refining feature representations via a learnable filtering mechanism that enhances discriminative histological structures. Additionally, a convex aggregation mechanism dynamically adjusts patch importance to generate a robust WSI-level representation.

When domain generalization (DG) encounters noise, noisy labels further exacerbate the emergence of spurious features in deep layers, i.e. spurious feature enlargement, leading to a degradation in the performance of existing algorithms. This paper, starting from domain generalization, explores how to make existing methods rework when meeting noise. We find that the latent features inside the model have certain discriminative capabilities, and different latent features focus on different parts of the image. Based on these observations, we propose the Self-Ensemble Post Learning approach (SEPL) to diversify features which can be leveraged. Specifically, SEPL consists of two parts: feature probing training and prediction ensemble inference. It leverages intermediate feature representations within the model architecture, training multiple probing classifiers to fully exploit the capabilities of pre-trained models, while the final predictions are obtained through the integration of outputs from these diverse classification heads.

Therefore, these fragmented approaches are trained on disjoint slices of available 3D/4D data. We introduce OmniView, a unified framework that generalizes across a wide range of 4D consistency tasks. Our method separately represents space, time, and view conditions, enabling flexible combinations of these inputs. For example, OmniView can synthesize novel views from static, dynamic, and multiview inputs, extrapolate trajectories forward and backward in time, and create videos from text or image prompts with full camera control. OmniView is competitive with task-specific models across diverse benchmarks and metrics, improving image quality scores among camera-conditioned diffusion models by up to 33\\% in multiview NVS LLFF dataset, 60\\% in dynamic NVS Neural 3D Video benchmark, 20\\% in static camera control on RE-10K, and reducing camera trajectory errors by 4x in text-conditioned video generation.

Existing approaches typically rely on explicitly constructing feature correspondences between the query image and either the object model or template images. In this work, we propose PoseGAM, a geometry-aware multi-view framework that directly predicts object pose from a query image and multiple template images, eliminating the need for explicit matching. Built upon recent multi-view-based foundation model architectures, the method integrates object geometry information through two complementary mechanisms: explicit point-based geometry and learned features from geometry representation networks. In addition, we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset containing more than 190k objects under diverse environmental conditions to enhance robustness and generalization. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance, yielding an average AR improvement of 5.1% over prior methods and achieving up to 17.6% gains on individual datasets, indicating strong generalization to unseen objects.

We investigate best practices to train Mull-Tokens inspired by latent reasoning frameworks. We first train Mull-Tokens using supervision from interleaved text-image traces, and then fine-tune without any supervision by only using the final answers. Across four challenging spatial reasoning benchmarks involving tasks such as solving puzzles and taking different perspectives, we demonstrate that Mull-Tokens improve upon several baselines utilizing text-only reasoning or interleaved image-text reasoning, achieving a +3% average improvement and up to +16% on a puzzle solving reasoning-heavy split compared to our strongest baseline.

The scarcity of large-scale, naturally captured 4D mesh datasets further limits the ability to train generalizable video-to-4D models from scratch in a purely data-driven manner. Meanwhile, advances in image-to-3D generation, supported by extensive datasets, offer powerful prior models that can be leveraged. To better utilize these priors while minimizing reliance on 4D supervision, we introduce SWiT-4D, a Sliding-Window Transformer for lossless, parameter-free temporal 4D mesh generation. SWiT-4D integrates seamlessly with any Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based image-to-3D generator, adding spatial-temporal modeling across video frames while preserving the original single-image forward process, enabling 4D mesh reconstruction from videos of arbitrary length. To recover global translation, we further introduce an optimization-based trajectory module tailored for static-camera monocular videos. SWiT-4D demonstrates strong data efficiency: with only a single short (<10s) video for fine-tuning, it achieves high-fidelity geometry and stable temporal consistency, indicating practical deployability under extremely limited 4D supervision. Comprehensive experiments on both in-domain zoo-test sets and challenging out-of-domain benchmarks (C4D, Objaverse, and in-the-wild videos) show that SWiT-4D consistently outperforms existing baselines in temporal smoothness.

However, existing methods lack fine-grained temporal control over subject appearance and disappearance, which are essential for applications such as compositional video synthesis, storyboarding, and controllable animation. We propose AlcheMinT, a unified framework that introduces explicit timestamps conditioning for subject-driven video generation. Our approach introduces a novel positional encoding mechanism that unlocks the encoding of temporal intervals, associated in our case with subject identities, while seamlessly integrating with the pretrained video generation model positional embeddings. Additionally, we incorporate subject-descriptive text tokens to strengthen binding between visual identity and video captions, mitigating ambiguity during generation. Through token-wise concatenation, AlcheMinT avoids any additional cross-attention modules and incurs negligible parameter overhead. We establish a benchmark evaluating multiple subject identity preservation, video fidelity, and temporal adherence. Experimental results demonstrate that AlcheMinT achieves visual quality matching state-of-the-art video personalization methods, while, for the first time, enabling precise temporal control over multi-subject generation within videos.

A Progressive Investigation", "comment": "Code is released at https://github.com/Ivan-Tang-3D/3DGen-R1", "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL), earlier proven to be effective in large language and multi-modal models, has been successfully extended to enhance 2D image generation recently. However, applying RL to 3D generation remains largely unexplored due to the higher spatial complexity of 3D objects, which require globally consistent geometry and fine-grained local textures. This makes 3D generation significantly sensitive to reward designs and RL algorithms. To address these challenges, we conduct the first systematic study of RL for text-to-3D autoregressive generation across several dimensions. (1) Reward designs: We evaluate reward dimensions and model choices, showing that alignment with human preference is crucial, and that general multi-modal models provide robust signal for 3D attributes. (2) RL algorithms: We study GRPO variants, highlighting the effectiveness of token-level optimization, and further investigate the scaling of training data and iterations. (3) Text-to-3D Benchmarks: Since existing benchmarks fail to measure implicit reasoning abilities in 3D generation models, we introduce MME-3DR. (4) Advanced RL paradigms: Motivated by the natural hierarchy of 3D generation, we propose Hi-GRPO, which optimizes the global-to-local hierarchical 3D generation through dedicated reward ensembles. Based on these insights, we develop AR3D-R1, the first RL-enhanced text-to-3D model, expert from coarse shape to texture refinement.

We formalize this gap as Category-Agnostic Motion Capture (CAMoCap): given a monocular video and an arbitrary rigged 3D asset as a prompt, the goal is to reconstruct a rotation-based animation such as BVH that directly drives the specific asset. We present MoCapAnything, a reference-guided, factorized framework that first predicts 3D joint trajectories and then recovers asset-specific rotations via constraint-aware inverse kinematics. The system contains three learnable modules and a lightweight IK stage: (1) a Reference Prompt Encoder that extracts per-joint queries from the asset's skeleton, mesh, and rendered images; (2) a Video Feature Extractor that computes dense visual descriptors and reconstructs a coarse 4D deforming mesh to bridge the gap between video and joint space; and (3) a Unified Motion Decoder that fuses these cues to produce temporally coherent trajectories. We also curate Truebones Zoo with 1038 motion clips, each providing a standardized skeleton-mesh-render triad. Experiments on both in-domain benchmarks and in-the-wild videos show that MoCapAnything delivers high-quality skeletal animations and exhibits meaningful cross-species retargeting across heterogeneous rigs, enabling scalable, prompt-driven 3D motion capture for arbitrary assets.

Due to the lack of sufficient open-set de-occlusion and pose estimation priors, existing methods struggle to simultaneously produce high-quality geometry and accurate poses under severe occlusion and open-set settings.

Then, we propose a unified pose estimation model that integrates global and local mechanisms for both self-attention and cross-attention to improve accuracy. Besides, we construct an open-set 3D scene dataset to further extend the generalization of the pose estimation model.

However, state-of-the-art models still struggle on recent motion benchmarks, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, fine-grained motion datasets. Existing motion datasets are often constructed from costly manual annotation, severely limiting scalability. To address this challenge, we introduce FoundationMotion, a fully automated data curation pipeline that constructs large-scale motion datasets. Our approach first detects and tracks objects in videos to extract their trajectories, then leverages these trajectories and video frames with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate fine-grained captions and diverse question-answer pairs about motion and spatial reasoning. Using datasets produced by this pipeline, we fine-tune open-source models including NVILA-Video-15B and Qwen2.5-7B, achieving substantial improvements in motion understanding without compromising performance on other tasks. Notably, our models outperform strong closed-source baselines like Gemini-2.5 Flash and large open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL-72B across diverse motion understanding datasets and benchmarks.

In a strictly controlled comparison against standard token-space VLM training with the same vision encoder and training data, VL-JEPA achieves stronger performance while having 50% fewer trainable parameters. At inference time, a lightweight text decoder is invoked only when needed to translate VL-JEPA predicted embeddings into text. We show that VL-JEPA natively supports selective decoding that reduces the number of decoding operations by 2.85x while maintaining similar performance compared to non-adaptive uniform decoding. Beyond generation, the VL-JEPA's embedding space naturally supports open-vocabulary classification, text-to-video retrieval, and discriminative VQA without any architecture modification. On eight video classification and eight video retrieval datasets, the average performance VL-JEPA surpasses that of CLIP, SigLIP2, and Perception Encoder.

Existing referring video segmentation datasets often focus on salient objects and use language expressions rich in static attributes, potentially allowing the target object to be identified in a single frame. Such datasets underemphasize the role of motion in both videos and languages. To explore the feasibility of using motion expressions and motion reasoning clues for pixel-level video understanding, we introduce MeViS, a dataset containing 33,072 human-annotated motion expressions in both text and audio, covering 8,171 objects in 2,006 videos of complex scenarios. We benchmark 15 existing methods across 4 tasks supported by MeViS, including 6 referring video object segmentation (RVOS) methods, 3 audio-guided video object segmentation (AVOS) methods, 2 referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) methods, and 4 video captioning methods for the newly introduced referring motion expression generation (RMEG) task. The results demonstrate weaknesses and limitations of existing methods in addressing motion expression-guided video understanding.

This holistic encoding strategy aggressively compresses the visual input for the downstream Large Language Model (LLM) based policy model. Evaluated on a large-scale proprietary dataset of 20,000 driving hours, our Flex achieves 2.2x greater inference throughput while improving driving performance by a large margin compared to state-of-the-art methods.

To address these issues, we propose ClusIR, a Cluster-Guided Image Restoration framework that explicitly models degradation semantics through learnable clustering and propagates cluster-aware cues across spatial and frequency domains for adaptive restoration. Specifically, ClusIR comprises two key components: a Probabilistic Cluster-Guided Routing Mechanism (PCGRM) and a Degradation-Aware Frequency Modulation Module (DAFMM). The proposed PCGRM disentangles degradation recognition from expert activation, enabling discriminative degradation perception and stable expert routing. Meanwhile, DAFMM leverages the cluster-guided priors to perform adaptive frequency decomposition and targeted modulation, collaboratively refining structural and textural representations for higher restoration fidelity. The cluster-guided synergy seamlessly bridges semantic cues with frequency-domain modulation, empowering ClusIR to attain remarkable restoration results across a wide range of degradations.

While all previous methods generate images independently at inference, we instead ask if samples can be generated collaboratively. We propose Group Diffusion, unlocking the attention mechanism to be shared across images, rather than limited to just the patches within an image. This enables images to be jointly denoised at inference time, learning both intra and inter-image correspondence. We observe a clear scaling effect - larger group sizes yield stronger cross-sample attention and better generation quality.

To address this limitation, we introduce Omni-Attribute, the first open-vocabulary image attribute encoder designed to learn high-fidelity, attribute-specific representations.

NFMs directly map monocular visual input to control actions and ignore mid-level vision modules (tracking, depth estimation, etc) entirely. While the assumption that vision capabilities will emerge implicitly is compelling, it requires large amounts of pixel-to-action supervision that are difficult to obtain. The challenge is especially pronounced in dynamic and unstructured settings, where robust navigation requires precise geometric and dynamic understanding, while the depth-scale ambiguity in monocular views further limits accurate spatial reasoning. In this paper, we show that relying on monocular vision and ignoring mid-level vision priors is inefficient.\n  We present StereoWalker, which augments NFMs with stereo inputs and explicit mid-level vision such as depth estimation and dense pixel tracking. Our intuition is straightforward: stereo inputs resolve the depth-scale ambiguity, and modern mid-level vision models provide reliable geometric and motion structure in dynamic scenes. We also curate a large stereo navigation dataset with automatic action annotation from Internet stereo videos to support training of StereoWalker and to facilitate future research. Through our experiments, we find that mid-level vision enables StereoWalker to achieve a comparable performance as the state-of-the-art using only 1.5% of the training data, and surpasses the state-of-the-art using the full data.
