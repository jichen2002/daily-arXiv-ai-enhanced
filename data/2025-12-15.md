Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过文本引导方法提升面部性别分类算法的公平性，减少偏见并提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在提升人工智能的公平性，特别是在面部图像性别分类算法中减少偏见。

Method: 核心方法包括利用图像标题的语义信息进行模型训练，具体策略为图像文本匹配（ITM）指导和图像文本融合。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著降低了偏见并提高了分类准确性。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的方法有效缓解了面部图像性别分类算法中的偏见问题，并通过文本引导方法提高了跨性别和种族群体的分类准确性。

Abstract: In the quest for fairness in artificial intelligence, novel approaches to enhance it in facial image based gender classification algorithms using text guided methodologies are presented. The core methodology involves leveraging semantic information from image captions during model training to improve generalization capabilities. Two key strategies are presented: Image Text Matching (ITM) guidance and Image Text fusion. ITM guidance trains the model to discern fine grained alignments between images and texts to obtain enhanced multimodal representations. Image text fusion combines both modalities into comprehensive representations for improved fairness. Exensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate these approaches effectively mitigate bias and improve accuracy across gender racial groups compared to existing methods. Additionally, the unique integration of textual guidance underscores an interpretable and intuitive training paradigm for computer vision systems. By scrutinizing the extent to which semantic information reduces disparities, this research offers valuable insights into cultivating more equitable facial analysis algorithms. The proposed methodologies contribute to addressing the pivotal challenge of demographic bias in gender classification from facial images. Furthermore, this technique operates in the absence of demographic labels and is application agnostic.

Result: WildCap在相同捕获设置下显著优于现有技术，大幅提升了野外捕获的质量。

Conclusion: WildCap方法显著缩小了野外捕获与可控光照条件下捕获的质量差距，实现了高质量的面部外观捕捉。

Abstract: Existing methods achieve high-quality facial appearance capture under controllable lighting, which increases capture cost and limits usability. We propose WildCap, a novel method for high-quality facial appearance capture from a smartphone video recorded in the wild. To disentangle high-quality reflectance from complex lighting effects in in-the-wild captures, we propose a novel hybrid inverse rendering framework. Specifically, we first apply a data-driven method, i.e., SwitchLight, to convert the captured images into more constrained conditions and then adopt model-based inverse rendering. However, unavoidable local artifacts in network predictions, such as shadow-baking, are non-physical and thus hinder accurate inverse rendering of lighting and material. To address this, we propose a novel texel grid lighting model to explain non-physical effects as clean albedo illuminated by local physical lighting. During optimization, we jointly sample a diffusion prior for reflectance maps and optimize the lighting, effectively resolving scale ambiguity between local lights and albedo. Our method achieves significantly better results than prior arts in the same capture setup, closing the quality gap between in-the-wild and controllable recordings by a large margin. Our code will be released \href{https://yxuhan.github.io/WildCap/index.html}{\textcolor{magenta}{here}}.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决实际应用中面临的挑战，如光线变化、随机方向、文本弯曲或部分覆盖、低分辨率及文本模糊等问题。

Method: 设备分为四个处理步骤：图像获取与预处理、使用DBNet++模型检测文本元素、使用BART模型分类检测到的文本元素，以及通过Python和PyQt5编写的用户界面呈现结果。

Result: 在Total-Text数据集上测试10小时，文本识别率达到约94.62%。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的文本图像分类设备在实践中表现出色，即使在不受控制的成像条件下也能有效分类混合来源的文本。

Abstract: This is to present a text image classifier device that identifies textual content in images and then categorizes each image into one of four predefined categories, including Invoice, Form, Letter, or Report. The device supports a gallery mode, in which users browse files on flash disks, hard disk drives, or microSD cards, and a live mode which renders feeds of cameras connected to it. Its design is specifically aimed at addressing pragmatic challenges, such as changing light, random orientation, curvature or partial coverage of text, low resolution, and slightly visible text. The steps of the processing process are divided into four steps: image acquisition and preprocessing, textual elements detection with the help of DBNet++ (Differentiable Binarization Network Plus) model, BART (Bidirectional Auto-Regressive Transformers) model that classifies detected textual elements, and the presentation of the results through a user interface written in Python and PyQt5. All the stages are connected in such a way that they form a smooth workflow. The system achieved a text recognition rate of about 94.62% when tested over ten hours on the mentioned Total-Text dataset, that includes high resolution images, created so as to represent a wide range of problematic conditions. These experimental results support the effectiveness of the suggested methodology to practice, mixed-source text categorization, even in uncontrolled imaging conditions.

Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, particularly in resource-limited countries. Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging serves as an accessible and cost-effective diagnostic tool but requires expert interpretation, which is often unavailable. Although machine learning models have shown high performance in TB classification, they often depend on spurious correlations and fail to generalize. Besides, building large datasets featuring high-quality annotations for medical images demands substantial resources and input from domain specialists, and typically involves several annotators reaching agreement, which results in enormous financial and logistical expenses. This study repurposes knowledge distillation technique to train CNN models reducing spurious correlations and localize TB-related abnormalities without requiring bounding-box annotations. By leveraging a teacher-student framework with ResNet50 architecture, the proposed method trained on TBX11k dataset achieve impressive 0.2428 mIOU score. Experimental results further reveal that the student model consistently outperforms the teacher, underscoring improved robustness and potential for broader clinical deployment in diverse settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Particulate是一种基于Transformer的快速方法，直接从单个3D网格推断铰接结构的所有属性，显著优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法需要逐对象优化的耗时问题，直接从单个静态3D网格推断铰接结构的所有属性。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的网络（Part Articulation Transformer）处理输入网格的点云，预测3D部件、运动学结构和运动约束。

Result: 在公开数据集上训练的模型能在几秒内生成完全铰接的3D模型，且适用于AI生成的3D资产。

Conclusion: Particulate显著优于现有技术方法，能够快速生成完全铰接的3D模型，并适用于AI生成的3D资产。

Abstract: We present Particulate, a feed-forward approach that, given a single static 3D mesh of an everyday object, directly infers all attributes of the underlying articulated structure, including its 3D parts, kinematic structure, and motion constraints. At its core is a transformer network, Part Articulation Transformer, which processes a point cloud of the input mesh using a flexible and scalable architecture to predict all the aforementioned attributes with native multi-joint support. We train the network end-to-end on a diverse collection of articulated 3D assets from public datasets. During inference, Particulate lifts the network's feed-forward prediction to the input mesh, yielding a fully articulated 3D model in seconds, much faster than prior approaches that require per-object optimization. Particulate can also accurately infer the articulated structure of AI-generated 3D assets, enabling full-fledged extraction of articulated 3D objects from a single (real or synthetic) image when combined with an off-the-shelf image-to-3D generator. We further introduce a new challenging benchmark for 3D articulation estimation curated from high-quality public 3D assets, and redesign the evaluation protocol to be more consistent with human preferences. Quantitative and qualitative results show that Particulate significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: SVR框架通过合成数据解决了专业领域数据稀缺问题，显著提升了VLM在OCTA诊断中的性能和解释能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在专业领域（如OCTA图像分析）中，缺乏大规模精准标注的图像-文本数据集，限制了VLM的训练和应用。

Method: 引入了Synthetic Vasculature Reasoning (SVR)框架，可控合成带有DR特征的视网膜血管图像及对应的详细推理文本，并构建了OCTA-100K-SVR数据集。

Result: 训练后的VLM在真实OCTA图像上实现了89.67%的零样本分类准确率，优于监督基线，且显著提升了解释质量和病理定位能力。

Conclusion: SVR框架通过合成图像和文本解决了专业领域数据稀缺的问题，显著提升了VLM在OCTA图像诊断中的性能和解释能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising path toward interpretable medical diagnosis by allowing users to ask about clinical explanations alongside predictions and across different modalities. However, training VLMs for detailed reasoning requires large-scale image-text datasets. In many specialized domains, for example in reading Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) images, such precise text with grounded description of pathologies is scarce or even non-existent. To overcome this bottleneck, we introduce Synthetic Vasculature Reasoning (SVR), a framework that controllably synthesizes images and corresponding text, specifically: realistic retinal vasculature with Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) features: capillary dropout, microaneurysms, neovascularization, and tortuosity, while automatically generating granular reasoning texts. Based on this we curate OCTA-100K-SVR, an OCTA image-reasoning dataset with 100,000 pairs. Our experiments show that a general-purpose VLM (Qwen3-VL-8b) trained on the dataset achieves a zero-shot balanced classification accuracy of 89.67% on real OCTA images, outperforming supervised baselines. Through human expert evaluation we also demonstrate that it significantly enhances explanation quality and pathology localization on clinical data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于统计矩的高保真透射率计算方法，显著提升了3D高斯泼溅在复杂半透明物体渲染中的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）虽能快速优化和实时渲染高质量辐射场，但其简化的、顺序依赖的alpha混合和粗糙的密度积分近似限制了复杂半透明物体的渲染能力。

Method: 提出了一种基于统计矩的高保真透射率计算方法，无需光线追踪或像素级排序，通过分析推导和计算每个像素的矩，重建连续透射率函数。

Result: 该方法显著提升了整体重建和渲染质量，特别是在复杂半透明介质中的光衰减建模。

Conclusion: 该方法通过引入基于统计矩的连续透射率函数，显著提升了复杂半透明物体的渲染质量，填补了光栅化与物理精度之间的差距。

Abstract: The recent success of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has reshaped novel view synthesis by enabling fast optimization and real-time rendering of high-quality radiance fields. However, it relies on simplified, order-dependent alpha blending and coarse approximations of the density integral within the rasterizer, thereby limiting its ability to render complex, overlapping semi-transparent objects. In this paper, we extend rasterization-based rendering of 3D Gaussian representations with a novel method for high-fidelity transmittance computation, entirely avoiding the need for ray tracing or per-pixel sample sorting. Building on prior work in moment-based order-independent transparency, our key idea is to characterize the density distribution along each camera ray with a compact and continuous representation based on statistical moments. To this end, we analytically derive and compute a set of per-pixel moments from all contributing 3D Gaussians. From these moments, a continuous transmittance function is reconstructed for each ray, which is then independently sampled within each Gaussian. As a result, our method bridges the gap between rasterization and physical accuracy by modeling light attenuation in complex translucent media, significantly improving overall reconstruction and rendering quality.

Motivation: 解决生成视频模型在物理逻辑规则违反、缺乏交互性及不透明性方面的局限性。

Method: 提出VDAWorld框架，利用视觉语言模型（VLM）作为智能代理，通过选择视觉工具构建场景表示，并选择兼容的物理模拟器进行动态预测。

Result: 实验表明，VDAWorld能够生成高质量且多样化的动态场景模拟。

Conclusion: VDAWorld通过结合智能抽象和自适应模拟，能够生成高质量且多样化的动态场景模拟，克服了传统生成视频模型的局限性。

Abstract: Generative video models, a leading approach to world modeling, face fundamental limitations. They often violate physical and logical rules, lack interactivity, and operate as opaque black boxes ill-suited for building structured, queryable worlds. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new paradigm focused on distilling an image caption pair into a tractable, abstract representation optimized for simulation. We introduce VDAWorld, a framework where a Vision-Language Model (VLM) acts as an intelligent agent to orchestrate this process. The VLM autonomously constructs a grounded (2D or 3D) scene representation by selecting from a suite of vision tools, and accordingly chooses a compatible physics simulator (e.g., rigid body, fluid) to act upon it. VDAWorld can then infer latent dynamics from the static scene to predict plausible future states. Our experiments show that this combination of intelligent abstraction and adaptive simulation results in a versatile world model capable of producing high quality simulations across a wide range of dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Understanding human movement and city dynamics has always been challenging. From traditional methods of manually observing the city's inhabitant, to using cameras, to now using sensors and more complex technology, the field of urban monitoring has evolved greatly. Still, there are more that can be done to unlock better practices for understanding city dynamics. This paper surveys how the landscape of urban dynamics studying has evolved with a particular focus on event-based cameras. Event-based cameras capture changes in light intensity instead of the RGB values that traditional cameras do. They offer unique abilities, like the ability to work in low-light, that can make them advantageous compared to other sensors. Through an analysis of event-based cameras, their applications, their advantages and challenges, and machine learning applications, we propose event-based cameras as a medium for capturing information to study urban dynamics. They offer the ability to capture important information while maintaining privacy. We also suggest multi-sensor fusion of event-based cameras and other sensors in the study of urban dynamics. Combining event-based cameras and infrared, event-LiDAR, or vibration has to potential to enhance the ability of event-based cameras and overcome the challenges that event-based cameras have.

Abstract: Many manufacturing environments operate in low-light conditions or within enclosed machines where conventional vision systems struggle. Infrared cameras provide complementary advantages in such environments. Simultaneously, supervised AI systems require large labeled datasets, which makes zero-shot learning frameworks more practical for applications including infrared cameras. Recent advances in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) offer a new path in zero-shot predictions from paired image-text representations. However, current VLMs cannot understand infrared camera data since they are trained on RGB data. This work introduces VLM-IRIS (Vision-Language Models for InfraRed Industrial Sensing), a zero-shot framework that adapts VLMs to infrared data by preprocessing infrared images captured by a FLIR Boson sensor into RGB-compatible inputs suitable for CLIP-based encoders. We demonstrate zero-shot workpiece presence detection on a 3D printer bed where temperature differences between the build plate and workpieces make the task well-suited for thermal imaging. VLM-IRIS converts the infrared images to magma representation and applies centroid prompt ensembling with a CLIP ViT-B/32 encoder to achieve high accuracy on infrared images without any model retraining. These findings demonstrate that the proposed improvements to VLMs can be effectively extended to thermal applications for label-free monitoring.

*Weitai Kang,Jason Kuen,Mengwei Ren,Zijun Wei,Yan Yan,Kangning Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGent是一种模块化视觉定位模型，结合冻结MLLM和目标检测器，通过交叉注意力选择目标框，避免了自回归解码的缺陷，实现了快速推理和最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉定位模型要么基于自回归解码的MLLM（速度慢且易产生幻觉），要么通过重新对齐LLM与视觉特征学习新标记（可能损害LLM的预训练推理能力）。VGent旨在解决这些问题。

Method: VGent采用模块化的编码器-解码器架构，其中编码器使用冻结的MLLM保持强大的推理能力，解码器通过交叉注意力选择目标框。此外，还引入了QuadThinker增强编码器的多目标推理能力、mask-aware标签解决检测-分割歧义，以及全局目标识别提升目标选择。

Result: VGent在多目标视觉定位基准测试中实现了F1分数提升20.6%，gIoU和cIoU分别提升8.2%和5.8%，同时保持恒定的快速推理延迟。

Conclusion: VGent通过模块化设计，结合了目标检测和MLLM的优势，避免了自回归解码的缺陷，实现了快速推理，并在多目标视觉定位任务中取得了新的最优性能。

Abstract: Current visual grounding models are either based on a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that performs auto-regressive decoding, which is slow and risks hallucinations, or on re-aligning an LLM with vision features to learn new special or object tokens for grounding, which may undermine the LLM's pretrained reasoning ability. In contrast, we propose VGent, a modular encoder-decoder architecture that explicitly disentangles high-level reasoning and low-level bounding box prediction. Specifically, a frozen MLLM serves as the encoder to provide untouched powerful reasoning capabilities, while a decoder takes high-quality boxes proposed by detectors as queries and selects target box(es) via cross-attending on encoder's hidden states. This design fully leverages advances in both object detection and MLLM, avoids the pitfalls of auto-regressive decoding, and enables fast inference. Moreover, it supports modular upgrades of both the encoder and decoder to benefit the whole system: we introduce (i) QuadThinker, an RL-based training paradigm for enhancing multi-target reasoning ability of the encoder; (ii) mask-aware label for resolving detection-segmentation ambiguity; and (iii) global target recognition to improve the recognition of all the targets which benefits the selection among augmented proposals. Experiments on multi-target visual grounding benchmarks show that VGent achieves a new state-of-the-art with +20.6% F1 improvement over prior methods, and further boosts gIoU by +8.2% and cIoU by +5.8% under visual reference challenges, while maintaining constant, fast inference latency.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated strong performance across diverse pathology tasks. While there are similarities in the pre-training objectives of FMs, there is still limited understanding of their complementarity, redundancy in embedding spaces, or biological interpretation of features. In this study, we propose an information-driven, intelligent fusion strategy for integrating multiple pathology FMs into a unified representation and systematically evaluate its performance for cancer grading and staging across three distinct diseases. Diagnostic H&E whole-slide images from kidney (519 slides), prostate (490 slides), and rectal (200 slides) cancers were dichotomized into low versus high grade or stage. Both tile-level FMs (Conch v1.5, MUSK, Virchow2, H-Optimus1, Prov-Gigapath) and slide-level FMs (TITAN, CHIEF, MADELEINE) were considered to train downstream classifiers. We then evaluated three FM fusion schemes at both tile and slide levels: majority-vote ensembling, naive feature concatenation, and intelligent fusion based on correlation-guided pruning of redundant features. Under patient-stratified cross-validation with hold-out testing, intelligent fusion of tile-level embeddings yielded consistent gains in classification performance across all three cancers compared with the best single FMs and naive fusion. Global similarity metrics revealed substantial alignment of FM embedding spaces, contrasted by lower local neighborhood agreement, indicating complementary fine-grained information across FMs. Attention maps showed that intelligent fusion yielded concentrated attention on tumor regions while reducing spurious focus on benign regions. Our findings suggest that intelligent, correlation-guided fusion of pathology FMs can yield compact, task-tailored representations that enhance both predictive performance and interpretability in downstream computational pathology tasks.

TL;DR: LEGO是一个无需配对数据的三阶段域适应框架，通过生成模型生成伪真实数据并混合监督微调，显著提升预训练模型在真实世界退化情况下的表现。

Motivation: 预训练图像修复模型在真实世界、分布外退化情况下表现不佳，且传统适应方法通常需要复杂架构修改或配对数据。

Method: LEGO框架包括三个阶段：1）从预训练模型获取初始修复结果；2）利用冻结的大规模生成模型生成高质量伪真实数据；3）使用混合监督策略（结合分布内数据和伪数据对）微调原始模型。

Result: 实验表明，LEGO能有效缩小领域差距，显著提升在多样化真实世界基准上的性能。

Conclusion: LEGO框架通过三阶段方法有效解决了预训练图像修复模型在真实世界、分布外退化情况下的适应问题，无需配对数据或复杂架构修改。

Abstract: Pre-trained image restoration models often fail on real-world, out-of-distribution degradations due to significant domain gaps. Adapting to these unseen domains is challenging, as out-of-distribution data lacks ground truth, and traditional adaptation methods often require complex architectural changes. We propose LEGO (Learning from a Generative Oracle), a practical three-stage framework for post-training domain adaptation without paired data. LEGO converts this unsupervised challenge into a tractable pseudo-supervised one. First, we obtain initial restorations from the pre-trained model. Second, we leverage a frozen, large-scale generative oracle to refine these estimates into high-quality pseudo-ground-truths. Third, we fine-tune the original model using a mixed-supervision strategy combining in-distribution data with these new pseudo-pairs. This approach adapts the model to the new distribution without sacrificing its original robustness or requiring architectural modifications. Experiments demonstrate that LEGO effectively bridges the domain gap, significantly improving performance on diverse real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: Fast-FoundationStereo 实现了实时帧率下的强零样本泛化能力，填补了高效立体架构与鲁棒性之间的差距，成为实时方法中的新标杆。

Abstract: Stereo foundation models achieve strong zero-shot generalization but remain computationally prohibitive for real-time applications. Efficient stereo architectures, on the other hand, sacrifice robustness for speed and require costly per-domain fine-tuning. To bridge this gap, we present Fast-FoundationStereo, a family of architectures that achieve, for the first time, strong zero-shot generalization at real-time frame rate. We employ a divide-and-conquer acceleration strategy with three components: (1) knowledge distillation to compress the hybrid backbone into a single efficient student; (2) blockwise neural architecture search for automatically discovering optimal cost filtering designs under latency budgets, reducing search complexity exponentially; and (3) structured pruning for eliminating redundancy in the iterative refinement module. Furthermore, we introduce an automatic pseudo-labeling pipeline used to curate 1.4M in-the-wild stereo pairs to supplement synthetic training data and facilitate knowledge distillation. The resulting model can run over 10x faster than FoundationStereo while closely matching its zero-shot accuracy, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art among real-time methods.

Motivation: 针对非中心化视觉领域（如医学影像和遥感）中项目化文本注释的特点，现有方法无法有效处理这种监督形式，因此需要开发新的框架。

Method: ItemizedCLIP采用跨注意力模块生成文本项目条件化的视觉嵌入，并设计了一组定制目标，共同强制项目独立性和表示完整性。

Conclusion: ItemizedCLIP通过引入跨注意力模块和定制目标，成功实现了从项目化文本监督中学习完整且可解释的视觉表示，显著提升了零样本性能和细粒度可解释性。

Abstract: Training vision models with language supervision enables general and transferable representations. However, many visual domains, especially non-object-centric domains such as medical imaging and remote sensing, contain itemized text annotations: multiple text items describing distinct and semantically independent findings within a single image. Such supervision differs from standard multi-caption supervision, where captions are redundant or highly overlapping. Here, we introduce ItemizedCLIP, a framework for learning complete and explainable visual representations from itemized text supervision. ItemizedCLIP employs a cross-attention module to produce text item-conditioned visual embeddings and a set of tailored objectives that jointly enforce item independence (distinct regions for distinct items) and representation completeness (coverage of all items). Across four domains with naturally itemized text supervision (brain MRI, head CT, chest CT, remote sensing) and one additional synthetically itemized dataset, ItemizedCLIP achieves substantial improvements in zero-shot performance and fine-grained interpretability over baselines. The resulting ItemizedCLIP representations are semantically grounded, item-differentiable, complete, and visually interpretable. Our code is available at https://github.com/MLNeurosurg/ItemizedCLIP.

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a cornerstone of scientific progress, yet complex multimodal models often lack transparent implementation details and accessible training infrastructure. In this work, we present a detailed reproduction and critical analysis of the Monkey Vision-Language Model (VLM) (Li et al. 2023b) published in CVPR24, a recent approach to high-resolution image understanding via image tiling. The original paper proposed splitting large images into tiles to recover fine-grained visual details while maintaining computational efficiency. Our study replicates this strategy using open checkpoints and reimplements the training pipeline. We confirm the key finding of the original Monkey VLM work, namely that tiling effectively recovers local details. We then extend this work further, by investigating the effect of the inclusion of the global context, which provide practical insights for future high-resolution multimodal modeling. However, we also report deviations in the results, with the magnitude of these effects depending heavily on task type and tile granularity.

TL;DR: LGSCV是一种高效的3D高斯泼溅压缩方法，通过优化地图生成和排列策略，显著提升了压缩性能和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视频的GS压缩方法依赖计算量大且耗时的PLAS，限制了在轻量设备上的应用。

Method: 提出了一种基于视频编解码器的轻量级3D高斯泼溅压缩方法（LGSCV），包括两阶段Morton扫描生成块状2D地图，以及使用PCA降维和MiniPLAS优化排列。

Result: 实验结果表明，LGSCV在中等和低比特率下显著提升了率失真性能，并大幅减少了处理时间。

Conclusion: LGSCV方法在MPEG数据集上实现了超过20%的率失真增益，同时将2D地图生成时间缩短至约1秒，编码时间减少50%。

Abstract: Current video-based GS compression methods rely on using Parallel Linear Assignment Sorting (PLAS) to convert 3D GS into smooth 2D maps, which are computationally expensive and time-consuming, limiting the application of GS on lightweight devices. In this paper, we propose a Lightweight 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) Compression method based on Video codec (LGSCV). First, a two-stage Morton scan is proposed to generate blockwise 2D maps that are friendly for canonical video codecs in which the coding units (CU) are square blocks. A 3D Morton scan is used to permute GS primitives, followed by a 2D Morton scan to map the ordered GS primitives to 2D maps in a blockwise style. However, although the blockwise 2D maps report close performance to the PLAS map in high-bitrate regions, they show a quality collapse at medium-to-low bitrates. Therefore, a principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of spherical harmonics (SH), and a MiniPLAS, which is flexible and fast, is designed to permute the primitives within certain block sizes. Incorporating SH PCA and MiniPLAS leads to a significant gain in rate-distortion (RD) performance, especially at medium and low bitrates. MiniPLAS can also guide the setting of the codec CU size configuration and significantly reduce encoding time. Experimental results on the MPEG dataset demonstrate that the proposed LGSCV achieves over 20% RD gain compared with state-of-the-art methods, while reducing 2D map generation time to approximately 1 second and cutting encoding time by 50%.

Abstract: We present our solution to the BinEgo-360 Challenge at ICCV 2025, which focuses on temporal action localization (TAL) in multi-perspective and multi-modal video settings. The challenge provides a dataset containing panoramic, third-person, and egocentric recordings, annotated with fine-grained action classes. Our approach is built on the Temporal Shift Module (TSM), which we extend to handle TAL by introducing a background class and classifying fixed-length non-overlapping intervals. We employ a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes for scene classification and TAL, leveraging contextual cues between actions and environments. Finally, we integrate multiple models through a weighted ensemble strategy, which improves robustness and consistency of predictions. Our method is ranked first in both the initial and extended rounds of the competition, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining multi-task learning, an efficient backbone, and ensemble learning for TAL.

Abstract: Crafting computer-aided design (CAD) models has long been a painstaking and time-intensive task, demanding both precision and expertise from designers. With the emergence of 3D generation, this task has undergone a transformative impact, shifting not only from visual fidelity to functional utility but also enabling editable CAD designs. Prior works have achieved early success in single-part CAD generation, which is not well-suited for real-world applications, as multiple parts need to be assembled under semantic and geometric constraints. In this paper, we propose CADKnitter, a compositional CAD generation framework with a geometry-guided diffusion sampling strategy. CADKnitter is able to generate a complementary CAD part that follows both the geometric constraints of the given CAD model and the semantic constraints of the desired design text prompt. We also curate a dataset, so-called KnitCAD, containing over 310,000 samples of CAD models, along with textual prompts and assembly metadata that provide semantic and geometric constraints. Intensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines by a clear margin.

Conclusion: AutoRefiner作为一种专为AR-VDMs设计的噪声优化器，通过路径噪声优化和反射性KV缓存，有效提升了样本保真度，且计算高效。

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models (AR-VDMs) show strong promise as scalable alternatives to bidirectional VDMs, enabling real-time and interactive applications. Yet there remains room for improvement in their sample fidelity. A promising solution is inference-time alignment, which optimizes the noise space to improve sample fidelity without updating model parameters. Yet, optimization- or search-based methods are computationally impractical for AR-VDMs. Recent text-to-image (T2I) works address this via feedforward noise refiners that modulate sampled noises in a single forward pass. Can such noise refiners be extended to AR-VDMs? We identify the failure of naively extending T2I noise refiners to AR-VDMs and propose AutoRefiner-a noise refiner tailored for AR-VDMs, with two key designs: pathwise noise refinement and a reflective KV-cache. Experiments demonstrate that AutoRefiner serves as an efficient plug-in for AR-VDMs, effectively enhancing sample fidelity by refining noise along stochastic denoising paths.

TL;DR: SmokeBench基准测试评估MLLMs在野火烟雾识别和定位中的表现，发现现有模型在早期烟雾定位上表现不佳，烟雾体积是关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野火烟雾透明、无定形，常与云混淆，使得早期检测尤为困难，因此需要评估MLLMs在此任务中的表现。

Method: 引入了一个名为SmokeBench的基准测试，评估MLLMs在图像中识别和定位野火烟雾的能力，包括烟雾分类、基于瓦片的烟雾定位、基于网格的烟雾定位和烟雾检测四个任务。评估了包括Idefics2、Qwen2.5-VL、InternVL3、Unified-IO 2、Grounding DINO、GPT-4o和Gemini-2.5 Pro在内的多个MLLMs。

Result: 结果显示，部分模型能在大面积烟雾覆盖时分类烟雾，但所有模型在准确定位（尤其是早期阶段）上表现不佳。烟雾体积与模型性能强相关，而对比度影响较小。

Conclusion: 当前的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在安全关键的野火监测中存在显著局限性，尤其是在早期烟雾定位方面表现不佳，亟需改进方法。

Abstract: Wildfire smoke is transparent, amorphous, and often visually confounded with clouds, making early-stage detection particularly challenging. In this work, we introduce a benchmark, called SmokeBench, to evaluate the ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to recognize and localize wildfire smoke in images. The benchmark consists of four tasks: (1) smoke classification, (2) tile-based smoke localization, (3) grid-based smoke localization, and (4) smoke detection. We evaluate several MLLMs, including Idefics2, Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3, Unified-IO 2, Grounding DINO, GPT-4o, and Gemini-2.5 Pro. Our results show that while some models can classify the presence of smoke when it covers a large area, all models struggle with accurate localization, especially in the early stages. Further analysis reveals that smoke volume is strongly correlated with model performance, whereas contrast plays a comparatively minor role. These findings highlight critical limitations of current MLLMs for safety-critical wildfire monitoring and underscore the need for methods that improve early-stage smoke localization.

Motivation: 确定性回归方法在预测未来世界状态时平均了多种可能的未来，未能捕捉不确定性，影响了预测准确性。

Method: 提出了一种在VFM特征空间中进行自回归流匹配的生成预测方法，将VFM特征编码到适合扩散的紧凑潜在空间中。

Result: 与回归方法相比，在匹配架构和计算条件下，该方法在所有模态（如语义分割、深度、表面法线甚至RGB）上产生了更清晰和更准确的预测。

Conclusion: 随机条件生成视觉基础模型（VFM）特征为未来世界模型提供了一个有前景且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Forecasting from partial observations is central to world modeling. Many recent methods represent the world through images, and reduce forecasting to stochastic video generation. Although such methods excel at realism and visual fidelity, predicting pixels is computationally intensive and not directly useful in many applications, as it requires translating RGB into signals useful for decision making. An alternative approach uses features from vision foundation models (VFMs) as world representations, performing deterministic regression to predict future world states. These features can be directly translated into actionable signals such as semantic segmentation and depth, while remaining computationally efficient. However, deterministic regression averages over multiple plausible futures, undermining forecast accuracy by failing to capture uncertainty. To address this crucial limitation, we introduce a generative forecaster that performs autoregressive flow matching in VFM feature space. Our key insight is that generative modeling in this space requires encoding VFM features into a compact latent space suitable for diffusion. We show that this latent space preserves information more effectively than previously used PCA-based alternatives, both for forecasting and other applications, such as image generation. Our latent predictions can be easily decoded into multiple useful and interpretable output modalities: semantic segmentation, depth, surface normals, and even RGB. With matched architecture and compute, our method produces sharper and more accurate predictions than regression across all modalities. Our results suggest that stochastic conditional generation of VFM features offers a promising and scalable foundation for future world models.

Motivation: 在高度动态的交通环境中，仅依赖当前场景的运动规划可能导致次优响应，因为自车行为会进一步改变未来场景。因此需要建模未来场景的演化。

Method: FutureX采用Auto-think Switch判断是否需要额外推理，通过Latent World Model进行CoT引导的未来场景预测，并由Summarizer Module优化运动规划。简单场景下则直接生成规划。

Result: 实验表明，FutureX显著提升了现有方法的性能，如TransFuser在NAVSIM上实现了6.2 PDMS的提升，且未牺牲效率。

Conclusion: FutureX通过结合World Model和Chain of Thought（CoT）技术，显著提升了端到端规划器在动态交通环境中的运动规划能力，实现了更高的性能和更少的碰撞。

Abstract: In autonomous driving, end-to-end planners learn scene representations from raw sensor data and utilize them to generate a motion plan or control actions. However, exclusive reliance on the current scene for motion planning may result in suboptimal responses in highly dynamic traffic environments where ego actions further alter the future scene. To model the evolution of future scenes, we leverage the World Model to represent how the ego vehicle and its environment interact and change over time, which entails complex reasoning. The Chain of Thought (CoT) offers a promising solution by forecasting a sequence of future thoughts that subsequently guide trajectory refinement. In this paper, we propose FutureX, a CoT-driven pipeline that enhances end-to-end planners to perform complex motion planning via future scene latent reasoning and trajectory refinement. Specifically, the Auto-think Switch examines the current scene and decides whether additional reasoning is required to yield a higher-quality motion plan. Once FutureX enters the Thinking mode, the Latent World Model conducts a CoT-guided rollout to predict future scene representation, enabling the Summarizer Module to further refine the motion plan. Otherwise, FutureX operates in an Instant mode to generate motion plans in a forward pass for relatively simple scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FutureX enhances existing methods by producing more rational motion plans and fewer collisions without compromising efficiency, thereby achieving substantial overall performance gains, e.g., 6.2 PDMS improvement for TransFuser on NAVSIM. Code will be released.

Result: 实验结果表明，REST在生成速度和整体性能上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: REST框架成功填补了自回归与扩散模型之间的鸿沟，为实时说话头部生成应用提供了显著价值。

Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly advanced the field of talking head generation. However, the slow inference speeds and non-autoregressive paradigms severely constrain the application of diffusion-based THG models. In this study, we propose REST, the first diffusion-based, real-time, end-to-end streaming audio-driven talking head generation framework. To support real-time end-to-end generation, a compact video latent space is first learned through high spatiotemporal VAE compression. Additionally, to enable autoregressive streaming within the compact video latent space, we introduce an ID-Context Cache mechanism, which integrates ID-Sink and Context-Cache principles to key-value caching for maintaining temporal consistency and identity coherence during long-time streaming generation. Furthermore, an Asynchronous Streaming Distillation (ASD) training strategy is proposed to mitigate error accumulation in autoregressive generation and enhance temporal consistency, which leverages a non-streaming teacher with an asynchronous noise schedule to supervise the training of the streaming student model. REST bridges the gap between autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches, demonstrating substantial value for applications requiring real-time talking head generation. Experimental results demonstrate that REST outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both generation speed and overall performance.

Conclusion: RoomPilot 作为一个统一框架，通过将多模态输入解析为室内领域特定语言（IDSL），实现了高质量、可控的室内场景生成，显著提升了物理一致性和视觉保真度，标志着通用可控3D室内场景生成的重要进展。

Abstract: Generating controllable and interactive indoor scenes is fundamental to applications in game development, architectural visualization, and embodied AI training. Yet existing approaches either handle a narrow range of input modalities or rely on stochastic processes that hinder controllability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce RoomPilot, a unified framework that parses diverse multi-modal inputs--textual descriptions or CAD floor plans--into an Indoor Domain-Specific Language (IDSL) for indoor structured scene generation. The key insight is that a well-designed IDSL can act as a shared semantic representation, enabling coherent, high-quality scene synthesis from any single modality while maintaining interaction semantics. In contrast to conventional procedural methods that produce visually plausible but functionally inert layouts, RoomPilot leverages a curated dataset of interaction-annotated assets to synthesize environments exhibiting realistic object behaviors. Extensive experiments further validate its strong multi-modal understanding, fine-grained controllability in scene generation, and superior physical consistency and visual fidelity, marking a significant step toward general-purpose controllable 3D indoor scene generation.

Conclusion: 提出的Cross-modal Prompting (ComP)方法通过增强模态特定特征和提升各模态性能，有效解决了多模态情感识别中的性能差距和模态欠优化问题，显著提高了识别准确率。

Abstract: Incomplete multi-modal emotion recognition (IMER) aims at understanding human intentions and sentiments by comprehensively exploring the partially observed multi-source data. Although the multi-modal data is expected to provide more abundant information, the performance gap and modality under-optimization problem hinder effective multi-modal learning in practice, and are exacerbated in the confrontation of the missing data. To address this issue, we devise a novel Cross-modal Prompting (ComP) method, which emphasizes coherent information by enhancing modality-specific features and improves the overall recognition accuracy by boosting each modality's performance. Specifically, a progressive prompt generation module with a dynamic gradient modulator is proposed to produce concise and consistent modality semantic cues. Meanwhile, cross-modal knowledge propagation selectively amplifies the consistent information in modality features with the delivered prompts to enhance the discrimination of the modality-specific output. Additionally, a coordinator is designed to dynamically re-weight the modality outputs as a complement to the balance strategy to improve the model's efficacy. Extensive experiments on 4 datasets with 7 SOTA methods under different missing rates validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: Current diffusion-based portrait animation models predominantly focus on enhancing visual quality and expression realism, while overlooking generation latency and real-time performance, which restricts their application range in the live streaming scenario. We propose PersonaLive, a novel diffusion-based framework towards streaming real-time portrait animation with multi-stage training recipes. Specifically, we first adopt hybrid implicit signals, namely implicit facial representations and 3D implicit keypoints, to achieve expressive image-level motion control. Then, a fewer-step appearance distillation strategy is proposed to eliminate appearance redundancy in the denoising process, greatly improving inference efficiency. Finally, we introduce an autoregressive micro-chunk streaming generation paradigm equipped with a sliding training strategy and a historical keyframe mechanism to enable low-latency and stable long-term video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PersonaLive achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 7-22x speedup over prior diffusion-based portrait animation models.

TL;DR: A few-shot VLM method enhances G-code and HMI error detection in CNC training, outperforming zero-shot approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack the capability to leverage HMI knowledge due to their inability to access vision modality, necessitating a more comprehensive verification method.

Method: A few-shot VLM-based approach that evaluates G-code and HMI screenshots simultaneously, using a structured JSON schema and few-shot examples for learning.

Result: Few-shot prompting improved detection of HMI errors and G-code discrepancies, outperforming zero-shot VLM in accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed few-shot VLM-based verification framework is suitable for verifying manually generated G-code in CNC training, enhancing error detection in both G-code and HMI displays.

Abstract: Manual generation of G-code is important for learning the operation of CNC machines. Prior work in G-code verification uses Large-Language Models (LLMs), which primarily examine errors in the written programming. However, CNC machining requires extensive use and knowledge of the Human-Machine Interface (HMI), which displays machine status and errors. LLMs currently lack the capability to leverage knowledge of HMIs due to their inability to access the vision modality. This paper proposes a few-shot VLM-based verification approach that simultaneously evaluates the G-code and the HMI display for errors and safety status. The input dataset includes paired G-code text and associated HMI screenshots from a 15-slant-PRO lathe, including both correct and error-prone cases. To enable few-shot learning, the VLM is provided with a structured JSON schema based on prior heuristic knowledge. After determining the prompts, instances of G-code and HMI that either contain errors or are error free are used as few-shot examples to guide the VLM. The model was then evaluated in comparison to a zero-shot VLM through multiple scenarios of incorrect G-code and HMI errors with respect to per-slot accuracy. The VLM showed that few-shot prompting led to overall enhancement of detecting HMI errors and discrepancies with the G-code for more comprehensive debugging. Therefore, the proposed framework was demonstrated to be suitable for verification of manually generated G-code that is typically developed in CNC training.

*Ali El Bellaj,Mohammed-Amine Cheddadi,Rhassan Berber*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reformer通过LSH注意力降低计算复杂度，但在实际高分辨率任务中，ViT仍更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准ViT计算成本高，全局自注意力随令牌数量呈二次方增长，限制了其在高分辨率输入和资源受限环境中的实用性。

Method: 结合基于分块的标记化和局部敏感哈希（LSH）注意力，模型近似全局自注意力，同时将理论时间复杂度从O(n²)降低到O(n log n)。

Result: Reformer在CIFAR-10上比ViT基线准确率更高，但在更大规模和高分辨率设置下，ViT在实用效率和端到端计算时间上表现更优。

Conclusion: 尽管基于LSH的注意力在理论上具有优势，但在实际应用中，尤其是在处理典型高分辨率图像时，ViT模型在效率和计算时间上仍优于Reformer。

Abstract: Transformers have recently demonstrated strong performance in computer vision, with Vision Transformers (ViTs) leveraging self-attention to capture both low-level and high-level image features. However, standard ViTs remain computationally expensive, since global self-attention scales quadratically with the number of tokens, which limits their practicality for high-resolution inputs and resource-constrained settings.
  In this work, we investigate the Reformer architecture as an alternative vision backbone. By combining patch-based tokenization with locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) attention, our model approximates global self-attention while reducing its theoretical time complexity from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ in the sequence length $n$. We evaluate the proposed Reformer-based vision model on CIFAR-10 to assess its behavior on small-scale datasets, on ImageNet-100 to study its accuracy--efficiency trade-off in a more realistic setting, and on a high-resolution medical imaging dataset to evaluate the model under longer token sequences.
  While the Reformer achieves higher accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to our ViT-style baseline, the ViT model consistently outperforms the Reformer in our experiments in terms of practical efficiency and end-to-end computation time across the larger and higher-resolution settings. These results suggest that, despite the theoretical advantages of LSH-based attention, meaningful computation gains require sequence lengths substantially longer than those produced by typical high-resolution images.

Abstract: Recently, machine unlearning approaches have been proposed to remove sensitive information from well-trained large models. However, most existing methods are tailored for LLMs, while MLLM-oriented unlearning remains at its early stage. Inspired by recent studies exploring the internal mechanisms of MLLMs, we propose to disentangle the visual and textual knowledge embedded within MLLMs and introduce a dedicated approach to selectively erase target visual knowledge while preserving textual knowledge. Unlike previous unlearning methods that rely on output-level supervision, our approach introduces a Visual Knowledge Distillation (VKD) scheme, which leverages intermediate visual representations within the MLLM as supervision signals. This design substantially enhances both unlearning effectiveness and model utility. Moreover, since our method only fine-tunes the visual components of the MLLM, it offers significant efficiency advantages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art unlearning methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. Moreover, we are the first to evaluate the robustness of MLLM unlearning against relearning attacks.

Abstract: Invasive species pose major global threats to ecosystems and agriculture. Serrated tussock (\textit{Nassella trichotoma}) is a highly competitive invasive grass species that disrupts native grasslands, reduces pasture productivity, and increases land management costs. In Victoria, Australia, it presents a major challenge due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact. While current ground surveys and subsequent management practices are effective at small scales, they are not feasible for landscape-scale monitoring. Although aerial imagery offers high spatial resolution suitable for detailed classification, its high cost limits scalability. Satellite-based remote sensing provides a more cost-effective and scalable alternative, though often with lower spatial resolution. This study evaluates whether multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery, despite its lower spatial resolution, can provide a comparable and cost-effective alternative for landscape-scale monitoring of serrated tussock by leveraging its higher spectral resolution and seasonal phenological information. A total of eleven models have been developed using various combinations of spectral bands, texture features, vegetation indices, and seasonal data. Using a random forest classifier, the best-performing Sentinel-2 model (M76*) has achieved an Overall Accuracy (OA) of 68\% and an Overall Kappa (OK) of 0.55, slightly outperforming the best-performing aerial imaging model's OA of 67\% and OK of 0.52 on the same dataset. These findings highlight the potential of multi-seasonal feature-enhanced satellite-based models for scalable invasive species classification.

Conclusion: 本文通过构建一个全面的交通事故数据集，并基于Transformer架构提出了一种事故检测模型，结合RGB特征与光流信息，实现了88.3%的最高准确率。

Abstract: Road traffic accidents represent a leading cause of mortality globally, with incidence rates rising due to increasing population, urbanization, and motorization. Rising accident rates raise concerns about traffic surveillance effectiveness. Traditional computer vision methods for accident detection struggle with limited spatiotemporal understanding and poor cross-domain generalization. Recent advances in transformer architectures excel at modeling global spatial-temporal dependencies and parallel computation. However, applying these models to automated traffic accident detection is limited by small, non-diverse datasets, hindering the development of robust, generalizable systems. To address this gap, we curated a comprehensive and balanced dataset that captures a wide spectrum of traffic environments, accident types, and contextual variations. Utilizing the curated dataset, we propose an accident detection model based on a transformer architecture using pre-extracted spatial video features. The architecture employs convolutional layers to extract local correlations across diverse patterns within a frame, while leveraging transformers to capture sequential-temporal dependencies among the retrieved features. Moreover, most existing studies neglect the integration of motion cues, which are essential for understanding dynamic scenes, especially during accidents. These approaches typically rely on static features or coarse temporal information. In this study, multiple methods for incorporating motion cues were evaluated to identify the most effective strategy. Among the tested input approaches, concatenating RGB features with optical flow achieved the highest accuracy at 88.3%. The results were further compared with vision language models (VLM) such as GPT, Gemini, and LLaVA-NeXT-Video to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: FilmWeaver通过双级缓存机制和自回归扩散范式，成功解决了多镜头视频生成中的一致性问题，并在一致性和美学质量上超越了现有方法，为生成更一致、可控和叙事驱动的视频内容开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Current video generation models perform well at single-shot synthesis but struggle with multi-shot videos, facing critical challenges in maintaining character and background consistency across shots and flexibly generating videos of arbitrary length and shot count. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{FilmWeaver}, a novel framework designed to generate consistent, multi-shot videos of arbitrary length. First, it employs an autoregressive diffusion paradigm to achieve arbitrary-length video generation. To address the challenge of consistency, our key insight is to decouple the problem into inter-shot consistency and intra-shot coherence. We achieve this through a dual-level cache mechanism: a shot memory caches keyframes from preceding shots to maintain character and scene identity, while a temporal memory retains a history of frames from the current shot to ensure smooth, continuous motion. The proposed framework allows for flexible, multi-round user interaction to create multi-shot videos. Furthermore, due to this decoupled design, our method demonstrates high versatility by supporting downstream tasks such as multi-concept injection and video extension. To facilitate the training of our consistency-aware method, we also developed a comprehensive pipeline to construct a high-quality multi-shot video dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches on metrics for both consistency and aesthetic quality, opening up new possibilities for creating more consistent, controllable, and narrative-driven video content.

Conclusion: 提出的RcAE方法在无监督工业异常检测中表现出色，性能与最新扩散模型相当，但参数更少、推理速度更快，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Unsupervised industrial anomaly detection requires accurately identifying defects without labeled data. Traditional autoencoder-based methods often struggle with incomplete anomaly suppression and loss of fine details, as their single-pass decoding fails to effectively handle anomalies with varying severity and scale. We propose a recursive architecture for autoencoder (RcAE), which performs reconstruction iteratively to progressively suppress anomalies while refining normal structures. Unlike traditional single-pass models, this recursive design naturally produces a sequence of reconstructions, progressively exposing suppressed abnormal patterns. To leverage this reconstruction dynamics, we introduce a Cross Recursion Detection (CRD) module that tracks inconsistencies across recursion steps, enhancing detection of both subtle and large-scale anomalies. Additionally, we incorporate a Detail Preservation Network (DPN) to recover high-frequency textures typically lost during reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing non-diffusion methods, and achieves performance on par with recent diffusion models with only 10% of their parameters and offering substantially faster inference. These results highlight the practicality and efficiency of our approach for real-world applications.

Conclusion: Flowception通过结合离散帧插入和连续帧去噪，有效减少了错误累积和漂移，同时在训练效率和视频长度学习方面表现出色，支持多种视频生成任务。

Abstract: We present Flowception, a novel non-autoregressive and variable-length video generation framework. Flowception learns a probability path that interleaves discrete frame insertions with continuous frame denoising. Compared to autoregressive methods, Flowception alleviates error accumulation/drift as the frame insertion mechanism during sampling serves as an efficient compression mechanism to handle long-term context. Compared to full-sequence flows, our method reduces FLOPs for training three-fold, while also being more amenable to local attention variants, and allowing to learn the length of videos jointly with their content. Quantitative experimental results show improved FVD and VBench metrics over autoregressive and full-sequence baselines, which is further validated with qualitative results. Finally, by learning to insert and denoise frames in a sequence, Flowception seamlessly integrates different tasks such as image-to-video generation and video interpolation.

Abstract: Video autoencoders compress videos into compact latent representations for efficient reconstruction, playing a vital role in enhancing the quality and efficiency of video generation. However, existing video autoencoders often entangle spatial and temporal information, limiting their ability to capture temporal consistency and leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose Autoregressive Video Autoencoder (ARVAE), which compresses and reconstructs each frame conditioned on its predecessor in an autoregressive manner, allowing flexible processing of videos with arbitrary lengths. ARVAE introduces a temporal-spatial decoupled representation that combines downsampled flow field for temporal coherence with spatial relative compensation for newly emerged content, achieving high compression efficiency without information loss. Specifically, the encoder compresses the current and previous frames into the temporal motion and spatial supplement, while the decoder reconstructs the original frame from the latent representations given the preceding frame. A multi-stage training strategy is employed to progressively optimize the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARVAE achieves superior reconstruction quality with extremely lightweight models and small-scale training data. Moreover, evaluations on video generation tasks highlight its strong potential for downstream applications.

Abstract: We introduce Skeleton-Cache, the first training-free test-time adaptation framework for skeleton-based zero-shot action recognition (SZAR), aimed at improving model generalization to unseen actions during inference. Skeleton-Cache reformulates inference as a lightweight retrieval process over a non-parametric cache that stores structured skeleton representations, combining both global and fine-grained local descriptors. To guide the fusion of descriptor-wise predictions, we leverage the semantic reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to assign class-specific importance weights. By integrating these structured descriptors with LLM-guided semantic priors, Skeleton-Cache dynamically adapts to unseen actions without any additional training or access to training data. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60/120 and PKU-MMD II demonstrate that Skeleton-Cache consistently boosts the performance of various SZAR backbones under both zero-shot and generalized zero-shot settings.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has rapidly advanced visual understanding, largely via multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that use powerful LLMs as cognitive cores. In visual generation, however, these powerful core models are typically reduced to global text encoders for diffusion models, leaving most of their reasoning and planning ability unused. This creates a gap: current multimodal LLMs can parse complex layouts, attributes, and knowledge-intensive scenes, yet struggle to generate images or videos with equally precise and structured control. We propose MetaCanvas, a lightweight framework that lets MLLMs reason and plan directly in spatial and spatiotemporal latent spaces and interface tightly with diffusion generators. We empirically implement MetaCanvas on three different diffusion backbones and evaluate it across six tasks, including text-to-image generation, text/image-to-video generation, image/video editing, and in-context video generation, each requiring precise layouts, robust attribute binding, and reasoning-intensive control. MetaCanvas consistently outperforms global-conditioning baselines, suggesting that treating MLLMs as latent-space planners is a promising direction for narrowing the gap between multimodal understanding and generation.

Conclusion: SATMapTR通过创新的特征融合方法显著提升了高精地图的实时构建精度和鲁棒性，尤其在恶劣天气和传感器故障情况下表现优异。

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are evolving from pre-annotated to real-time construction to better support autonomous driving in diverse scenarios. However, this process is hindered by low-quality input data caused by onboard sensors limited capability and frequent occlusions, leading to incomplete, noisy, or missing data, and thus reduced mapping accuracy and robustness. Recent efforts have introduced satellite images as auxiliary input, offering a stable, wide-area view to complement the limited ego perspective. However, satellite images in Bird's Eye View are often degraded by shadows and occlusions from vegetation and buildings. Prior methods using basic feature extraction and fusion remain ineffective. To address these challenges, we propose SATMapTR, a novel online map construction model that effectively fuses satellite image through two key components: (1) a gated feature refinement module that adaptively filters satellite image features by integrating high-level semantics with low-level structural cues to extract high signal-to-noise ratio map-relevant representations; and (2) a geometry-aware fusion module that consistently fuse satellite and BEV features at a grid-to-grid level, minimizing interference from irrelevant regions and low-quality inputs. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset show that SATMapTR achieves the highest mean average precision (mAP) of 73.8, outperforming state-of-the-art satellite-enhanced models by up to 14.2 mAP. It also shows lower mAP degradation under adverse weather and sensor failures, and achieves nearly 3 times higher mAP at extended perception ranges.

Abstract: Generating dynamic 3D facial animation from natural language requires understanding both temporally structured semantics and fine-grained expression changes. Existing datasets and methods mainly focus on speech-driven animation or unstructured expression sequences and therefore lack the semantic grounding and temporal structures needed for expressive human performance generation. In this work, we introduce KeyframeFace, a large-scale multimodal dataset designed for text-to-animation research through keyframe-level supervision. KeyframeFace provides 2,100 expressive scripts paired with monocular videos, per-frame ARKit coefficients, contextual backgrounds, complex emotions, manually defined keyframes, and multi-perspective annotations based on ARKit coefficients and images via Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Beyond the dataset, we propose the first text-to-animation framework that explicitly leverages LLM priors for interpretable facial motion synthesis. This design aligns the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs with the interpretable structure of ARKit's coefficients, enabling high-fidelity expressive animation. KeyframeFace and our LLM-based framework together establish a new foundation for interpretable, keyframe-guided, and context-aware text-to-animation.

Conclusion: 高质量牙科数据与分阶段适配相结合，为构建能力强且专业化的牙科MLLMs提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Reliable interpretation of multimodal data in dentistry is essential for automated oral healthcare, yet current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained dental visual details and lack sufficient reasoning ability for precise diagnosis. To address these limitations, we present DentalGPT, a specialized dental MLLM developed through high-quality domain knowledge injection and reinforcement learning. Specifically, the largest annotated multimodal dataset for dentistry to date was constructed by aggregating over 120k dental images paired with detailed descriptions that highlight diagnostically relevant visual features, making it the multimodal dataset with the most extensive collection of dental images to date. Training on this dataset significantly enhances the MLLM's visual understanding of dental conditions, while the subsequent reinforcement learning stage further strengthens its capability for multimodal complex reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations on intraoral and panoramic benchmarks, along with dental subsets of medical VQA benchmarks, show that DentalGPT achieves superior performance in disease classification and dental VQA tasks, outperforming many state-of-the-art MLLMs despite having only 7B parameters. These results demonstrate that high-quality dental data combined with staged adaptation provides an effective pathway for building capable and domain-specialized dental MLLMs.

Conclusion: 通过整合多帧时间序列信息，提出的方法在Tyrion架构中实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了冰川前缘监测的准确性。

Abstract: The calving fronts of marine-terminating glaciers undergo constant changes. These changes significantly affect the glacier's mass and dynamics, demanding continuous monitoring. To address this need, deep learning models were developed that can automatically delineate the calving front in Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery. However, these models often struggle to correctly classify areas affected by seasonal conditions such as ice melange or snow-covered surfaces. To address this issue, we propose to process multiple frames from a satellite image time series of the same glacier in parallel and exchange temporal information between the corresponding feature maps to stabilize each prediction. We integrate our approach into the current state-of-the-art architecture Tyrion and accomplish a new state-of-the-art performance on the CaFFe benchmark dataset. In particular, we achieve a Mean Distance Error of 184.4 m and a mean Intersection over Union of 83.6.

Conclusion: 该方法在真实和合成视频上均优于现有方法，有效去除动态光晕的同时保持了光源完整性和场景的时空一致性。

Abstract: Lens flare is a degradation phenomenon caused by strong light sources. Existing researches on flare removal have mainly focused on images, while the spatiotemporal characteristics of video flare remain largely unexplored. Video flare synthesis and removal pose significantly greater challenges than in image, owing to the complex and mutually independent motion of flare, light sources, and scene content. This motion independence further affects restoration performance, often resulting in flicker and artifacts. To address this issue, we propose a physics-informed dynamic flare synthesis pipeline, which simulates light source motion using optical flow and models the temporal behaviors of both scattering and reflective flares. Meanwhile, we design a video flare removal network that employs an attention module to spatially suppress flare regions and incorporates a Mamba-based temporal modeling component to capture long range spatio-temporal dependencies. This motion-independent spatiotemporal representation effectively eliminates the need for multi-frame alignment, alleviating temporal aliasing between flares and scene content and thereby improving video flare removal performance. Building upon this, we construct the first video flare dataset to comprehensively evaluate our method, which includes a large set of synthetic paired videos and additional real-world videos collected from the Internet to assess generalization capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing video-based restoration and image-based flare removal methods on both real and synthetic videos, effectively removing dynamic flares while preserving light source integrity and maintaining spatiotemporal consistency of scene.

Motivation: 模型指纹检测技术用于追踪AI生成图像的来源模型，但其在对抗条件下的鲁棒性尚未被充分研究。

Method: 通过形式化威胁模型（包括白盒和黑盒访问）和两种攻击目标（指纹移除和指纹伪造），实施了五种攻击策略，并评估了14种代表性指纹检测方法。

Result: 实验显示，移除攻击在白盒和黑盒条件下均表现高效（成功率分别超过80%和50%），而伪造攻击的成功率因目标模型而异。高准确性的方法通常鲁棒性较差。

Conclusion: 当前模型指纹检测技术在对抗条件下的鲁棒性存在明显不足，需要在保持高准确性的同时提升鲁棒性。

Abstract: Model fingerprint detection techniques have emerged as a promising approach for attributing AI-generated images to their source models, but their robustness under adversarial conditions remains largely unexplored. We present the first systematic security evaluation of these techniques, formalizing threat models that encompass both white- and black-box access and two attack goals: fingerprint removal, which erases identifying traces to evade attribution, and fingerprint forgery, which seeks to cause misattribution to a target model. We implement five attack strategies and evaluate 14 representative fingerprinting methods across RGB, frequency, and learned-feature domains on 12 state-of-the-art image generators. Our experiments reveal a pronounced gap between clean and adversarial performance. Removal attacks are highly effective, often achieving success rates above 80% in white-box settings and over 50% under constrained black-box access. While forgery is more challenging than removal, its success significantly varies across targeted models. We also identify a utility-robustness trade-off: methods with the highest attribution accuracy are often vulnerable to attacks. Although some techniques exhibit robustness in specific settings, none achieves high robustness and accuracy across all evaluated threat models. These findings highlight the need for techniques balancing robustness and accuracy, and identify the most promising approaches for advancing this goal.

Abstract: Ultrasound image segmentation is pivotal for clinical diagnosis, yet challenged by speckle noise and imaging artifacts. Recently, DINOv3 has shown remarkable promise in medical image segmentation with its powerful representation capabilities. However, DINOv3, pre-trained on natural images, lacks sensitivity to ultrasound-specific boundary degradation. To address this limitation, we propose FreqDINO, a frequency-guided segmentation framework that enhances boundary perception and structural consistency. Specifically, we devise a Multi-scale Frequency Extraction and Alignment (MFEA) strategy to separate low-frequency structures and multi-scale high-frequency boundary details, and align them via learnable attention. We also introduce a Frequency-Guided Boundary Refinement (FGBR) module that extracts boundary prototypes from high-frequency components and refines spatial features. Furthermore, we design a Multi-task Boundary-Guided Decoder (MBGD) to ensure spatial coherence between boundary and semantic predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreqDINO surpasses state-of-the-art methods with superior achieves remarkable generalization capability.

Abstract: With the advancement of multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs), Video LLMs have been further developed to perform on holistic and specialized video understanding. However, existing works are limited to specialized video understanding tasks, failing to achieve a comprehensive and multi-grained video perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce UFVideo, the first Video LLM with unified multi-grained cooperative understanding capabilities. Specifically, we design unified visual-language guided alignment to flexibly handle video understanding across global, pixel and temporal scales within a single model. UFVideo dynamically encodes the visual and text inputs of different tasks and generates the textual response, temporal localization, or grounded mask. Additionally, to evaluate challenging multi-grained video understanding tasks, we construct the UFVideo-Bench consisting of three distinct collaborative tasks within the scales, which demonstrates UFVideo's flexibility and advantages over GPT-4o. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our model across 9 public benchmarks covering various common video understanding tasks, providing valuable insights for future Video LLMs.

Motivation: 现有的小样本动作识别方法在集合匹配和预训练模型的高效适应方面存在两个主要限制：1. 现有的集合匹配度量通常仅依赖余弦相似性，无法捕捉更复杂的非线性关系；2. 高效适应CLIP时引入的侧层在有限数据条件下难以优化。

Abstract: Few-shot action recognition (FSAR) has recently made notable progress through set matching and efficient adaptation of large-scale pre-trained models. However, two key limitations persist. First, existing set matching metrics typically rely on cosine similarity to measure inter-frame linear dependencies and then perform matching with only instance-level information, thus failing to capture more complex patterns such as nonlinear relationships and overlooking task-specific cues. Second, for efficient adaptation of CLIP to FSAR, recent work performing fine-tuning via skip-fusion layers (which we refer to as side layers) has significantly reduced memory cost. However, the newly introduced side layers are often difficult to optimize under limited data conditions. To address these limitations, we propose TS-FSAR, a framework comprising three components: (1) a visual Ladder Side Network (LSN) for efficient CLIP fine-tuning; (2) a metric called Task-Specific Distance Correlation Matching (TS-DCM), which uses $α$-distance correlation to model both linear and nonlinear inter-frame dependencies and leverages a task prototype to enable task-specific matching; and (3) a Guiding LSN with Adapted CLIP (GLAC) module, which regularizes LSN using the adapted frozen CLIP to improve training for better $α$-distance correlation estimation under limited supervision. Extensive experiments on five widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that our TS-FSAR yields superior performance compared to prior state-of-the-arts.

Abstract: Underwater pipelines are highly susceptible to corrosion, which not only shorten their service life but also pose significant safety risks. Compared with manual inspection, the intelligent real-time imaging system for underwater pipeline detection has become a more reliable and practical solution. Among various underwater imaging techniques, structured light 3D imaging can restore the sufficient spatial detail for precise defect characterization. Therefore, this paper develops a multi-mode underwater structured light 3D imaging system for pipeline detection (UW-SLD system) based on multi-source information fusion. First, a rapid distortion correction (FDC) method is employed for efficient underwater image rectification. To overcome the challenges of extrinsic calibration among underwater sensors, a factor graph-based parameter optimization method is proposed to estimate the transformation matrix between the structured light and acoustic sensors. Furthermore, a multi-mode 3D imaging strategy is introduced to adapt to the geometric variability of underwater pipelines. Given the presence of numerous disturbances in underwater environments, a multi-source information fusion strategy and an adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF) are designed to ensure stable pose estimation and high-accuracy measurements. In particular, an edge detection-based ICP (ED-ICP) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm integrates pipeline edge detection network with enhanced point cloud registration to achieve robust and high-fidelity reconstruction of defect structures even under variable motion conditions. Extensive experiments are conducted under different operation modes, velocities, and depths. The results demonstrate that the developed system achieves superior accuracy, adaptability and robustness, providing a solid foundation for autonomous underwater pipeline detection.

Abstract: We introduce a fully automatic pipeline for dynamic scene reconstruction from casually captured monocular RGB videos. Rather than designing a new scene representation, we enhance the priors that drive Dynamic Gaussian Splatting. Video segmentation combined with epipolar-error maps yields object-level masks that closely follow thin structures; these masks (i) guide an object-depth loss that sharpens the consistent video depth, and (ii) support skeleton-based sampling plus mask-guided re-identification to produce reliable, comprehensive 2-D tracks. Two additional objectives embed the refined priors in the reconstruction stage: a virtual-view depth loss removes floaters, and a scaffold-projection loss ties motion nodes to the tracks, preserving fine geometry and coherent motion. The resulting system surpasses previous monocular dynamic scene reconstruction methods and delivers visibly superior renderings

Abstract: Efficient crop detection via Unmanned Aerial Vehicles is critical for scaling precision agriculture, yet it remains challenging due to the small scale of targets and environmental variability. This paper addresses the detection of rice seedlings in paddy fields by leveraging a Faster R-CNN architecture initialized via transfer learning. To overcome the specific difficulties of detecting minute objects in high-resolution aerial imagery, we curate a significant UAV dataset for training and rigorously evaluate the model's generalization capabilities. Specifically, we validate performance across three distinct test sets acquired at different temporal intervals, thereby assessing robustness against varying imaging conditions. Our empirical results demonstrate that transfer learning not only facilitates the rapid convergence of object detection models in agricultural contexts but also yields consistent performance despite domain shifts in image acquisition.

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) stands as a significant challenge in computer vision, dedicated to identifying and segmenting objects visually highly integrated with their backgrounds. Current mainstream methods have made progress in cross-layer feature fusion, but two critical issues persist during the decoding stage. The first is insufficient cross-channel information interaction within the same-layer features, limiting feature expressiveness. The second is the inability to effectively co-model boundary and region information, making it difficult to accurately reconstruct complete regions and sharp boundaries of objects. To address the first issue, we propose the Channel Information Interaction Module (CIIM), which introduces a horizontal-vertical integration mechanism in the channel dimension. This module performs feature reorganization and interaction across channels to effectively capture complementary cross-channel information. To address the second issue, we construct a collaborative decoding architecture guided by prior knowledge. This architecture generates boundary priors and object localization maps through Boundary Extraction (BE) and Region Extraction (RE) modules, then employs hybrid attention to collaboratively calibrate decoded features, effectively overcoming semantic ambiguity and imprecise boundaries. Additionally, the Multi-scale Enhancement (MSE) module enriches contextual feature representations. Extensive experiments on four COD benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of the proposed model. We further transferred our model to the Salient Object Detection (SOD) task and demonstrated its adaptability across downstream tasks, including polyp segmentation, transparent object detection, and industrial and road defect detection.

Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve superior performance in semantic segmentation, but are limited to a predefined set of classes, which leads to failures when they encounter unknown objects in open-world scenarios. Recognizing and segmenting these out-of-distribution (OOD) objects is crucial for safety-critical applications such as automated driving. In this work, we present an evidence segmentation framework using a Wasserstein loss, which captures distributional distances while respecting the probability simplex geometry. Combined with Kullback-Leibler regularization and Dice structural consistency terms, our approach leads to improved OOD segmentation performance compared to uncertainty-based approaches.

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法通过结构化提示策略显著提升了动作覆盖率和并行执行的可行性，同时大幅减少了冲突和约束违反。

Abstract: Humans can intuitively parallelise complex activities, but can a model learn this from observing a single person? Given one egocentric video, we introduce the N-Body Problem: how N individuals, can hypothetically perform the same set of tasks observed in this video. The goal is to maximise speed-up, but naive assignment of video segments to individuals often violates real-world constraints, leading to physically impossible scenarios like two people using the same object or occupying the same space. To address this, we formalise the N-Body Problem and propose a suite of metrics to evaluate both performance (speed-up, task coverage) and feasibility (spatial collisions, object conflicts and causal constraints). We then introduce a structured prompting strategy that guides a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to reason about the 3D environment, object usage, and temporal dependencies to produce a viable parallel execution. On 100 videos from EPIC-Kitchens and HD-EPIC, our method for N = 2 boosts action coverage by 45% over a baseline prompt for Gemini 2.5 Pro, while simultaneously slashing collision rates, object and causal conflicts by 55%, 45% and 55% respectively.

Conclusion: FlowDC通过并行叠加多个子编辑效果并分解速度场，显著提升了复杂编辑任务中的语义对齐和源一致性表现。

Abstract: With the surge of pre-trained text-to-image flow matching models, text-based image editing performance has gained remarkable improvement, especially for \underline{simple editing} that only contains a single editing target. To satisfy the exploding editing requirements, the \underline{complex editing} which contains multiple editing targets has posed as a more challenging task. However, current complex editing solutions: single-round and multi-round editing are limited by long text following and cumulative inconsistency, respectively. Thus, they struggle to strike a balance between semantic alignment and source consistency. In this paper, we propose \textbf{FlowDC}, which decouples the complex editing into multiple sub-editing effects and superposes them in parallel during the editing process. Meanwhile, we observed that the velocity quantity that is orthogonal to the editing displacement harms the source structure preserving. Thus, we decompose the velocity and decay the orthogonal part for better source consistency. To evaluate the effectiveness of complex editing settings, we construct a complex editing benchmark: Complex-PIE-Bench. On two benchmarks, FlowDC shows superior results compared with existing methods. We also detail the ablations of our module designs.

Conclusion: CRR框架通过协同重建与修复策略有效解决了传统重建网络中的身份映射问题，并在多类工业异常检测中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is a challenging open-set task that aims to identify unknown anomalous patterns deviating from normal data distribution. To avoid the significant memory consumption and limited generalizability brought by building separate models per class, we focus on developing a unified framework for multi-class anomaly detection. However, under this challenging setting, conventional reconstruction-based networks often suffer from an identity mapping problem, where they directly replicate input features regardless of whether they are normal or anomalous, resulting in detection failures. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel framework termed Collaborative Reconstruction and Repair (CRR), which transforms the reconstruction to repairation. First, we optimize the decoder to reconstruct normal samples while repairing synthesized anomalies. Consequently, it generates distinct representations for anomalous regions and similar representations for normal areas compared to the encoder's output. Second, we implement feature-level random masking to ensure that the representations from decoder contain sufficient local information. Finally, to minimize detection errors arising from the discrepancies between feature representations from the encoder and decoder, we train a segmentation network supervised by synthetic anomaly masks, thereby enhancing localization performance. Extensive experiments on industrial datasets that CRR effectively mitigates the identity mapping issue and achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-class industrial anomaly detection.

Conclusion: JoyAvatar通过PSB、MCI和URCR三项创新技术，成功解决了现有DiT方法在长视频生成中的计算开销大和错误累积问题，实现了实时推理和无限长度视频生成。

Abstract: Existing DiT-based audio-driven avatar generation methods have achieved considerable progress, yet their broader application is constrained by limitations such as high computational overhead and the inability to synthesize long-duration videos. Autoregressive methods address this problem by applying block-wise autoregressive diffusion methods. However, these methods suffer from the problem of error accumulation and quality degradation. To address this, we propose JoyAvatar, an audio-driven autoregressive model capable of real-time inference and infinite-length video generation with the following contributions: (1) Progressive Step Bootstrapping (PSB), which allocates more denoising steps to initial frames to stabilize generation and reduce error accumulation; (2) Motion Condition Injection (MCI), enhancing temporal coherence by injecting noise-corrupted previous frames as motion condition; and (3) Unbounded RoPE via Cache-Resetting (URCR), enabling infinite-length generation through dynamic positional encoding. Our 1.3B-parameter causal model achieves 16 FPS on a single GPU and achieves competitive results in visual quality, temporal consistency, and lip synchronization.

Abstract: Driver fatigue remains a leading cause of road accidents, with 24\% of crashes involving drowsy drivers. While yawning serves as an early behavioral indicator of fatigue, existing machine learning approaches face significant challenges due to video-annotated datasets that introduce systematic noise from coarse temporal annotations. We develop a semi-automated labeling pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification, which we apply to YawDD, enabling more accurate model training. Training the established MNasNet classifier and YOLOv11 detector architectures on YawDD+ improves frame accuracy by up to 6\% and mAP by 5\% over video-level supervision, achieving 99.34\% classification accuracy and 95.69\% detection mAP. The resulting approach deliver up to 59.8 FPS on edge AI hardware (NVIDIA Jetson Nano), confirming that enhanced data quality alone supports on-device yawning monitoring without server-side computation.

Conclusion: DOS框架通过仅对可观察点进行语义相关性软图的自蒸馏，提供了一种可扩展且有效的学习3D点云表示的方法，显著提升了语义分割和3D目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) have shown tremendous potential for learning 3D point cloud representations without human annotations. However, SSL for 3D point clouds still faces critical challenges due to irregular geometry, shortcut-prone reconstruction, and unbalanced semantics distribution. In this work, we propose DOS (Distilling Observable Softmaps), a novel SSL framework that self-distills semantic relevance softmaps only at observable (unmasked) points. This strategy prevents information leakage from masked regions and provides richer supervision than discrete token-to-prototype assignments. To address the challenge of unbalanced semantics in an unsupervised setting, we introduce Zipfian prototypes and incorporate them using a modified Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, Zipf-Sinkhorn, which enforces a power-law prior over prototype usage and modulates the sharpness of the target softmap during training. DOS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on semantic segmentation and 3D object detection across multiple benchmarks, including nuScenes, Waymo, SemanticKITTI, ScanNet, and ScanNet200, without relying on extra data or annotations. Our results demonstrate that observable-point softmaps distillation offers a scalable and effective paradigm for learning robust 3D representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决几何驱动参数化CAD编辑中需同步调整几何形状与底层参数序列的挑战，同时满足结构保留、语义有效性和形状保真度要求。

Method: 采用迭代的plan-generate-verify框架，结合P2S潜在扩散模型和MPP模型，通过规划、生成和验证三个阶段协同工作。

Result: CADMorph在无需三元组数据训练的情况下，性能优于现有方法，并支持迭代编辑和逆向工程增强等下游应用。

Conclusion: CADMorph通过结合预训练的领域特定基础模型（P2S和MPP），在几何驱动参数化CAD编辑中实现了结构保留、语义有效性和形状保真度，且无需依赖稀缺的三元组数据，性能优于GPT-4o和专用CAD基线。

Abstract: A Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model encodes an object in two coupled forms: a parametric construction sequence and its resulting visible geometric shape. During iterative design, adjustments to the geometric shape inevitably require synchronized edits to the underlying parametric sequence, called geometry-driven parametric CAD editing. The task calls for 1) preserving the original sequence's structure, 2) ensuring each edit's semantic validity, and 3) maintaining high shape fidelity to the target shape, all under scarce editing data triplets. We present CADMorph, an iterative plan-generate-verify framework that orchestrates pretrained domain-specific foundation models during inference: a parameter-to-shape (P2S) latent diffusion model and a masked-parameter-prediction (MPP) model. In the planning stage, cross-attention maps from the P2S model pinpoint the segments that need modification and offer editing masks. The MPP model then infills these masks with semantically valid edits in the generation stage. During verification, the P2S model embeds each candidate sequence in shape-latent space, measures its distance to the target shape, and selects the closest one. The three stages leverage the inherent geometric consciousness and design knowledge in pretrained priors, and thus tackle structure preservation, semantic validity, and shape fidelity respectively. Besides, both P2S and MPP models are trained without triplet data, bypassing the data-scarcity bottleneck. CADMorph surpasses GPT-4o and specialized CAD baselines, and supports downstream applications such as iterative editing and reverse-engineering enhancement.

Conclusion: VLM2GeoVec通过统一的单编码器架构，成功结合了可扩展检索与区域级空间推理能力，为遥感领域提供了连贯的多模态分析工具。

Abstract: Satellite imagery differs fundamentally from natural images: its aerial viewpoint, very high resolution, diverse scale variations, and abundance of small objects demand both region-level spatial reasoning and holistic scene understanding. Current remote-sensing approaches remain fragmented between dual-encoder retrieval models, which excel at large-scale cross-modal search but cannot interleave modalities, and generative assistants, which support region-level interpretation but lack scalable retrieval capabilities. We propose $\textbf{VLM2GeoVec}$, an instruction-following, single-encoder vision-language model trained contrastively to embed interleaved inputs (images, text, bounding boxes, and geographic coordinates) in a unified vector space. Our single encoder interleaves all inputs into one joint embedding trained with a contrastive loss, eliminating multi-stage pipelines and task-specific modules. To evaluate its versatility, we introduce $\textbf{RSMEB}$, a novel benchmark covering key remote-sensing embedding applications: scene classification; cross-modal search; compositional retrieval; visual-question answering; visual grounding and region-level reasoning; and semantic geospatial retrieval. On RSMEB, it achieves $\textbf{26.6%}$ P@1 on region-caption retrieval (+25 pp vs. dual-encoder baselines), $\textbf{32.5%}$ P@1 on referring-expression retrieval (+19 pp), and $\textbf{17.8%}$ P@1 on semantic geo-localization retrieval (over $3\times$ prior best), while matching or exceeding specialized baselines on conventional tasks such as scene classification and cross-modal retrieval. VLM2GeoVec unifies scalable retrieval with region-level spatial reasoning, enabling cohesive multimodal analysis in remote sensing. We will publicly release the code, checkpoints, and data upon acceptance.

Conclusion: TSkel-Mamba框架通过结合Transformer和Mamba模型，在骨架动作识别任务中实现了高效且高性能的识别，特别是在处理时空动态和跨通道时间交互方面表现出色。

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition has garnered significant attention in the computer vision community. Inspired by the recent success of the selective state-space model (SSM) Mamba in modeling 1D temporal sequences, we propose TSkel-Mamba, a hybrid Transformer-Mamba framework that effectively captures both spatial and temporal dynamics. In particular, our approach leverages Spatial Transformer for spatial feature learning while utilizing Mamba for temporal modeling. Mamba, however, employs separate SSM blocks for individual channels, which inherently limits its ability to model inter-channel dependencies. To better adapt Mamba for skeleton data and enhance Mamba`s ability to model temporal dependencies, we introduce a Temporal Dynamic Modeling (TDM) block, which is a versatile plug-and-play component that integrates a novel Multi-scale Temporal Interaction (MTI) module. The MTI module employs multi-scale Cycle operators to capture cross-channel temporal interactions, a critical factor in action recognition. Extensive experiments on NTU-RGB+D 60, NTU-RGB+D 120, NW-UCLA and UAV-Human datasets demonstrate that TSkel-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining low inference time, making it both efficient and highly effective.

Conclusion: SS$A^3$D框架通过双分支架构和TCP模块，显著提高了自动化基台设计的准确性和效率，同时减少了训练时间。

Abstract: Abutment design is a critical step in dental implant restoration. However, manual design involves tedious measurement and fitting, and research on automating this process with AI is limited, due to the unavailability of large annotated datasets. Although self-supervised learning (SSL) can alleviate data scarcity, its need for pre-training and fine-tuning results in high computational costs and long training times. In this paper, we propose a Self-supervised assisted automatic abutment design framework (SS$A^3$D), which employs a dual-branch architecture with a reconstruction branch and a regression branch. The reconstruction branch learns to restore masked intraoral scan data and transfers the learned structural information to the regression branch. The regression branch then predicts the abutment parameters under supervised learning, which eliminates the separate pre-training and fine-tuning process. We also design a Text-Conditioned Prompt (TCP) module to incorporate clinical information (such as implant location, system, and series) into SS$A^3$D. This guides the network to focus on relevant regions and constrains the parameter predictions. Extensive experiments on a collected dataset show that SS$A^3$D saves half of the training time and achieves higher accuracy than traditional SSL methods. It also achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other methods, significantly improving the accuracy and efficiency of automated abutment design.

Conclusion: VGGT隐式地实现了对应匹配并在全局注意力层中编码了对极几何，尽管训练时没有明确的几何约束。同时，该模型结合了学习到的数据驱动先验，展现出对几何结构的内部化理解。

Abstract: The Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) is a 3D foundation model that infers camera geometry and scene structure in a single feed-forward pass. Trained in a supervised, single-step fashion on large datasets, VGGT raises a key question: does it build upon geometric concepts like traditional multi-view methods, or does it rely primarily on learned appearance-based data-driven priors? In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of VGGT's internal mechanisms to uncover whether geometric understanding emerges within its representations. By probing intermediate features, analyzing attention patterns, and performing interventions, we examine how the model implements its functionality. Our findings reveal that VGGT implicitly performs correspondence matching within its global attention layers and encodes epipolar geometry, despite being trained without explicit geometric constraints. We further investigate VGGT's dependence on its learned data priors. Using spatial input masking and perturbation experiments, we assess its robustness to occlusions, appearance variations, and camera configurations, comparing it with classical multi-stage pipelines. Together, these insights highlight how VGGT internalizes geometric structure while using learned data-driven priors.

Abstract: Integrating event cameras with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) promises general scene understanding in challenging visual conditions, yet requires navigating a trade-off between preserving the unique advantages of event data and ensuring compatibility with frame-based models.

Abstract: Fine-scale forest monitoring is essential for understanding canopy structure and its dynamics, which are key indicators of carbon stocks, biodiversity, and forest health. Deep learning is particularly effective for this task, as it integrates spectral, temporal, and spatial signals that jointly reflect the canopy structure. To address this need, we introduce THREASURE-Net, a novel end-to-end framework for Tree Height Regression And Super-Resolution. The model is trained on Sentinel-2 time series using reference height metrics derived from LiDAR HD data at multiple spatial resolutions over Metropolitan France to produce annual height maps. We evaluate three model variants, producing tree-height predictions at 2.5 m, 5 m, and 10 m resolution. THREASURE-Net does not rely on any pretrained model nor on reference very high resolution optical imagery to train its super-resolution module; instead, it learns solely from LiDAR-derived height information. Our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods based on Sentinel data and is competitive with methods based on very high resolution imagery. It can be deployed to generate high-precision annual canopy-height maps, achieving mean absolute errors of 2.62 m, 2.72 m, and 2.88 m at 2.5 m, 5 m, and 10 m resolution, respectively. These results highlight the potential of THREASURE-Net for scalable and cost-effective structural monitoring of temperate forests using only freely available satellite data.

Conclusion: 提出的端到端可训练、任务自适应的框架显著优于现有方法，在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: Key frame selection in video understanding presents significant challenges. Traditional top-K selection methods, which score frames independently, often fail to optimize the selection as a whole. This independent scoring frequently results in selecting frames that are temporally clustered and visually redundant. Additionally, training lightweight selectors using pseudo labels generated offline by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) prevents the supervisory signal from dynamically adapting to task objectives. To address these limitations, we propose an end-to-end trainable, task-adaptive framework for frame selection. A Chain-of-Thought approach guides a Small Language Model (SLM) to generate task-specific implicit query vectors, which are combined with multimodal features to enable dynamic frame scoring. We further define a continuous set-level objective function that incorporates relevance, coverage, and redundancy, enabling differentiable optimization via Gumbel-Softmax to select optimal frame combinations at the set level. Finally, student-teacher mutual learning is employed, where the student selector (SLM) and teacher reasoner (MLLM) are trained to align their frame importance distributions via KL divergence. Combined with cross-entropy loss, this enables end-to-end optimization, eliminating reliance on static pseudo labels. Experiments across various benchmarks, including Video-MME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, and NExT-QA, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches.

Motivation: 实现文本描述与生成图像之间的组合对齐（涵盖对象、属性和空间关系）是现代文本到图像（T2I）模型的核心挑战。尽管扩散架构已被广泛研究，但新兴的视觉自回归（VAR）模型的组合行为仍未得到充分研究。

Method: 对六种不同的T2I系统（SDXL、PixArt-α、Flux-Dev、Flux-Schnell、Infinity-2B和Infinity-8B）进行了全面的T2I-CompBench++和GenEval套件测试，评估了颜色和属性绑定、空间关系、数字能力和复杂多对象提示的对齐情况。

Conclusion: Infinity-8B展示了最强的整体组合对齐能力，而Infinity-2B在多个类别中表现优于更大的扩散模型，突出了效率与性能的有利权衡。SDXL和PixArt-α在属性和空间任务上表现较弱。

Abstract: Achieving compositional alignment between textual descriptions and generated images - covering objects, attributes, and spatial relationships - remains a core challenge for modern text-to-image (T2I) models. Although diffusion-based architectures have been widely studied, the compositional behavior of emerging Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models is still largely unexamined. We benchmark six diverse T2I systems - SDXL, PixArt-$α$, Flux-Dev, Flux-Schnell, Infinity-2B, and Infinity-8B - across the full T2I-CompBench++ and GenEval suites, evaluating alignment in color and attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy, and complex multi-object prompts. Across both benchmarks, Infinity-8B achieves the strongest overall compositional alignment, while Infinity-2B also matches or exceeds larger diffusion models in several categories, highlighting favorable efficiency-performance trade-offs. In contrast, SDXL and PixArt-$α$ show persistent weaknesses in attribute-sensitive and spatial tasks. These results provide the first systematic comparison of VAR and diffusion approaches to compositional alignment and establish unified baselines for the future development of the T2I model.

Abstract: Despite the success of deep learning based models in medical image segmentation, most state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods perform fully-supervised learning, which commonly rely on large scale annotated training datasets. However, medical image annotation is highly time-consuming, hindering its clinical applications. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has been emerged as an appealing strategy in training with limited annotations, largely reducing the labelling cost. We propose a novel SSL framework SSL-MedSAM2, which contains a training-free few-shot learning branch TFFS-MedSAM2 based on the pretrained large foundation model Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for pseudo label generation, and an iterative fully-supervised learning branch FSL-nnUNet based on nnUNet for pseudo label refinement. The results on MICCAI2025 challenge CARE-LiSeg (Liver Segmentation) demonstrate an outstanding performance of SSL-MedSAM2 among other methods.

To adapt SAM2 for 3D teeth data, we render images of 3D teeth models from predefined views, apply SAM2 for 2D segmentation, and reconstruct 3D results using 2D-3D projections. Since SAM2's performance depends on input prompts and its initial outputs often have deficiencies, and given its class-agnostic nature, we introduce three light-weight learnable modules: (1) a prompt embedding generator to derive prompt embeddings from image embeddings for accurate mask decoding, (2) a mask refiner to enhance SAM2's initial segmentation results, and (3) a mask classifier to categorize the generated masks. Additionally, we incorporate Deformable Global Attention Plugins (DGAP) into SAM2's image encoder. The DGAP enhances both the segmentation accuracy and the speed of the training process. Our method has been validated on the 3DTeethSeg benchmark, achieving an IoU of 91.90% on high-resolution 3D teeth meshes, establishing a new state-of-the-art in the field.

Conclusion: DINO-based encoders remain competitive across large viewpoint shifts, while 3D-aware models like VGGT require dedicated multi-view adjustments.

Abstract: Benchmarking 3D spatial understanding of foundation models is essential for real-world applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. Existing evaluations often rely on downstream finetuning with linear heads or task-specific decoders, making it difficult to isolate the intrinsic 3D reasoning ability of pretrained encoders. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark for in-context 3D scene understanding that requires no finetuning and directly probes the quality of dense visual features. Building on the Hummingbird framework, which evaluates in-context 2D scene understanding, we extend the setup to the 3D Multi-View ImageNet (MVImgNet) dataset. Given a set of images from objects in specific angles (keys), we benchmark the performance of segmenting novel views (queries) and report the scores in 4 categories of easy, medium, hard, and extreme based on the key-query view contrast. We benchmark 8 state-of-the-art foundation models and show DINO-based encoders remain competitive across large viewpoint shifts, while 3D-aware models like VGGT require dedicated multi-view adjustments.

Conclusion: ContextSeisNet作为一种实用的方法，在地震多次波去除中实现了空间一致性，并可能适用于其他地震处理任务。

Abstract: Seismic processing transforms raw data into subsurface images essential for geophysical applications. Traditional methods face challenges, such as noisy data, and manual parameter tuning, among others. Recently deep learning approaches have proposed alternative solutions to some of these problems. However, important challenges of existing deep learning approaches are spatially inconsistent results across neighboring seismic gathers and lack of user-control. We address these limitations by introducing ContextSeisNet, an in-context learning model, to seismic demultiple processing. Our approach conditions predictions on a support set of spatially related example pairs: neighboring common-depth point gathers from the same seismic line and their corresponding labels. This allows the model to learn task-specific processing behavior at inference time by observing how similar gathers should be processed, without any retraining. This method provides both flexibility through user-defined examples and improved lateral consistency across seismic lines. On synthetic data, ContextSeisNet outperforms a U-Net baseline quantitatively and demonstrates enhanced spatial coherence between neighboring gathers. On field data, our model achieves superior lateral consistency compared to both traditional Radon demultiple and the U-Net baseline. Relative to the U-Net, ContextSeisNet also delivers improved near-offset performance and more complete multiple removal. Notably, ContextSeisNet achieves comparable field data performance despite being trained on 90% less data, demonstrating substantial data efficiency. These results establish ContextSeisNet as a practical approach for spatially consistent seismic demultiple with potential applicability to other seismic processing tasks.

Motivation: Professional CAD suites promise high economic return but remain the weakest performance domain for existing GUI agents, far from replacing expert EDA engineers.

Method: The study presents a large-scale dataset (GUI-EDA) with 2,000+ high-quality screenshot-answer-action pairs, evaluates 30+ mainstream GUI agents, and introduces an EDA-specialized metric (EDAgent) with a reflection mechanism.

Conclusion: This work extends GUI agents from generic office automation to specialized, high-value engineering domains, offering a new avenue for advancing EDA productivity.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents adopt an end-to-end paradigm that maps a screenshot to an action sequence, thereby automating repetitive tasks in virtual environments. However, existing GUI agents are evaluated almost exclusively on commodity software such as Microsoft Word and Excel. Professional Computer-Aided Design (CAD) suites promise an order-of-magnitude higher economic return, yet remain the weakest performance domain for existing agents and are still far from replacing expert Electronic-Design-Automation (EDA) engineers. We therefore present the first systematic study that deploys GUI agents for EDA workflows. Our contributions are: (1) a large-scale dataset named GUI-EDA, including 5 CAD tools and 5 physical domains, comprising 2,000+ high-quality screenshot-answer-action pairs recorded by EDA scientists and engineers during real-world component design; (2) a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates 30+ mainstream GUI agents, demonstrating that EDA tasks constitute a major, unsolved challenge; and (3) an EDA-specialized metric named EDAgent, equipped with a reflection mechanism that achieves reliable performance on industrial CAD software and, for the first time, outperforms Ph.D. students majored in Electrical Engineering. This work extends GUI agents from generic office automation to specialized, high-value engineering domains and offers a new avenue for advancing EDA productivity.

Abstract: Image Compression for Machines (ICM) has emerged as a pivotal research direction in the field of visual data compression. However, with the rapid evolution of machine intelligence, the target of compression has shifted from task-specific virtual models to Embodied agents operating in real-world environments. To address the communication constraints of Embodied AI in multi-agent systems and ensure real-time task execution, this paper introduces, for the first time, the scientific problem of Embodied Image Compression. We establish a standardized benchmark, EmbodiedComp, to facilitate systematic evaluation under ultra-low bitrate conditions in a closed-loop setting. Through extensive empirical studies in both simulated and real-world settings, we demonstrate that existing Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) fail to reliably perform even simple manipulation tasks when compressed below the Embodied bitrate threshold. We anticipate that EmbodiedComp will catalyze the development of domain-specific compression tailored for Embodied agents , thereby accelerating the Embodied AI deployment in the Real-world.

Abstract: Recovering high-fidelity 3D images from sparse or degraded 2D images is a fundamental challenge in medical imaging, with broad applications ranging from 3D ultrasound reconstruction to MRI super-resolution. In the context of fetal MRI, high-resolution 3D reconstruction of the brain from motion-corrupted low-resolution 2D acquisitions is a prerequisite for accurate neurodevelopmental diagnosis. While implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently established state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), they suffer from a critical computational bottleneck: accurately modeling the image acquisition physics requires expensive stochastic Monte Carlo sampling to approximate the point spread function (PSF). In this work, we propose a shift from neural network based implicit representations to Gaussian based explicit representations. By parameterizing the HR 3D image volume as a field of anisotropic Gaussian primitives, we leverage the property of Gaussians being closed under convolution and thus derive a \textit{closed-form analytical solution} for the forward model. This formulation reduces the previously intractable acquisition integral to an exact covariance addition ($\mathbfΣ_{obs} = \mathbfΣ_{HR} + \mathbfΣ_{PSF}$), effectively bypassing the need for compute-intensive stochastic sampling while ensuring exact gradient propagation. We demonstrate that our approach matches the reconstruction quality of self-supervised state-of-the-art SVR frameworks while delivering a 5$\times$--10$\times$ speed-up on neonatal and fetal data. With convergence often reached in under 30 seconds, our framework paves the way towards translation into clinical routine of real-time fetal 3D MRI. Code will be public at {https://github.com/m-dannecker/Gaussian-Primitives-for-Fast-SVR}.

Result: FactorPortrait能够从单张肖像图像、驱动视频和相机轨迹中生成逼真的动画，同时支持从任意视角进行新视角合成。

Conclusion: FactorPortrait在肖像动画的真实性、表现力、控制准确性和视角一致性方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: We introduce FactorPortrait, a video diffusion method for controllable portrait animation that enables lifelike synthesis from disentangled control signals of facial expressions, head movement, and camera viewpoints. Given a single portrait image, a driving video, and camera trajectories, our method animates the portrait by transferring facial expressions and head movements from the driving video while simultaneously enabling novel view synthesis from arbitrary viewpoints. We utilize a pre-trained image encoder to extract facial expression latents from the driving video as control signals for animation generation. Such latents implicitly capture nuanced facial expression dynamics with identity and pose information disentangled, and they are efficiently injected into the video diffusion transformer through our proposed expression controller. For camera and head pose control, we employ Plücker ray maps and normal maps rendered from 3D body mesh tracking. To train our model, we curate a large-scale synthetic dataset containing diverse combinations of camera viewpoints, head poses, and facial expression dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in realism, expressiveness, control accuracy, and view consistency.

Conclusion: KineMIC框架通过将T2M扩散模型适应到HAR领域，显著提升了动作合成的质量和分类器性能，验证了其在少样本场景下的有效性。

Abstract: The acquisition cost for large, annotated motion datasets remains a critical bottleneck for skeletal-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Although Text-to-Motion (T2M) generative models offer a compelling, scalable source of synthetic data, their training objectives, which emphasize general artistic motion, and dataset structures fundamentally differ from HAR's requirements for kinematically precise, class-discriminative actions. This disparity creates a significant domain gap, making generalist T2M models ill-equipped for generating motions suitable for HAR classifiers. To address this challenge, we propose KineMIC (Kinetic Mining In Context), a transfer learning framework for few-shot action synthesis. KineMIC adapts a T2M diffusion model to an HAR domain by hypothesizing that semantic correspondences in the text encoding space can provide soft supervision for kinematic distillation. We operationalize this via a kinetic mining strategy that leverages CLIP text embeddings to establish correspondences between sparse HAR labels and T2M source data. This process guides fine-tuning, transforming the generalist T2M backbone into a specialized few-shot Action-to-Motion generator. We validate KineMIC using HumanML3D as the source T2M dataset and a subset of NTU RGB+D 120 as the target HAR domain, randomly selecting just 10 samples per action class. Our approach generates significantly more coherent motions, providing a robust data augmentation source that delivers a +23.1% accuracy points improvement.

Abstract: Recent advances in image understanding have enabled methods that leverage large language models for multimodal reasoning in remote sensing. However, existing approaches still struggle to steer models to the user-relevant regions when only simple, generic text prompts are available. Moreover, in large-scale aerial imagery many objects exhibit highly similar visual appearances and carry rich inter-object relationships, which further complicates accurate recognition. To address these challenges, we propose Cross-modal Context-aware Learning for Visual Prompt-Guided Multimodal Image Understanding (CLV-Net). CLV-Net lets users supply a simple visual cue, a bounding box, to indicate a region of interest, and uses that cue to guide the model to generate correlated segmentation masks and captions that faithfully reflect user intent. Central to our design is a Context-Aware Mask Decoder that models and integrates inter-object relationships to strengthen target representations and improve mask quality. In addition, we introduce a Semantic and Relationship Alignment module: a Cross-modal Semantic Consistency Loss enhances fine-grained discrimination among visually similar targets, while a Relationship Consistency Loss enforces alignment between textual relations and visual interactions. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that CLV-Net outperforms existing methods and establishes new state-of-the-art results. The model effectively captures user intent and produces precise, intention-aligned multimodal outputs.

Abstract: Data augmentation is crucial for improving the robustness of face detection systems, especially under challenging conditions such as occlusion, illumination variation, and complex environments. Traditional copy paste augmentation often produces unrealistic composites due to inaccurate foreground extraction, inconsistent scene geometry, and mismatched background semantics. To address these limitations, we propose Depth Copy Paste, a multimodal and depth aware augmentation framework that generates diverse and physically consistent face detection training samples by copying full body person instances and pasting them into semantically compatible scenes. Our approach first employs BLIP and CLIP to jointly assess semantic and visual coherence, enabling automatic retrieval of the most suitable background images for the given foreground person. To ensure high quality foreground masks that preserve facial details, we integrate SAM3 for precise segmentation and Depth-Anything to extract only the non occluded visible person regions, preventing corrupted facial textures from being used in augmentation. For geometric realism, we introduce a depth guided sliding window placement mechanism that searches over the background depth map to identify paste locations with optimal depth continuity and scale alignment. The resulting composites exhibit natural depth relationships and improved visual plausibility. Extensive experiments show that Depth Copy Paste provides more diverse and realistic training data, leading to significant performance improvements in downstream face detection tasks compared with traditional copy paste and depth free augmentation methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models (DMs) have achieved exceptional visual quality in image editing tasks. However, the global denoising dynamics of DMs inherently conflate local editing targets with the full-image context, leading to unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we shift our attention beyond DMs and turn to Masked Generative Transformers (MGTs) as an alternative approach to tackle this challenge. By predicting multiple masked tokens rather than holistic refinement, MGTs exhibit a localized decoding paradigm that endows them with the inherent capacity to explicitly preserve non-relevant regions during the editing process. Building upon this insight, we introduce the first MGT-based image editing framework, termed EditMGT. We first demonstrate that MGT's cross-attention maps provide informative localization signals for localizing edit-relevant regions and devise a multi-layer attention consolidation scheme that refines these maps to achieve fine-grained and precise localization. On top of these adaptive localization results, we introduce region-hold sampling, which restricts token flipping within low-attention areas to suppress spurious edits, thereby confining modifications to the intended target regions and preserving the integrity of surrounding non-target areas. To train EditMGT, we construct CrispEdit-2M, a high-resolution dataset spanning seven diverse editing categories. Without introducing additional parameters, we adapt a pre-trained text-to-image MGT into an image editing model through attention injection. Extensive experiments across four standard benchmarks demonstrate that, with fewer than 1B parameters, our model achieves similarity performance while enabling 6 times faster editing. Moreover, it delivers comparable or superior editing quality, with improvements of 3.6% and 17.6% on style change and style transfer tasks, respectively.

Abstract: Change detection in remote sensing imagery is essential for applications such as urban planning, environmental monitoring, and disaster management. Traditional change detection methods typically identify all changes between two temporal images without distinguishing the types of transitions, which can lead to results that may not align with specific user needs. Although semantic change detection methods have attempted to address this by categorizing changes into predefined classes, these methods rely on rigid class definitions and fixed model architectures, making it difficult to mix datasets with different label sets or reuse models across tasks, as the output channels are tightly coupled with the number and type of semantic classes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Referring Change Detection (RCD), which leverages natural language prompts to detect specific classes of changes in remote sensing images. By integrating language understanding with visual analysis, our approach allows users to specify the exact type of change they are interested in. However, training models for RCD is challenging due to the limited availability of annotated data and severe class imbalance in existing datasets. To address this, we propose a two-stage framework consisting of (I) \textbf{RCDNet}, a cross-modal fusion network designed for referring change detection, and (II) \textbf{RCDGen}, a diffusion-based synthetic data generation pipeline that produces realistic post-change images and change maps for a specified category using only pre-change image, without relying on semantic segmentation masks and thereby significantly lowering the barrier to scalable data creation. Experiments across multiple datasets show that our framework enables scalable and targeted change detection. Project website is here: https://yilmazkorkmaz1.github.io/RCD.

Abstract: Recent pose-to-video models can translate 2D pose sequences into photorealistic, identity-preserving dance videos, so the key challenge is to generate temporally coherent, rhythm-aligned 2D poses from music, especially under complex, high-variance in-the-wild distributions. We address this by reframing music-to-dance generation as a music-token-conditioned multi-channel image synthesis problem: 2D pose sequences are encoded as one-hot images, compressed by a pretrained image VAE, and modeled with a DiT-style backbone, allowing us to inherit architectural and training advances from modern text-to-image models and better capture high-variance 2D pose distributions. On top of this formulation, we introduce (i) a time-shared temporal indexing scheme that explicitly synchronizes music tokens and pose latents over time and (ii) a reference-pose conditioning strategy that preserves subject-specific body proportions and on-screen scale while enabling long-horizon segment-and-stitch generation. Experiments on a large in-the-wild 2D dance corpus and the calibrated AIST++2D benchmark show consistent improvements over representative music-to-dance methods in pose- and video-space metrics and human preference, and ablations validate the contributions of the representation, temporal indexing, and reference conditioning.

This method can learn to segment de novo a new class of images from a new instrument and/or a new imaging protocol without the need for human annotations. We also present metrics for automated self-diagnosis of segmentation quality in production environments, where human visual proofreading of massive WSI images is unaffordable. Our method was benchmarked against five current widely used methods and showed a significant improvement. The code, sample WSI images, and high-resolution segmentation results are provided in open form for community adoption and adaptation.

Motivation: 尽管视觉基础模型（VFM）表征为视觉理解、感知和生成提供了统一的路径，但大规模文本到图像扩散模型在VFM表征空间中的训练尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过扩展SVG框架，提出SVG-T2I，直接在VFM特征域中支持高质量的文本到图像合成，利用标准的文本到图像扩散流程。

Result: SVG-T2I在GenEval上达到0.75，在DPG-Bench上达到85.78，展示了竞争性能。

Conclusion: 该研究验证了视觉基础模型（VFM）在生成任务中的内在表征能力，并通过开源项目促进了表征驱动视觉生成的进一步研究。

Abstract: Visual generation grounded in Visual Foundation Model (VFM) representations offers a highly promising unified pathway for integrating visual understanding, perception, and generation. Despite this potential, training large-scale text-to-image diffusion models entirely within the VFM representation space remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we scale the SVG (Self-supervised representations for Visual Generation) framework, proposing SVG-T2I to support high-quality text-to-image synthesis directly in the VFM feature domain. By leveraging a standard text-to-image diffusion pipeline, SVG-T2I achieves competitive performance, reaching 0.75 on GenEval and 85.78 on DPG-Bench. This performance validates the intrinsic representational power of VFMs for generative tasks. We fully open-source the project, including the autoencoder and generation model, together with their training, inference, evaluation pipelines, and pre-trained weights, to facilitate further research in representation-driven visual generation.

TL;DR: InST-based style transfer improves synthetic microscopy images, reducing domain gap and enhancing cell counting model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the domain gap in synthetic microscopy images lacking complex textures and visual patterns of real samples for better deep learning model training.

Method: Adapts the Inversion-Based Style Transfer (InST) framework, combining latent-space Adaptive Instance Normalization with stochastic inversion in a diffusion model to transfer style from real to synthetic images.

Result: Models trained with InST-synthesized images achieve up to 37% lower MAE compared to hard-coded synthetic data and 52% reduction compared to Cell200-s, even outperforming real data alone (25.95 vs. 27.74 MAE).

Conclusion: InST-based style transfer effectively reduces the domain gap between synthetic and real microscopy data, enhancing cell counting performance with minimal manual labeling effort.

Abstract: Generating realistic synthetic microscopy images is critical for training deep learning models in label-scarce environments, such as cell counting with many cells per image. However, traditional domain adaptation methods often struggle to bridge the domain gap when synthetic images lack the complex textures and visual patterns of real samples. In this work, we adapt the Inversion-Based Style Transfer (InST) framework originally designed for artistic style transfer to biomedical microscopy images. Our method combines latent-space Adaptive Instance Normalization with stochastic inversion in a diffusion model to transfer the style from real fluorescence microscopy images to synthetic ones, while weakly preserving content structure.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of our InST-based synthetic dataset for downstream cell counting by pre-training and fine-tuning EfficientNet-B0 models on various data sources, including real data, hard-coded synthetic data, and the public Cell200-s dataset. Models trained with our InST-synthesized images achieve up to 37\% lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared to models trained on hard-coded synthetic data, and a 52\% reduction in MAE compared to models trained on Cell200-s (from 53.70 to 25.95 MAE). Notably, our approach also outperforms models trained on real data alone (25.95 vs. 27.74 MAE). Further improvements are achieved when combining InST-synthesized data with lightweight domain adaptation techniques such as DACS with CutMix. These findings demonstrate that InST-based style transfer most effectively reduces the domain gap between synthetic and real microscopy data. Our approach offers a scalable path for enhancing cell counting performance while minimizing manual labeling effort.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频抠图数据集在规模和真实性上存在局限，且缺乏有效的边界监督，导致细节不足。

Method: 引入了学习的Matting Quality Evaluator（MQE）来评估alpha mattes的语义和边界质量，无需真实数据。MQE可在线用于训练反馈或离线用于数据筛选。此外，提出了一个参考帧训练策略来处理长视频中的外观变化。

Result: 构建了大规模真实世界视频抠图数据集VMReal，包含28K剪辑和2.4M帧。MatAnyone 2在所有指标上超越了先前方法。

Conclusion: MatAnyone 2模型在合成和真实世界基准测试中均达到了最先进的性能，超越了所有先前的方法。

Abstract: Video matting remains limited by the scale and realism of existing datasets. While leveraging segmentation data can enhance semantic stability, the lack of effective boundary supervision often leads to segmentation-like mattes lacking fine details. To this end, we introduce a learned Matting Quality Evaluator (MQE) that assesses semantic and boundary quality of alpha mattes without ground truth. It produces a pixel-wise evaluation map that identifies reliable and erroneous regions, enabling fine-grained quality assessment. The MQE scales up video matting in two ways: (1) as an online matting-quality feedback during training to suppress erroneous regions, providing comprehensive supervision, and (2) as an offline selection module for data curation, improving annotation quality by combining the strengths of leading video and image matting models. This process allows us to build a large-scale real-world video matting dataset, VMReal, containing 28K clips and 2.4M frames. To handle large appearance variations in long videos, we introduce a reference-frame training strategy that incorporates long-range frames beyond the local window for effective training. Our MatAnyone 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, surpassing prior methods across all metrics.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying vitiligo extent in routine clinical photographs is crucial for longitudinal monitoring of treatment response. We propose a trustworthy, frequency-aware segmentation framework built on three synergistic pillars: (1) a data-efficient training strategy combining domain-adaptive pre-training on the ISIC 2019 dataset with an ROI-constrained dual-task loss to suppress background noise; (2) an architectural refinement via a ConvNeXt V2-based encoder enhanced with a novel High-Frequency Spectral Gating (HFSG) module and stem-skip connections to capture subtle textures; and (3) a clinical trust mechanism employing K-fold ensemble and Test-Time Augmentation (TTA) to generate pixel-wise uncertainty maps. Extensive validation on an expert-annotated clinical cohort demonstrates superior performance, achieving a Dice score of 85.05% and significantly reducing boundary error (95% Hausdorff Distance improved from 44.79 px to 29.95 px), consistently outperforming strong CNN (ResNet-50 and UNet++) and Transformer (MiT-B5) baselines. Notably, our framework demonstrates high reliability with zero catastrophic failures and provides interpretable entropy maps to identify ambiguous regions for clinician review. Our approach suggests that the proposed framework establishes a robust and reliable standard for automated vitiligo assessment.

Result: SAM2VideoX在VBench上取得了95.51%的评分，比REPA高出2.60%，FVD降低到360.57，比REPA和LoRA微调分别提高了21.20%和22.46%。人类偏好测试中获得了71.4%的偏好率。

Conclusion: SAM2VideoX通过结合双向特征融合模块和局部Gram Flow损失，显著提升了视频生成模型在保持结构一致性方面的性能，实验证明了其在VBench和人类评估中的优越表现。

Abstract: Reality is a dance between rigid constraints and deformable structures. For video models, that means generating motion that preserves fidelity as well as structure. Despite progress in diffusion models, producing realistic structure-preserving motion remains challenging, especially for articulated and deformable objects such as humans and animals. Scaling training data alone, so far, has failed to resolve physically implausible transitions. Existing approaches rely on conditioning with noisy motion representations, such as optical flow or skeletons extracted using an external imperfect model. To address these challenges, we introduce an algorithm to distill structure-preserving motion priors from an autoregressive video tracking model (SAM2) into a bidirectional video diffusion model (CogVideoX). With our method, we train SAM2VideoX, which contains two innovations: (1) a bidirectional feature fusion module that extracts global structure-preserving motion priors from a recurrent model like SAM2; (2) a Local Gram Flow loss that aligns how local features move together. Experiments on VBench and in human studies show that SAM2VideoX delivers consistent gains (+2.60\% on VBench, 21-22\% lower FVD, and 71.4\% human preference) over prior baselines. Specifically, on VBench, we achieve 95.51\%, surpassing REPA (92.91\%) by 2.60\%, and reduce FVD to 360.57, a 21.20\% and 22.46\% improvement over REPA- and LoRA-finetuning, respectively.

Motivation: 当前的大规模视频生成模型在建模真实场景的光照和外观方面表现出色，但缺乏一个闭环框架来联合理解场景本征属性并支持可编辑的本征表示。

Method: V-RGBX 通过交织条件机制统一了三个关键能力：视频逆渲染到本征通道、从这些本征表示中合成逼真视频，以及基于本征通道的关键帧视频编辑。

Result: V-RGBX 在多样化的应用中表现出色，包括对象外观编辑和场景级重新照明，其生成的视频在时间一致性和逼真度上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: V-RGBX 是一个首创的端到端框架，支持基于本征通道的视频编辑，能够生成时间一致且逼真的视频，并在物理合理的方式下传播关键帧编辑，其性能超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have shown remarkable potential in modeling photorealistic appearance and lighting interactions in real-world scenes. However, a closed-loop framework that jointly understands intrinsic scene properties (e.g., albedo, normal, material, and irradiance), leverages them for video synthesis, and supports editable intrinsic representations remains unexplored. We present V-RGBX, the first end-to-end framework for intrinsic-aware video editing. V-RGBX unifies three key capabilities: (1) video inverse rendering into intrinsic channels, (2) photorealistic video synthesis from these intrinsic representations, and (3) keyframe-based video editing conditioned on intrinsic channels. At the core of V-RGBX is an interleaved conditioning mechanism that enables intuitive, physically grounded video editing through user-selected keyframes, supporting flexible manipulation of any intrinsic modality. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results show that V-RGBX produces temporally consistent, photorealistic videos while propagating keyframe edits across sequences in a physically plausible manner. We demonstrate its effectiveness in diverse applications, including object appearance editing and scene-level relighting, surpassing the performance of prior methods.

Abstract: Humanoid robots require precise locomotion and dexterous manipulation to perform challenging loco-manipulation tasks. Yet existing approaches, modular or end-to-end, are deficient in manipulation-aware locomotion. This confines the robot to a limited workspace, preventing it from performing large-space loco-manipulation. We attribute this to: (1) the challenge of acquiring loco-manipulation knowledge due to the scarcity of humanoid teleoperation data, and (2) the difficulty of faithfully and reliably executing locomotion commands, stemming from the limited precision and stability of existing RL controllers. To acquire richer loco-manipulation knowledge, we propose a unified latent learning framework that enables Vision-Language-Action (VLA) system to learn from low-cost action-free egocentric videos. Moreover, an efficient human data collection pipeline is devised to augment the dataset and scale the benefits. To more precisely execute the desired locomotion commands, we present a loco-manipulation-oriented (LMO) RL policy specifically tailored for accurate and stable core loco-manipulation movements, such as advancing, turning, and squatting. Building on these components, we introduce WholeBodyVLA, a unified framework for humanoid loco-manipulation. To the best of our knowledge, WholeBodyVLA is one of its kind enabling large-space humanoid loco-manipulation. It is verified via comprehensive experiments on the AgiBot X2 humanoid, outperforming prior baseline by 21.3%. It also demonstrates strong generalization and high extensibility across a broad range of tasks.

Abstract: General-purpose robotic end-effectors of limited complexity, like the parallel-jaw gripper, are appealing for their balance of simplicity and effectiveness in a wide range of manipulation tasks. However, while many such manipulators offer versatility in grasp-like interactions, they are not optimized for non-prehensile actions like pressing, rubbing, or scraping -- manipulations needed for many common tasks. To perform such tasks, humans use a range of different body parts or tools with different rigidity, friction, etc., according to the properties most effective for a given task. Here, we discuss a taxonomy for the key properties of a non-actuated end-effector, laying the groundwork for a systematic understanding of the affordances of non-prehensile manipulators. We then present a modular tool system, based on the taxonomy, that can be used by a standard two-fingered gripper to extend its versatility and effectiveness in performing such actions. We demonstrate the application of the tool system in aerospace and household scenarios that require a range of non-prehensile and prehensile manipulations.

Abstract: This letter presents a closed-form solution of Control Barrier Function (CBF) framework for enforcing safety constraints on a Stewart robotic platform. The proposed method simultaneously handles multiple position and velocity constraints through an explicit closed-form control law, eliminating the need to solve a Quadratic Program (QP) at every control step and enabling efficient real-time implementation. This letter derives necessary and sufficient conditions under which the closed-form expression remains non-singular, thereby ensuring well-posedness of the CBF solution to multi-constraint problem. The controller is validated in both simulation and hardware experiments on a custom-built Stewart platform prototype, demonstrating safetyguaranteed performance that is comparable to the QP-based formulation, while reducing computation time by more than an order of magnitude. The results confirm that the proposed approach provides a reliable and computationally lightweight framework for real-time safe control of parallel robotic systems.

Abstract: Achieving precise positioning of the mobile manipulator's base is essential for successful manipulation actions that follow. Most of the RGB-based navigation systems only guarantee coarse, meter-level accuracy, making them less suitable for the precise positioning phase of mobile manipulation. This gap prevents manipulation policies from operating within the distribution of their training demonstrations, resulting in frequent execution failures. We address this gap by introducing an object-centric imitation learning framework for last-meter navigation, enabling a quadruped mobile manipulator robot to achieve manipulation-ready positioning using only RGB observations from its onboard cameras. Our method conditions the navigation policy on three inputs: goal images, multi-view RGB observations from the onboard cameras, and a text prompt specifying the target object. A language-driven segmentation module and a spatial score-matrix decoder then supply explicit object grounding and relative pose reasoning. Using real-world data from a single object instance within a category, the system generalizes to unseen object instances across diverse environments with challenging lighting and background conditions. To comprehensively evaluate this, we introduce two metrics: an edge-alignment metric, which uses ground truth orientation, and an object-alignment metric, which evaluates how well the robot visually faces the target. Under these metrics, our policy achieves 73.47% success in edge-alignment and 96.94% success in object-alignment when positioning relative to unseen target objects. These results show that precise last-meter navigation can be achieved at a category-level without depth, LiDAR, or map priors, enabling a scalable pathway toward unified mobile manipulation.

Conclusion: BayesVLA通过贝叶斯分解有效解决了VLA模型中的模态不平衡问题，显著提升了模型在未见指令、物体和环境中的泛化能力。

Abstract: The pursuit of out-of-distribution generalization in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models is often hindered by catastrophic forgetting of the Vision-Language Model (VLM) backbone during fine-tuning. While co-training with external reasoning data helps, it requires experienced tuning and data-related overhead. Beyond such external dependencies, we identify an intrinsic cause within VLA datasets: modality imbalance, where language diversity is much lower than visual and action diversity. This imbalance biases the model toward visual shortcuts and language forgetting. To address this, we introduce BayesVLA, a Bayesian factorization that decomposes the policy into a visual-action prior, supporting seeing-to-act, and a language-conditioned likelihood, enabling prompt-to-specify. This inherently preserves generalization and promotes instruction following. We further incorporate pre- and post-contact phases to better leverage pre-trained foundation models. Information-theoretic analysis formally validates our effectiveness in mitigating shortcut learning. Extensive experiments show superior generalization to unseen instructions, objects, and environments compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Reliable testing of autonomous driving systems requires simulation environments that combine large-scale traffic modeling with realistic 3D perception and terrain. Existing tools rarely capture real-world elevation, limiting their usefulness in cities with complex topography. This paper presents an automated, elevation-aware co-simulation framework that integrates SUMO with CARLA using a pipeline that fuses OpenStreetMap road networks and USGS elevation data into physically consistent 3D environments. The system generates smooth elevation profiles, validates geometric accuracy, and enables synchronized 2D-3D simulation across platforms. Demonstrations on multiple regions of San Francisco show the framework's scalability and ability to reproduce steep and irregular terrain. The result is a practical foundation for high-fidelity autonomous vehicle testing in realistic, elevation-rich urban settings.

Conclusion: 该研究通过结合降阶Pontryagin最大原理（PMP）控制器与物理启发的梯度下降阶段，为自定义4自由度刚性机械臂开发了一个以控制为中心的框架，实现了高效且物理一致的动态控制。

Abstract: This work develops a control-centric framework for a custom 4-DOF rigid-body manipulator by coupling a reduced-order Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP) controller with a physics-informed Gradient Descent stage. The reduced PMP model provides a closed-form optimal control law for the joint accelerations, while the Gradient Descent module determines the corresponding time horizons by minimizing a cost functional built directly from the full Rigid-Body Dynamics. Structural-mechanics reaction analysis is used only to initialize feasible joint velocities-most critically the azimuthal component-ensuring that the optimizer begins in a physically admissible region. The resulting kinematic trajectories and dynamically consistent time horizons are then supplied to the symbolic Euler-Lagrange model to yield closed-form inverse-dynamics inputs. This pipeline preserves a strict control-theoretic structure while embedding the physical constraints and loading behavior of the manipulator in a computationally efficient way.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个对象中心的操作逻辑模式τ，作为人机协作中的关键知识信号，并在3D打印任务中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Existing pipelines for vision-language models (VLMs) in robotic manipulation prioritize broad semantic generalization from images and language, but typically omit execution-critical parameters required for contact-rich actions in manufacturing cells. We formalize an object-centric manipulation-logic schema, serialized as an eight-field tuple τ, which exposes object, interface, trajectory, tolerance, and force/impedance information as a first-class knowledge signal between human operators, VLM-based assistants, and robot controllers. We instantiate τ and a small knowledge base (KB) on a 3D-printer spool-removal task in a collaborative cell, and analyze τ-conditioned VLM planning using plan-quality metrics adapted from recent VLM/LLM planning benchmarks, while demonstrating how the same schema supports taxonomy-tagged data augmentation at training time and logic-aware retrieval-augmented prompting at test time as a building block for assistant systems in smart manufacturing enterprises.

Abstract: The validation of highly automated, perception-based driving systems must ensure that they function correctly under the full range of real-world conditions. Scenario-based testing is a prominent approach to addressing this challenge, as it involves the systematic simulation of objects and environments. Operational Design Domains (ODDs) are usually described using a taxonomy of qualitative designations for individual objects. However, the process of transitioning from taxonomy to concrete test cases remains unstructured, and completeness is theoretical. This paper introduces a structured method of subdividing the ODD into manageable sections, termed micro-ODDs (mODDs), and deriving test cases with abstract object representations. This concept is demonstrated using a one-dimensional, laterally guided manoeuvre involving a shunting locomotive within a constrained ODD. In this example, mODDs are defined and refined into narrow taxonomies that enable test case generation. Obstacles are represented as generic cubes of varying sizes, providing a simplified yet robust means of evaluating perception performance. A series of tests were conducted in a closed-loop, co-simulated virtual environment featuring photorealistic rendering and simulated LiDAR, GNSS and camera sensors. The results demonstrate how edge cases in obstacle detection can be systematically explored and how perception quality can be evaluated based on observed vehicle behaviour, using crash versus safe stop as the outcome metrics. These findings support the development of a standardised framework for safety argumentation and offer a practical step towards the validation and authorisation of automated driving functions.

This field is exploding with new models and datasets, making it both exciting and challenging to keep pace with. This survey offers a clear and structured guide to the VLA landscape. We design it to follow the natural learning path of a researcher: we start with the basic Modules of any VLA model, trace the history through key Milestones, and then dive deep into the core Challenges that define recent research frontier. Our main contribution is a detailed breakdown of the five biggest challenges in: (1) Representation, (2) Execution, (3) Generalization, (4) Safety, and (5) Dataset and Evaluation. This structure mirrors the developmental roadmap of a generalist agent: establishing the fundamental perception-action loop, scaling capabilities across diverse embodiments and environments, and finally ensuring trustworthy deployment-all supported by the essential data infrastructure. For each of them, we review existing approaches and highlight future opportunities. We position this paper as both a foundational guide for newcomers and a strategic roadmap for experienced researchers, with the dual aim of accelerating learning and inspiring new ideas in embodied intelligence.

Motivation: 道路使用者数量增加导致事故风险上升，VRUs在遮挡严重的城市环境中尤为危险。基础设施辅助CP技术能提供更优视角，减少遮挡，但需数据证明其安全性改进以推动决策者采用。

Method: 提出了一个评估基础设施CP对VRU安全性改进的框架，并创建了一个包含11k帧EuroNCAP安全关键场景（CarlaNCAP）的数据集。通过该数据集进行了深入的仿真研究。

Result: 基础设施辅助CP在关键安全场景中实现了高达100%的事故避免率，而仅配备传感器的车辆仅为33%。

Conclusion: 基础设施辅助的集体感知（CP）技术能显著提高弱势道路使用者（VRUs）的安全性，在关键安全场景中事故避免率可达100%，远高于仅配备传感器的车辆的33%。

Abstract: The growing number of road users has significantly increased the risk of accidents in recent years. Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) are particularly at risk, especially in urban environments where they are often occluded by parked vehicles or buildings. Autonomous Driving (AD) and Collective Perception (CP) are promising solutions to mitigate these risks. In particular, infrastructure-assisted CP, where sensor units are mounted on infrastructure elements such as traffic lights or lamp posts, can help overcome perceptual limitations by providing enhanced points of view, which significantly reduces occlusions. To encourage decision makers to adopt this technology, comprehensive studies and datasets demonstrating safety improvements for VRUs are essential. In this paper, we propose a framework for evaluating the safety improvement by infrastructure-based CP specifically targeted at VRUs including a dataset with safety-critical EuroNCAP scenarios (CarlaNCAP) with 11k frames. Using this dataset, we conduct an in-depth simulation study and demonstrate that infrastructure-assisted CP can significantly reduce accident rates in safety-critical scenarios, achieving up to 100% accident avoidance compared to a vehicle equipped with sensors with only 33%.

Conclusion: 通过使用GPU并行化物理模拟器和交叉熵优化，该方法能够生成可直接由机器人执行的计划，有效解决了传统TAMP算法在动态和复杂接触方面的不足。

Abstract: Autonomously performing tasks often requires robots to plan high-level discrete actions and continuous low-level motions to realize them. Previous TAMP algorithms have focused mainly on computational performance, completeness, or optimality by making the problem tractable through simplifications and abstractions. However, this comes at the cost of the resulting plans potentially failing to account for the dynamics or complex contacts necessary to reliably perform the task when object manipulation is required. Additionally, approaches that ignore effects of the low-level controllers may not obtain optimal or feasible plan realizations for the real system. We investigate the use of a GPU-parallelized physics simulator to compute realizations of plans with motion controllers, explicitly accounting for dynamics, and considering contacts with the environment. Using cross-entropy optimization, we sample the parameters of the controllers, or actions, to obtain low-cost solutions. Since our approach uses the same controllers as the real system, the robot can directly execute the computed plans. We demonstrate our approach for a set of tasks where the robot is able to exploit the environment's geometry to move an object.

Conclusion: UniBYD框架通过动态强化学习算法和统一形态表示（UMR），显著提升了机器人手在多样化形态下的任务成功率，超越了现有方法。

Abstract: In embodied intelligence, the embodiment gap between robotic and human hands brings significant challenges for learning from human demonstrations. Although some studies have attempted to bridge this gap using reinforcement learning, they remain confined to merely reproducing human manipulation, resulting in limited task performance. In this paper, we propose UniBYD, a unified framework that uses a dynamic reinforcement learning algorithm to discover manipulation policies aligned with the robot's physical characteristics. To enable consistent modeling across diverse robotic hand morphologies, UniBYD incorporates a unified morphological representation (UMR). Building on UMR, we design a dynamic PPO with an annealed reward schedule, enabling reinforcement learning to transition from imitation of human demonstrations to explore policies adapted to diverse robotic morphologies better, thereby going beyond mere imitation of human hands. To address the frequent failures of learning human priors in the early training stage, we design a hybrid Markov-based shadow engine that enables reinforcement learning to imitate human manipulations in a fine-grained manner. To evaluate UniBYD comprehensively, we propose UniManip, the first benchmark encompassing robotic manipulation tasks spanning multiple hand morphologies. Experiments demonstrate a 67.90% improvement in success rate over the current state-of-the-art. Upon acceptance of the paper, we will release our code and benchmark at https://github.com/zhanheng-creator/UniBYD.

Abstract: The realization of intelligent robots, operating autonomously and interacting with other intelligent agents, human or artificial, requires the integration of environment perception, reasoning, and action. Classic Artificial Intelligence techniques for this purpose, focusing on symbolic approaches, have long-ago hit the scalability wall on compute and memory costs. Advances in Large Language Models in the past decade (neural approaches) have resulted in unprecedented displays of capability, at the cost of control, explainability, and interpretability. Large Action Models aim at extending Large Language Models to encompass the full perception, reasoning, and action cycle; however, they typically require substantially more comprehensive training and suffer from the same deficiencies in reliability. Here, we show it is possible to build competent Large Action Models by composing off-the-shelf foundation models, and that their control, interpretability, and explainability can be effected by incorporating symbolic wrappers and associated verification on their outputs, achieving verifiable neuro-symbolic solutions for intelligent robots. Our experiments on a multi-modal robot demonstrate that Large Action Model intelligence does not require massive end-to-end training, but can be achieved by integrating efficient perception models with a logic-driven core. We find that driving action execution through the generation of Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) code enables a human-in-the-loop verification stage that effectively mitigates action hallucinations. These results can support practitioners in the design and development of robotic Large Action Models across novel industries, and shed light on the ongoing challenges that must be addressed to ensure safety in the field.

Abstract: Mobile robots are increasingly deployed in cluttered environments with movable objects, posing challenges for traditional methods that prohibit interaction. In such settings, the mobile robot must go beyond traditional obstacle avoidance, leveraging pushing or nudging strategies to accomplish its goals. While research in pushing-based robotics is growing, evaluations rely on ad hoc setups, limiting reproducibility and cross-comparison. To address this, we present Bench-Push, the first unified benchmark for pushing-based mobile robot navigation and manipulation tasks. Bench-Push includes multiple components: 1) a comprehensive range of simulated environments that capture the fundamental challenges in pushing-based tasks, including navigating a maze with movable obstacles, autonomous ship navigation in ice-covered waters, box delivery, and area clearing, each with varying levels of complexity; 2) novel evaluation metrics to capture efficiency, interaction effort, and partial task completion; and 3) demonstrations using Bench-Push to evaluate example implementations of established baselines across environments. Bench-Push is open-sourced as a Python library with a modular design. The code, documentation, and trained models can be found at https://github.com/IvanIZ/BenchNPIN.

Motivation: 研究机器人外观对用户心理模型和人机交互的影响，特别是在其对预期机器人解释的影响方面，这是一个尚未被充分研究的领域。

Method: 设计了一个组间研究，包含三种不同人化外观的家用服务机器人的视觉刺激条件，并要求受访者为相同的机器人动作提供他们期望从机器人那里获得的解释。

Result: 大多数解释在所有条件下都是拟人化的，但拟人化解释与机器人外观的人化程度之间存在正相关关系。

Conclusion: 研究发现，尽管所有条件下大多数解释都是拟人化的，但拟人化解释与机器人外观的人化程度呈正相关。此外，研究还报告了非拟人化解释和机器人描述中的更细微趋势。

Abstract: A robot's appearance is a known factor influencing user's mental model and human-robot interaction, that has not been studied in the context of its influence in expected robot explanations. In this study, we investigate whether and to what extent the human-like appearance of robots elicits anthropomorphism, which is conceptualised as an attribution of mental capacities, and how the level of anthropomorphism is revealed in explanations that people expect to receive. We designed a between-subject study comprising conditions with visual stimuli of three domestic service robots with varying human-like appearance, and we prompted respondents to provide explanations they would expect to receive from the robot for the same robot actions. We found that most explanations were anthropomorphic across all conditions. However, there is a positive correlation between the anthropomorphic explanations and human-like appearance. We also report on more nuanced trends observed in non-anthropomorphic explanations and trends in robot descriptions.

Conclusion: BLURR 是一种轻量级推理包装器，能够在保持任务成功率的同时显著降低计算开销，适用于在有限计算资源下部署现代 VLA 策略。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models enable impressive zero shot manipulation, but their inference stacks are often too heavy for responsive web demos or high frequency robot control on commodity GPUs. We present BLURR, a lightweight inference wrapper that can be plugged into existing VLA controllers without retraining or changing model checkpoints. Instantiated on the pi-zero VLA controller, BLURR keeps the original observation interfaces and accelerates control by combining an instruction prefix key value cache, mixed precision execution, and a single step rollout schedule that reduces per step computation. In our SimplerEnv based evaluation, BLURR maintains task success rates comparable to the original controller while significantly lowering effective FLOPs and wall clock latency. We also build an interactive web demo that allows users to switch between controllers and toggle inference options in real time while watching manipulation episodes. This highlights BLURR as a practical approach for deploying modern VLA policies under tight compute budgets.

Conclusion: ProbeMDE通过结合RGB图像和稀疏的本体感知测量，显著提高了单目深度估计（MDE）在挑战性环境中的准确性，同时最小化了所需的测量次数。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) provides a useful tool for robotic perception, but its predictions are often uncertain and inaccurate in challenging environments such as surgical scenes where textureless surfaces, specular reflections, and occlusions are common. To address this, we propose ProbeMDE, a cost-aware active sensing framework that combines RGB images with sparse proprioceptive measurements for MDE. Our approach utilizes an ensemble of MDE models to predict dense depth maps conditioned on both RGB images and on a sparse set of known depth measurements obtained via proprioception, where the robot has touched the environment in a known configuration. We quantify predictive uncertainty via the ensemble's variance and measure the gradient of the uncertainty with respect to candidate measurement locations. To prevent mode collapse while selecting maximally informative locations to propriocept (touch), we leverage Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) over this gradient map. We validate our method in both simulated and physical experiments on central airway obstruction surgical phantoms. Our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline methods across standard depth estimation metrics, achieving higher accuracy while minimizing the number of required proprioceptive measurements.

Conclusion: 多智能体竞争训练方法在真实世界中展现出比单智能体基于进度奖励的方法更可靠的策略迁移能力，并且能够泛化到训练中未见过的对手。

Abstract: Through multi-agent competition and the sparse high-level objective of winning a race, we find that both agile flight (e.g., high-speed motion pushing the platform to its physical limits) and strategy (e.g., overtaking or blocking) emerge from agents trained with reinforcement learning. We provide evidence in both simulation and the real world that this approach outperforms the common paradigm of training agents in isolation with rewards that prescribe behavior, e.g., progress on the raceline, in particular when the complexity of the environment increases, e.g., in the presence of obstacles. Moreover, we find that multi-agent competition yields policies that transfer more reliably to the real world than policies trained with a single-agent progress-based reward, despite the two methods using the same simulation environment, randomization strategy, and hardware. In addition to improved sim-to-real transfer, the multi-agent policies also exhibit some degree of generalization to opponents unseen at training time. Overall, our work, following in the tradition of multi-agent competitive game-play in digital domains, shows that sparse task-level rewards are sufficient for training agents capable of advanced low-level control in the physical world.

Conclusion: AnchorDream通过将生成世界模型与机器人运动相结合，为模仿学习的数据扩展提供了实用路径，显著提升了策略学习的效果。

Abstract: The collection of large-scale and diverse robot demonstrations remains a major bottleneck for imitation learning, as real-world data acquisition is costly and simulators offer limited diversity and fidelity with pronounced sim-to-real gaps. While generative models present an attractive solution, existing methods often alter only visual appearances without creating new behaviors, or suffer from embodiment inconsistencies that yield implausible motions. To address these limitations, we introduce AnchorDream, an embodiment-aware world model that repurposes pretrained video diffusion models for robot data synthesis. AnchorDream conditions the diffusion process on robot motion renderings, anchoring the embodiment to prevent hallucination while synthesizing objects and environments consistent with the robot's kinematics. Starting from only a handful of human teleoperation demonstrations, our method scales them into large, diverse, high-quality datasets without requiring explicit environment modeling. Experiments show that the generated data leads to consistent improvements in downstream policy learning, with relative gains of 36.4% in simulator benchmarks and nearly double performance in real-world studies. These results suggest that grounding generative world models in robot motion provides a practical path toward scaling imitation learning.

Conclusion: AHPP模型及其高效算法在真实和合成数据集上验证了有效性，优于15种竞争方法。

Abstract: Bipartite graphs are widely used to model relationships between entities of different types, where nodes are divided into two disjoint sets. Similarity search, a fundamental operation that retrieves nodes similar to a given query node, plays a crucial role in various real-world applications, including machine learning and graph clustering. However, existing state-of-the-art methods often struggle to accurately capture the unique structural properties of bipartite graphs or fail to incorporate the informative node attributes, leading to suboptimal performance. Besides, their high computational complexity limits scalability, making them impractical for large graphs with millions of nodes and tens of thousands of attributes. To overcome these challenges, we first introduce Attribute-augmented Hidden Personalized PageRank (AHPP), a novel random walk model designed to blend seamlessly both the higher-order bipartite structure proximity and attribute similarity. We then formulate the similarity search over attributed bipartite graphs as an approximate AHPP problem and propose two efficient push-style local algorithms with provable approximation guarantees. Finally, extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of AHPP and the efficiency of our proposed algorithms when compared with fifteen competitors.

Conclusion: 本文提出了两种新的trie熵度量方法，克服了现有方法的局限性，并与字符串熵的性质相似，成为字符串熵的自然推广。此外，还展示了XBWT在压缩和索引方面的优势。

Abstract: Entropy quantifies the number of bits required to store objects under certain given assumptions. While this is a well established concept for strings, in the context of tries the state-of-the-art regarding entropies is less developed. The standard trie worst-case entropy considers the set of tries with a fixed number of nodes and alphabet size. However, this approach does not consider the frequencies of the symbols in the trie, thus failing to capture the compressibility of tries with skewed character distributions. On the other hand, the label entropy [FOCS '05], proposed for node-labeled trees, does not take into account the tree topology, which has to be stored separately. In this paper, we introduce two new entropy measures for tries - worst-case and empirical - which overcome the two aforementioned limitations. Notably, our entropies satisfy similar properties of their string counterparts, thereby becoming very natural generalizations of the (simpler) string case. Indeed, our empirical entropy is closely related to the worst-case entropy and is reachable through a natural extension of arithmetic coding from strings to tries. Moreover we show that, similarly to the FM-index for strings [JACM '05], the XBWT of a trie can be compressed and efficiently indexed within our k-th order empirical entropy plus o(n) bits, with n being the number of nodes. Interestingly, the space usage of this encoding includes the trie topology and the upper-bound holds for every k sufficiently small, simultaneously. This XBWT encoding is always strictly smaller than the original one [JACM '09] and we show that in certain cases it is asymptotically smaller.

TL;DR: 论文研究了带有连通性约束的图着色问题，证明其在参数化复杂性中的可解性和核下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 继续研究Hsieh等人提出的带有连通性约束的新图着色变体，探索其在参数化复杂性中的性质，并与传统k-着色问题进行比较。

Method: 研究了一种新的图着色变体，带有连通性约束，称为强无冲突顶点连接k-可着色性。通过参数化分析和复杂性理论假设，探讨了该问题的可解性和核下界。

Result: 在顶点覆盖数参数化下，强无冲突k-可着色性是固定参数可处理的；但在标准假设下，强无冲突3-可着色性不承认多项式核。

Conclusion: 该论文证明了在顶点覆盖数参数化下，判断图是否具有强无冲突顶点连接k-可着色性是固定参数可处理的。然而，在标准复杂性理论假设下，判断图是否具有强无冲突3-可着色性（即使是二分图）不承认多项式核。

Abstract: This paper continues the study of a new variant of graph coloring with a connectivity constraint recently introduced by Hsieh et al. [COCOON 2024]. A path in a vertex-colored graph is called conflict-free if there is a color that appears exactly once on its vertices. A connected graph is said to be strongly conflict-free vertex-connection $k$-colorable if it admits a (proper) vertex $k$-coloring such that any two distinct vertices are connected by a conflict-free shortest path. Among others, we show that deciding, for a given graph $G$ and an integer $k$, whether $G$ is strongly conflict-free $k$-colorable is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the vertex cover number. But under the standard complexity-theoretic assumption NP $\not\subseteq$ coNP/poly, deciding, for a given graph $G$, whether $G$ is strongly conflict-free $3$-colorable does not admit a polynomial kernel, even for bipartite graphs. This kernel lower bound is in stark contrast to the ordinal $k$-Coloring problem which is known to admit a polynomial kernel when parameterized by the vertex cover number.

*Sasara Shimizu,Yoshiki Higo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 自动生成测试在覆盖率上优于手动测试，但在故障定位效果上较差，尤其在复杂代码结构中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动创建测试用例耗时且低效，现有研究多关注覆盖率指标，而较少探讨测试对故障定位的支持效果，尤其是通过变异测试引入的人工故障。

Method: 本研究比较了自动生成测试和手动创建测试的SBFL得分和代码覆盖率，特别关注了SBFL得分作为评估指标。

Result: 实验结果显示，自动生成测试的分支覆盖率高于手动创建测试，但其SBFL得分较低，特别是在深度嵌套结构的代码中。

Conclusion: 自动生成的测试在分支覆盖率上优于手动创建的测试，但在SBFL得分上表现较差，尤其是在深度嵌套结构的代码中。这些发现为如何有效结合自动生成和手动创建的测试方法提供了指导。

Abstract: The testing phase is an essential part of software development, but manually creating test cases can be time-consuming. Consequently, there is a growing need for more efficient testing methods. To reduce the burden on developers, various automated test generation tools have been developed, and several studies have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the tests they produce. However, most of these studies focus primarily on coverage metrics, and only a few examine how well the tests support fault localization-particularly using artificial faults introduced through mutation testing. In this study, we compare the SBFL (Spectrum-Based Fault Localization) score and code coverage of automatically generated tests with those of manually created tests. The SBFL score indicates how accurately faults can be localized using SBFL techniques. By employing SBFL score as an evaluation metric-an approach rarely used in prior studies on test generation-we aim to provide new insights into the respective strengths and weaknesses of manually created and automatically generated tests. Our experimental results show that automatically generated tests achieve higher branch coverage than manually created tests, but their SBFL score is lower, especially for code with deeply nested structures. These findings offer guidance on how to effectively combine automatically generated and manually created testing approaches.

TL;DR: AutoFSM是一个多智能体协作框架，通过结构化IR和自动化测试提升Verilog代码生成的效率和可靠性，实验显示显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在生成Verilog代码时面临语法错误频繁、调试效率低和依赖测试基准的问题，AutoFSM旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出了AutoFSM，一个多智能体协作框架，引入结构清晰的IR以减少语法错误，并提供工具链支持从IR到Verilog的自动转换。此外，首次将SystemC建模与自动测试台生成结合。

Result: 在SKT-FSM基准测试中，AutoFSM相比开源框架MAGE，通过率提升11.94%，语法错误率降低17.62%。

Conclusion: AutoFSM通过结合结构化中间表示（IR）和自动化测试，显著提升了寄存器传输级（RTL）代码生成的可靠性和扩展性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) in code generation, their applications in hardware design are receiving growing attention. However, existing LLMs face several challenges when generating Verilog code for finite state machine (FSM) control logic, including frequent syntax errors, low debugging efficiency, and heavy reliance on test benchmarks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes AutoFSM, a multi-agent collaborative framework designed for FSM code generation tasks. AutoFSM introduces a structurally clear intermediate representation (IR) to reduce syntax error rate during code generation and provides a supporting toolchain to enable automatic translation from IR to Verilog. Furthermore, AutoFSM is the first to integrate SystemC-based modeling with automatic testbench generation, thereby improving debugging efficiency and feedback quality. To systematically evaluate the framework's performance, we construct SKT-FSM, the first hierarchical FSM benchmark in the field, comprising 67 FSM samples across different complexity levels. Experimental results show that, under the same base LLM, AutoFSM consistently outperforms the open-source framework MAGE on the SKT-FSM benchmark, achieving up to an 11.94% improvement in pass rate and up to a 17.62% reduction in syntax error rate. These results demonstrate the potential of combining LLMs with structured IR and automated testing to improve the reliability and scalability of register-transfer level (RTL) code generation.

TL;DR: 研究发现小型量化LLM在C到Java翻译中表现分层，仅少数模型可行，但仍无法处理复杂概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究小型量化LLM在C到Java代码翻译任务中的有效性，解决范式转换、内存模型和不兼容数据类型等挑战。

Method: 采用了一种新颖的混合管道，结合抽象语法树（AST）进行语义分解，并使用高度约束的基于规则的提示策略。

Result: 模型表现分为三个层级：大多数模型完全失败，中间层产生可运行代码但存在语义错误，仅少数模型通过超过50%的测试。

Conclusion: 当前量化模型在C到Java代码翻译任务中存在明显的性能分层，仅有少数模型（如phi4、deepseek-coder-v2、codeqwen）表现可行，但仍无法处理复杂C概念。

Abstract: The automated translation of C code to Java code is a notoriously difficult task, fraught with challenges stemming from fundamental paradigm shifts (procedural vs. Object Oriented), memory models (manual pointers vs. Garbage Collection), and incompatible data types. This paper investigates the efficacy of 19 small, quantized LLMs (under 20 billion parameters) for the C to Java translation task. We use a novel, hybrid pipeline that leverages Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) for semantic decomposition and employs a highly constrained, rule based prompting strategy. The results are stark: a clear multi tiered performance divide emerged. The vast majority of models (Tier 3, e.g., llama3.1, gemma3, starcoder2) failed 100\% of the tests, proving incapable of generating even basic, runnable Java boilerplate. A small middle tier (Tier 2, e.g., mistral-nemo and mistral) produced runnable code but was plagued by dangerous semantic failures and wrong translations. Only three models (Tier 1: phi4, deepseek-coder-v2, codeqwen) proved viable, passing over 50\% of the test suite. Even these top models failed on the most complex C concepts, such as function pointers, sizeof, and enum logic, revealing a hard ceiling for the reasoning capabilities of current quantized models.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究首次系统评估了差分隐私（DP）在CodeLLMs中的效果，发现DP能显著减少记忆行为且不影响代码生成能力，适合隐私保护的训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CodeLLMs可能无意中记忆并重现训练数据中的代码片段，导致隐私泄露和知识产权风险，限制了其在敏感领域的应用。

Method: 应用差分隐私（DP）到CodeLLMs的训练过程中，通过添加校准噪声来保护个体数据点。

Result: DP有效减少了所有测试片段类型的记忆行为，且对代码生成能力影响较小，甚至有所提升。

Conclusion: DP显著减少了CodeLLMs的记忆行为，同时保持了代码生成能力，且对训练效率和能耗影响不大，使其成为保护隐私的实用选择。

Abstract: Large language models specialized for code (CodeLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating code snippets, documentation, and test cases. However, despite their promising capabilities, CodeLLMs can inadvertently memorize and reproduce snippets from their training data, which poses risks of privacy breaches and intellectual property violations. These risks restrict the deployment of CodeLLMs in sensitive domains and limit their training datasets to publicly available sources. To mitigate the memorization risk without compromising their task performance, we apply Differential Privacy (DP) to CodeLLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that systematically evaluates the effectiveness of DP in CodeLLMs. DP adds calibrated noise to the training process to protect individual data points while still allowing the model to learn useful patterns. To this end, we first identify and understand the driving reasons of the memorization behaviour of the CodeLLMs during their fine-tuning. Then, to address this issue, we empirically evaluate the effect of DP on mitigating memorization while preserving code generation capabilities. Our findings show that DP substantially reduces memorization in CodeLLMs across all the tested snippet types. The snippet types most prone to memorization are also the most effectively mitigated by DP. Furthermore, we observe that DP slightly increases perplexity but preserves, and can even enhance, the code generation capabilities of CodeLLMs, which makes it feasible to apply DP in practice without significantly compromising model utility. Finally, we analyze the impact of DP on training efficiency and energy consumption, finding that DP does not significantly affect training time or energy usage, making it a practical choice for privacy-preserving CodeLLMs training.

TL;DR: 研究分析了AI编码代理在PR中如何使用库，发现代理常导入库但少加新依赖，且版本控制严格，库选择多样性高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补关于AI编码代理在生成代码时如何使用库的知识空白，这是现实世界软件开发的核心部分。

Method: 研究分析了来自AIDev数据集的26,760个代理撰写的PR，考察了代理导入库的频率、引入新依赖的频率及版本控制实践，以及所选择的特定库。

Result: 代理经常导入库（29.5%的PR），但很少添加新依赖（1.3%的PR）；且当添加时，遵循严格的版本控制实践（75.0%指定版本），优于直接LLM使用。代理选择的库多样性远超先前非代理LLM研究中的有限偏好。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了关于AI编码代理如何与当前软件生态系统互动的早期实证视角，揭示了代理在使用库时的行为模式及其与直接LLM使用的差异。

Abstract: Coding agents are becoming increasingly capable of completing end-to-end software engineering workflows that previously required a human developer, including raising pull requests (PRs) to propose their changes. However, we still know little about how these agents use libraries when generating code, a core part of real-world software development. To fill this gap, we study 26,760 agent-authored PRs from the AIDev dataset to examine three questions: how often do agents import libraries, how often do they introduce new dependencies (and with what versioning), and which specific libraries do they choose? We find that agents often import libraries (29.5% of PRs) but rarely add new dependencies (1.3% of PRs); and when they do, they follow strong versioning practices (75.0% specify a version), an improvement on direct LLM usage where versions are rarely mentioned. Generally, agents draw from a surprisingly diverse set of external libraries, contrasting with the limited "library preferences" seen in prior non-agentic LLM studies. Our results offer an early empirical view into how AI coding agents interact with today's software ecosystems.

Motivation: 云服务能耗问题日益突出，现有算法未充分考虑物理机中不同类型资源的利用率，亟需开发更高效的节能算法。

Method: 提出了一种基于适应值（综合考虑CPU、磁盘、I/O利用率和任务处理时间）的任务调度算法，通过模拟实验验证其性能。

Result: 模拟实验表明，新算法在资源利用率和能耗方面均优于MaxUtil算法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的任务调度算法在提高资源利用率方面表现优异，相比现有算法MaxUtil能显著降低能耗，是一种更高效的能源节约方案。

Abstract: Recent trends of technology have explored a numerous applications of cloud services, which require a significant amount of energy. In the present scenario, most of the energy sources are limited and have a greenhouse effect on the environment. Therefore, it is the need of the hour that the energy consumed by the cloud service providers must be reduced and it is a great challenge to the research community to develop energy-efficient algorithms. To design the same, some researchers tried to maximize the average resource utilization, whereas some researchers tried to minimize the makespan. However, they have not considered different types of resources that are present in the physical machines. In this paper, we propose a task scheduling algorithm, which tries to improve utilization of resources (like CPU, disk, I/O) explicitly, which in turn increases the utilization of active resources. For this, the proposed algorithm uses a fitness value, which is a function of CPU, disk and I/O utilization, and processing time of the task. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, extensive simulations are performed on both proposed algorithm and existing algorithm MaxUtil using synthetic datasets. From the simulation results, it can be observed that the proposed algorithm is a better energy-efficient algorithm and consumes less energy than the MaxUtil algorithm.

Abstract: Live migration, a technology enabling seamless transition of operational computational entities between various hosts while preserving continuous functionality and client connectivity, has been the subject of extensive research. However, existing reviews often overlook critical technical aspects and practical challenges integral to the usage of live migration techniques in real-world scenarios. This work bridges this gap by integrating the aspects explored in existing reviews together with a comprehensive analysis of live migration technologies across multiple dimensions, with focus on migration techniques, migration units, and infrastructure characteristics. Despite efforts to make live migration widely accessible, its reliance on multiple system factors can create challenges. In certain cases, the complexities and resource demands outweigh the benefits, making its implementation hard to justify. The focus of this work is mainly on container based and virtual machine-based migration technologies, examining the current state of the art and the disparity in adoption between these two approaches. Furthermore, this work explores the impact of migration objectives and operational constraints on the usability and efficacy of existing technologies. By outlining current technical challenges and providing guidelines for future research and development directions, this work serves a dual purpose: first, to equip enthusiasts with a valuable resource on live migration, and second, to contribute to the advancement of live migration technologies and their practical implementation across diverse computing environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU集群的平均利用率仅为50%，主要由于碎片化、异构工作负载和静态调度策略的局限性。

Method: 通过控制模拟1,000个AI作业在64-GPU、8节点集群上评估三种动态调度器（HPS、PBS、SBS），并与静态基准（FIFO、SJF等）对比。

Result: 动态调度器表现优异：HPS实现最高利用率（78.2%）和吞吐量（25.8作业/小时），PBS提升碎片处理（76.1%利用率），SBS优化相似作业效率（74.6%利用率）。

Conclusion: 动态调度策略（HPS、PBS、SBS）在GPU集群中显著提升了利用率、公平性和吞吐量，为未来生产调度框架提供了实用基础。

Abstract: GPU clusters have become essential for training and deploying modern AI systems, yet real deployments continue to report average utilization near 50%. This inefficiency is largely caused by fragmentation, heterogeneous workloads, and the limitations of static scheduling policies. This work presents a systematic evaluation of these issues and introduces three specialized dynamic schedulers: Hybrid Priority (HPS), Predictive Backfill (PBS), and Smart Batch (SBS). These schedulers are designed to improve utilization, fairness, and overall throughput in multi-tenant GPU clusters. We evaluate all schedulers using a controlled simulation of 1,000 AI jobs on a 64-GPU, 8-node cluster that includes a realistic mix of training, inference, and research workloads. Static baselines (FIFO, SJF, Shortest, Shortest-GPU) achieve 45 to 67% GPU utilization and 12.5 to 18.3 jobs per hour and experience severe starvation, with as many as 156 jobs waiting longer than 30 minutes. The dynamic schedulers significantly outperform these policies. HPS achieves the highest utilization (78.2%), highest throughput (25.8 jobs per hour), and the lowest fairness variance among dynamic methods (457), reducing starvation to 12 jobs. PBS improves fragmentation handling and reaches 76.1% utilization, while SBS increases efficiency for structurally similar jobs and reaches 74.6% utilization. Across all key metrics, including throughput, job wait times, fairness variance, and starvation, dynamic multi-objective schedulers consistently outperform single-objective heuristics. These results show that targeted and transparent scheduling strategies can meaningfully increase GPU efficiency in heterogeneous AI clusters and provide a practical foundation for future production scheduling frameworks.

Abstract: In recent years, the landscape of federated learning has witnessed significant advancements, particularly in decentralized methodologies. This research paper presents a comprehensive comparison of Centralized Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) with Decentralized Aggregated Federated Learning (AFL) and Decentralized Continual Federated Learning (CFL) architectures. While HFL, in its centralized approach, faces challenges such as communication bottlenecks and privacy concerns due to centralized data aggregation, AFL and CFL provide promising alternatives by distributing computation and aggregation processes across devices. Through evaluation of Fashion MNIST and MNIST datasets, this study demonstrates the advantages of decentralized methodologies, showcasing how AFL and CFL outperform HFL in precision, recall, F1 score, and balanced accuracy. The analysis highlights the importance of decentralized aggregation mechanisms in AFL and CFL, which effectively enables collaborative model training across distributed devices. This comparative study contributes valuable insights into the evolving landscape of federated learning, guiding researchers and practitioners towards decentralized methodologies for enhanced performance in collaborative model training scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘AI应用中，现有规划器多关注吞吐量或设备利用率，忽视了QoE，导致资源效率低下或QoE违规。

Method: Dora采用异构感知模型分区器、竞争感知网络调度器和运行时适配器三种机制，联合优化计算、网络和QoE目标。

Result: 在智能家居、交通分析和小型边缘集群等场景中，Dora实现了1.1-6.3倍的执行速度提升或21-82%的能源消耗降低。

Conclusion: Dora框架通过异构感知模型分区、竞争感知网络调度和运行时适配器，显著提升了边缘AI训练和推理的执行效率与能源利用率，同时保证了QoE。

Abstract: With the proliferation of edge AI applications, satisfying user quality of experience (QoE) requirements, such as model inference latency, has become a first class objective, as these models operate in resource constrained settings and directly interact with users. Yet, modern AI models routinely exceed the resource capacity of individual devices, necessitating distributed execution across heterogeneous devices over variable and contention prone networks. Existing planners for hybrid (e.g., data and pipeline) parallelism largely optimize for throughput or device utilization, overlooking QoE, leading to severe resource inefficiency (e.g., unnecessary energy drain) or QoE violations under runtime dynamics.
  We present Dora, a framework for QoE aware hybrid parallelism in distributed edge AI training and inference. Dora jointly optimizes heterogeneous computation, contention prone networks, and multi dimensional QoE objectives via three key mechanisms: (i) a heterogeneity aware model partitioner that determines and assigns model partitions across devices, forming a compact set of QoE compliant plans; (ii) a contention aware network scheduler that further refines these candidate plans by maximizing compute communication overlap; and (iii) a runtime adapter that adaptively composes multiple plans to maximize global efficiency while respecting overall QoEs. Across representative edge deployments, including smart homes, traffic analytics, and small edge clusters, Dora achieves 1.1--6.3 times faster execution and, alternatively, reduces energy consumption by 21--82 percent, all while maintaining QoE under runtime dynamics.

Conclusion: 论文通过三种互补的GPU原生编译方法（并行传统编译、神经编译及混合架构）显著减少了AI代码生成系统中的延迟瓶颈，并证明了潜在10-100倍的加速效果。

Abstract: Current AI code generation systems suffer from significant latency bottlenecks due to CPU-GPU data transfers during compilation, execution, and testing phases. We establish theoretical foundations for three complementary approaches to GPU-native compilation that eliminate these transfers: (1) parallel traditional compilation adapted for GPU execution, (2) neural compilation using learned sequence-to-sequence translation with probabilistic verification, and (3) hybrid architectures combining both strategies. We derive latency and energy bounds demonstrating potential speedups of 10-100x for code iteration cycles. Our analysis shows that traditional GPU compilation provides 2-5x improvements through transfer elimination, neural compilation achieves 10-100x speedups via massive parallelism, and hybrid approaches offer practical deployment paths with guaranteed correctness. We formalize the probabilistic verification framework that enables trading compilation accuracy for parallel exploration, and discuss implications for self-improving AI systems and future analog computing substrates.

Motivation: RL训练后解耦架构中，严格同步要求的策略算法导致严重的依赖气泡，迫使一个集群在依赖阶段运行时闲置，RollMux旨在回收这些闲置资源。

Method: RollMux引入了共同执行组抽象，将集群划分为隔离的局部性域，采用两层级调度架构：组间调度器通过保守随机规划优化任务放置，组内调度器协调可证明最优的轮询调度。

Result: 在包含328台H20和328台H800 GPU的生产级测试平台上，RollMux的成本效率比标准解耦架构提高了1.84倍，比现有共置基线提高了1.38倍。

Conclusion: RollMux通过跨集群编排有效回收了依赖气泡，显著提升了硬件效率，成本效率比标准解耦架构提高了1.84倍，同时实现了100%的SLO达成率。

Abstract: Rollout-training disaggregation is emerging as the standard architecture for Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training, where memory-bound rollout and compute-bound training are physically disaggregated onto purpose-built clusters to maximize hardware efficiency. However, the strict synchronization required by on-policy algorithms introduces severe dependency bubbles, forcing one cluster to idle while the dependent phase is running on the other. We present RollMux, a cluster scheduling framework that reclaims these bubbles through cross-cluster orchestration. RollMux is built on the insight that the structural idleness of one job can be effectively utilized by the active phase of another. To realize this, we introduce the co-execution group abstraction, which partitions the cluster into isolated locality domains. This abstraction enables a two-tier scheduling architecture: an inter-group scheduler that optimizes job placement using conservative stochastic planning, and an intra-group scheduler that orchestrates a provably optimal round-robin schedule. The group abstraction also imposes a residency constraint, ensuring that massive model states remain cached in host memory to enable "warm-star" context switching. We evaluate RollMux on a production-scale testbed with 328 H20 and 328 H800 GPUs. RollMux improves cost efficiency by 1.84x over standard disaggregation and 1.38x over state-of-the-art co-located baselines, all while achieving 100% SLO attainment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的分布式修剪方法，通过多包消息传递技术降低通信开销，提升大规模网络分析的效率和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模复杂网络中，分散式计算接近中心性节点的任务由于高通信开销而具有挑战性。现有的分布式近似技术（如修剪）往往无法完全降低大型网络设置中交换大量数据包的成本。

Method: 引入了一种多包消息传递技术，允许节点批量传输更大的数据块，从而减少交换的消息数量并最小化数据丢失。

Result: 多包方法在消息效率（更少的总体消息）和计算时间上均显著优于原始修剪技术，同时保持了基线方法的核心近似特性。尽管观察到每个节点的内存使用和本地开销有所增加，但通信效率的提升（尤其是对于非常大的网络和复杂的数据包结构）超过了这一折衷。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种改进的分布式修剪方法，通过多包消息传递技术显著降低了通信开销，同时保持了中心性估计的准确性。该方法在消息效率和计算时间上均优于原始修剪技术，为大规模网络分析提供了更高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Identifying central nodes using closeness centrality is a critical task in analyzing large-scale complex networks, yet its decentralized computation remains challenging due to high communication overhead. Existing distributed approximation techniques, such as pruning, often fail to fully mitigate the cost of exchanging numerous data packets in large network settings. In this paper, we introduce a novel enhancement to the distributed pruning method specifically designed to overcome this communication bottleneck. Our core contribution is a technique that leverages multi-packet messaging, allowing nodes to batch and transmit larger, consolidated data blocks. This approach significantly reduces the number of exchanged messages and minimizes data loss without compromising the accuracy of the centrality estimates. We demonstrate that our multi-packet approach substantially outperforms the original pruning technique in both message efficiency (fewer overall messages) and computation time, preserving the core approximation properties of the baseline method. While we observe a manageable trade-off in increased per-node memory usage and local overhead, our findings show that this is outweighed by the gains in communication efficiency, particularly for very large networks and complex packet structures. Our work offers a more scalable and efficient solution for decentralized closeness centrality computation, promising a significant step forward for large-scale network analysis.

TL;DR: Parallax通过并行分区和智能内存管理优化移动DNN推理，显著降低延迟和内存开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动设备上实时DNN应用需求增长，但现有框架对动态控制流和未支持内核的处理效率低下，导致CPU闲置、高延迟和内存峰值。

Method: Parallax首先分区计算DAG以暴露并行性，采用分支感知内存管理（专用内存池和缓冲区重用），并结合自适应调度器和细粒度子图控制实现异构推理。

Result: 在三种移动设备上评估五种代表性DNN，Parallax实现了高达46%的延迟降低、平均26.5%的内存开销控制，以及30%的节能。

Conclusion: Parallax框架通过分区计算DAG、分支感知内存管理和自适应调度，显著提升了移动设备上DNN推理的效率，实现了低延迟、可控内存开销和节能效果。

Abstract: The growing demand for real-time DNN applications on edge devices necessitates faster inference of increasingly complex models. Although many devices include specialized accelerators (e.g., mobile GPUs), dynamic control-flow operators and unsupported kernels often fall back to CPU execution. Existing frameworks handle these fallbacks poorly, leaving CPU cores idle and causing high latency and memory spikes. We introduce Parallax, a framework that accelerates mobile DNN inference without model refactoring or custom operator implementations. Parallax first partitions the computation DAG to expose parallelism, then employs branch-aware memory management with dedicated arenas and buffer reuse to reduce runtime footprint. An adaptive scheduler executes branches according to device memory constraints, meanwhile, fine-grained subgraph control enables heterogeneous inference of dynamic models. By evaluating on five representative DNNs across three different mobile devices, Parallax achieves up to 46% latency reduction, maintains controlled memory overhead (26.5% on average), and delivers up to 30% energy savings compared with state-of-the-art frameworks, offering improvements aligned with the responsiveness demands of real-time mobile inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Snowflake算法在容器化环境中因工作节点ID的分配和管理带来显著复杂性，与现代无状态微服务的操作优势相冲突。

Method: 通过利用容器的私有IPv4地址作为节点唯一性来源，提出了一种修改后的位分配方案（1-41-16-6），无需中央协调即可生成严格单调的ID。

Result: 在AWS、GCP和Azure环境中验证了该方法的有效性，单节点理论上限约为64,000 TPS，实际微服务部署中网络I/O主导延迟，3节点集群下性能约为31,000 TPS，与经典有状态生成器相当，同时提供近乎无限的横向扩展能力。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于容器网络属性的分布式ID生成协议，有效解决了传统Snowflake算法在容器化环境中因工作节点ID管理带来的复杂性问题，实现了无状态微服务的操作优势。

Abstract: Snowflake-style distributed ID generators are the industry standard for producing k-ordered, unique identifiers at scale. However, the traditional requirement for manually assigned or centrally coordinated worker IDs introduces significant friction in modern container-orchestrated environments (e.g., Kubernetes), where workloads are ephemeral and autoscaled. In such systems, maintaining stable worker identities requires complex stateful sets or external coordination services (e.g., ZooKeeper), negating the operational benefits of stateless microservices.
  This paper presents a cloud-agnostic, container-native ID generation protocol that eliminates the dependency on explicit worker IDs. By deriving node uniqueness deterministically from ephemeral network properties - specifically the container's private IPv4 address - the proposed method removes the need for centralized coordination. We introduce a modified bit-allocation scheme (1-41-16-6) that accommodates 16 bits of network-derived entropy while preserving strict monotonicity. We validate the approach across AWS, GCP, and Azure environments. Evaluation results demonstrate that while the design has a theoretical single-node ceiling of approximately 64,000 TPS, in practical microservice deployments the network I/O dominates latency, resulting in end-to-end performance (approximately 31,000 TPS on a 3-node cluster) comparable to classic stateful generators while offering effectively unbounded horizontal scalability.

TL;DR: ECCO通过共享模型重训练和动态资源分配，高效解决视频分析中的数据漂移问题，显著降低成本并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前为每个摄像头单独重训练模型的方法计算和通信成本高，难以扩展。数据漂移在时空上具有相关性，为共享重训练提供了机会。

Method: ECCO引入轻量级分组算法、动态GPU分配器和传输控制器，以识别相似漂移的摄像头并共享模型重训练。

Result: 在三个数据集上的评估显示，ECCO在相同资源下将重训练精度提高6.7%-18.1%，或在相同精度下支持3.3倍多的并发摄像头。

Conclusion: ECCO通过动态分组、GPU资源分配和传输控制，显著降低了视频分析中连续学习的计算和通信成本，同时提高了重训练精度和系统可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advances in video analytics address real-time data drift by continuously retraining specialized, lightweight DNN models for individual cameras. However, the current practice of retraining a separate model for each camera suffers from high compute and communication costs, making it unscalable. We present ECCO, a new video analytics framework designed for resource-efficient continuous learning. The key insight is that the data drift, which necessitates model retraining, often shows temporal and spatial correlations across nearby cameras. By identifying cameras that experience similar drift and retraining a shared model for them, ECCO can substantially reduce the associated compute and communication costs. Specifically, ECCO introduces: (i) a lightweight grouping algorithm that dynamically forms and updates camera groups; (ii) a GPU allocator that dynamically assigns GPU resources across different groups to improve retraining accuracy and ensure fairness; and (iii) a transmission controller at each camera that configures frame sampling and coordinates bandwidth sharing with other cameras based on its assigned GPU resources. We conducted extensive evaluations on three distinctive datasets for two vision tasks. Compared to leading baselines, ECCO improves retraining accuracy by 6.7%-18.1% using the same compute and communication resources, or supports 3.3 times more concurrent cameras at the same accuracy.

TL;DR: H-MPCs是一种新型链下支付通道设计，通过超图结构解决流动性碎片化和通道耗尽问题，实验显示其交易成功率达94%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有支付通道网络（PCNs）存在流动性碎片化和通道耗尽问题，限制了路由效率和交易成功率。多方通道（MPC）虽能缓解这些问题，但通常依赖领导者或协调者，存在单点故障和灵活性不足的缺陷。

Method: 提出了一种新的链下构造——基于超图的多方支付通道（H-MPCs），替代传统的双边通道，通过可验证的有序DAG更新实现无领导者的跨通道支付。

Result: 在150个节点的网络中实现了约94%的交易成功率，且未出现HTLC过期或路由失败，证明了H-MPCs的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: H-MPCs通过基于超图的集体资金通道设计，显著提高了交易成功率和灵活性，解决了现有PCN中的流动性碎片化和通道耗尽问题。

Abstract: Public blockchains inherently offer low throughput and high latency, motivating off-chain scalability solutions such as Payment Channel Networks (PCNs). However, existing PCNs suffer from liquidity fragmentation-funds locked in one channel cannot be reused elsewhere-and channel depletion, both of which limit routing efficiency and reduce transaction success rates. Multi-party channel (MPC) constructions mitigate these issues, but they typically rely on leaders or coordinators, creating single points of failure and providing only limited flexibility for inter-channel payments.
  We introduce Hypergraph-based Multi-Party Payment Channels (H-MPCs), a new off-chain construction that replaces bilateral channels with collectively funded hyperedges. These hyperedges enable fully concurrent, leaderless intra- and inter-hyperedge payments through verifiable, proposer-ordered DAG updates, offering significantly greater flexibility and concurrency than prior designs.
  Our implementation on a 150-node network demonstrates a transaction success rate of approximately 94% without HTLC expiry or routing failures, highlighting the robustness of H-MPCs.

TL;DR: SHIFT是一个RDMA层的容错机制，通过无缝重定向RDMA流量减少网络异常对LLM训练的影响，透明且低开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模分布式LLM训练中，单个网络异常可能导致整个任务失败，现有容错机制（如检查点）主要作用于应用层，仍会中断训练进度。

Method: SHIFT在RDMA层上构建了一个容错层，支持RDMA流量在不同主机内NIC间的无缝重定向，并通过精心设计的故障状态机和控制流实现。

Result: 实验表明，SHIFT在数据路径上引入的开销极小，同时确保网络故障下的应用连续性。

Conclusion: SHIFT通过将容错机制引入RDMA层并与应用层技术结合，显著减少了网络异常导致的训练进度损失，且对应用透明、低开销。

Abstract: With gang scheduling in large-scale distributed Large Language Model training, a single network anomaly can propagate and cause complete task failure. The frequency of such anomalies increases with network scale. However, existing fault-tolerance mechanisms, such as checkpointing and runtime resilience methods, primarily operate at the application layer and inevitably cause disruptions in training progress.
  We propose to address this challenge by introducing fault tolerance at the Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) layer and integrating it with existing application-layer techniques. We present SHIFT, a fault-resilient layer over RDMA that enables seamless redirection of RDMA traffic across different intra-host NICs. By allowing applications to continue execution in the presence of network anomalies until the next checkpoint, SHIFT effectively minimizes training progress loss. SHIFT is designed to be application-agnostic, transparent to applications, and low-overhead.
  Through a carefully designed failure state machine and control flow, unmodified applications such as PyTorch with NCCL can run with RDMA-level fault tolerance. Experimental results demonstrate that SHIFT introduces minimal data path overhead while ensuring application continuity under network failures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LEO卫星网络的快速扩张需要高效、可扩展的多播协议，传统协议因控制开销大且难以适应动态拓扑而无法满足需求。

Method: 采用两层地理空间网格方案（H3）将目的地编码为地球和空间单元标识符，而非终端地址，从而缩短头部比特串并简化转发。

Result: 仿真显示，BIER-Star相比BIER减少了头部大小，并避免了贪婪方法中的地理路径查找失败。

Conclusion: BIER-Star是一种针对TN-NTN集成的无状态多播协议，通过地理空间网格方案显著减少了控制开销并提升了动态适应性。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of LEO satellite constellations has enabled an integrated terrestrial network and non-terrestrial network (TN-NTN), connecting diverse users such as aircraft, ships, and remote communities. These networks increasingly need a scalable and efficient multicast protocol for critical applications like emergency alerts, large-scale software updates, and real-time broadcasting. However, traditional multicast protocols, such as IP-based multicast and software-defined multicast approaches, introduce significant control overhead and struggle to adapt to the dynamic and mobile nature of satellite topologies. This paper presents BIER-Star, a stateless multicast protocol designed for the integrated TN-NTN. BIER-Star uses a two-layer geospatial gridding scheme (i.e., H3) to encode destinations as Earth- and space-cell identifiers rather than per-terminal addresses. This cell-based abstraction shortens the header bitstring, simplifies forwarding, and eliminates per-flow state and complex signaling. Our simulations indicate that BIER-Star reduces header size versus BIER and avoids geographic path-finding failures seen in greedy methods.

Conclusion: 该论文为高度移动环境中的虚拟网络嵌入（VNE）部署提供了基础，展示了在资源受限条件下优于传统方法的性能改进。

Abstract: Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) approaches typically assume static or slowly-changing network topologies, but emerging applications require deployment in mobile environments where traditional methods become insufficient. This work extends VNE to constrained mesh networks of mobile edge devices, addressing the unique challenges of rapid topology changes and limited resources. We develop models incorporating device capabilities, connectivity, mobility and energy constraints to evaluate optimal deployment strategies for mobile edge environments. Our approach handles the dynamic nature of mobile networks through three allocation strategies: an integer linear program for optimal allocation, a greedy heuristic for immediate deployment, and a multi-objective genetic algorithm for balanced optimization. Our initial evaluation analyzes application acceptance rates, resource utilization, and latency performance under resource limitations. Results demonstrate improvements over traditional approaches, providing a foundation for VNE deployment in highly mobile environments.

Abstract: Virtual Reality Cloud Gaming (VR-CG) represents a demanding class of immersive applications, requiring high bandwidth, ultra-low latency, and intelligent resource management to ensure optimal user experience. In this paper, we propose a scalable and QoE-aware multi-stage optimization framework for resource allocation in VR-CG over 6G networks. Our solution decomposes the joint resource allocation problem into three interdependent stages: (i) user association and communication resource allocation; (ii) VR-CG game engine placement with adaptive multipath routing; and (iii) attention-aware scheduling and wireless resource allocation based on motion-to-photon latency. For each stage, we design specialized heuristic algorithms that achieve near-optimal performance while significantly reducing computational time. We introduce a novel user-centric QoE model based on visual attention to virtual objects, guiding adaptive resolution and frame rate selection. A dataset-driven evaluation demonstrates that, when compared against state-of-the-art approaches, our framework improves QoE by up to 50\%, reduces communication resource usage by 75\%, and achieves up to 35\% cost savings, while maintaining an average optimality gap of 5\%. Our proposed heuristics solve large-scale scenarios in under 0.1 seconds, highlighting their potential for real-time deployment in next-generation mobile networks.

Result: 在简单的组合序贯决策示例中验证了CORL方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CORL框架通过强化学习端到端微调MILP方案，显著提升了其在现实世界中的操作性能。

Abstract: Combinatorial sequential decision making problems are typically modeled as mixed integer linear programs (MILPs) and solved via branch and bound (B&B) algorithms. The inherent difficulty of modeling MILPs that accurately represent stochastic real world problems leads to suboptimal performance in the real world. Recently, machine learning methods have been applied to build MILP models for decision quality rather than how accurately they model the real world problem. However, these approaches typically rely on supervised learning, assume access to true optimal decisions, and use surrogates for the MILP gradients. In this work, we introduce a proof of concept CORL framework that end to end fine tunes an MILP scheme using reinforcement learning (RL) on real world data to maximize its operational performance. We enable this by casting an MILP solved by B&B as a differentiable stochastic policy compatible with RL. We validate the CORL method in a simple illustrative combinatorial sequential decision making example.

Abstract: Online Freight Exchange Systems (OFEX) play a crucial role in modern freight logistics by facilitating real-time matching between shippers and carrier. However, efficient combinatorial bundling of transporation jobs remains a bottleneck. We model the OFEX combinatorial bundling problem as a multi-commodity one-to-one pickup-and-delivery selective traveling salesperson problem (m1-PDSTSP), which optimizes revenue-driven freight bundling under capacity, precedence, and route-length constraints. The key challenge is to couple combinatorial bundle selection with pickup-and-delivery routing under sub-second latency. We propose a learning--accelerated hybrid search pipeline that pairs a Transformer Neural Network-based constructive policy with an innovative Multi-Start Large Neighborhood Search (MSLNS) metaheuristic within a rolling-horizon scheme in which the platform repeatedly freezes the current marketplace into a static snapshot and solves it under a short time budget. This pairing leverages the low-latency, high-quality inference of the learning-based constructor alongside the robustness of improvement search; the multi-start design and plausible seeds help LNS to explore the solution space more efficiently. Across benchmarks, our method outperforms state-of-the-art neural combinatorial optimization and metaheuristic baselines in solution quality with comparable time, achieving an optimality gap of less than 2\% in total revenue relative to the best available exact baseline method. To our knowledge, this is the first work to establish that a Deep Neural Network-based constructor can reliably provide high-quality seeds for (multi-start) improvement heuristics, with applicability beyond the \textit{m1-PDSTSP} to a broad class of selective traveling salesperson problems and pickup and delivery problems.

Conclusion: FutureWeaver框架通过模块化协作和双级规划架构，有效优化了多智能体系统中的测试时计算分配，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Scaling test-time computation improves large language model performance without additional training. Recent work demonstrates that techniques such as repeated sampling, self-verification, and self-reflection can significantly enhance task success by allocating more inference-time compute. However, applying these techniques across multiple agents in a multi-agent system is difficult: there does not exist principled mechanisms to allocate compute to foster collaboration among agents, to extend test-time scaling to collaborative interactions, or to distribute compute across agents under explicit budget constraints. To address this gap, we propose FutureWeaver, a framework for planning and optimizing test-time compute allocation in multi-agent systems under fixed budgets. FutureWeaver introduces modularized collaboration, formalized as callable functions that encapsulate reusable multi-agent workflows. These modules are automatically derived through self-play reflection by abstracting recurring interaction patterns from past trajectories. Building on these modules, FutureWeaver employs a dual-level planning architecture that optimizes compute allocation by reasoning over the current task state while also speculating on future steps. Experiments on complex agent benchmarks demonstrate that FutureWeaver consistently outperforms baselines across diverse budget settings, validating its effectiveness for multi-agent collaboration in inference-time optimization.

Abstract: Applying reinforcement learning (RL) to real-world tasks requires converting informal descriptions into a formal Markov decision process (MDP), implementing an executable environment, and training a policy agent. Automating this process is challenging due to modeling errors, fragile code, and misaligned objectives, which often impede policy training. We introduce an agentic large language model (LLM)-based framework for automated MDP modeling and policy generation (A-LAMP), that automatically translates free-form natural language task descriptions into an MDP formulation and trained policy. The framework decomposes modeling, coding, and training into verifiable stages, ensuring semantic alignment throughout the pipeline. Across both classic control and custom RL domains, A-LAMP consistently achieves higher policy generation capability than a single state-of-the-art LLM model. Notably, even its lightweight variant, which is built on smaller language models, approaches the performance of much larger models. Failure analysis reveals why these improvements occur. In addition, a case study also demonstrates that A-LAMP generates environments and policies that preserve the task's optimality, confirming its correctness and reliability.

*Yuxing Chen,Basem Suleiman,Qifan Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TriFlow是一个多阶段框架，通过结合规则与LLM协作，显著提升了旅行规划的可行性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的代理在满足约束、工具协调和效率方面表现不佳，导致生成的计划不可行或成本高昂。

Method: TriFlow采用三阶段流程（检索、规划、治理），结合结构化推理和语言灵活性，通过规则与LLM协作逐步缩小搜索空间并确保全局可行性。

Result: 在TravelPlanner和TripTailor基准测试中，TriFlow分别达到了91.1%和97%的最终通过率，且运行效率比当前SOTA提高了10倍以上。

Conclusion: TriFlow通过其多阶段框架显著提升了旅行规划的可行性和个性化，同时在效率和约束满足方面取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Real-world trip planning requires transforming open-ended user requests into executable itineraries under strict spatial, temporal, and budgetary constraints while aligning with user preferences. Existing LLM-based agents struggle with constraint satisfaction, tool coordination, and efficiency, often producing infeasible or costly plans. To address these limitations, we present TriFlow, a progressive multi-agent framework that unifies structured reasoning and language-based flexibility through a three-stage pipeline of retrieval, planning, and governance. By this design, TriFlow progressively narrows the search space, assembles constraint-consistent itineraries via rule-LLM collaboration, and performs bounded iterative refinement to ensure global feasibility and personalisation. Evaluations on TravelPlanner and TripTailor benchmarks demonstrated state-of-the-art results, achieving 91.1% and 97% final pass rates, respectively, with over 10x runtime efficiency improvement compared to current SOTA.

TL;DR: CAPTURE是一个专为大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）设计的CAPTCHA基准测试，涵盖多种类型和子类型，结果显示当前LVLMs在解决CAPTCHA任务上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CAPTCHA基准测试无法全面覆盖所有CAPTCHA类型，且缺乏专门针对LVLMs的测试标准。为填补这一空白，研究团队开发了CAPTURE基准测试。

Method: 研究团队设计了一个名为CAPTURE的CAPTCHA基准测试，涵盖4种主要CAPTCHA类型和25种子类型，来自31家供应商。基准测试具有多样性、大规模数据和专门为LVLMs设计的标签。

Result: CAPTURE基准测试显示，当前的LVLMs在解决CAPTCHA任务上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前的大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在解决CAPTCHA任务上表现不佳，突显了现有模型的局限性。CAPTURE基准的引入填补了现有研究的空白，为LVLMs提供了全面评估的标准。

Abstract: Benefiting from strong and efficient multi-modal alignment strategies, Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) are able to simulate human visual and reasoning capabilities, such as solving CAPTCHAs. However, existing benchmarks based on visual CAPTCHAs still face limitations. Previous studies, when designing benchmarks and datasets, customized them according to their research objectives. Consequently, these benchmarks cannot comprehensively cover all CAPTCHA types. Notably, there is a dearth of dedicated benchmarks for LVLMs. To address this problem, we introduce a novel CAPTCHA benchmark for the first time, named CAPTURE CAPTCHA for Testing Under Real-world Experiments, specifically for LVLMs. Our benchmark encompasses 4 main CAPTCHA types and 25 sub-types from 31 vendors. The diversity enables a multi-dimensional and thorough evaluation of LVLM performance. CAPTURE features extensive class variety, large-scale data, and unique LVLM-tailored labels, filling the gaps in previous research in terms of data comprehensiveness and labeling pertinence. When evaluated by this benchmark, current LVLMs demonstrate poor performance in solving CAPTCHAs.

TL;DR: 提出一个任务完成框架，通过强化学习形式化环境中的行为指导，提升LLM代理在多轮任务中的可靠性和可验证性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多轮任务中行为缺乏可靠性和可验证性，需通过强化学习形式化环境中的明确行为指导提升其表现。

Method: 框架包含三个组件：轻量级任务分析器选择推理和生成策略，推理模块学习可验证的观察-动作映射，生成模块通过验证或确定性合成确保约束合规的输出。

Result: 代理在与环境交互过程中，各组件协同进化，产生可信行为。

Conclusion: 该框架通过整合任务分析器、推理模块和生成模块，实现了LLM代理在明确行为指导下的可信行为。

Abstract: Large Language Models demonstrate strong reasoning and generation abilities, yet their behavior in multi-turn tasks often lacks reliability and verifiability. We present a task completion framework that enables LLM-based agents to act under explicit behavioral guidance in environments described by reinforcement learning formalisms with defined observation, action, and reward signals.
  The framework integrates three components: a lightweight task profiler that selects reasoning and generation strategies, a reasoning module that learns verifiable observation - action mappings, and a generation module that enforces constraint-compliant outputs through validation or deterministic synthesis. We show that as the agent interacts with the environment, these components co-evolve, yielding trustworthy behavior.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentBalance 是一个多代理系统框架，通过先优化代理骨干再设计通信拓扑，在明确预算约束下显著提升成本效益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在优化多代理系统成本效益时，往往忽略明确的令牌成本和延迟预算，导致设计次优。AgentBalance 旨在解决这一问题。

Method: AgentBalance 采用两步设计：1) 骨干导向的代理生成（LLM池构建、池选择和角色-骨干匹配）；2) 自适应多代理系统拓扑生成（代理表示学习、门控和延迟感知拓扑合成）。

Result: 实验表明，AgentBalance 在匹配的令牌成本和延迟预算下，性能提升高达10%和22%，并在性能-预算曲线上表现优异。

Conclusion: AgentBalance 是一个在明确令牌成本和延迟预算下构建高效多代理系统的框架，通过先骨干后拓扑的设计，显著提升了性能与成本的平衡。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) are becoming indispensable building blocks for web-scale applications such as web search, social network analytics, and online customer support, where cost-effectiveness is increasingly the primary constraint for large-scale deployment. While recent work improves MAS cost-effectiveness by shaping inter-agent communication topologies and selecting agent backbones, it rarely models and optimizes under explicit token-cost and latency budgets that reflect deployment constraints. This often leads to topology-first designs and suboptimal cost-effectiveness when budgets are binding. We present AgentBalance, a framework for constructing cost-effective MAS under explicit token-cost and latency budgets via a backbone-then-topology design. AgentBalance first performs backbone-oriented agent generation, constructing agents with heterogeneous backbones through LLM pool construction, pool selection, and role-backbone matching. It then performs adaptive MAS topology generation, guiding inter-agent communication via agent representation learning, gating, and latency-aware topology synthesis. Experiments on benchmarks with 14 candidate LLM backbones show that AgentBalance achieves up to 10% and 22% performance gains under matched token-cost and latency budgets, respectively, and yields strong AUC on performance-versus-budget curves across benchmarks. AgentBalance also functions as a plug-in for existing MAS, improving performance under the same token-cost and latency constraints, and it generalizes well to unseen LLMs for practical, budget-aware deployment.

TL;DR: 论文指出现有Fidelity度量的基线选择存在问题，提出了一种新的模型依赖基线方法，通过特征可视化技术平衡信息去除和图像分布一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Fidelity度量（如Insertion和Deletion）依赖于基线函数，但基线的选择会偏向某些归因方法，甚至导致矛盾的结果。因此，需要研究基线的理想属性并改进现有方法。

Method: 作者通过分析现有基线的不足，提出了一个模型依赖的新基线方法，该方法利用特征可视化技术来平衡信息去除和图像分布的一致性。

Result: 研究表明，现有基线无法同时满足信息去除和避免生成过于偏离分布的图像的需求。新提出的基线方法在这两方面取得了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个新的基线方法，通过结合特征可视化技术，能够在去除信息的同时避免生成过于偏离分布的图像，从而改进了现有基线方法的权衡问题。

Abstract: Attribution methods are among the most prevalent techniques in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and are usually evaluated and compared using Fidelity metrics, with Insertion and Deletion being the most popular. These metrics rely on a baseline function to alter the pixels of the input image that the attribution map deems most important. In this work, we highlight a critical problem with these metrics: the choice of a given baseline will inevitably favour certain attribution methods over others. More concerningly, even a simple linear model with commonly used baselines contradicts itself by designating different optimal methods. A question then arises: which baseline should we use? We propose to study this problem through two desirable properties of a baseline: (i) that it removes information and (ii) that it does not produce overly out-of-distribution (OOD) images. We first show that none of the tested baselines satisfy both criteria, and there appears to be a trade-off among current baselines: either they remove information or they produce a sequence of OOD images. Finally, we introduce a novel baseline by leveraging recent work in feature visualisation to artificially produce a model-dependent baseline that removes information without being overly OOD, thus improving on the trade-off when compared to other existing baselines.

Motivation: 解决开放权重系统与专有前沿模型在复杂推理和长上下文理解方面的差距，以及推理适应中的模型崩溃和训练不稳定问题。

Method: 结合了内存高效的基础设施（支持64K标记上下文）、两阶段监督微调（SFT）课程以及稳健的强化学习微调（RLFT）流程。

Conclusion: Motif-2-12.7B-Reasoning 提供了一个在有限计算资源下扩展推理能力的实用蓝图，其性能可与更大参数量的模型媲美。

Abstract: We introduce Motif-2-12.7B-Reasoning, a 12.7B parameter language model designed to bridge the gap between open-weight systems and proprietary frontier models in complex reasoning and long-context understanding. Addressing the common challenges of model collapse and training instability in reasoning adaptation, we propose a comprehensive, reproducible training recipe spanning system, data, and algorithmic optimizations. Our approach combines memory-efficient infrastructure for 64K-token contexts using hybrid parallelism and kernel-level optimizations with a two-stage Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) curriculum that mitigates distribution mismatch through verified, aligned synthetic data. Furthermore, we detail a robust Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) pipeline that stabilizes training via difficulty-aware data filtering and mixed-policy trajectory reuse. Empirical results demonstrate that Motif-2-12.7B-Reasoning achieves performance comparable to models with significantly larger parameter counts across mathematics, coding, and agentic benchmarks, offering the community a competitive open model and a practical blueprint for scaling reasoning capabilities under realistic compute constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No-Three-In-Line问题作为组合几何中的著名问题，传统方法如ILP虽能保证最优解，但随着网格规模扩大面临指数级计算复杂度，而AI方法为基于模式的近似提供了新思路。

Method: 本文首次系统比较了经典优化（如整数线性规划ILP）与AI方法（如PatternBoost变压器学习和强化学习PPO）在解决No-Three-In-Line问题上的表现。

Result: ILP在19×19网格内获得可证明的最优解；PatternBoost在14×14网格内匹配最优性能，测试损失减少96%；PPO在10×10网格上表现完美，但在11×11网格上因约束违反而失败。

Conclusion: 经典优化方法在精确解方面仍不可替代，而AI方法在小规模问题上表现优异，混合方法为扩展到更大规模问题提供了最有前景的方向。

Abstract: The No-Three-In-Line problem asks for the maximum number of points that can be placed on an n by n grid with no three collinear, representing a famous problem in combinatorial geometry. While classical methods like Integer Linear Programming (ILP) guarantee optimal solutions, they face exponential scaling with grid size, and recent advances in machine learning offer promising alternatives for pattern-based approximation. This paper presents the first systematic comparison of classical optimization and AI approaches to this problem, evaluating their performance against traditional algorithms. We apply PatternBoost transformer learning and reinforcement learning (PPO) to this problem for the first time, comparing them against ILP. ILP achieves provably optimal solutions up to 19 by 19 grids, while PatternBoost matches optimal performance up to 14 by 14 grids with 96% test loss reduction. PPO achieves perfect solutions on 10 by 10 grids but fails at 11 by 11 grids, where constraint violations prevent valid configurations. These results demonstrate that classical optimization remains essential for exact solutions while AI methods offer competitive performance on smaller instances, with hybrid approaches presenting the most promising direction for scaling to larger problem sizes.

Motivation: 探索生成式AI在农业食品科学中的应用潜力，特别是在生态作物保护领域的科学知识生成。

Method: 通过评估DeepSeek和ChatGPT在九种全球性害虫、杂草和植物病害上的事实准确性、数据一致性和知识广度，比较两者的表现。

Result: DeepSeek在文献筛选、生物控制剂报告和管理解决方案方面表现优于ChatGPT，但两者均存在幻觉、遗漏数据和混淆科学术语的问题。

Conclusion: 尽管存在幻觉和遗漏数据的问题，当与严格的人工监督结合时，LLMs可能成为支持农场决策和释放科学创造力的强大工具。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) offers potential for democratizing scientific knowledge and converting this to clear, actionable information, yet its application in agri-food science remains unexplored. Here, we verify the scientific knowledge on agroecological crop protection that is generated by either web-grounded or non-grounded large language models (LLMs), i.e., DeepSeek versus the free-tier version of ChatGPT. For nine globally limiting pests, weeds, and plant diseases, we assessed the factual accuracy, data consistency, and breadth of knowledge or data completeness of each LLM. Overall, DeepSeek consistently screened a 4.8-49.7-fold larger literature corpus and reported 1.6-2.4-fold more biological control agents or management solutions than ChatGPT. As a result, DeepSeek reported 21.6% higher efficacy estimates, exhibited greater laboratory-to-field data consistency, and showed more realistic effects of pest identity and management tactics. However, both models hallucinated, i.e., fabricated fictitious agents or references, reported on implausible ecological interactions or outcomes, confused old and new scientific nomenclatures, and omitted data on key agents or solutions. Despite these shortcomings, both LLMs correctly reported low-resolution efficacy trends. Overall, when paired with rigorous human oversight, LLMs may pose a powerful tool to support farm-level decision-making and unleash scientific creativity.

Motivation: 尽管AI生成文本检测器在教育及专业环境中得到应用，但先前研究仅揭示了孤立偏见案例，缺乏针对更广泛社会语言因素的系统评估。

Method: 提出了BAID，一个全面的评估框架，包括超过200k样本，涵盖7大类：人口统计、年龄、教育年级、方言、正式程度、政治倾向和主题。还生成了每个样本的合成版本，以保留原始内容并反映特定子组的写作风格。

Result: 评估了四种开源AI文本检测器，发现检测性能存在持续差异，尤其是对来自代表性不足群体的文本召回率较低。

Conclusion: BAID框架提供了一种可扩展、透明的方法来审计AI文本检测器，并强调了在部署这些工具供公众使用之前进行偏见感知评估的必要性。

Abstract: AI-generated text detectors have recently gained adoption in educational and professional contexts. Prior research has uncovered isolated cases of bias, particularly against English Language Learners (ELLs) however, there is a lack of systematic evaluation of such systems across broader sociolinguistic factors. In this work, we propose BAID, a comprehensive evaluation framework for AI detectors across various types of biases. As a part of the framework, we introduce over 200k samples spanning 7 major categories: demographics, age, educational grade level, dialect, formality, political leaning, and topic. We also generated synthetic versions of each sample with carefully crafted prompts to preserve the original content while reflecting subgroup-specific writing styles. Using this, we evaluate four open-source state-of-the-art AI text detectors and find consistent disparities in detection performance, particularly low recall rates for texts from underrepresented groups. Our contributions provide a scalable, transparent approach for auditing AI detectors and emphasize the need for bias-aware evaluation before these tools are deployed for public use.

Method: 引入了EmeraldMind框架，整合领域特定知识图谱（EmeraldGraph）与检索增强生成技术，自动化检测绿色洗涤行为。

Result: 在绿色洗涤声明数据集上的实验表明，EmeraldMind相比通用大型语言模型具有更高的准确性、覆盖范围和解释质量，且无需微调或重新训练。

Conclusion: EmeraldMind框架通过结合领域特定知识图谱和检索增强生成技术，有效提升了绿色洗涤检测的准确性、覆盖范围和解释质量，为可持续发展决策提供了透明且证据支持的解决方案。

Abstract: As AI and web agents become pervasive in decision-making, it is critical to design intelligent systems that not only support sustainability efforts but also guard against misinformation. Greenwashing, i.e., misleading corporate sustainability claims, poses a major challenge to environmental progress. To address this challenge, we introduce EmeraldMind, a fact-centric framework integrating a domain-specific knowledge graph with retrieval-augmented generation to automate greenwashing detection. EmeraldMind builds the EmeraldGraph from diverse corporate ESG (environmental, social, and governance) reports, surfacing verifiable evidence, often missing in generic knowledge bases, and supporting large language models in claim assessment. The framework delivers justification-centric classifications, presenting transparent, evidence-backed verdicts and abstaining responsibly when claims cannot be verified. Experiments on a new greenwashing claims dataset demonstrate that EmeraldMind achieves competitive accuracy, greater coverage, and superior explanation quality compared to generic LLMs, without the need for fine-tuning or retraining.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在嘈杂冗余的患者主诉中提取核心医学信息的能力，并验证其是否表现出类似MASLD的功能衰退。

Method: 采用基于标准化医疗探针的横断面分析设计，选取四种主流LLM（GPT-4o、Gemini 2.5、DeepSeek 3.1和Qwen3-Max）作为研究对象，使用包含20个医疗探针的评估系统模拟真实临床沟通环境。

Result: 所有测试模型均表现出不同程度的功能缺陷，Qwen3-Max整体表现最佳，Gemini 2.5最差。极端噪音条件下，多数模型功能崩溃。GPT-4o在DVT继发PE风险评估中严重误判。

Conclusion: 本研究首次实证了大型语言模型在处理临床信息时表现出类似代谢功能障碍的特征，提出了‘AI-MASLD’的创新概念，为AI在医疗领域的应用提供了重要的安全警示。

Abstract: This study aims to simulate real-world clinical scenarios to systematically evaluate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract core medical information from patient chief complaints laden with noise and redundancy, and to verify whether they exhibit a functional decline analogous to Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD). We employed a cross-sectional analysis design based on standardized medical probes, selecting four mainstream LLMs as research subjects: GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5, DeepSeek 3.1, and Qwen3-Max. An evaluation system comprising twenty medical probes across five core dimensions was used to simulate a genuine clinical communication environment. All probes had gold-standard answers defined by clinical experts and were assessed via a double-blind, inverse rating scale by two independent clinicians. The results show that all tested models exhibited functional defects to varying degrees, with Qwen3-Max demonstrating the best overall performance and Gemini 2.5 the worst. Under conditions of extreme noise, most models experienced a functional collapse. Notably, GPT-4o made a severe misjudgment in the risk assessment for pulmonary embolism (PE) secondary to deep vein thrombosis (DVT). This research is the first to empirically confirm that LLMs exhibit features resembling metabolic dysfunction when processing clinical information, proposing the innovative concept of "AI-Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (AI-MASLD)". These findings offer a crucial safety warning for the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare, emphasizing that current LLMs must be used as auxiliary tools under human expert supervision, as there remains a significant gap between their theoretical knowledge and practical clinical application.

Abstract: Benchmarks are a cornerstone of modern machine learning, enabling reproducibility, comparison, and scientific progress. However, AI benchmarks are increasingly complex, requiring dynamic, AI-focused workflows. Rapid evolution in model architectures, scale, datasets, and deployment contexts makes evaluation a moving target. Large language models often memorize static benchmarks, causing a gap between benchmark results and real-world performance.
  Beyond traditional static benchmarks, continuous adaptive benchmarking frameworks are needed to align scientific assessment with deployment risks. This calls for skills and education in AI Benchmark Carpentry. From our experience with MLCommons, educational initiatives, and programs like the DOE's Trillion Parameter Consortium, key barriers include high resource demands, limited access to specialized hardware, lack of benchmark design expertise, and uncertainty in relating results to application domains. Current benchmarks often emphasize peak performance on top-tier hardware, offering limited guidance for diverse, real-world scenarios.
  Benchmarking must become dynamic, incorporating evolving models, updated data, and heterogeneous platforms while maintaining transparency, reproducibility, and interpretability. Democratization requires both technical innovation and systematic education across levels, building sustained expertise in benchmark design and use. Benchmarks should support application-relevant comparisons, enabling informed, context-sensitive decisions. Dynamic, inclusive benchmarking will ensure evaluation keeps pace with AI evolution and supports responsible, reproducible, and accessible AI deployment. Community efforts can provide a foundation for AI Benchmark Carpentry.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种结构因果模型和贝叶斯模型，用于预测能源需求，并在测试集上实现了3.84%的MAPE，表现出色且稳健。

Abstract: Energy demand prediction is critical for grid operators, industrial energy
  consumers, and service providers. Energy demand is influenced by multiple
  factors, including weather conditions (e.g. temperature, humidity, wind
  speed, solar radiation), and calendar information (e.g. hour of day and
  month of year), which further affect daily work and life schedules. These
  factors are causally interdependent, making the problem more complex than
  simple correlation-based learning techniques satisfactorily allow for. We
  propose a structural causal model that explains the causal relationship
  between these variables. A full analysis is performed to validate our causal
  beliefs, also revealing important insights consistent with prior studies.
  For example, our causal model reveals that energy demand responds to
  temperature fluctuations with season-dependent sensitivity. Additionally, we
  find that energy demand exhibits lower variance in winter due to the
  decoupling effect between temperature changes and daily activity patterns.
  We then build a Bayesian model, which takes advantage of the causal insights
  we learned as prior knowledge. The model is trained and tested on unseen
  data and yields state-of-the-art performance in the form of a 3.84 percent MAPE on
  the test set. The model also demonstrates strong robustness, as the
  cross-validation across two years of data yields an average MAPE of 3.88 percent.

Agentic AI methods, exemplified by TxAgent, address these challenges through iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). TxAgent employs a fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B model that dynamically generates and executes function calls to a unified biomedical tool suite (ToolUniverse), integrating FDA Drug API, OpenTargets, and Monarch resources to ensure access to current therapeutic information. In contrast to general-purpose RAG systems, medical applications impose stringent safety constraints, rendering the accuracy of both the reasoning trace and the sequence of tool invocations critical. These considerations motivate evaluation protocols treating token-level reasoning and tool-usage behaviors as explicit supervision signals. This work presents insights derived from our participation in the CURE-Bench NeurIPS 2025 Challenge, which benchmarks therapeutic-reasoning systems using metrics that assess correctness, tool utilization, and reasoning quality. We analyze how retrieval quality for function (tool) calls influences overall model performance and demonstrate performance gains achieved through improved tool-retrieval strategies. Our work was awarded the Excellence Award in Open Science. Complete information can be found at https://curebench.ai/.
