Yet existing approaches, modular or end-to-end, are deficient in manipulation-aware locomotion. This confines the robot to a limited workspace, preventing it from performing large-space loco-manipulation. We attribute this to: (1) the challenge of acquiring loco-manipulation knowledge due to the scarcity of humanoid teleoperation data, and (2) the difficulty of faithfully and reliably executing locomotion commands, stemming from the limited precision and stability of existing RL controllers. To acquire richer loco-manipulation knowledge, we propose a unified latent learning framework that enables Vision-Language-Action (VLA) system to learn from low-cost action-free egocentric videos. Moreover, an efficient human data collection pipeline is devised to augment the dataset and scale the benefits. To more precisely execute the desired locomotion commands, we present a loco-manipulation-oriented (LMO) RL policy specifically tailored for accurate and stable core loco-manipulation movements, such as advancing, turning, and squatting. Building on these components, we introduce WholeBodyVLA, a unified framework for humanoid loco-manipulation. To the best of our knowledge, WholeBodyVLA is one of its kind enabling large-space humanoid loco-manipulation. It is verified via comprehensive experiments on the AgiBot X2 humanoid, outperforming prior baseline by 21.3%.

To perform such tasks, humans use a range of different body parts or tools with different rigidity, friction, etc., according to the properties most effective for a given task. Here, we discuss a taxonomy for the key properties of a non-actuated end-effector, laying the groundwork for a systematic understanding of the affordances of non-prehensile manipulators. We then present a modular tool system, based on the taxonomy, that can be used by a standard two-fingered gripper to extend its versatility and effectiveness in performing such actions.

The proposed method simultaneously handles multiple position and velocity constraints through an explicit closed-form control law, eliminating the need to solve a Quadratic Program (QP) at every control step and enabling efficient real-time implementation. This letter derives necessary and sufficient conditions under which the closed-form expression remains non-singular, thereby ensuring well-posedness of the CBF solution to multi-constraint problem. The controller is validated in both simulation and hardware experiments on a custom-built Stewart platform prototype, demonstrating safetyguaranteed performance that is comparable to the QP-based formulation, while reducing computation time by more than an order of magnitude. The results confirm that the proposed approach provides a reliable and computationally lightweight framework for real-time safe control of parallel robotic systems.

Most of the RGB-based navigation systems only guarantee coarse, meter-level accuracy, making them less suitable for the precise positioning phase of mobile manipulation. This gap prevents manipulation policies from operating within the distribution of their training demonstrations, resulting in frequent execution failures. We address this gap by introducing an object-centric imitation learning framework for last-meter navigation, enabling a quadruped mobile manipulator robot to achieve manipulation-ready positioning using only RGB observations from its onboard cameras. Our method conditions the navigation policy on three inputs: goal images, multi-view RGB observations from the onboard cameras, and a text prompt specifying the target object. A language-driven segmentation module and a spatial score-matrix decoder then supply explicit object grounding and relative pose reasoning. Using real-world data from a single object instance within a category, the system generalizes to unseen object instances across diverse environments with challenging lighting and background conditions. To comprehensively evaluate this, we introduce two metrics: an edge-alignment metric, which uses ground truth orientation, and an object-alignment metric, which evaluates how well the robot visually faces the target. Under these metrics, our policy achieves 73.47% success in edge-alignment and 96.94% success in object-alignment when positioning relative to unseen target objects. These results show that precise last-meter navigation can be achieved at a category-level without depth, LiDAR, or map priors, enabling a scalable pathway toward unified mobile manipulation.

Similarity search, a fundamental operation that retrieves nodes similar to a given query node, plays a crucial role in various real-world applications, including machine learning and graph clustering. However, existing state-of-the-art methods often struggle to accurately capture the unique structural properties of bipartite graphs or fail to incorporate the informative node attributes, leading to suboptimal performance. Besides, their high computational complexity limits scalability, making them impractical for large graphs with millions of nodes and tens of thousands of attributes. To overcome these challenges, we first introduce Attribute-augmented Hidden Personalized PageRank (AHPP), a novel random walk model designed to blend seamlessly both the higher-order bipartite structure proximity and attribute similarity. We then formulate the similarity search over attributed bipartite graphs as an approximate AHPP problem and propose two efficient push-style local algorithms with provable approximation guarantees. Finally, extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of AHPP and the efficiency of our proposed algorithms when compared with fifteen competitors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAHPP\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u641c\u7d22\u4e2d\u7ed3\u6784\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u7ed3\u6784\u5c5e\u6027\u6216\u7ed3\u5408\u8282\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Attribute-augmented Hidden Personalized PageRank (AHPP)\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u9636\u4e8c\u5206\u7ed3\u6784\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684push-style\u5c40\u90e8\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "AHPP\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u641c\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "AHPP\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e15\u79cd\u7ade\u4e89\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Consequently, there is a growing need for more efficient testing methods. To reduce the burden on developers, various automated test generation tools have been developed, and several studies have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the tests they produce. However, most of these studies focus primarily on coverage metrics, and only a few examine how well the tests support fault localization-particularly using artificial faults introduced through mutation testing. In this study, we compare the SBFL (Spectrum-Based Fault Localization) score and code coverage of automatically generated tests with those of manually created tests. The SBFL score indicates how accurately faults can be localized using SBFL techniques. By employing SBFL score as an evaluation metric-an approach rarely used in prior studies on test generation-we aim to provide new insights into the respective strengths and weaknesses of manually created and automatically generated tests. Our experimental results show that automatically generated tests achieve higher branch coverage than manually created tests, but their SBFL score is lower, especially for code with deeply nested structures.

The frequency of such anomalies increases with network scale. However, existing fault-tolerance mechanisms, such as checkpointing and runtime resilience methods, primarily operate at the application layer and inevitably cause disruptions in training progress.\n  We propose to address this challenge by introducing fault tolerance at the Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) layer and integrating it with existing application-layer techniques. We present SHIFT, a fault-resilient layer over RDMA that enables seamless redirection of RDMA traffic across different intra-host NICs. By allowing applications to continue execution in the presence of network anomalies until the next checkpoint, SHIFT effectively minimizes training progress loss. SHIFT is designed to be application-agnostic, transparent to applications, and low-overhead.\n  Through a carefully designed failure state machine and control flow, unmodified applications such as PyTorch with NCCL can run with RDMA-level fault tolerance.

In the present scenario, most of the energy sources are limited and have a greenhouse effect on the environment.

To design the same, some researchers tried to maximize the average resource utilization, whereas some researchers tried to minimize the makespan. However, they have not considered different types of resources that are present in the physical machines. In this paper, we propose a task scheduling algorithm, which tries to improve utilization of resources (like CPU, disk, I/O) explicitly, which in turn increases the utilization of active resources. For this, the proposed algorithm uses a fitness value, which is a function of CPU, disk and I/O utilization, and processing time of the task.

Two key strategies are presented: Image Text Matching (ITM) guidance and Image Text fusion. ITM guidance trains the model to discern fine grained alignments between images and texts to obtain enhanced multimodal representations. Image text fusion combines both modalities into comprehensive representations for improved fairness. Exensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate these approaches effectively mitigate bias and improve accuracy across gender racial groups compared to existing methods. Additionally, the unique integration of textual guidance underscores an interpretable and intuitive training paradigm for computer vision systems. By scrutinizing the extent to which semantic information reduces disparities, this research offers valuable insights into cultivating more equitable facial analysis algorithms. The proposed methodologies contribute to addressing the pivotal challenge of demographic bias in gender classification from facial images.

We propose WildCap, a novel method for high-quality facial appearance capture from a smartphone video recorded in the wild. To disentangle high-quality reflectance from complex lighting effects in in-the-wild captures, we propose a novel hybrid inverse rendering framework. Specifically, we first apply a data-driven method, i.e., SwitchLight, to convert the captured images into more constrained conditions and then adopt model-based inverse rendering. However, unavoidable local artifacts in network predictions, such as shadow-baking, are non-physical and thus hinder accurate inverse rendering of lighting and material. To address this, we propose a novel texel grid lighting model to explain non-physical effects as clean albedo illuminated by local physical lighting. During optimization, we jointly sample a diffusion prior for reflectance maps and optimize the lighting, effectively resolving scale ambiguity between local lights and albedo. Our method achieves significantly better results than prior arts in the same capture setup, closing the quality gap between in-the-wild and controllable recordings by a large margin.

While co-training with external reasoning data helps, it requires experienced tuning and data-related overhead. Beyond such external dependencies, we identify an intrinsic cause within VLA datasets: modality imbalance, where language diversity is much lower than visual and action diversity. This imbalance biases the model toward visual shortcuts and language forgetting. To address this, we introduce BayesVLA, a Bayesian factorization that decomposes the policy into a visual-action prior, supporting seeing-to-act, and a language-conditioned likelihood, enabling prompt-to-specify. This inherently preserves generalization and promotes instruction following. We further incorporate pre- and post-contact phases to better leverage pre-trained foundation models. Information-theoretic analysis formally validates our effectiveness in mitigating shortcut learning.

While this is a well established concept for strings, in the context of tries the state-of-the-art regarding entropies is less developed. The standard trie worst-case entropy considers the set of tries with a fixed number of nodes and alphabet size. However, this approach does not consider the frequencies of the symbols in the trie, thus failing to capture the compressibility of tries with skewed character distributions. On the other hand, the label entropy [FOCS '05], proposed for node-labeled trees, does not take into account the tree topology, which has to be stored separately. In this paper, we introduce two new entropy measures for tries - worst-case and empirical - which overcome the two aforementioned limitations. Notably, our entropies satisfy similar properties of their string counterparts, thereby becoming very natural generalizations of the (simpler) string case. Indeed, our empirical entropy is closely related to the worst-case entropy and is reachable through a natural extension of arithmetic coding from strings to tries. Moreover we show that, similarly to the FM-index for strings [JACM '05], the XBWT of a trie can be compressed and efficiently indexed within our k-th order empirical entropy plus o(n) bits, with n being the number of nodes. Interestingly, the space usage of this encoding includes the trie topology and the upper-bound holds for every k sufficiently small, simultaneously.

However, existing LLMs face several challenges when generating Verilog code for finite state machine (FSM) control logic, including frequent syntax errors, low debugging efficiency, and heavy reliance on test benchmarks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes AutoFSM, a multi-agent collaborative framework designed for FSM code generation tasks. AutoFSM introduces a structurally clear intermediate representation (IR) to reduce syntax error rate during code generation and provides a supporting toolchain to enable automatic translation from IR to Verilog. Furthermore, AutoFSM is the first to integrate SystemC-based modeling with automatic testbench generation, thereby improving debugging efficiency and feedback quality. To systematically evaluate the framework's performance, we construct SKT-FSM, the first hierarchical FSM benchmark in the field, comprising 67 FSM samples across different complexity levels. Experimental results show that, under the same base LLM, AutoFSM consistently outperforms the open-source framework MAGE on the SKT-FSM benchmark, achieving up to an 11.94% improvement in pass rate and up to a 17.62% reduction in syntax error rate.

These networks increasingly need a scalable and efficient multicast protocol for critical applications like emergency alerts, large-scale software updates, and real-time broadcasting. However, traditional multicast protocols, such as IP-based multicast and software-defined multicast approaches, introduce significant control overhead and struggle to adapt to the dynamic and mobile nature of satellite topologies. This paper presents BIER-Star, a stateless multicast protocol designed for the integrated TN-NTN. BIER-Star uses a two-layer geospatial gridding scheme (i.e., H3) to encode destinations as Earth- and space-cell identifiers rather than per-terminal addresses. This cell-based abstraction shortens the header bitstring, simplifies forwarding, and eliminates per-flow state and complex signaling. Our simulations indicate that BIER-Star reduces header size versus BIER and avoids geographic path-finding failures seen in greedy methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "BIER-Star\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5730\u7406\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u591a\u64ad\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u536b\u661f\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a7\u5236\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "LEO\u536b\u661f\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6269\u5f20\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u591a\u64ad\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u534f\u8bae\u56e0\u63a7\u5236\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u62d3\u6251\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u5c42\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f51\u683c\u65b9\u6848\uff08H3\uff09\u5c06\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u5730\u7403\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5355\u5143\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7ec8\u7aef\u5730\u5740\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7f29\u77ed\u5934\u90e8\u6bd4\u7279\u4e32\u5e76\u7b80\u5316\u8f6c\u53d1\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\uff0cBIER-Star\u76f8\u6bd4BIER\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5934\u90e8\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u8d2a\u5a6a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5730\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u67e5\u627e\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "conclusion": "BIER-Star\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9TN-NTN\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u591a\u64ad\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f51\u683c\u65b9\u6848\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u63a7\u5236\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

However, efficient combinatorial bundling of transporation jobs remains a bottleneck. We model the OFEX combinatorial bundling problem as a multi-commodity one-to-one pickup-and-delivery selective traveling salesperson problem (m1-PDSTSP), which optimizes revenue-driven freight bundling under capacity, precedence, and route-length constraints. The key challenge is to couple combinatorial bundle selection with pickup-and-delivery routing under sub-second latency. We propose a learning--accelerated hybrid search pipeline that pairs a Transformer Neural Network-based constructive policy with an innovative Multi-Start Large Neighborhood Search (MSLNS) metaheuristic within a rolling-horizon scheme in which the platform repeatedly freezes the current marketplace into a static snapshot and solves it under a short time budget. This pairing leverages the low-latency, high-quality inference of the learning-based constructor alongside the robustness of improvement search; the multi-start design and plausible seeds help LNS to explore the solution space more efficiently. Across benchmarks, our method outperforms state-of-the-art neural combinatorial optimization and metaheuristic baselines in solution quality with comparable time, achieving an optimality gap of less than 2\\% in total revenue relative to the best available exact baseline method.

The data, code, and model will be publicly available.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u8db3\u7403\u4e13\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578bSoccerMaster\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u516c\u5f00\u3002", "motivation": "\u8db3\u7403\u7406\u89e3\u56e0\u5176\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\u800c\u53d7\u5230\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u4ece\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5230\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8db3\u7403\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SoccerMaster\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5f0f\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8db3\u7403\u4e13\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u6574\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u8db3\u7403\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6574\u5408\u6784\u5efa\u4e86SoccerFactory\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "result": "SoccerMaster\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "SoccerMaster\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u8db3\u7403\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002\u6570\u636e\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u516c\u5f00\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002"}}

Its design is specifically aimed at addressing pragmatic challenges, such as changing light, random orientation, curvature or partial coverage of text, low resolution, and slightly visible text. The steps of the processing process are divided into four steps: image acquisition and preprocessing, textual elements detection with the help of DBNet++ (Differentiable Binarization Network Plus) model, BART (Bidirectional Auto-Regressive Transformers) model that classifies detected textual elements, and the presentation of the results through a user interface written in Python and PyQt5. All the stages are connected in such a way that they form a smooth workflow. The system achieved a text recognition rate of about 94.62% when tested over ten hours on the mentioned Total-Text dataset, that includes high resolution images, created so as to represent a wide range of problematic conditions.

A connected graph is said to be strongly conflict-free vertex-connection $k$-colorable if it admits a (proper) vertex $k$-coloring such that any two distinct vertices are connected by a conflict-free shortest path. Among others, we show that deciding, for a given graph $G$ and an integer $k$, whether $G$ is strongly conflict-free $k$-colorable is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the vertex cover number. But under the standard complexity-theoretic assumption NP $\\not\\subseteq$ coNP/poly, deciding, for a given graph $G$, whether $G$ is strongly conflict-free $3$-colorable does not admit a polynomial kernel, even for bipartite graphs.

This paper investigates the efficacy of 19 small, quantized LLMs (under 20 billion parameters) for the C to Java translation task. We use a novel, hybrid pipeline that leverages Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) for semantic decomposition and employs a highly constrained, rule based prompting strategy. The results are stark: a clear multi tiered performance divide emerged. The vast majority of models (Tier 3, e.g., llama3.1, gemma3, starcoder2) failed 100\\% of the tests, proving incapable of generating even basic, runnable Java boilerplate.

Recent work demonstrates that techniques such as repeated sampling, self-verification, and self-reflection can significantly enhance task success by allocating more inference-time compute. However, applying these techniques across multiple agents in a multi-agent system is difficult: there does not exist principled mechanisms to allocate compute to foster collaboration among agents, to extend test-time scaling to collaborative interactions, or to distribute compute across agents under explicit budget constraints. To address this gap, we propose FutureWeaver, a framework for planning and optimizing test-time compute allocation in multi-agent systems under fixed budgets. FutureWeaver introduces modularized collaboration, formalized as callable functions that encapsulate reusable multi-agent workflows. These modules are automatically derived through self-play reflection by abstracting recurring interaction patterns from past trajectories. Building on these modules, FutureWeaver employs a dual-level planning architecture that optimizes compute allocation by reasoning over the current task state while also speculating on future steps. Experiments on complex agent benchmarks demonstrate that FutureWeaver consistently outperforms baselines across diverse budget settings, validating its effectiveness for multi-agent collaboration in inference-time optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "FutureWeaver\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u53cc\u7ea7\u89c4\u5212\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u539f\u5219\u6027\u673a\u5236\u6765\u5206\u914d\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u6216\u6269\u5c55\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5230\u534f\u4f5c\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FutureWeaver\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u534f\u4f5c\uff08\u53ef\u8c03\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u5c01\u88c5\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff09\u548c\u53cc\u7ea7\u89c4\u5212\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u4efb\u52a1\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u672a\u6765\u6b65\u9aa4\u63a8\u6d4b\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u914d\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFutureWeaver\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u7b97\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FutureWeaver\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u53cc\u7ea7\u89c4\u5212\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging serves as an accessible and cost-effective diagnostic tool but requires expert interpretation, which is often unavailable. Although machine learning models have shown high performance in TB classification, they often depend on spurious correlations and fail to generalize. Besides, building large datasets featuring high-quality annotations for medical images demands substantial resources and input from domain specialists, and typically involves several annotators reaching agreement, which results in enormous financial and logistical expenses. This study repurposes knowledge distillation technique to train CNN models reducing spurious correlations and localize TB-related abnormalities without requiring bounding-box annotations.

We train the network end-to-end on a diverse collection of articulated 3D assets from public datasets. During inference, Particulate lifts the network's feed-forward prediction to the input mesh, yielding a fully articulated 3D model in seconds, much faster than prior approaches that require per-object optimization. Particulate can also accurately infer the articulated structure of AI-generated 3D assets, enabling full-fledged extraction of articulated 3D objects from a single (real or synthetic) image when combined with an off-the-shelf image-to-3D generator. We further introduce a new challenging benchmark for 3D articulation estimation curated from high-quality public 3D assets, and redesign the evaluation protocol to be more consistent with human preferences.

The reduced PMP model provides a closed-form optimal control law for the joint accelerations, while the Gradient Descent module determines the corresponding time horizons by minimizing a cost functional built directly from the full Rigid-Body Dynamics. Structural-mechanics reaction analysis is used only to initialize feasible joint velocities-most critically the azimuthal component-ensuring that the optimizer begins in a physically admissible region. The resulting kinematic trajectories and dynamically consistent time horizons are then supplied to the symbolic Euler-Lagrange model to yield closed-form inverse-dynamics inputs.

However, despite their promising capabilities, CodeLLMs can inadvertently memorize and reproduce snippets from their training data, which poses risks of privacy breaches and intellectual property violations. These risks restrict the deployment of CodeLLMs in sensitive domains and limit their training datasets to publicly available sources. To mitigate the memorization risk without compromising their task performance, we apply Differential Privacy (DP) to CodeLLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that systematically evaluates the effectiveness of DP in CodeLLMs. DP adds calibrated noise to the training process to protect individual data points while still allowing the model to learn useful patterns. To this end, we first identify and understand the driving reasons of the memorization behaviour of the CodeLLMs during their fine-tuning. Then, to address this issue, we empirically evaluate the effect of DP on mitigating memorization while preserving code generation capabilities. Our findings show that DP substantially reduces memorization in CodeLLMs across all the tested snippet types. The snippet types most prone to memorization are also the most effectively mitigated by DP. Furthermore, we observe that DP slightly increases perplexity but preserves, and can even enhance, the code generation capabilities of CodeLLMs, which makes it feasible to apply DP in practice without significantly compromising model utility. Finally, we analyze the impact of DP on training efficiency and energy consumption, finding that DP does not significantly affect training time or energy usage, making it a practical choice for privacy-preserving CodeLLMs training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff08DP\uff09\u5728CodeLLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0DP\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8bb0\u5fc6\u884c\u4e3a\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "CodeLLMs\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e76\u91cd\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5e94\u7528\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff08DP\uff09\u5230CodeLLMs\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u6821\u51c6\u566a\u58f0\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e2a\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u3002", "result": "DP\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7247\u6bb5\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "DP\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86CodeLLMs\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u5927\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u4e3a\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a scalable and QoE-aware multi-stage optimization framework for resource allocation in VR-CG over 6G networks. Our solution decomposes the joint resource allocation problem into three interdependent stages: (i) user association and communication resource allocation; (ii) VR-CG game engine placement with adaptive multipath routing; and (iii) attention-aware scheduling and wireless resource allocation based on motion-to-photon latency. For each stage, we design specialized heuristic algorithms that achieve near-optimal performance while significantly reducing computational time. We introduce a novel user-centric QoE model based on visual attention to virtual objects, guiding adaptive resolution and frame rate selection. A dataset-driven evaluation demonstrates that, when compared against state-of-the-art approaches, our framework improves QoE by up to 50\\%, reduces communication resource usage by 75\\%, and achieves up to 35\\% cost savings, while maintaining an average optimality gap of 5\\%.

This inefficiency is largely caused by fragmentation, heterogeneous workloads, and the limitations of static scheduling policies. This work presents a systematic evaluation of these issues and introduces three specialized dynamic schedulers: Hybrid Priority (HPS), Predictive Backfill (PBS), and Smart Batch (SBS). These schedulers are designed to improve utilization, fairness, and overall throughput in multi-tenant GPU clusters. We evaluate all schedulers using a controlled simulation of 1,000 AI jobs on a 64-GPU, 8-node cluster that includes a realistic mix of training, inference, and research workloads. Static baselines (FIFO, SJF, Shortest, Shortest-GPU) achieve 45 to 67% GPU utilization and 12.5 to 18.3 jobs per hour and experience severe starvation, with as many as 156 jobs waiting longer than 30 minutes. The dynamic schedulers significantly outperform these policies. HPS achieves the highest utilization (78.2%), highest throughput (25.8 jobs per hour), and the lowest fairness variance among dynamic methods (457), reducing starvation to 12 jobs. PBS improves fragmentation handling and reaches 76.1% utilization, while SBS increases efficiency for structurally similar jobs and reaches 74.6% utilization. Across all key metrics, including throughput, job wait times, fairness variance, and starvation, dynamic multi-objective schedulers consistently outperform single-objective heuristics.

Automating this process is challenging due to modeling errors, fragile code, and misaligned objectives, which often impede policy training. We introduce an agentic large language model (LLM)-based framework for automated MDP modeling and policy generation (A-LAMP), that automatically translates free-form natural language task descriptions into an MDP formulation and trained policy. The framework decomposes modeling, coding, and training into verifiable stages, ensuring semantic alignment throughout the pipeline. Across both classic control and custom RL domains, A-LAMP consistently achieves higher policy generation capability than a single state-of-the-art LLM model. Notably, even its lightweight variant, which is built on smaller language models, approaches the performance of much larger models. Failure analysis reveals why these improvements occur.

To overcome this bottleneck, we introduce Synthetic Vasculature Reasoning (SVR), a framework that controllably synthesizes images and corresponding text, specifically: realistic retinal vasculature with Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) features: capillary dropout, microaneurysms, neovascularization, and tortuosity, while automatically generating granular reasoning texts.

However, it relies on simplified, order-dependent alpha blending and coarse approximations of the density integral within the rasterizer, thereby limiting its ability to render complex, overlapping semi-transparent objects. In this paper, we extend rasterization-based rendering of 3D Gaussian representations with a novel method for high-fidelity transmittance computation, entirely avoiding the need for ray tracing or per-pixel sample sorting. Building on prior work in moment-based order-independent transparency, our key idea is to characterize the density distribution along each camera ray with a compact and continuous representation based on statistical moments. To this end, we analytically derive and compute a set of per-pixel moments from all contributing 3D Gaussians. From these moments, a continuous transmittance function is reconstructed for each ray, which is then independently sampled within each Gaussian. As a result, our method bridges the gap between rasterization and physical accuracy by modeling light attenuation in complex translucent media, significantly improving overall reconstruction and rendering quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u77e9\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u900f\u5c04\u7387\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u5728\u590d\u6742\u534a\u900f\u660e\u7269\u4f53\u6e32\u67d3\u4e2d\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff083DGS\uff09\u867d\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6e32\u67d3\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8f90\u5c04\u573a\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u3001\u987a\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684alpha\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u7c97\u7cd9\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u79ef\u5206\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u534a\u900f\u660e\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u77e9\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u900f\u5c04\u7387\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5149\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6216\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u5bfc\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u4e2a\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u77e9\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u8fde\u7eed\u900f\u5c04\u7387\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u534a\u900f\u660e\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2d\u7684\u5149\u8870\u51cf\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u77e9\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u900f\u5c04\u7387\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u534a\u900f\u660e\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5149\u6805\u5316\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

They often violate physical and logical rules, lack interactivity, and operate as opaque black boxes ill-suited for building structured, queryable worlds. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new paradigm focused on distilling an image caption pair into a tractable, abstract representation optimized for simulation. We introduce VDAWorld, a framework where a Vision-Language Model (VLM) acts as an intelligent agent to orchestrate this process. The VLM autonomously constructs a grounded (2D or 3D) scene representation by selecting from a suite of vision tools, and accordingly chooses a compatible physics simulator (e.g., rigid body, fluid) to act upon it. VDAWorld can then infer latent dynamics from the static scene to predict plausible future states. Our experiments show that this combination of intelligent abstraction and adaptive simulation results in a versatile world model capable of producing high quality simulations across a wide range of dynamic scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "VDAWorld\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528VLM\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u903b\u8f91\u89c4\u5219\u8fdd\u53cd\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u53ca\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVDAWorld\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u89c6\u89c9\u5de5\u5177\u6784\u5efa\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVDAWorld\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "conclusion": "VDAWorld\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u667a\u80fd\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Scenario-based testing is a prominent approach to addressing this challenge, as it involves the systematic simulation of objects and environments. Operational Design Domains (ODDs) are usually described using a taxonomy of qualitative designations for individual objects. However, the process of transitioning from taxonomy to concrete test cases remains unstructured, and completeness is theoretical. This paper introduces a structured method of subdividing the ODD into manageable sections, termed micro-ODDs (mODDs), and deriving test cases with abstract object representations. This concept is demonstrated using a one-dimensional, laterally guided manoeuvre involving a shunting locomotive within a constrained ODD. In this example, mODDs are defined and refined into narrow taxonomies that enable test case generation. Obstacles are represented as generic cubes of varying sizes, providing a simplified yet robust means of evaluating perception performance. A series of tests were conducted in a closed-loop, co-simulated virtual environment featuring photorealistic rendering and simulated LiDAR, GNSS and camera sensors. The results demonstrate how edge cases in obstacle detection can be systematically explored and how perception quality can be evaluated based on observed vehicle behaviour, using crash versus safe stop as the outcome metrics. These findings support the development of a standardised framework for safety argumentation and offer a practical step towards the validation and authorisation of automated driving functions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06ODD\u7ec6\u5206\u4e3amODD\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u865a\u62df\u73af\u5883\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7d22\u8fb9\u7f18\u6848\u4f8b\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4ece\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u5230\u5177\u4f53\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u8f6c\u6362\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u65e0\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u573a\u666f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06ODD\u7ec6\u5206\u4e3amODD\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u8868\u793a\u969c\u788d\u7269\u3002\u5728\u95ed\u73af\u5171\u6a21\u62df\u865a\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5149\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff08LiDAR\u3001GNSS\u3001\u6444\u50cf\u5934\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u969c\u788d\u7269\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u78b0\u649e\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u505c\u6b62\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57df\uff08ODD\uff09\u7ec6\u5206\u4e3a\u5fae\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57df\uff08mODD\uff09\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u62bd\u8c61\u5bf9\u8c61\u8868\u793a\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u63a2\u7d22\u969c\u788d\u7269\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f66\u8f86\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u6388\u6743\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002"}}

We find that agents often import libraries (29.5% of PRs) but rarely add new dependencies (1.3% of PRs); and when they do, they follow strong versioning practices (75.0% specify a version), an improvement on direct LLM usage where versions are rarely mentioned.

Yet, modern AI models routinely exceed the resource capacity of individual devices, necessitating distributed execution across heterogeneous devices over variable and contention prone networks. Existing planners for hybrid (e.g., data and pipeline) parallelism largely optimize for throughput or device utilization, overlooking QoE, leading to severe resource inefficiency (e.g., unnecessary energy drain) or QoE violations under runtime dynamics.\n  We present Dora, a framework for QoE aware hybrid parallelism in distributed edge AI training and inference. Dora jointly optimizes heterogeneous computation, contention prone networks, and multi dimensional QoE objectives via three key mechanisms: (i) a heterogeneity aware model partitioner that determines and assigns model partitions across devices, forming a compact set of QoE compliant plans; (ii) a contention aware network scheduler that further refines these candidate plans by maximizing compute communication overlap; and (iii) a runtime adapter that adaptively composes multiple plans to maximize global efficiency while respecting overall QoEs. Across representative edge deployments, including smart homes, traffic analytics, and small edge clusters, Dora achieves 1.1--6.3 times faster execution and, alternatively, reduces energy consumption by 21--82 percent, all while maintaining QoE under runtime dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Dora\u662f\u4e00\u4e2aQoE\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5e76\u884c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u548cQoE\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6216\u8bbe\u5907\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86QoE\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u6216QoE\u8fdd\u89c4\u3002", "method": "Dora\u91c7\u7528\u5f02\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u533a\u5668\u3001\u7ade\u4e89\u611f\u77e5\u7f51\u7edc\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9002\u914d\u5668\u4e09\u79cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u548cQoE\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u5c45\u3001\u4ea4\u901a\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5c0f\u578b\u8fb9\u7f18\u96c6\u7fa4\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cDora\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e861.1-6.3\u500d\u7684\u6267\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u621621-82%\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "Dora\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u533a\u3001\u7ade\u4e89\u611f\u77e5\u7f51\u7edc\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u80fd\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86QoE\u3002"}}

From traditional methods of manually observing the city's inhabitant, to using cameras, to now using sensors and more complex technology, the field of urban monitoring has evolved greatly. Still, there are more that can be done to unlock better practices for understanding city dynamics. This paper surveys how the landscape of urban dynamics studying has evolved with a particular focus on event-based cameras. Event-based cameras capture changes in light intensity instead of the RGB values that traditional cameras do. They offer unique abilities, like the ability to work in low-light, that can make them advantageous compared to other sensors. Through an analysis of event-based cameras, their applications, their advantages and challenges, and machine learning applications, we propose event-based cameras as a medium for capturing information to study urban dynamics. They offer the ability to capture important information while maintaining privacy. We also suggest multi-sensor fusion of event-based cameras and other sensors in the study of urban dynamics.

We establish theoretical foundations for three complementary approaches to GPU-native compilation that eliminate these transfers: (1) parallel traditional compilation adapted for GPU execution, (2) neural compilation using learned sequence-to-sequence translation with probabilistic verification, and (3) hybrid architectures combining both strategies. We derive latency and energy bounds demonstrating potential speedups of 10-100x for code iteration cycles. Our analysis shows that traditional GPU compilation provides 2-5x improvements through transfer elimination, neural compilation achieves 10-100x speedups via massive parallelism, and hybrid approaches offer practical deployment paths with guaranteed correctness.

Infrared cameras provide complementary advantages in such environments. Simultaneously, supervised AI systems require large labeled datasets, which makes zero-shot learning frameworks more practical for applications including infrared cameras. Recent advances in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) offer a new path in zero-shot predictions from paired image-text representations. However, current VLMs cannot understand infrared camera data since they are trained on RGB data. This work introduces VLM-IRIS (Vision-Language Models for InfraRed Industrial Sensing), a zero-shot framework that adapts VLMs to infrared data by preprocessing infrared images captured by a FLIR Boson sensor into RGB-compatible inputs suitable for CLIP-based encoders. We demonstrate zero-shot workpiece presence detection on a 3D printer bed where temperature differences between the build plate and workpieces make the task well-suited for thermal imaging. VLM-IRIS converts the infrared images to magma representation and applies centroid prompt ensembling with a CLIP ViT-B/32 encoder to achieve high accuracy on infrared images without any model retraining.

Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) are particularly at risk, especially in urban environments where they are often occluded by parked vehicles or buildings. Autonomous Driving (AD) and Collective Perception (CP) are promising solutions to mitigate these risks. In particular, infrastructure-assisted CP, where sensor units are mounted on infrastructure elements such as traffic lights or lamp posts, can help overcome perceptual limitations by providing enhanced points of view, which significantly reduces occlusions. To encourage decision makers to adopt this technology, comprehensive studies and datasets demonstrating safety improvements for VRUs are essential. In this paper, we propose a framework for evaluating the safety improvement by infrastructure-based CP specifically targeted at VRUs including a dataset with safety-critical EuroNCAP scenarios (CarlaNCAP) with 11k frames. Using this dataset, we conduct an in-depth simulation study and demonstrate that infrastructure-assisted CP can significantly reduce accident rates in safety-critical scenarios, achieving up to 100% accident avoidance compared to a vehicle equipped with sensors with only 33%.

However, the strict synchronization required by on-policy algorithms introduces severe dependency bubbles, forcing one cluster to idle while the dependent phase is running on the other. We present RollMux, a cluster scheduling framework that reclaims these bubbles through cross-cluster orchestration. RollMux is built on the insight that the structural idleness of one job can be effectively utilized by the active phase of another. To realize this, we introduce the co-execution group abstraction, which partitions the cluster into isolated locality domains. This abstraction enables a two-tier scheduling architecture: an inter-group scheduler that optimizes job placement using conservative stochastic planning, and an intra-group scheduler that orchestrates a provably optimal round-robin schedule.

While recent work improves MAS cost-effectiveness by shaping inter-agent communication topologies and selecting agent backbones, it rarely models and optimizes under explicit token-cost and latency budgets that reflect deployment constraints. This often leads to topology-first designs and suboptimal cost-effectiveness when budgets are binding. We present AgentBalance, a framework for constructing cost-effective MAS under explicit token-cost and latency budgets via a backbone-then-topology design. AgentBalance first performs backbone-oriented agent generation, constructing agents with heterogeneous backbones through LLM pool construction, pool selection, and role-backbone matching. It then performs adaptive MAS topology generation, guiding inter-agent communication via agent representation learning, gating, and latency-aware topology synthesis. Experiments on benchmarks with 14 candidate LLM backbones show that AgentBalance achieves up to 10% and 22% performance gains under matched token-cost and latency budgets, respectively, and yields strong AUC on performance-versus-budget curves across benchmarks. AgentBalance also functions as a plug-in for existing MAS, improving performance under the same token-cost and latency constraints, and it generalizes well to unseen LLMs for practical, budget-aware deployment.

In contrast, we propose VGent, a modular encoder-decoder architecture that explicitly disentangles high-level reasoning and low-level bounding box prediction. Specifically, a frozen MLLM serves as the encoder to provide untouched powerful reasoning capabilities, while a decoder takes high-quality boxes proposed by detectors as queries and selects target box(es) via cross-attending on encoder's hidden states. This design fully leverages advances in both object detection and MLLM, avoids the pitfalls of auto-regressive decoding, and enables fast inference. Moreover, it supports modular upgrades of both the encoder and decoder to benefit the whole system: we introduce (i) QuadThinker, an RL-based training paradigm for enhancing multi-target reasoning ability of the encoder; (ii) mask-aware label for resolving detection-segmentation ambiguity; and (iii) global target recognition to improve the recognition of all the targets which benefits the selection among augmented proposals.

Previous TAMP algorithms have focused mainly on computational performance, completeness, or optimality by making the problem tractable through simplifications and abstractions. However, this comes at the cost of the resulting plans potentially failing to account for the dynamics or complex contacts necessary to reliably perform the task when object manipulation is required. Additionally, approaches that ignore effects of the low-level controllers may not obtain optimal or feasible plan realizations for the real system. We investigate the use of a GPU-parallelized physics simulator to compute realizations of plans with motion controllers, explicitly accounting for dynamics, and considering contacts with the environment. Using cross-entropy optimization, we sample the parameters of the controllers, or actions, to obtain low-cost solutions. Since our approach uses the same controllers as the real system, the robot can directly execute the computed plans. We demonstrate our approach for a set of tasks where the robot is able to exploit the environment's geometry to move an object.

Existing distributed approximation techniques, such as pruning, often fail to fully mitigate the cost of exchanging numerous data packets in large network settings. In this paper, we introduce a novel enhancement to the distributed pruning method specifically designed to overcome this communication bottleneck. Our core contribution is a technique that leverages multi-packet messaging, allowing nodes to batch and transmit larger, consolidated data blocks. This approach significantly reduces the number of exchanged messages and minimizes data loss without compromising the accuracy of the centrality estimates. We demonstrate that our multi-packet approach substantially outperforms the original pruning technique in both message efficiency (fewer overall messages) and computation time, preserving the core approximation properties of the baseline method. While we observe a manageable trade-off in increased per-node memory usage and local overhead, our findings show that this is outweighed by the gains in communication efficiency, particularly for very large networks and complex packet structures. Our work offers a more scalable and efficient solution for decentralized closeness centrality computation, promising a significant step forward for large-scale network analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4fee\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5305\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u6280\u672f\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7531\u4e8e\u9ad8\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u800c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982\u4fee\u526a\uff09\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u964d\u4f4e\u5927\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4ea4\u6362\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5305\u7684\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u5305\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u8282\u70b9\u6279\u91cf\u4f20\u8f93\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5757\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u6570\u91cf\u5e76\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6570\u636e\u4e22\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u5305\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6d88\u606f\u6548\u7387\uff08\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u603b\u4f53\u6d88\u606f\uff09\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u4fee\u526a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7279\u6027\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u672c\u5730\u5f00\u9500\u6709\u6240\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u5e38\u5927\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5305\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u6298\u8877\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4fee\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5305\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u6280\u672f\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6d88\u606f\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u4fee\u526a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

These metrics rely on a baseline function to alter the pixels of the input image that the attribution map deems most important. In this work, we highlight a critical problem with these metrics: the choice of a given baseline will inevitably favour certain attribution methods over others. More concerningly, even a simple linear model with commonly used baselines contradicts itself by designating different optimal methods. A question then arises: which baseline should we use? We propose to study this problem through two desirable properties of a baseline: (i) that it removes information and (ii) that it does not produce overly out-of-distribution (OOD) images. We first show that none of the tested baselines satisfy both criteria, and there appears to be a trade-off among current baselines: either they remove information or they produce a sequence of OOD images. Finally, we introduce a novel baseline by leveraging recent work in feature visualisation to artificially produce a model-dependent baseline that removes information without being overly OOD, thus improving on the trade-off when compared to other existing baselines.

In this study, we propose an information-driven, intelligent fusion strategy for integrating multiple pathology FMs into a unified representation and systematically evaluate its performance for cancer grading and staging across three distinct diseases. Diagnostic H&E whole-slide images from kidney (519 slides), prostate (490 slides), and rectal (200 slides) cancers were dichotomized into low versus high grade or stage. Both tile-level FMs (Conch v1.5, MUSK, Virchow2, H-Optimus1, Prov-Gigapath) and slide-level FMs (TITAN, CHIEF, MADELEINE) were considered to train downstream classifiers. We then evaluated three FM fusion schemes at both tile and slide levels: majority-vote ensembling, naive feature concatenation, and intelligent fusion based on correlation-guided pruning of redundant features. Under patient-stratified cross-validation with hold-out testing, intelligent fusion of tile-level embeddings yielded consistent gains in classification performance across all three cancers compared with the best single FMs and naive fusion. Global similarity metrics revealed substantial alignment of FM embedding spaces, contrasted by lower local neighborhood agreement, indicating complementary fine-grained information across FMs. Attention maps showed that intelligent fusion yielded concentrated attention on tumor regions while reducing spurious focus on benign regions.

Although some studies have attempted to bridge this gap using reinforcement learning, they remain confined to merely reproducing human manipulation, resulting in limited task performance. In this paper, we propose UniBYD, a unified framework that uses a dynamic reinforcement learning algorithm to discover manipulation policies aligned with the robot's physical characteristics. To enable consistent modeling across diverse robotic hand morphologies, UniBYD incorporates a unified morphological representation (UMR). Building on UMR, we design a dynamic PPO with an annealed reward schedule, enabling reinforcement learning to transition from imitation of human demonstrations to explore policies adapted to diverse robotic morphologies better, thereby going beyond mere imitation of human hands. To address the frequent failures of learning human priors in the early training stage, we design a hybrid Markov-based shadow engine that enables reinforcement learning to imitate human manipulations in a fine-grained manner. To evaluate UniBYD comprehensively, we propose UniManip, the first benchmark encompassing robotic manipulation tasks spanning multiple hand morphologies. Experiments demonstrate a 67.90% improvement in success rate over the current state-of-the-art.

Although many devices include specialized accelerators (e.g., mobile GPUs), dynamic control-flow operators and unsupported kernels often fall back to CPU execution. Existing frameworks handle these fallbacks poorly, leaving CPU cores idle and causing high latency and memory spikes. We introduce Parallax, a framework that accelerates mobile DNN inference without model refactoring or custom operator implementations. Parallax first partitions the computation DAG to expose parallelism, then employs branch-aware memory management with dedicated arenas and buffer reuse to reduce runtime footprint. An adaptive scheduler executes branches according to device memory constraints, meanwhile, fine-grained subgraph control enables heterogeneous inference of dynamic models. By evaluating on five representative DNNs across three different mobile devices, Parallax achieves up to 46% latency reduction, maintains controlled memory overhead (26.5% on average), and delivers up to 30% energy savings compared with state-of-the-art frameworks, offering improvements aligned with the responsiveness demands of real-time mobile inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "Parallax\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u5206\u533a\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u79fb\u52a8DNN\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u65f6DNN\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u548c\u672a\u652f\u6301\u5185\u6838\u7684\u5904\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4CPU\u95f2\u7f6e\u3001\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5cf0\u503c\u3002", "method": "Parallax\u9996\u5148\u5206\u533a\u8ba1\u7b97DAG\u4ee5\u66b4\u9732\u5e76\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u652f\u611f\u77e5\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\uff08\u4e13\u7528\u5185\u5b58\u6c60\u548c\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u91cd\u7528\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b50\u56fe\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f02\u6784\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e94\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027DNN\uff0cParallax\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe46%\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u3001\u5e73\u574726.5%\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca30%\u7684\u8282\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Parallax\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u533a\u8ba1\u7b97DAG\u3001\u5206\u652f\u611f\u77e5\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0aDNN\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u8282\u80fd\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

LEGO converts this unsupervised challenge into a tractable pseudo-supervised one. First, we obtain initial restorations from the pre-trained model. Second, we leverage a frozen, large-scale generative oracle to refine these estimates into high-quality pseudo-ground-truths. Third, we fine-tune the original model using a mixed-supervision strategy combining in-distribution data with these new pseudo-pairs.

Classic Artificial Intelligence techniques for this purpose, focusing on symbolic approaches, have long-ago hit the scalability wall on compute and memory costs. Advances in Large Language Models in the past decade (neural approaches) have resulted in unprecedented displays of capability, at the cost of control, explainability, and interpretability. Large Action Models aim at extending Large Language Models to encompass the full perception, reasoning, and action cycle; however, they typically require substantially more comprehensive training and suffer from the same deficiencies in reliability. Here, we show it is possible to build competent Large Action Models by composing off-the-shelf foundation models, and that their control, interpretability, and explainability can be effected by incorporating symbolic wrappers and associated verification on their outputs, achieving verifiable neuro-symbolic solutions for intelligent robots. Our experiments on a multi-modal robot demonstrate that Large Action Model intelligence does not require massive end-to-end training, but can be achieved by integrating efficient perception models with a logic-driven core. We find that driving action execution through the generation of Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) code enables a human-in-the-loop verification stage that effectively mitigates action hallucinations. These results can support practitioners in the design and development of robotic Large Action Models across novel industries, and shed light on the ongoing challenges that must be addressed to ensure safety in the field.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5927\u578b\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u9a71\u52a8\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210PDDL\u4ee3\u7801\u9a71\u52a8\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u73af\u8282\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5927\u578b\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u73b0\u6210\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u5c01\u88c5\u53ca\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u51fa\u5177\u5907\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5927\u578b\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

This paper presents the first systematic comparison of classical optimization and AI approaches to this problem, evaluating their performance against traditional algorithms. We apply PatternBoost transformer learning and reinforcement learning (PPO) to this problem for the first time, comparing them against ILP. ILP achieves provably optimal solutions up to 19 by 19 grids, while PatternBoost matches optimal performance up to 14 by 14 grids with 96% test loss reduction. PPO achieves perfect solutions on 10 by 10 grids but fails at 11 by 11 grids, where constraint violations prevent valid configurations.

Efficient stereo architectures, on the other hand, sacrifice robustness for speed and require costly per-domain fine-tuning. To bridge this gap, we present Fast-FoundationStereo, a family of architectures that achieve, for the first time, strong zero-shot generalization at real-time frame rate. We employ a divide-and-conquer acceleration strategy with three components: (1) knowledge distillation to compress the hybrid backbone into a single efficient student; (2) blockwise neural architecture search for automatically discovering optimal cost filtering designs under latency budgets, reducing search complexity exponentially; and (3) structured pruning for eliminating redundancy in the iterative refinement module. Furthermore, we introduce an automatic pseudo-labeling pipeline used to curate 1.4M in-the-wild stereo pairs to supplement synthetic training data and facilitate knowledge distillation. The resulting model can run over 10x faster than FoundationStereo while closely matching its zero-shot accuracy, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art among real-time methods.

In such settings, the mobile robot must go beyond traditional obstacle avoidance, leveraging pushing or nudging strategies to accomplish its goals. While research in pushing-based robotics is growing, evaluations rely on ad hoc setups, limiting reproducibility and cross-comparison. To address this, we present Bench-Push, the first unified benchmark for pushing-based mobile robot navigation and manipulation tasks. Bench-Push includes multiple components: 1) a comprehensive range of simulated environments that capture the fundamental challenges in pushing-based tasks, including navigating a maze with movable obstacles, autonomous ship navigation in ice-covered waters, box delivery, and area clearing, each with varying levels of complexity; 2) novel evaluation metrics to capture efficiency, interaction effort, and partial task completion; and 3) demonstrations using Bench-Push to evaluate example implementations of established baselines across environments. Bench-Push is open-sourced as a Python library with a modular design.

However, the traditional requirement for manually assigned or centrally coordinated worker IDs introduces significant friction in modern container-orchestrated environments (e.g., Kubernetes), where workloads are ephemeral and autoscaled. In such systems, maintaining stable worker identities requires complex stateful sets or external coordination services (e.g., ZooKeeper), negating the operational benefits of stateless microservices.\n  This paper presents a cloud-agnostic, container-native ID generation protocol that eliminates the dependency on explicit worker IDs. By deriving node uniqueness deterministically from ephemeral network properties - specifically the container's private IPv4 address - the proposed method removes the need for centralized coordination. We introduce a modified bit-allocation scheme (1-41-16-6) that accommodates 16 bits of network-derived entropy while preserving strict monotonicity. We validate the approach across AWS, GCP, and Azure environments. Evaluation results demonstrate that while the design has a theoretical single-node ceiling of approximately 64,000 TPS, in practical microservice deployments the network I/O dominates latency, resulting in end-to-end performance (approximately 31,000 TPS on a 3-node cluster) comparable to classic stateful generators while offering effectively unbounded horizontal scalability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bb9\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fID\u751f\u6210\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4e2d\u592e\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfSnowflake\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5bb9\u5668\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6848\u76f8\u5f53\u4e14\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfSnowflake\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5bb9\u5668\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u56e0\u5de5\u4f5c\u8282\u70b9ID\u7684\u5206\u914d\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u4f18\u52bf\u76f8\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5bb9\u5668\u7684\u79c1\u6709IPv4\u5730\u5740\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8282\u70b9\u552f\u4e00\u6027\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684\u4f4d\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6848\uff081-41-16-6\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4e2d\u592e\u534f\u8c03\u5373\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u4e25\u683c\u5355\u8c03\u7684ID\u3002", "result": "\u5728AWS\u3001GCP\u548cAzure\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5355\u8282\u70b9\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u9650\u7ea6\u4e3a64,000 TPS\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7f51\u7edcI/O\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c3\u8282\u70b9\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u7ea6\u4e3a31,000 TPS\uff0c\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u6709\u72b6\u6001\u751f\u6210\u5668\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fd1\u4e4e\u65e0\u9650\u7684\u6a2a\u5411\u6269\u5c55\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bb9\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fID\u751f\u6210\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfSnowflake\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5bb9\u5668\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u56e0\u5de5\u4f5c\u8282\u70b9ID\u7ba1\u7406\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

For nine globally limiting pests, weeds, and plant diseases, we assessed the factual accuracy, data consistency, and breadth of knowledge or data completeness of each LLM. Overall, DeepSeek consistently screened a 4.8-49.7-fold larger literature corpus and reported 1.6-2.4-fold more biological control agents or management solutions than ChatGPT. As a result, DeepSeek reported 21.6% higher efficacy estimates, exhibited greater laboratory-to-field data consistency, and showed more realistic effects of pest identity and management tactics. However, both models hallucinated, i.e., fabricated fictitious agents or references, reported on implausible ecological interactions or outcomes, confused old and new scientific nomenclatures, and omitted data on key agents or solutions.

Here, we introduce ItemizedCLIP, a framework for learning complete and explainable visual representations from itemized text supervision. ItemizedCLIP employs a cross-attention module to produce text item-conditioned visual embeddings and a set of tailored objectives that jointly enforce item independence (distinct regions for distinct items) and representation completeness (coverage of all items). Across four domains with naturally itemized text supervision (brain MRI, head CT, chest CT, remote sensing) and one additional synthetically itemized dataset, ItemizedCLIP achieves substantial improvements in zero-shot performance and fine-grained interpretability over baselines.

In this study, we investigate whether and to what extent the human-like appearance of robots elicits anthropomorphism, which is conceptualised as an attribution of mental capacities, and how the level of anthropomorphism is revealed in explanations that people expect to receive.

However, the current practice of retraining a separate model for each camera suffers from high compute and communication costs, making it unscalable. We present ECCO, a new video analytics framework designed for resource-efficient continuous learning. The key insight is that the data drift, which necessitates model retraining, often shows temporal and spatial correlations across nearby cameras. By identifying cameras that experience similar drift and retraining a shared model for them, ECCO can substantially reduce the associated compute and communication costs. Specifically, ECCO introduces: (i) a lightweight grouping algorithm that dynamically forms and updates camera groups; (ii) a GPU allocator that dynamically assigns GPU resources across different groups to improve retraining accuracy and ensure fairness; and (iii) a transmission controller at each camera that configures frame sampling and coordinates bandwidth sharing with other cameras based on its assigned GPU resources.

Instantiated on the pi-zero VLA controller, BLURR keeps the original observation interfaces and accelerates control by combining an instruction prefix key value cache, mixed precision execution, and a single step rollout schedule that reduces per step computation.

In this paper, we propose a Lightweight 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) Compression method based on Video codec (LGSCV). First, a two-stage Morton scan is proposed to generate blockwise 2D maps that are friendly for canonical video codecs in which the coding units (CU) are square blocks. A 3D Morton scan is used to permute GS primitives, followed by a 2D Morton scan to map the ordered GS primitives to 2D maps in a blockwise style. However, although the blockwise 2D maps report close performance to the PLAS map in high-bitrate regions, they show a quality collapse at medium-to-low bitrates. Therefore, a principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of spherical harmonics (SH), and a MiniPLAS, which is flexible and fast, is designed to permute the primitives within certain block sizes. Incorporating SH PCA and MiniPLAS leads to a significant gain in rate-distortion (RD) performance, especially at medium and low bitrates. MiniPLAS can also guide the setting of the codec CU size configuration and significantly reduce encoding time. Experimental results on the MPEG dataset demonstrate that the proposed LGSCV achieves over 20% RD gain compared with state-of-the-art methods, while reducing 2D map generation time to approximately 1 second and cutting encoding time by 50%.

To address this, we propose ProbeMDE, a cost-aware active sensing framework that combines RGB images with sparse proprioceptive measurements for MDE. Our approach utilizes an ensemble of MDE models to predict dense depth maps conditioned on both RGB images and on a sparse set of known depth measurements obtained via proprioception, where the robot has touched the environment in a known configuration. We quantify predictive uncertainty via the ensemble's variance and measure the gradient of the uncertainty with respect to candidate measurement locations.

We employed a cross-sectional analysis design based on standardized medical probes, selecting four mainstream LLMs as research subjects: GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5, DeepSeek 3.1, and Qwen3-Max. An evaluation system comprising twenty medical probes across five core dimensions was used to simulate a genuine clinical communication environment. All probes had gold-standard answers defined by clinical experts and were assessed via a double-blind, inverse rating scale by two independent clinicians. The results show that all tested models exhibited functional defects to varying degrees, with Qwen3-Max demonstrating the best overall performance and Gemini 2.5 the worst. Under conditions of extreme noise, most models experienced a functional collapse. Notably, GPT-4o made a severe misjudgment in the risk assessment for pulmonary embolism (PE) secondary to deep vein thrombosis (DVT). This research is the first to empirically confirm that LLMs exhibit features resembling metabolic dysfunction when processing clinical information, proposing the innovative concept of \"AI-Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (AI-MASLD)\".

We provide evidence in both simulation and the real world that this approach outperforms the common paradigm of training agents in isolation with rewards that prescribe behavior, e.g., progress on the raceline, in particular when the complexity of the environment increases, e.g., in the presence of obstacles. Moreover, we find that multi-agent competition yields policies that transfer more reliably to the real world than policies trained with a single-agent progress-based reward, despite the two methods using the same simulation environment, randomization strategy, and hardware. In addition to improved sim-to-real transfer, the multi-agent policies also exhibit some degree of generalization to opponents unseen at training time.

Current benchmarks often emphasize peak performance on top-tier hardware, offering limited guidance for diverse, real-world scenarios.\n  Benchmarking must become dynamic, incorporating evolving models, updated data, and heterogeneous platforms while maintaining transparency, reproducibility, and interpretability. Democratization requires both technical innovation and systematic education across levels, building sustained expertise in benchmark design and use. Benchmarks should support application-relevant comparisons, enabling informed, context-sensitive decisions. Dynamic, inclusive benchmarking will ensure evaluation keeps pace with AI evolution and supports responsible, reproducible, and accessible AI deployment.

With the emergence of 3D generation, this task has undergone a transformative impact, shifting not only from visual fidelity to functional utility but also enabling editable CAD designs. Prior works have achieved early success in single-part CAD generation, which is not well-suited for real-world applications, as multiple parts need to be assembled under semantic and geometric constraints. In this paper, we propose CADKnitter, a compositional CAD generation framework with a geometry-guided diffusion sampling strategy. CADKnitter is able to generate a complementary CAD part that follows both the geometric constraints of the given CAD model and the semantic constraints of the desired design text prompt. We also curate a dataset, so-called KnitCAD, containing over 310,000 samples of CAD models, along with textual prompts and assembly metadata that provide semantic and geometric constraints.

While generative models present an attractive solution, existing methods often alter only visual appearances without creating new behaviors, or suffer from embodiment inconsistencies that yield implausible motions. To address these limitations, we introduce AnchorDream, an embodiment-aware world model that repurposes pretrained video diffusion models for robot data synthesis. AnchorDream conditions the diffusion process on robot motion renderings, anchoring the embodiment to prevent hallucination while synthesizing objects and environments consistent with the robot's kinematics. Starting from only a handful of human teleoperation demonstrations, our method scales them into large, diverse, high-quality datasets without requiring explicit environment modeling. Experiments show that the generated data leads to consistent improvements in downstream policy learning, with relative gains of 36.4% in simulator benchmarks and nearly double performance in real-world studies. These results suggest that grounding generative world models in robot motion provides a practical path toward scaling imitation learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "AnchorDream\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6837\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u521b\u65b0\u6216\u8fd0\u52a8\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u6e32\u67d3\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u884c\u4e3a\u5408\u7406\u6027\u5e76\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u73af\u5883\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u534736.4%\uff0c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8fd1\u4e00\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "AnchorDream\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6269\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

In contrast to general-purpose RAG systems, medical applications impose stringent safety constraints, rendering the accuracy of both the reasoning trace and the sequence of tool invocations critical. These considerations motivate evaluation protocols treating token-level reasoning and tool-usage behaviors as explicit supervision signals. This work presents insights derived from our participation in the CURE-Bench NeurIPS 2025 Challenge, which benchmarks therapeutic-reasoning systems using metrics that assess correctness, tool utilization, and reasoning quality. We analyze how retrieval quality for function (tool) calls influences overall model performance and demonstrate performance gains achieved through improved tool-retrieval strategies.

In this work, we introduce a benchmark, called SmokeBench, to evaluate the ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to recognize and localize wildfire smoke in images. The benchmark consists of four tasks: (1) smoke classification, (2) tile-based smoke localization, (3) grid-based smoke localization, and (4) smoke detection. We evaluate several MLLMs, including Idefics2, Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3, Unified-IO 2, Grounding DINO, GPT-4o, and Gemini-2.5 Pro. Our results show that while some models can classify the presence of smoke when it covers a large area, all models struggle with accurate localization, especially in the early stages. Further analysis reveals that smoke volume is strongly correlated with model performance, whereas contrast plays a comparatively minor role. These findings highlight critical limitations of current MLLMs for safety-critical wildfire monitoring and underscore the need for methods that improve early-stage smoke localization.", "AI": {"tldr": "SmokeBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30MLLMs\u5728\u91ce\u706b\u70df\u96fe\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u70df\u96fe\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u70df\u96fe\u4f53\u79ef\u662f\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u91ce\u706b\u70df\u96fe\u900f\u660e\u3001\u65e0\u5b9a\u5f62\uff0c\u5e38\u4e0e\u4e91\u6df7\u6dc6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5c24\u4e3a\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30MLLMs\u5728\u6b64\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aSmokeBench\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30MLLMs\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u91ce\u706b\u70df\u96fe\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u70df\u96fe\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u74e6\u7247\u7684\u70df\u96fe\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u70df\u96fe\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u70df\u96fe\u68c0\u6d4b\u56db\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5305\u62ecIdefics2\u3001Qwen2.5-VL\u3001InternVL3\u3001Unified-IO 2\u3001Grounding DINO\u3001GPT-4o\u548cGemini-2.5 Pro\u5728\u5185\u7684\u591a\u4e2aMLLMs\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5728\u5927\u9762\u79ef\u70df\u96fe\u8986\u76d6\u65f6\u5206\u7c7b\u70df\u96fe\uff0c\u4f46\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u70df\u96fe\u4f53\u79ef\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7684\u91ce\u706b\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u70df\u96fe\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Many recent methods represent the world through images, and reduce forecasting to stochastic video generation. Although such methods excel at realism and visual fidelity, predicting pixels is computationally intensive and not directly useful in many applications, as it requires translating RGB into signals useful for decision making. An alternative approach uses features from vision foundation models (VFMs) as world representations, performing deterministic regression to predict future world states. These features can be directly translated into actionable signals such as semantic segmentation and depth, while remaining computationally efficient. However, deterministic regression averages over multiple plausible futures, undermining forecast accuracy by failing to capture uncertainty. To address this crucial limitation, we introduce a generative forecaster that performs autoregressive flow matching in VFM feature space. Our key insight is that generative modeling in this space requires encoding VFM features into a compact latent space suitable for diffusion. We show that this latent space preserves information more effectively than previously used PCA-based alternatives, both for forecasting and other applications, such as image generation. Our latent predictions can be easily decoded into multiple useful and interpretable output modalities: semantic segmentation, depth, surface normals, and even RGB. With matched architecture and compute, our method produces sharper and more accurate predictions than regression across all modalities.

To model the evolution of future scenes, we leverage the World Model to represent how the ego vehicle and its environment interact and change over time, which entails complex reasoning. The Chain of Thought (CoT) offers a promising solution by forecasting a sequence of future thoughts that subsequently guide trajectory refinement. In this paper, we propose FutureX, a CoT-driven pipeline that enhances end-to-end planners to perform complex motion planning via future scene latent reasoning and trajectory refinement. Specifically, the Auto-think Switch examines the current scene and decides whether additional reasoning is required to yield a higher-quality motion plan. Once FutureX enters the Thinking mode, the Latent World Model conducts a CoT-guided rollout to predict future scene representation, enabling the Summarizer Module to further refine the motion plan. Otherwise, FutureX operates in an Instant mode to generate motion plans in a forward pass for relatively simple scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FutureX enhances existing methods by producing more rational motion plans and fewer collisions without compromising efficiency, thereby achieving substantial overall performance gains, e.g., 6.2 PDMS improvement for TransFuser on NAVSIM.

However, the slow inference speeds and non-autoregressive paradigms severely constrain the application of diffusion-based THG models. In this study, we propose REST, the first diffusion-based, real-time, end-to-end streaming audio-driven talking head generation framework. To support real-time end-to-end generation, a compact video latent space is first learned through high spatiotemporal VAE compression. Additionally, to enable autoregressive streaming within the compact video latent space, we introduce an ID-Context Cache mechanism, which integrates ID-Sink and Context-Cache principles to key-value caching for maintaining temporal consistency and identity coherence during long-time streaming generation.

The key insight is that a well-designed IDSL can act as a shared semantic representation, enabling coherent, high-quality scene synthesis from any single modality while maintaining interaction semantics. In contrast to conventional procedural methods that produce visually plausible but functionally inert layouts, RoomPilot leverages a curated dataset of interaction-annotated assets to synthesize environments exhibiting realistic object behaviors.

LLMs currently lack the capability to leverage knowledge of HMIs due to their inability to access the vision modality. This paper proposes a few-shot VLM-based verification approach that simultaneously evaluates the G-code and the HMI display for errors and safety status. The input dataset includes paired G-code text and associated HMI screenshots from a 15-slant-PRO lathe, including both correct and error-prone cases. To enable few-shot learning, the VLM is provided with a structured JSON schema based on prior heuristic knowledge. After determining the prompts, instances of G-code and HMI that either contain errors or are error free are used as few-shot examples to guide the VLM. The model was then evaluated in comparison to a zero-shot VLM through multiple scenarios of incorrect G-code and HMI errors with respect to per-slot accuracy. The VLM showed that few-shot prompting led to overall enhancement of detecting HMI errors and discrepancies with the G-code for more comprehensive debugging.

By combining patch-based tokenization with locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) attention, our model approximates global self-attention while reducing its theoretical time complexity from $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log n)$ in the sequence length $n$. We evaluate the proposed Reformer-based vision model on CIFAR-10 to assess its behavior on small-scale datasets, on ImageNet-100 to study its accuracy--efficiency trade-off in a more realistic setting, and on a high-resolution medical imaging dataset to evaluate the model under longer token sequences.\n  While the Reformer achieves higher accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to our ViT-style baseline, the ViT model consistently outperforms the Reformer in our experiments in terms of practical efficiency and end-to-end computation time across the larger and higher-resolution settings. These results suggest that, despite the theoretical advantages of LSH-based attention, meaningful computation gains require sequence lengths substantially longer than those produced by typical high-resolution images.", "AI": {"tldr": "Reformer\u901a\u8fc7LSH\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cViT\u4ecd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6ViT\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u5168\u5c40\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u968f\u4ee4\u724c\u6570\u91cf\u5448\u4e8c\u6b21\u65b9\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5757\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u654f\u611f\u54c8\u5e0c\uff08LSH\uff09\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5168\u5c40\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u7406\u8bba\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4eceO(n\u00b2)\u964d\u4f4e\u5230O(n log n)\u3002", "result": "Reformer\u5728CIFAR-10\u4e0a\u6bd4ViT\u57fa\u7ebf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cViT\u5728\u5b9e\u7528\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u57fa\u4e8eLSH\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5178\u578b\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\uff0cViT\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4ecd\u4f18\u4e8eReformer\u3002"}}

Serrated tussock (\\textit{Nassella trichotoma}) is a highly competitive invasive grass species that disrupts native grasslands, reduces pasture productivity, and increases land management costs. In Victoria, Australia, it presents a major challenge due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact. While current ground surveys and subsequent management practices are effective at small scales, they are not feasible for landscape-scale monitoring. Although aerial imagery offers high spatial resolution suitable for detailed classification, its high cost limits scalability. Satellite-based remote sensing provides a more cost-effective and scalable alternative, though often with lower spatial resolution. This study evaluates whether multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery, despite its lower spatial resolution, can provide a comparable and cost-effective alternative for landscape-scale monitoring of serrated tussock by leveraging its higher spectral resolution and seasonal phenological information. A total of eleven models have been developed using various combinations of spectral bands, texture features, vegetation indices, and seasonal data. Using a random forest classifier, the best-performing Sentinel-2 model (M76*) has achieved an Overall Accuracy (OA) of 68\\% and an Overall Kappa (OK) of 0.55, slightly outperforming the best-performing aerial imaging model's OA of 67\\% and OK of 0.52 on the same dataset.

Rising accident rates raise concerns about traffic surveillance effectiveness. Traditional computer vision methods for accident detection struggle with limited spatiotemporal understanding and poor cross-domain generalization. Recent advances in transformer architectures excel at modeling global spatial-temporal dependencies and parallel computation. However, applying these models to automated traffic accident detection is limited by small, non-diverse datasets, hindering the development of robust, generalizable systems. To address this gap, we curated a comprehensive and balanced dataset that captures a wide spectrum of traffic environments, accident types, and contextual variations. Utilizing the curated dataset, we propose an accident detection model based on a transformer architecture using pre-extracted spatial video features. The architecture employs convolutional layers to extract local correlations across diverse patterns within a frame, while leveraging transformers to capture sequential-temporal dependencies among the retrieved features. Moreover, most existing studies neglect the integration of motion cues, which are essential for understanding dynamic scenes, especially during accidents. These approaches typically rely on static features or coarse temporal information. In this study, multiple methods for incorporating motion cues were evaluated to identify the most effective strategy.

To address these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{FilmWeaver}, a novel framework designed to generate consistent, multi-shot videos of arbitrary length. First, it employs an autoregressive diffusion paradigm to achieve arbitrary-length video generation. To address the challenge of consistency, our key insight is to decouple the problem into inter-shot consistency and intra-shot coherence. We achieve this through a dual-level cache mechanism: a shot memory caches keyframes from preceding shots to maintain character and scene identity, while a temporal memory retains a history of frames from the current shot to ensure smooth, continuous motion. The proposed framework allows for flexible, multi-round user interaction to create multi-shot videos. Furthermore, due to this decoupled design, our method demonstrates high versatility by supporting downstream tasks such as multi-concept injection and video extension. To facilitate the training of our consistency-aware method, we also developed a comprehensive pipeline to construct a high-quality multi-shot video dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches on metrics for both consistency and aesthetic quality, opening up new possibilities for creating more consistent, controllable, and narrative-driven video content.

Traditional autoencoder-based methods often struggle with incomplete anomaly suppression and loss of fine details, as their single-pass decoding fails to effectively handle anomalies with varying severity and scale. We propose a recursive architecture for autoencoder (RcAE), which performs reconstruction iteratively to progressively suppress anomalies while refining normal structures. Unlike traditional single-pass models, this recursive design naturally produces a sequence of reconstructions, progressively exposing suppressed abnormal patterns. To leverage this reconstruction dynamics, we introduce a Cross Recursion Detection (CRD) module that tracks inconsistencies across recursion steps, enhancing detection of both subtle and large-scale anomalies. Additionally, we incorporate a Detail Preservation Network (DPN) to recover high-frequency textures typically lost during reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing non-diffusion methods, and achieves performance on par with recent diffusion models with only 10% of their parameters and offering substantially faster inference.

ARVAE introduces a temporal-spatial decoupled representation that combines downsampled flow field for temporal coherence with spatial relative compensation for newly emerged content, achieving high compression efficiency without information loss. Specifically, the encoder compresses the current and previous frames into the temporal motion and spatial supplement, while the decoder reconstructs the original frame from the latent representations given the preceding frame.

To guide the fusion of descriptor-wise predictions, we leverage the semantic reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to assign class-specific importance weights. By integrating these structured descriptors with LLM-guided semantic priors, Skeleton-Cache dynamically adapts to unseen actions without any additional training or access to training data. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60/120 and PKU-MMD II demonstrate that Skeleton-Cache consistently boosts the performance of various SZAR backbones under both zero-shot and generalized zero-shot settings.

In visual generation, however, these powerful core models are typically reduced to global text encoders for diffusion models, leaving most of their reasoning and planning ability unused. This creates a gap: current multimodal LLMs can parse complex layouts, attributes, and knowledge-intensive scenes, yet struggle to generate images or videos with equally precise and structured control. We propose MetaCanvas, a lightweight framework that lets MLLMs reason and plan directly in spatial and spatiotemporal latent spaces and interface tightly with diffusion generators. We empirically implement MetaCanvas on three different diffusion backbones and evaluate it across six tasks, including text-to-image generation, text/image-to-video generation, image/video editing, and in-context video generation, each requiring precise layouts, robust attribute binding, and reasoning-intensive control.

However, this process is hindered by low-quality input data caused by onboard sensors limited capability and frequent occlusions, leading to incomplete, noisy, or missing data, and thus reduced mapping accuracy and robustness. Recent efforts have introduced satellite images as auxiliary input, offering a stable, wide-area view to complement the limited ego perspective. However, satellite images in Bird's Eye View are often degraded by shadows and occlusions from vegetation and buildings. Prior methods using basic feature extraction and fusion remain ineffective. To address these challenges, we propose SATMapTR, a novel online map construction model that effectively fuses satellite image through two key components: (1) a gated feature refinement module that adaptively filters satellite image features by integrating high-level semantics with low-level structural cues to extract high signal-to-noise ratio map-relevant representations; and (2) a geometry-aware fusion module that consistently fuse satellite and BEV features at a grid-to-grid level, minimizing interference from irrelevant regions and low-quality inputs. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset show that SATMapTR achieves the highest mean average precision (mAP) of 73.8, outperforming state-of-the-art satellite-enhanced models by up to 14.2 mAP.

Existing datasets and methods mainly focus on speech-driven animation or unstructured expression sequences and therefore lack the semantic grounding and temporal structures needed for expressive human performance generation. In this work, we introduce KeyframeFace, a large-scale multimodal dataset designed for text-to-animation research through keyframe-level supervision. KeyframeFace provides 2,100 expressive scripts paired with monocular videos, per-frame ARKit coefficients, contextual backgrounds, complex emotions, manually defined keyframes, and multi-perspective annotations based on ARKit coefficients and images via Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Beyond the dataset, we propose the first text-to-animation framework that explicitly leverages LLM priors for interpretable facial motion synthesis. This design aligns the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs with the interpretable structure of ARKit's coefficients, enabling high-fidelity expressive animation.

Existing researches on flare removal have mainly focused on images, while the spatiotemporal characteristics of video flare remain largely unexplored. Video flare synthesis and removal pose significantly greater challenges than in image, owing to the complex and mutually independent motion of flare, light sources, and scene content. This motion independence further affects restoration performance, often resulting in flicker and artifacts. To address this issue, we propose a physics-informed dynamic flare synthesis pipeline, which simulates light source motion using optical flow and models the temporal behaviors of both scattering and reflective flares. Meanwhile, we design a video flare removal network that employs an attention module to spatially suppress flare regions and incorporates a Mamba-based temporal modeling component to capture long range spatio-temporal dependencies. This motion-independent spatiotemporal representation effectively eliminates the need for multi-frame alignment, alleviating temporal aliasing between flares and scene content and thereby improving video flare removal performance. Building upon this, we construct the first video flare dataset to comprehensively evaluate our method, which includes a large set of synthetic paired videos and additional real-world videos collected from the Internet to assess generalization capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing video-based restoration and image-based flare removal methods on both real and synthetic videos, effectively removing dynamic flares while preserving light source integrity and maintaining spatiotemporal consistency of scene.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u89c6\u9891\u5149\u6655\u53bb\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7f51\u7edc\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u52a8\u6001\u5149\u6655\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u5149\u6655\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u5149\u6655\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u53bb\u9664\u9762\u4e34\u6bd4\u56fe\u50cf\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5982\u8fd0\u52a8\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u548c\u7531\u6b64\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u95ea\u70c1\u548c\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5149\u6655\u5408\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u5149\u6e90\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e76\u5efa\u6a21\u6563\u5c04\u548c\u53cd\u5c04\u5149\u6655\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u5149\u6655\u53bb\u9664\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u548cMamba-based\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u5149\u6655\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u53bb\u9664\u52a8\u6001\u5149\u6655\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5149\u6e90\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

The final version will be available on IEEE Xplore", "summary": "Model fingerprint detection techniques have emerged as a promising approach for attributing AI-generated images to their source models, but their robustness under adversarial conditions remains largely unexplored. We present the first systematic security evaluation of these techniques, formalizing threat models that encompass both white- and black-box access and two attack goals: fingerprint removal, which erases identifying traces to evade attribution, and fingerprint forgery, which seeks to cause misattribution to a target model. We implement five attack strategies and evaluate 14 representative fingerprinting methods across RGB, frequency, and learned-feature domains on 12 state-of-the-art image generators. Our experiments reveal a pronounced gap between clean and adversarial performance. Removal attacks are highly effective, often achieving success rates above 80% in white-box settings and over 50% under constrained black-box access. While forgery is more challenging than removal, its success significantly varies across targeted models.

Second, for efficient adaptation of CLIP to FSAR, recent work performing fine-tuning via skip-fusion layers (which we refer to as side layers) has significantly reduced memory cost.

Compared with manual inspection, the intelligent real-time imaging system for underwater pipeline detection has become a more reliable and practical solution. Among various underwater imaging techniques, structured light 3D imaging can restore the sufficient spatial detail for precise defect characterization. Therefore, this paper develops a multi-mode underwater structured light 3D imaging system for pipeline detection (UW-SLD system) based on multi-source information fusion. First, a rapid distortion correction (FDC) method is employed for efficient underwater image rectification. To overcome the challenges of extrinsic calibration among underwater sensors, a factor graph-based parameter optimization method is proposed to estimate the transformation matrix between the structured light and acoustic sensors. Furthermore, a multi-mode 3D imaging strategy is introduced to adapt to the geometric variability of underwater pipelines. Given the presence of numerous disturbances in underwater environments, a multi-source information fusion strategy and an adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF) are designed to ensure stable pose estimation and high-accuracy measurements. In particular, an edge detection-based ICP (ED-ICP) algorithm is proposed.

Current mainstream methods have made progress in cross-layer feature fusion, but two critical issues persist during the decoding stage. The first is insufficient cross-channel information interaction within the same-layer features, limiting feature expressiveness. The second is the inability to effectively co-model boundary and region information, making it difficult to accurately reconstruct complete regions and sharp boundaries of objects. To address the first issue, we propose the Channel Information Interaction Module (CIIM), which introduces a horizontal-vertical integration mechanism in the channel dimension. This module performs feature reorganization and interaction across channels to effectively capture complementary cross-channel information. To address the second issue, we construct a collaborative decoding architecture guided by prior knowledge. This architecture generates boundary priors and object localization maps through Boundary Extraction (BE) and Region Extraction (RE) modules, then employs hybrid attention to collaboratively calibrate decoded features, effectively overcoming semantic ambiguity and imprecise boundaries. Additionally, the Multi-scale Enhancement (MSE) module enriches contextual feature representations. Extensive experiments on four COD benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of the proposed model. We further transferred our model to the Salient Object Detection (SOD) task and demonstrated its adaptability across downstream tasks, including polyp segmentation, transparent object detection, and industrial and road defect detection.

Given one egocentric video, we introduce the N-Body Problem: how N individuals, can hypothetically perform the same set of tasks observed in this video. The goal is to maximise speed-up, but naive assignment of video segments to individuals often violates real-world constraints, leading to physically impossible scenarios like two people using the same object or occupying the same space. To address this, we formalise the N-Body Problem and propose a suite of metrics to evaluate both performance (speed-up, task coverage) and feasibility (spatial collisions, object conflicts and causal constraints). We then introduce a structured prompting strategy that guides a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to reason about the 3D environment, object usage, and temporal dependencies to produce a viable parallel execution. On 100 videos from EPIC-Kitchens and HD-EPIC, our method for N = 2 boosts action coverage by 45% over a baseline prompt for Gemini 2.5 Pro, while simultaneously slashing collision rates, object and causal conflicts by 55%, 45% and 55% respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faN-Body\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u6267\u884c\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u590d\u6742\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165N-Body\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u5957\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u6307\u5bfc\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728EPIC-Kitchens\u548cHD-EPIC\u7684100\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u4e0a\uff0cN=2\u65f6\u52a8\u4f5c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u63d0\u534745%\uff0c\u51b2\u7a81\u7387\u3001\u7269\u4f53\u51b2\u7a81\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u51b2\u7a81\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e55%\u300145%\u548c55%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u52a8\u4f5c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u6267\u884c\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u51b2\u7a81\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u3002"}}

To satisfy the exploding editing requirements, the \\underline{complex editing} which contains multiple editing targets has posed as a more challenging task. However, current complex editing solutions: single-round and multi-round editing are limited by long text following and cumulative inconsistency, respectively. Thus, they struggle to strike a balance between semantic alignment and source consistency. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{FlowDC}, which decouples the complex editing into multiple sub-editing effects and superposes them in parallel during the editing process. Meanwhile, we observed that the velocity quantity that is orthogonal to the editing displacement harms the source structure preserving. Thus, we decompose the velocity and decay the orthogonal part for better source consistency. To evaluate the effectiveness of complex editing settings, we construct a complex editing benchmark: Complex-PIE-Bench.

To avoid the significant memory consumption and limited generalizability brought by building separate models per class, we focus on developing a unified framework for multi-class anomaly detection. However, under this challenging setting, conventional reconstruction-based networks often suffer from an identity mapping problem, where they directly replicate input features regardless of whether they are normal or anomalous, resulting in detection failures. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel framework termed Collaborative Reconstruction and Repair (CRR), which transforms the reconstruction to repairation. First, we optimize the decoder to reconstruct normal samples while repairing synthesized anomalies. Consequently, it generates distinct representations for anomalous regions and similar representations for normal areas compared to the encoder's output. Second, we implement feature-level random masking to ensure that the representations from decoder contain sufficient local information. Finally, to minimize detection errors arising from the discrepancies between feature representations from the encoder and decoder, we train a segmentation network supervised by synthetic anomaly masks, thereby enhancing localization performance.

However, SSL for 3D point clouds still faces critical challenges due to irregular geometry, shortcut-prone reconstruction, and unbalanced semantics distribution. In this work, we propose DOS (Distilling Observable Softmaps), a novel SSL framework that self-distills semantic relevance softmaps only at observable (unmasked) points. This strategy prevents information leakage from masked regions and provides richer supervision than discrete token-to-prototype assignments. To address the challenge of unbalanced semantics in an unsupervised setting, we introduce Zipfian prototypes and incorporate them using a modified Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, Zipf-Sinkhorn, which enforces a power-law prior over prototype usage and modulates the sharpness of the target softmap during training. DOS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on semantic segmentation and 3D object detection across multiple benchmarks, including nuScenes, Waymo, SemanticKITTI, ScanNet, and ScanNet200, without relying on extra data or annotations.

The task calls for 1) preserving the original sequence's structure, 2) ensuring each edit's semantic validity, and 3) maintaining high shape fidelity to the target shape, all under scarce editing data triplets. We present CADMorph, an iterative plan-generate-verify framework that orchestrates pretrained domain-specific foundation models during inference: a parameter-to-shape (P2S) latent diffusion model and a masked-parameter-prediction (MPP) model. In the planning stage, cross-attention maps from the P2S model pinpoint the segments that need modification and offer editing masks. The MPP model then infills these masks with semantically valid edits in the generation stage. During verification, the P2S model embeds each candidate sequence in shape-latent space, measures its distance to the target shape, and selects the closest one. The three stages leverage the inherent geometric consciousness and design knowledge in pretrained priors, and thus tackle structure preservation, semantic validity, and shape fidelity respectively. Besides, both P2S and MPP models are trained without triplet data, bypassing the data-scarcity bottleneck.

Inspired by the recent success of the selective state-space model (SSM) Mamba in modeling 1D temporal sequences, we propose TSkel-Mamba, a hybrid Transformer-Mamba framework that effectively captures both spatial and temporal dynamics. In particular, our approach leverages Spatial Transformer for spatial feature learning while utilizing Mamba for temporal modeling. Mamba, however, employs separate SSM blocks for individual channels, which inherently limits its ability to model inter-channel dependencies. To better adapt Mamba for skeleton data and enhance Mamba`s ability to model temporal dependencies, we introduce a Temporal Dynamic Modeling (TDM) block, which is a versatile plug-and-play component that integrates a novel Multi-scale Temporal Interaction (MTI) module. The MTI module employs multi-scale Cycle operators to capture cross-channel temporal interactions, a critical factor in action recognition. Extensive experiments on NTU-RGB+D 60, NTU-RGB+D 120, NW-UCLA and UAV-Human datasets demonstrate that TSkel-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining low inference time, making it both efficient and highly effective.", "AI": {"tldr": "TSkel-Mamba\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u548cMamba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7TDM\u5757\u548cMTI\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u5347\u9aa8\u67b6\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7Mamba\u57281D\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u529f\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u9aa8\u67b6\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u8de8\u901a\u9053\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TSkel-Mamba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTSkel-Mamba\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528Spatial Transformer\u5b66\u4e60\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff0cMamba\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165Temporal Dynamic Modeling (TDM)\u5757\u548cMulti-scale Temporal Interaction (MTI)\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u8de8\u901a\u9053\u65f6\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "\u5728NTU-RGB+D 60\u3001NTU-RGB+D 120\u3001NW-UCLA\u548cUAV-Human\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "TSkel-Mamba\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u548cMamba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u9aa8\u67b6\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u8de8\u901a\u9053\u65f6\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Although self-supervised learning (SSL) can alleviate data scarcity, its need for pre-training and fine-tuning results in high computational costs and long training times. In this paper, we propose a Self-supervised assisted automatic abutment design framework (SS$A^3$D), which employs a dual-branch architecture with a reconstruction branch and a regression branch. The reconstruction branch learns to restore masked intraoral scan data and transfers the learned structural information to the regression branch. The regression branch then predicts the abutment parameters under supervised learning, which eliminates the separate pre-training and fine-tuning process. We also design a Text-Conditioned Prompt (TCP) module to incorporate clinical information (such as implant location, system, and series) into SS$A^3$D. This guides the network to focus on relevant regions and constrains the parameter predictions.

Trained in a supervised, single-step fashion on large datasets, VGGT raises a key question: does it build upon geometric concepts like traditional multi-view methods, or does it rely primarily on learned appearance-based data-driven priors? In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of VGGT's internal mechanisms to uncover whether geometric understanding emerges within its representations. By probing intermediate features, analyzing attention patterns, and performing interventions, we examine how the model implements its functionality. Our findings reveal that VGGT implicitly performs correspondence matching within its global attention layers and encodes epipolar geometry, despite being trained without explicit geometric constraints. We further investigate VGGT's dependence on its learned data priors. Using spatial input masking and perturbation experiments, we assess its robustness to occlusions, appearance variations, and camera configurations, comparing it with classical multi-stage pipelines.

Deep learning is particularly effective for this task, as it integrates spectral, temporal, and spatial signals that jointly reflect the canopy structure. To address this need, we introduce THREASURE-Net, a novel end-to-end framework for Tree Height Regression And Super-Resolution. The model is trained on Sentinel-2 time series using reference height metrics derived from LiDAR HD data at multiple spatial resolutions over Metropolitan France to produce annual height maps. We evaluate three model variants, producing tree-height predictions at 2.5 m, 5 m, and 10 m resolution. THREASURE-Net does not rely on any pretrained model nor on reference very high resolution optical imagery to train its super-resolution module; instead, it learns solely from LiDAR-derived height information. Our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods based on Sentinel data and is competitive with methods based on very high resolution imagery. It can be deployed to generate high-precision annual canopy-height maps, achieving mean absolute errors of 2.62 m, 2.72 m, and 2.88 m at 2.5 m, 5 m, and 10 m resolution, respectively.

Traditional top-K selection methods, which score frames independently, often fail to optimize the selection as a whole. This independent scoring frequently results in selecting frames that are temporally clustered and visually redundant. Additionally, training lightweight selectors using pseudo labels generated offline by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) prevents the supervisory signal from dynamically adapting to task objectives. To address these limitations, we propose an end-to-end trainable, task-adaptive framework for frame selection. A Chain-of-Thought approach guides a Small Language Model (SLM) to generate task-specific implicit query vectors, which are combined with multimodal features to enable dynamic frame scoring. We further define a continuous set-level objective function that incorporates relevance, coverage, and redundancy, enabling differentiable optimization via Gumbel-Softmax to select optimal frame combinations at the set level.

SAM2 is a pretrained foundation model for image and video segmentation, demonstrating a strong backbone in various downstream scenarios. To adapt SAM2 for 3D teeth data, we render images of 3D teeth models from predefined views, apply SAM2 for 2D segmentation, and reconstruct 3D results using 2D-3D projections. Since SAM2's performance depends on input prompts and its initial outputs often have deficiencies, and given its class-agnostic nature, we introduce three light-weight learnable modules: (1) a prompt embedding generator to derive prompt embeddings from image embeddings for accurate mask decoding, (2) a mask refiner to enhance SAM2's initial segmentation results, and (3) a mask classifier to categorize the generated masks. Additionally, we incorporate Deformable Global Attention Plugins (DGAP) into SAM2's image encoder. The DGAP enhances both the segmentation accuracy and the speed of the training process.

Our approach conditions predictions on a support set of spatially related example pairs: neighboring common-depth point gathers from the same seismic line and their corresponding labels. This allows the model to learn task-specific processing behavior at inference time by observing how similar gathers should be processed, without any retraining. This method provides both flexibility through user-defined examples and improved lateral consistency across seismic lines. On synthetic data, ContextSeisNet outperforms a U-Net baseline quantitatively and demonstrates enhanced spatial coherence between neighboring gathers. On field data, our model achieves superior lateral consistency compared to both traditional Radon demultiple and the U-Net baseline. Relative to the U-Net, ContextSeisNet also delivers improved near-offset performance and more complete multiple removal. Notably, ContextSeisNet achieves comparable field data performance despite being trained on 90% less data, demonstrating substantial data efficiency. These results establish ContextSeisNet as a practical approach for spatially consistent seismic demultiple with potential applicability to other seismic processing tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "ContextSeisNet\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u6539\u8fdb\u5730\u9707\u591a\u6b21\u6ce2\u53bb\u9664\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5730\u9707\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7528\u6237\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165ContextSeisNet\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u5bf9\u4e0a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5904\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eU-Net\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u91ce\u5916\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6a2a\u5411\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u591a\u6b21\u6ce2\u53bb\u9664\uff0c\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "ContextSeisNet\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5730\u9707\u591a\u6b21\u6ce2\u53bb\u9664\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5730\u9707\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

In the context of fetal MRI, high-resolution 3D reconstruction of the brain from motion-corrupted low-resolution 2D acquisitions is a prerequisite for accurate neurodevelopmental diagnosis. While implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently established state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), they suffer from a critical computational bottleneck: accurately modeling the image acquisition physics requires expensive stochastic Monte Carlo sampling to approximate the point spread function (PSF). In this work, we propose a shift from neural network based implicit representations to Gaussian based explicit representations. By parameterizing the HR 3D image volume as a field of anisotropic Gaussian primitives, we leverage the property of Gaussians being closed under convolution and thus derive a \\textit{closed-form analytical solution} for the forward model. This formulation reduces the previously intractable acquisition integral to an exact covariance addition ($\\mathbf\u03a3_{obs} = \\mathbf\u03a3_{HR} + \\mathbf\u03a3_{PSF}$), effectively bypassing the need for compute-intensive stochastic sampling while ensuring exact gradient propagation. We demonstrate that our approach matches the reconstruction quality of self-supervised state-of-the-art SVR frameworks while delivering a 5$\\times$--10$\\times$ speed-up on neonatal and fetal data. With convergence often reached in under 30 seconds, our framework paves the way towards translation into clinical routine of real-time fetal 3D MRI.

Although Text-to-Motion (T2M) generative models offer a compelling, scalable source of synthetic data, their training objectives, which emphasize general artistic motion, and dataset structures fundamentally differ from HAR's requirements for kinematically precise, class-discriminative actions. This disparity creates a significant domain gap, making generalist T2M models ill-equipped for generating motions suitable for HAR classifiers. To address this challenge, we propose KineMIC (Kinetic Mining In Context), a transfer learning framework for few-shot action synthesis. KineMIC adapts a T2M diffusion model to an HAR domain by hypothesizing that semantic correspondences in the text encoding space can provide soft supervision for kinematic distillation. We operationalize this via a kinetic mining strategy that leverages CLIP text embeddings to establish correspondences between sparse HAR labels and T2M source data. This process guides fine-tuning, transforming the generalist T2M backbone into a specialized few-shot Action-to-Motion generator. We validate KineMIC using HumanML3D as the source T2M dataset and a subset of NTU RGB+D 120 as the target HAR domain, randomly selecting just 10 samples per action class. Our approach generates significantly more coherent motions, providing a robust data augmentation source that delivers a +23.1% accuracy points improvement.

In addition, we introduce a Semantic and Relationship Alignment module: a Cross-modal Semantic Consistency Loss enhances fine-grained discrimination among visually similar targets, while a Relationship Consistency Loss enforces alignment between textual relations and visual interactions.

Our approach first employs BLIP and CLIP to jointly assess semantic and visual coherence, enabling automatic retrieval of the most suitable background images for the given foreground person. To ensure high quality foreground masks that preserve facial details, we integrate SAM3 for precise segmentation and Depth-Anything to extract only the non occluded visible person regions, preventing corrupted facial textures from being used in augmentation. For geometric realism, we introduce a depth guided sliding window placement mechanism that searches over the background depth map to identify paste locations with optimal depth continuity and scale alignment.

However, the global denoising dynamics of DMs inherently conflate local editing targets with the full-image context, leading to unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we shift our attention beyond DMs and turn to Masked Generative Transformers (MGTs) as an alternative approach to tackle this challenge. By predicting multiple masked tokens rather than holistic refinement, MGTs exhibit a localized decoding paradigm that endows them with the inherent capacity to explicitly preserve non-relevant regions during the editing process. Building upon this insight, we introduce the first MGT-based image editing framework, termed EditMGT. We first demonstrate that MGT's cross-attention maps provide informative localization signals for localizing edit-relevant regions and devise a multi-layer attention consolidation scheme that refines these maps to achieve fine-grained and precise localization. On top of these adaptive localization results, we introduce region-hold sampling, which restricts token flipping within low-attention areas to suppress spurious edits, thereby confining modifications to the intended target regions and preserving the integrity of surrounding non-target areas. To train EditMGT, we construct CrispEdit-2M, a high-resolution dataset spanning seven diverse editing categories.

Extensive experiments across four standard benchmarks demonstrate that, with fewer than 1B parameters, our model achieves similarity performance while enabling 6 times faster editing.

Patel"], "title": "Referring Change Detection in Remote Sensing Imagery", "comment": "2026 IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)", "summary": "Change detection in remote sensing imagery is essential for applications such as urban planning, environmental monitoring, and disaster management. Traditional change detection methods typically identify all changes between two temporal images without distinguishing the types of transitions, which can lead to results that may not align with specific user needs. Although semantic change detection methods have attempted to address this by categorizing changes into predefined classes, these methods rely on rigid class definitions and fixed model architectures, making it difficult to mix datasets with different label sets or reuse models across tasks, as the output channels are tightly coupled with the number and type of semantic classes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Referring Change Detection (RCD), which leverages natural language prompts to detect specific classes of changes in remote sensing images. By integrating language understanding with visual analysis, our approach allows users to specify the exact type of change they are interested in. However, training models for RCD is challenging due to the limited availability of annotated data and severe class imbalance in existing datasets. To address this, we propose a two-stage framework consisting of (I) \\textbf{RCDNet}, a cross-modal fusion network designed for referring change detection, and (II) \\textbf{RCDGen}, a diffusion-based synthetic data generation pipeline that produces realistic post-change images and change maps for a specified category using only pre-change image, without relying on semantic segmentation masks and thereby significantly lowering the barrier to scalable data creation. Experiments across multiple datasets show that our framework enables scalable and targeted change detection.

We address this by reframing music-to-dance generation as a music-token-conditioned multi-channel image synthesis problem: 2D pose sequences are encoded as one-hot images, compressed by a pretrained image VAE, and modeled with a DiT-style backbone, allowing us to inherit architectural and training advances from modern text-to-image models and better capture high-variance 2D pose distributions. On top of this formulation, we introduce (i) a time-shared temporal indexing scheme that explicitly synchronizes music tokens and pose latents over time and (ii) a reference-pose conditioning strategy that preserves subject-specific body proportions and on-screen scale while enabling long-horizon segment-and-stitch generation. Experiments on a large in-the-wild 2D dance corpus and the calibrated AIST++2D benchmark show consistent improvements over representative music-to-dance methods in pose- and video-space metrics and human preference, and ablations validate the contributions of the representation, temporal indexing, and reference conditioning.

While leveraging segmentation data can enhance semantic stability, the lack of effective boundary supervision often leads to segmentation-like mattes lacking fine details.

It produces a pixel-wise evaluation map that identifies reliable and erroneous regions, enabling fine-grained quality assessment. The MQE scales up video matting in two ways: (1) as an online matting-quality feedback during training to suppress erroneous regions, providing comprehensive supervision, and (2) as an offline selection module for data curation, improving annotation quality by combining the strengths of leading video and image matting models. This process allows us to build a large-scale real-world video matting dataset, VMReal, containing 28K clips and 2.4M frames.

For video models, that means generating motion that preserves fidelity as well as structure. Despite progress in diffusion models, producing realistic structure-preserving motion remains challenging, especially for articulated and deformable objects such as humans and animals. Scaling training data alone, so far, has failed to resolve physically implausible transitions. Existing approaches rely on conditioning with noisy motion representations, such as optical flow or skeletons extracted using an external imperfect model. To address these challenges, we introduce an algorithm to distill structure-preserving motion priors from an autoregressive video tracking model (SAM2) into a bidirectional video diffusion model (CogVideoX). With our method, we train SAM2VideoX, which contains two innovations: (1) a bidirectional feature fusion module that extracts global structure-preserving motion priors from a recurrent model like SAM2; (2) a Local Gram Flow loss that aligns how local features move together. Experiments on VBench and in human studies show that SAM2VideoX delivers consistent gains (+2.60\\% on VBench, 21-22\\% lower FVD, and 71.4\\% human preference) over prior baselines. Specifically, on VBench, we achieve 95.51\\%, surpassing REPA (92.91\\%) by 2.60\\%, and reduce FVD to 360.57, a 21.20\\% and 22.46\\% improvement over REPA- and LoRA-finetuning, respectively.

However, a closed-loop framework that jointly understands intrinsic scene properties (e.g., albedo, normal, material, and irradiance), leverages them for video synthesis, and supports editable intrinsic representations remains unexplored. We present V-RGBX, the first end-to-end framework for intrinsic-aware video editing. V-RGBX unifies three key capabilities: (1) video inverse rendering into intrinsic channels, (2) photorealistic video synthesis from these intrinsic representations, and (3) keyframe-based video editing conditioned on intrinsic channels. At the core of V-RGBX is an interleaved conditioning mechanism that enables intuitive, physically grounded video editing through user-selected keyframes, supporting flexible manipulation of any intrinsic modality. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results show that V-RGBX produces temporally consistent, photorealistic videos while propagating keyframe edits across sequences in a physically plausible manner. We demonstrate its effectiveness in diverse applications, including object appearance editing and scene-level relighting, surpassing the performance of prior methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "V-RGBX \u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u672c\u5f81\u611f\u77e5\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u4ea4\u7ec7\u6761\u4ef6\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u903c\u771f\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5149\u7167\u548c\u5916\u89c2\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ed\u73af\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8054\u5408\u7406\u89e3\u573a\u666f\u672c\u5f81\u5c5e\u6027\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u672c\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "V-RGBX \u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u7ec7\u6761\u4ef6\u673a\u5236\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u80fd\u529b\uff1a\u89c6\u9891\u9006\u6e32\u67d3\u5230\u672c\u5f81\u901a\u9053\u3001\u4ece\u8fd9\u4e9b\u672c\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u5408\u6210\u903c\u771f\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u5f81\u901a\u9053\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "result": "V-RGBX \u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u8c61\u5916\u89c2\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u91cd\u65b0\u7167\u660e\uff0c\u5176\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u903c\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "V-RGBX \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9996\u521b\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u5f81\u901a\u9053\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u903c\u771f\u7684\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0b\u4f20\u64ad\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}
