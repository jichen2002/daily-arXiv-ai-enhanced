However, efficient task offloading and resource allocation for time-critical applications in VEC remain challenging due to constrained network bandwidth and computational resources, stringent task deadlines, and rapidly changing network conditions. To address these challenges, we formulate a Deadline-Constrained Task Offloading and Resource Allocation Problem (DOAP), denoted as $\\mathbf{P}$, in VEC with both bandwidth and computational resource constraints, aiming to maximize the total vehicle utility. To solve $\\mathbf{P}$, we propose $\\mathtt{SARound}$, an approximation algorithm based on Linear Program rounding and local-ratio techniques, that improves the best-known approximation ratio for DOAP from $\\frac{1}{6}$ to $\\frac{1}{4}$. Additionally, we design an online service subscription and offloading control framework to address the challenges of short task deadlines and rapidly changing wireless network conditions. To validate our approach, we develop a comprehensive VEC simulator, VecSim, using the open-source simulation libraries OMNeT++ and Simu5G. VecSim integrates our designed framework to manage the full life-cycle of real-time vehicular tasks. Experimental results, based on profiled object detection applications and real-world taxi trace data, show that $\\mathtt{SARound}$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under varying network conditions while maintaining runtime efficiency.", "AI": {"conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684$\\mathtt{SARound}$\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728VEC\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u5378\u8f7d\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u820d\u5165\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6bd4\u7387\u6280\u672f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86$\\mathtt{SARound}$\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5728\u7ebf\u670d\u52a1\u8ba2\u9605\u548c\u5378\u8f7d\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3VEC\u4e2d\u56e0\u7f51\u7edc\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u622a\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u4e25\u683c\u53ca\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u4efb\u52a1\u5378\u8f7d\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u96be\u9898\u3002", "result": "$\\mathtt{SARound}$\u5c06DOAP\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u4ece$\\frac{1}{6}$\u63d0\u5347\u81f3$\\frac{1}{4}$\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa$\\mathtt{SARound}$\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u5316VEC\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5378\u8f7d\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

This decentralization is achieved through the implementation of microservice architectures, which require low latencies to meet stringent service level agreements (SLA) such as performance, reliability, and availability metrics. While cloud computing offers the large data storage and computation resources necessary to handle peak demands, a hybrid cloud and edge environment is required to ensure SLA compliance. This is achieved by sophisticated orchestration strategies such as Kubernetes, which help facilitate resource management. The orchestration strategies alone do not guarantee SLA adherence due to the inherent delay of scaling resources. Existing auto-scaling algorithms have been proposed to address these challenges, but they suffer from performance issues and configuration complexity. In this paper, a novel auto-scaling algorithm is proposed for SLA-constrained edge computing applications. This approach combines a Machine Learning (ML) based proactive auto-scaling algorithm, capable of predicting incoming resource requests to forecast demand, with a reactive autoscaler which considers current resource utilization and SLA constraints for immediate adjustments. The algorithm is integrated into Kubernetes as an extension, and its performance is evaluated through extensive experiments in an edge environment with real applications. The results demonstrate that existing solutions have an SLA violation rate of up to 23%, whereas the proposed hybrid solution outperforms the baselines with an SLA violation rate of only 6%, ensuring stable SLA compliance across various applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408ML\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5230Kubernetes\uff0c\u5c06SLA\u8fdd\u89c4\u7387\u4ece23%\u964d\u81f36%\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u533b\u7597\u548c\u519c\u4e1a\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u8981\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1SLA\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u9884\u6d4b\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\uff09\u548c\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u5668\uff08\u5b9e\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\u8d44\u6e90\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u96c6\u6210\u5230Kubernetes\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u4e2dSLA\u8fdd\u89c4\u7387\u4ec5\u4e3a6%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86SLA\u8fdd\u89c4\u7387\uff0c\u4ece\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u768423%\u964d\u81f36%\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684SLA\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3002"}}

In other situations the parallel tasks have constraints that require them to synchronize their start and possibly departure times. This is true of many parallelized machine learning workloads, and the popular Apache Spark processing engine has recently added support for Barrier Execution Mode, which allows users to add such barriers to their jobs. These barriers necessarily result in idle periods on some of the workers, which reduces their stability and performance, compared to equivalent workloads with no barriers.\n  In this paper we will consider and analyze the stability and performance penalties resulting from barriers. We include an analysis of the stability of $(s,k,l)$ barrier systems that allow jobs to depart after $l$ out of $k$ of their tasks complete. We also derive and evaluate performance bounds for hybrid barrier systems servicing a mix of jobs, both with and without barriers, and with varying degrees of parallelism. For the purely 1-barrier case we compare the bounds and simulation results to benchmark data from a standalone Spark system. We study the overhead in the real system, and based on its distribution we attribute it to the dual event and polling-driven mechanism used to schedule barrier-mode jobs. We develop a model for this type of overhead and validate it against the real system through simulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u5c4f\u969c\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u548c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u5c4f\u969c\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u5bfc\u81f4\u5de5\u4eba\u7a7a\u95f2\u65f6\u95f4\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9$(s,k,l)$\u5c4f\u969c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6df7\u5408\u5c4f\u969c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u754c\u9650\u63a8\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5c4f\u969c\u786e\u5b9e\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5c4f\u969c\u5bf9\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

While compact models are the ultimate deployment target, conventional pruning-aware distributed training systems typically fail to reduce communication overhead because unstructured sparsity cannot be efficiently exploited by highly optimized dense collective primitives. We present PruneX, a distributed data-parallel training system that co-designs pruning algorithms with cluster hierarchy to reduce inter-node bandwidth usage. PruneX introduces the Hierarchical Structured ADMM (H-SADMM) algorithm, which enforces node-level structured sparsity before inter-node synchronization, enabling dynamic buffer compaction that eliminates both zero-valued transmissions and indexing overhead. The system adopts a leader-follower execution model with separated intra-node and inter-node process groups, performing dense collectives on compacted tensors over bandwidth-limited links while confining full synchronization to high-bandwidth intra-node interconnects. Evaluation on ResNet architectures across 64 GPUs demonstrates that PruneX reduces inter-node communication volume by approximately 60% and achieves 6.75x strong scaling speedup, outperforming the dense baseline (5.81x) and Top-K gradient compression (3.71x) on the Puhti supercomputer at CSC - IT Center for Science (Finland).", "AI": {"tldr": "PruneX\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u526a\u679d\u548c\u96c6\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u591a\u8282\u70b9GPU\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u5e26\u5bbd\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u526a\u679d\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u65e0\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "PruneX\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u5316ADMM\uff08H-SADMM\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8282\u70b9\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u9886\u5bfc\u8005-\u8ddf\u968f\u8005\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u4e86\u8282\u70b9\u5185\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u8fdb\u7a0b\u7ec4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7d27\u51d1\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u96c6\u5408\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u572864\u4e2aGPU\u4e0a\u5bf9ResNet\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cPruneX\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7ea660%\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e866.75\u500d\u7684\u5f3a\u6269\u5c55\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u57fa\u7ebf\uff085.81\u500d\uff09\u548cTop-K\u68af\u5ea6\u538b\u7f29\uff083.71\u500d\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "PruneX\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u526a\u679d\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u96c6\u7fa4\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5f3a\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Meanwhile, video diffusion models have recently demonstrated remarkable motion imagination in 2D, generating dynamic and visually coherent motion from text or image prompts. However, their results lack explicit 3D structure and cannot be directly used for animation or simulation. We present AnimaMimic, a framework that animates static 3D meshes using motion priors learned from video diffusion models. Starting from an input mesh, AnimaMimic synthesizes a monocular animation video, automatically constructs a skeleton with skinning weights, and refines joint parameters through differentiable rendering and video-based supervision. To further enhance realism, we integrate a differentiable simulation module that refines mesh deformation through physically grounded soft-tissue dynamics. Our method bridges the creativity of video diffusion and the structural control of 3D rigged animation, producing physically plausible, temporally coherent, and artist-editable motion sequences that integrate seamlessly into standard animation pipelines.

Nevertheless, providing high-speed internet access in these regions is essential to promote digital inclusion. 5G Fixed Wireless Access (5G FWA) has emerged as a promising alternative; however, its one-hop topology limits coverage. To overcome this limitation, a multi-hop architecture is required. This work proposes a unified multi-hop framework that integrates long-haul microwave, Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB), and FWA to provide wide coverage and high capacity in rural areas. As the number of hops increases, total energy consumption also rises, a challenge often overlooked in existing literature. To address this, we propose an energy-efficient multi-radio microwave and IAB-based FWA framework for rural area connectivity. When the network is underutilized, the proposed approach dynamically operates at reduced capacity to minimize energy consumption. We optimize the off, start-up, serving, deep sleep, and wake-up sates of microwave radios to balance energy use and satisfying data rate requirements. Additionally, we optimize resource block allocation for IAB-based FWA nodes connected to microwave backhaul. The formulated optimization problems aim to minimize the energy consumption of long-haul microwave and multi-hop IAB-based network while satisfying data rate constraints. These problems are solved using dual decomposition and multi-convex programming, supported by dynamic programming.

While earlier works emphasize highly diverse predictions, they often generate unrealistic human motions. More recent methods focus on accuracy and real-time performance, yet there remains potential to improve prediction quality further without exceeding time budgets. Additionally, current research on stochastic human motion prediction in HRC typically considers human motion in isolation, neglecting the influence of robot motion on human behavior. To address these research gaps and enable real-time, realistic, and interaction-aware human motion prediction, we propose a novel prediction-refinement framework that integrates both human and robot observed motion to refine the initial predictions produced by a pretrained state-of-the-art predictor. The refinement module employs a Flow Matching structure to account for uncertainty. Experimental studies on the HRC desktop disassembly dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves prediction accuracy while preserving the uncertainties and multi-modalities of human motion.

Through 26 semi-structured interviews with practitioners from different application domains and with varied backgrounds across 23 countries, we conducted research on fairness requirements in AI from software engineering perspective. Our study assesses the participants' awareness of fairness in AI / ML software and its application within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), from translating fairness concerns into requirements to assessing their arising early in the SDLC. It also examines fairness through the key assessment dimensions of implementation, validation, evaluation, and how it is balanced with trade-offs involving other priorities, such as addressing all the software functionalities and meeting critical delivery deadlines. Findings of our thematic qualitative analysis show that while our participants recognize the aforementioned AI fairness dimensions, practices are inconsistent, and fairness is often deprioritized with noticeable knowledge gaps.

The $b$-coloring problem, in which the task is to decide whether a graph admits a $b$-coloring with $k$ colors, is NP-complete in general but polytime solvable on trees. Moreover, it is known that $b$-coloring is in XP but W[$t$]-hard for all $t \\in \\mathbb{N}$ when parameterized by tree-width. In fact, only very few parameters, such as the vertex cover number, were known to admit an FPT algorithm for $b$-coloring. In this paper, we consider a more restrictive parameter measuring similarity to trees than tree-width, namely the feedback edge number, and show that $b$-coloring is fixed-parameter tractable under this parameterization.

Leveraging CMER-Bench, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of existing MER models and general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The results reveal that while current methods perform well on easy and moderate expressions, their performance degrades significantly when handling complex mathematical expressions, mainly because existing public training datasets are primarily composed of simple samples. In response, we propose MER-17M and CMER-3M that are large-scale datasets emphasizing the recognition of complex mathematical expressions. The datasets provide rich and diverse samples to support the development of accurate and robust complex MER models. Furthermore, to address the challenges posed by the complicated spatial layout of complex expressions, we introduce a novel expression tokenizer, and a new representation called Structured Mathematical Language, which explicitly models the hierarchical and spatial structure of expressions beyond LaTeX format. Based on these, we propose a specialized model named CMERNet, built upon an encoder-decoder architecture and trained on CMER-3M.

To address this challenge, we propose AMID, an unsupervised Ambient Measurement-Integrated Diffusion with noise decoupling, which establishes clean SOMs directly from noisy measurements. AMID introduces a measurement-integrated strategy aligning measurement noise with the diffusion trajectory, and explicitly models coupling between measurement and diffusion noise across steps, an ambient loss is thus designed base on it to learn clean SOMs. Experiments on real CT and mammography datasets show that AMID outperforms existing methods in generation fidelity and yields more reliable task-based IQ evaluation, demonstrating its potential for unsupervised medical imaging analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "AMID\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5e72\u51c0\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u8c61\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u5b66SOM\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u771f\u5b9e\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u3002AMID\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "AMID\u91c7\u7528\u6d4b\u91cf\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u6d4b\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u660e\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u6269\u6563\u566a\u58f0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u7684\u73af\u5883\u635f\u5931\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u5e72\u51c0\u7684SOM\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAMID\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "AMID\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u5efa\u7acb\u5e72\u51c0\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u8c61\u6a21\u578b\uff08SOM\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9eCT\u548c\u4e73\u817aX\u5149\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Because these services directly influence public trust, any disruption can have significant societal and political consequences. Yet their supporting infrastructures remain vulnerable to outages from natural disasters, geopolitical tensions, and targeted attacks. Central to their operation is the authoritative Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure, the single source of truth that maps government domain names to service endpoints. While indispensable, this infrastructure also represents a potential and critical point of system failure. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive assessment framework with purpose-designed mechanisms to systematically evaluate the operational resilience of authoritative DNS infrastructure supporting government services. Complementing prior studies on website hosting, recursive resolution, and DNS record integrity, our work provides a holistic view of authoritative DNS operation. Our first contribution develops a multi-sourced data schema that characterizes a (government) domain's authoritative DNS infrastructure across four hierarchical levels: physical hosting infrastructure, server functionality, name servers, and individual hosting instances. Using data collected from six representative countries, our second contribution identifies resilience attributes at their finest applicable hierarchy across three operational phases: infrastructure placement, service configuration, and DNS record dispatch. Our method assigns numerical scores to each attribute and aggregates them algorithmically to enable consistent and cross-domain comparisons. We apply our method to government domains in the six countries, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in authoritative DNS resilience and pinpointing operational practices that require improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6743\u5a01DNS\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5f39\u6027\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u6570\u503c\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u516d\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u653f\u5e9c\u57df\u540d\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u5f39\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u653f\u5e9c\u670d\u52a1\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u516c\u4f17\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5176\u652f\u6301\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u81ea\u7136\u707e\u5bb3\u3001\u5730\u7f18\u653f\u6cbb\u7d27\u5f20\u548c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6743\u5a01DNS\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u662f\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u662f\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6545\u969c\u70b9\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u64cd\u4f5c\u5f39\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ece\u56db\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\uff08\u7269\u7406\u6258\u7ba1\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3001\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u529f\u80fd\u3001\u540d\u79f0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u548c\u5355\u4e2a\u6258\u7ba1\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff09\u63cf\u8ff0\u653f\u5e9c\u57df\u540d\u7684\u6743\u5a01DNS\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002\u6536\u96c6\u4e86\u516d\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u64cd\u4f5c\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u90e8\u7f72\u3001\u670d\u52a1\u914d\u7f6e\u548cDNS\u8bb0\u5f55\u5206\u53d1\uff09\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5c5e\u6027\u5206\u914d\u6570\u503c\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u805a\u5408\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u8de8\u57df\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5e94\u7528\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e8e\u516d\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u653f\u5e9c\u57df\u540d\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6743\u5a01DNS\u5f39\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u652f\u6301\u653f\u5e9c\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u6743\u5a01DNS\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u5f39\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5e94\u7528\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u516d\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u653f\u5e9c\u57df\u540d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002"}}

Meanwhile, field inspection with robots still depends on human teleoperation and manual reporting, which are labor-intensive. This paper aims to connect what a robot sees during autonomous navigation to the safety rules that are common in construction sites, automatically generating a safety inspection report. To this end, we proposed a multi-layer framework with two main modules: robotics and AI. On the robotics side, SLAM and autonomous navigation provide repeatable coverage and targeted revisits via waypoints. On AI side, a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based layer produces scene descriptions; a retrieval component powered grounds those descriptions in OSHA and site policies; Another VLM-based layer assesses the safety situation based on rules; and finally Large Language Model (LLM) layer generates safety reports based on previous outputs. The framework is validated with a proof-of-concept implementation and evaluated in a lab environment that simulates common hazards across three scenarios. Results show high recall with competitive precision compared to state-of-the-art closed-source models. This paper contributes a transparent, generalizable pipeline that moves beyond black-box models by exposing intermediate artifacts from each layer and keeping the human in the loop.

However, the effectiveness of tool use depends heavily on the quality of the associated documentation and knowledge base context. These materials are usually written for human users and are often misaligned with how LLMs interpret information. This problem is even more pronounced in industrial settings, where hundreds of tools with overlapping functionality create challenges in scalability, variability, and ambiguity. We propose Verification-Guided Context Optimization (VGCO), a framework that uses LLMs as editors to automatically refine tool-related documentation and knowledge base context. VGCO works in two stages. First, Evaluation collects real-world failure cases and identifies mismatches between tools and their context. Second, Optimization performs hierarchical editing through offline learning with structure-aware, in-context optimization. The novelty of our LLM editors has three main aspects. First, they use a hierarchical structure that naturally integrates into the tool-calling workflow. Second, they are state-aware, action-specific, and verification-guided, which constrains the search space and enables efficient, targeted improvements.

However, conventional construction methods demand extensive location-labeled data, which are costly and impractical in many real-world scenarios. This paper presents a blind radio map construction framework that infers user trajectories from indoor multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) channel measurements without relying on location labels. It first proves that channel state information (CSI) under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) exhibits spatial continuity under a quasi-specular environmental model, allowing the derivation of a CSI-distance metric that is proportional to the corresponding physical distance. For rectilinear trajectories in Poisson-distributed access point (AP) deployments, it is shown that the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) of localization error vanishes asymptotically, even under poor angular resolution. Building on these theoretical results, a spatially regularized Bayesian inference framework is developed that jointly estimates channel features, distinguishes line-of-sight (LOS)/NLOS conditions and recovers user trajectories.

(2) Experiment 2 builds a human-in-the-loop modular pipeline combining high-precision segmentation (SAM, GroundingDINO), semantic alignment (BrushNet), and style regulating (Style-LoRA, Prompt-to-Prompt), ensuring editorial fidelity through CLIP-based semantic scoring, NSFW/OCR/YOLO filtering, and verifiable content credentials.

Existing visual methods often suffer from drift, scale ambiguity, and depend on fiducials or loop closure. This work introduces a real-time method for localizing a camera within a pre-captured, highly accurate colored LiDAR point cloud. By rendering synthetic views from this cloud, 2D-3D correspondences are established between live frames and the point cloud. A neural rendering technique narrows the domain gap between synthetic and real images, reducing occlusion and background artifacts to improve feature matching.

This paper investigates how a robot's task performance and its expressive responses after outcomes shape the dynamics of human trust over time. To this end, we designed a controlled within-subjects study with two construction-inspired tasks, Material Delivery (physical assistance) and Information Gathering (perceptual assistance), and measured trust repeatedly (four times per task) using the 14-item Trust Perception Scale for HRI plus a redelegation choice. The robot produced two multimodal expressions, a \"glad\" display with a brief confirmation after success, and a \"sad\" display with an apology and a request for a second chance after failure. The study was conducted in a lab environment with 30 participants and a quadruped platform, and we evaluated trust dynamics and repair across both tasks. Results show that robot success reliably increases trust, failure causes sharp drops, and apology-based expressions partially restores trust (44% recovery in Material Delivery; 38% in Information Gathering). Item-level analysis indicates that recovered trust was driven mostly by interaction and communication factors, with competence recovering partially and autonomy aspects changing least. Additionally, age group and prior attitudes moderated trust dynamics with younger participants showed larger but shorter-lived changes, mid-20s participants exhibited the most durable repair, and older participants showed most conservative dynamics.

Recent studies demonstrate an average 39% performance drop when instructions are delivered across multiple turns, with models making premature assumptions and failing to course correct (Laban et al., 2025). This degradation is particularly problematic in exploratory programming tasks where developers need to investigate alternative approaches without committing to a single path. Current solutions force users into a false dichotomy: continue in a context-polluted conversation where the LLM becomes increasingly confused, or start fresh and lose all accumulated context.\n  We present ContextBranch, a conversation management system that applies version control semantics to LLM interactions. ContextBranch provides four core primitives--checkpoint, branch, switch, and inject--enabling users to capture conversation state, explore alternatives in isolation, and selectively merge insights. We evaluate ContextBranch through a controlled experiment with 30 software engineering scenarios featuring intentionally polluting explorations. Branched conversations achieved higher response quality compared to linear conversations, with large improvements in focus and context awareness. Benefits were concentrated in complex scenarios involving conceptually distant explorations. Branching reduced context size by 58.1% (31.0 to 13.0 messages), eliminating irrelevant exploratory content. Our work establishes conversation branching as a fundamental primitive for AI-assisted exploratory work, demonstrating that isolation prevents context pollution when exploring alternatives.", "AI": {"tldr": "ContextBranch\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5206\u652f\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3LLMs\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLMs\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u7f16\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6c61\u67d3\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faContextBranch\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u56db\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1acheckpoint\u3001branch\u3001switch\u548cinject\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u7ba1\u7406\u5bf9\u8bdd\u72b6\u6001\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u652f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5728\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u4e13\u6ce8\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u610f\u8bc6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5927\u5c0f\u51cf\u5c1158.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "ContextBranch\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7248\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2dLLMs\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

This problem is closely related to the classic maximum weight matching problem. In this paper, we propose a $10/17$-approximation algorithm, improving the best-known $7/12$-approximation algorithm (ESA 2015). Our result is obtained by making a trade-off among three algorithms. The first is based on the maximum weight matching of size $n/2$, the second is based on the maximum weight matching of size $n/3$, and the last is based on an approximation algorithm for star packing. Our first algorithm is the same as the previous $7/12$-approximation algorithm, but we propose a new analysis method -- a charging method -- for this problem, which is not only essential to analyze our second algorithm but also may be extended to analyze algorithms for some related problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u6700\u5927\u6743\u91cd3\u8def\u5f84\u5305\u88c5\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u5145\u7535\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u4ece7/12\u63d0\u5347\u81f310/17\u3002", "motivation": "\u6700\u5927\u6743\u91cd3\u8def\u5f84\u5305\u88c5\u95ee\u9898\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6743\u91cd\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\uff087/12\uff09\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ec4\u5408\u548c\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u5c0f\u4e3an/2\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6743\u91cd\u5339\u914d\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u5c0f\u4e3an/3\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6743\u91cd\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u661f\u5305\u88c5\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5145\u7535\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u768410/17-\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u76847/12-\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5145\u7535\u65b9\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5145\u7535\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u6700\u5927\u6743\u91cd3\u8def\u5f84\u5305\u88c5\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u4e4b\u524d\u76847/12\u63d0\u5347\u81f310/17\u3002"}}

Adjudicator models this as a neuro-symbolic task, first constructing a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) to unify item context.

We validate our system on a 1,000-item balanced subset of the AlleNoise benchmark. Our KG-informed model achieves a 0.99 F1-score, significantly outperforming a single-LLM baseline (0.48 F1) and a non-KG council (0.59 F1). Our analysis reveals this is due to a Precision, achieved by a novel override logic that uses the KG to perfectly identify complex, structural errors (complete Recall) -- a class of errors that baselines fail to find.

Large language models can generate clinical text, yet they struggle with visual reasoning and often produce unstable or incorrect explanations. This leaves a gap between what a model sees and the type of reasoning a clinician expects. We introduce a framework that links image classification with structured clinical reasoning. A new hybrid model, MobileCoAtNet, is designed for endoscopic images and achieves high accuracy across eight stomach-related classes. Its outputs are then used to drive reasoning by several LLMs. To judge this reasoning, we build two expert-verified benchmarks covering causes, symptoms, treatment, lifestyle, and follow-up care. Thirty-two LLMs are evaluated against these gold standards. Strong classification improves the quality of their explanations, but none of the models reach human-level stability. Even the best LLMs change their reasoning when prompts vary. Our study shows that combining DL with LLMs can produce useful clinical narratives, but current LLMs remain unreliable for high-stakes medical decisions. The framework provides a clearer view of their limits and a path for building safer reasoning systems.

For texturing, conditional image generators now allow the synthesis of realistic RGB images of a 3D scene that align with the geometry of that scene. For appearance modeling, SVBRDF prediction networks recover material parameters from RGB images. Combining these technologies allows us to quickly generate SVBRDF maps for multiple views of a 3D scene, which can be merged to form a SVBRDF texture atlas of that scene. In this paper, we analyze the challenges and opportunities for SVBRDF prediction in the context of such a fast appearance modeling pipeline. On the one hand, single-view SVBRDF predictions might suffer from multiview incoherence and yield inconsistent texture atlases. On the other hand, generated RGB images, and the different modalities on which they are conditioned, can provide additional information for SVBRDF estimation compared to photographs. We compare neural architectures and conditions to identify designs that achieve high accuracy and coherence. We find that, surprisingly, a standard UNet is competitive with more complex designs.

These events violate IEC~61850-derived quality-of-service requirements and user-defined service-level agreements, hindering the reliable and timely delivery of control, monitoring, and best-effort traffic in IEC~61400-25-compliant wind power plants. Failure to maintain these requirements often results in delayed or lost control signals, reduced operational efficiency, and increased risk of wind turbine generator downtime.\n  To address these challenges, this study proposes a threshold-triggered Deep Q-Network self-healing agent that autonomically detects, analyzes, and mitigates network disruptions while adapting routing behavior and resource allocation in real time. The proposed agent was trained, validated, and tested on an emulated tri-clustered switch network deployed in a cloud-based proof-of-concept testbed.\n  Simulation results show that the proposed agent improves disruption recovery performance by 53.84% compared to a baseline shortest-path and load-balanced routing approach and outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including the Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System by 13.1% and the Deep Q-Network and traffic prediction-based routing optimization method by 21.5%, in a super-spine leaf data-plane architecture.\n  Additionally, the agent maintains switch thermal stability by proactively initiating external rack cooling when required. These findings highlight the potential of deep reinforcement learning in building resilience in software-defined industrial networks deployed in mission-critical, time-sensitive application scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6Q\u7f51\u7edc\u81ea\u6108\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4e49\u5de5\u4e1a\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u4e2d\u65ad\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6062\u590d\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u673a\u4e2d\u65ad\uff08\u5982\u7531\u826f\u6027\u6d41\u91cf\u7a81\u53d1\u548c\u4ea4\u6362\u673a\u70ed\u6ce2\u52a8\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u95ea\u65ad\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff09\u662f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4e49\u5de5\u4e1a\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u670d\u52a1\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u8fdd\u53cd\u4e86IEC 61850\u884d\u751f\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u8981\u6c42\u548c\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u7ea7\u522b\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9608\u503c\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6Q\u7f51\u7edc\u81ea\u6108\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4e3b\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u65ad\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\u8def\u7531\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5c06\u4e2d\u65ad\u6062\u590d\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8653.84%\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u8d85\u7ea7\u810a\u67f1\u53f6\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u9762\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5305\u62ec\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u7cca\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0813.1%\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6Q\u7f51\u7edc\u53ca\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8def\u7531\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0821.5%\uff09\u5728\u5185\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4e49\u5de5\u4e1a\u7f51\u7edc\u5f39\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002"}}

These two losses serve as good metrics for camera-LiDAR alignment results and require no complicated steps of data processing, feature extraction, or feature matching like most methods, rendering our method simple and adaptive to most scenes.

The promise of agents is that developers might write code quicker, delegate multiple tasks to different agents, and even write a full piece of software purely out of natural language.

This paper investigates how experienced developers use agents in building software, including their motivations, strategies, task suitability, and sentiments. Through field observations (N=13) and qualitative surveys (N=99), we find that while experienced developers value agents as a productivity boost, they retain their agency in software design and implementation out of insistence on fundamental software quality attributes, employing strategies for controlling agent behavior leveraging their expertise. In addition, experienced developers feel overall positive about incorporating agents into software development given their confidence in complementing the agents' limitations.

In the biomedical domain, however, even state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle with basic Medical Decision Making (MDM) tasks. We investigate this limitation using two challenging datasets: (1) three-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification (normal, mild cognitive impairment, dementia), where category differences are visually subtle, and (2) MIMIC-CXR chest radiograph classification with 14 non-mutually exclusive conditions. Our empirical study shows that text-only reasoning consistently outperforms vision-only or vision-text settings, with multimodal inputs often performing worse than text alone. To mitigate this, we explore three strategies: (1) in-context learning with reason-annotated exemplars, (2) vision captioning followed by text-only inference, and (3) few-shot fine-tuning of the vision tower with classification supervision. These findings reveal that current MLLMs lack grounded visual understanding and point to promising directions for improving multimodal decision making in healthcare.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524dMLLMs\u5728\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5dee\u5f02\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1\uff09\u5e26\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u6ce8\u91ca\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b2\uff09\u89c6\u89c9\u63cf\u8ff0\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\uff1b3\uff09\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u5fae\u8c03\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u6216\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u66f4\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u624e\u5b9e\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u5fae\u8c03\u7b49\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

WorldPlay draws power from three key innovations. 1) We use a Dual Action Representation to enable robust action control in response to the user's keyboard and mouse inputs. 2) To enforce long-term consistency, our Reconstituted Context Memory dynamically rebuilds context from past frames and uses temporal reframing to keep geometrically important but long-past frames accessible, effectively alleviating memory attenuation. 3) We also propose Context Forcing, a novel distillation method designed for memory-aware model. Aligning memory context between the teacher and student preserves the student's capacity to use long-range information, enabling real-time speeds while preventing error drift. Taken together, WorldPlay generates long-horizon streaming 720p video at 24 FPS with superior consistency, comparing favorably with existing techniques and showing strong generalization across diverse scenes.

We consider hybrid players where the computing capacity of edge servers (ESs) are augmented by vehicular-UAV agent pairs (AgPs) that can be proactively dispatched to overloaded hotspots. Unique key challenges should be addressed: highly uncertain spatio-temporal workloads, spatio-temporal coupling between road traffic and UAV capacity, forecast-driven contracting risks, and heterogeneous quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of human users (HuUs) and machine users (MaUs). To cope with these issues, we propose FUSION, a two-stage framework that tightly couples service demand prediction, agent deployment, and task scheduling. In the offline stage, a Pro-LNN module performs intelligent multi-step spatio-temporal demand forecasting at distributed ESs, whose outputs are exploited by an enhanced ant colony optimization-based routing scheme (eACO-VRP) and an auction-based incentive-compatible contracting mechanism (Off-AIC^2), to jointly determine ES-AgP contracts and pre-planned service routes. In the online stage, we formulate congestion-aware task scheduling as an potential game among HuUs, MaUs, and heterogeneous ES/UAV providers, and devise a potential-guided best-response dynamics (PG-BR) algorithm that provably converges to a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium.

The goal is to understand both task performance and the practical effort needed to deploy each approach on real jobs. The authors developed two teleoperation interfaces to control the robots and collect the demonstrations needed, both of which proved effective for training robots for long-horizon and dexterous tasks. In addition, the authors conduct a three-stage evaluation. First, the authors compare a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) policy with a Deep Q-network (DQN) imitation model to identify the stronger RL baseline, focusing on model performance, generalization, and a pick-up experiment. Second, three different VLA models are trained in two different scenarios and compared with each other. Third, the authors benchmark the selected RL baseline against the VLA model using computational and sample-efficiency measures and then a robot experiment on a multi-stage panel installation task that includes transport and installation. The VLA model demonstrates strong generalization and few-shot capability, achieving 60% and 100% success in the pickup phase. In comparison, DQN can be made robust but needs additional noise during tuning, which increases the workload.

We argue that current LLMs struggle not only due to data scarcity but, more importantly, because they lack supervision that guides interpretable and effective performance improvements. In this work, we introduce PerfCoder, a family of LLMs specifically designed to generate performance-enhanced code from source code via interpretable, customized optimizations. PerfCoder is fine-tuned on a curated collection of real-world optimization trajectories with human-readable annotations, and preference-aligned by reinforcement fine-tuning using runtime measurements, enabling it to propose input-specific improvement strategies and apply them directly without relying on iterative refinement. On the PIE code performance benchmark, PerfCoder surpasses all existing models in both runtime speedup and effective optimization rate, demonstrating that performance optimization cannot be achieved by scale alone but requires optimization stratetgy awareness. In addition, PerfCoder can generate interpretable feedback about the source code, which, when provided as input to a larger LLM in a planner-and-optimizer cooperative workflow, can further improve outcomes.

Prior work on joint human-scene reconstruction relies on data-driven priors and joint optimization with no physics in the loop, or recovers noisy geometry with artifacts that cause motion tracking policies with scene interactions to fail. In contrast, our key insight is to recover convex, clean, and simulation-ready geometry by fitting planar primitives to a point cloud reconstruction of the scene, via a simple clustering pipeline over depth, normals, and flow. To reconstruct scene geometry that might be occluded during interactions, we make use of human-scene contact modeling (e.g., we use human posture to reconstruct the occluded seat of a chair). Finally, we ensure that human and scene reconstructions are physically-plausible by using them to drive a humanoid controller via reinforcement learning. Our approach reduces motion tracking failure rates from 55.2\\% to 6.9\\% on human-centric video benchmarks (EMDB, PROX), while delivering a 43\\% faster RL simulation throughput. We further validate it on in-the-wild videos including casually-captured videos, Internet videos, and even Sora-generated videos.

However, existing navigation systems adopt fixed execution configurations without considering environmental dynamics based on available computing resources, e.g., with a high execution frequency and task workload. This static approach causes rigid flight strategies and excessive computations, ultimately degrading flight performance or even leading to failures in UAVs. Despite the necessity for an adaptive system, dynamically adjusting workloads remains challenging, due to difficulties in quantifying environmental complexity and modeling the relationship between environment and system configuration. Aiming at adapting to dynamic environments, this paper proposes E-Navi, an environmental-adaptive navigation system for UAVs that dynamically adjusts task executions on the CPUs in response to environmental changes based on available computational resources. Specifically, the perception-planning pipeline of UAVs navigation system is redesigned through dynamic adaptation of mapping resolution and execution frequency, driven by the quantitative environmental complexity evaluations. In addition, E-Navi supports flexible deployment across hardware platforms with varying levels of computing capability. Extensive Hardware-In-the-Loop and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed system significantly outperforms the baseline method across various hardware platforms, achieving up to 53.9% navigation task workload reduction, up to 63.8% flight time savings, and delivering more stable velocity control.", "AI": {"tldr": "E-Navi\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u73af\u5883\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u548c\u5730\u56fe\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u98de\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u50f5\u5316\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u611f\u77e5-\u89c4\u5212\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u73af\u5883\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5730\u56fe\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u6267\u884c\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7075\u6d3b\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cE-Navi\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u786c\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe53.9%\uff0c\u98de\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u8282\u7701\u9ad8\u8fbe63.8%\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "E-Navi\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u9891\u7387\u548c\u5730\u56fe\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u548c\u98de\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

Although recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities for automation, existing applications rely on simplistic prompting without task decomposition or domain adaptation, resulting in unreliable black-box behavior and limited insight into model capabilities across penetration testing stages. To address this gap, we introduce PentestEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs across six decomposed penetration testing stages: Information Collection, Weakness Gathering and Filtering, Attack Decision-Making, Exploit Generation and Revision. PentestEval integrates expert-annotated ground truth with a fully automated evaluation pipeline across 346 tasks covering all stages in 12 realistic vulnerable scenarios. Our stage-level evaluation of 9 widely used LLMs reveals generally weak performance and distinct limitations across the stages of penetration-testing workflow. End-to-end pipelines reach only 31% success rate, and existing LLM-powered systems such as PentestGPT, PentestAgent, and VulnBot exhibit similar limitations, with autonomous agents failing almost entirely. These findings highlight that autonomous penetration testing demands stronger structured reasoning, where modularization enhances each individual stage and improves overall performance.

The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture, with its RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) modules, has emerged as a pivotal solution for dynamic resource management and network slicing. While artificial intelligence (AI) driven methods have shown promise, most approaches struggle to maintain performance under unpredictable and highly dynamic conditions. This paper proposes an adaptive Meta Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (Meta-HRL) framework, inspired by Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML), to jointly optimize resource allocation and network slicing in O-RAN. The framework integrates hierarchical control with meta learning to enable both global and local adaptation: the high-level controller allocates resources across slices, while low level agents perform intra slice scheduling. The adaptive meta-update mechanism weights tasks by temporal difference error variance, improving stability and prioritizing complex network scenarios.

Spatial downscaling methods aim to transform the coarse satellite data into high-resolution fields. In this work, two widely used deep learning architectures, the super-resolution deep residual network (SRDRN) and the encoder-decoder-based UNet, are considered for spatial downscaling of tropospheric ozone. Both methods are extended with a lightweight temporal module, which encodes observation time using either sinusoidal or radial basis function (RBF) encoding, and fuses the temporal features with the spatial representations in the networks. The proposed time-aware extensions are evaluated against their baseline counterparts in a case study on ozone downscaling over Italy.

While modern detectors such as YOLOv8 offer strong baseline performance, single-model pipelines struggle to remain robust across the extreme scale transitions that occur during descent, where helipads appear small at high altitude and large near touchdown. To address this limitation, we propose a scale-adaptive dual-expert perception framework that decomposes the detection task into far-range and close-range regimes. Two YOLOv8 experts are trained on scale-specialized versions of the HelipadCat dataset, enabling one model to excel at detecting small, low-resolution helipads and the other to provide high-precision localization when the target dominates the field of view. During inference, both experts operate in parallel, and a geometric gating mechanism selects the expert whose prediction is most consistent with the AAV's viewpoint. This adaptive routing prevents the degradation commonly observed in single-detector systems when operating across wide altitude ranges. The dual-expert perception module is evaluated in a closed-loop landing environment that integrates CARLA's photorealistic rendering with NASA's GUAM flight-dynamics engine. Results show substantial improvements in alignment stability, landing accuracy, and overall robustness compared to single-detector baselines.

Context-adaptive meta reinforcement learning addresses these limitations by conditioning on the task representation, yet they mostly rely on complete action information in the experience making task inference tightly coupled to a specific policy. This paper introduces Context Representation via Action Free Transformer encoder decoder (CRAFT), a belief model that infers task representations solely from sequences of states and rewards. By removing the dependence on actions, CRAFT decouples task inference from policy optimization, supports modular training, and leverages amortized variational inference for scalable belief updates. Built on a transformer encoder decoder with rotary positional embeddings, the model captures long range temporal dependencies and robustly encodes both parametric and non-parametric task variations. Experiments on the MetaWorld ML-10 robotic manipulation benchmark show that CRAFT achieves faster adaptation, improved generalization, and more effective exploration compared to context adaptive meta--RL baselines.

Property-based testing addresses this shortcoming by generating multiple inputs satisfying properties but requires significant manual effort to define properties and their constraints. We propose a semantics-based approach that automatically transforms unit tests into property-based tests by extracting specifications from implementations via single-path symbolic analysis. We demonstrate this approach through Teralizer, a prototype for Java that transforms JUnit tests into property-based jqwik tests. Unlike prior work that generalizes from input-output examples, Teralizer derives specifications from program semantics.\n  We evaluated Teralizer on three progressively challenging datasets. On EvoSuite-generated tests for EqBench and Apache Commons utilities, Teralizer improved mutation scores by 1-4 percentage points. Generalization of mature developer-written tests from Apache Commons utilities showed only 0.05-0.07 percentage points improvement. Analysis of 632 real-world Java projects from RepoReapers highlights applicability barriers: only 1.7% of projects completed the generalization pipeline, with failures primarily due to type support limitations in symbolic analysis and static analysis limitations in our prototype. Based on the results, we provide a roadmap for future work, identifying research and engineering challenges that need to be tackled to advance the field of test generalization.\n  Artifacts available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17950381", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faTeralizer\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u81ea\u52a8\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u53d6\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ec5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5355\u4e00\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u672a\u88ab\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u867d\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u624b\u52a8\u5de5\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4e49\u5c5e\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u8def\u5f84\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u4ece\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u5c06\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u81ea\u52a8\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u9010\u6b65\u6311\u6218\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30Teralizer\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5728EvoSuite\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cTeralizer\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e861-4\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u7684\u7a81\u53d8\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6210\u719f\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7f16\u5199\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6539\u8fdb\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002\u5206\u6790632\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684Java\u9879\u76ee\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4ec51.7%\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eTeralizer\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u6311\u6218\u4ee5\u63a8\u8fdb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6cdb\u5316\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

As deployment shifts toward edge and resource constrained environments, quantized models such as INT8 and NF4 are becoming standard. Yet the impact of precision reduction on formal causal reasoning is poorly understood. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate quantization effects across all three levels of Pearls Causal Ladder. Using a 3000 sample stratified CLadder benchmark, we find that rung level accuracy in Llama 3 8B remains broadly stable under quantization, with NF4 showing less than one percent overall degradation. Interventional queries at rung 2 are the most sensitive to precision loss, whereas counterfactual reasoning at rung 3 is comparatively stable but exhibits heterogeneous weaknesses across query types such as collider bias and backdoor adjustment. Experiments on the CRASS benchmark show near identical performance across precisions, indicating that existing commonsense counterfactual datasets lack the structural sensitivity needed to reveal quantization induced reasoning drift. We further evaluate Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation using ground truth causal graphs and observe a consistent improvement in NF4 interventional accuracy of plus 1.7 percent, partially offsetting compression related degradation.

This study introduces the Model of Things (MoT), a model-based approach that incorporates low-code principles to simplify CoT development. MoT reduces technical barriers by providing a custom UML profile designed for IoT and cloud services. To evaluate MoT, we conducted a case study and a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire. The results confirmed MoT's feasibility, demonstrating that it streamlines CoT application development and deployment. Users found MoT accessible, even with limited IoT experience, and reported high perceived ease of use and usefulness. Qualitative feedback highlighted MoT's ability to reduce complexity and speed up development. MoT offers a promising, model-driven solution for CoT application development.

In this paper, we study how to make diffusion on continuous motion latents work best. We focus on two questions: (1) how to build a semantically aligned latent space so diffusion becomes more effective, and (2) how to best inject text conditioning so the motion follows the description closely. We propose a semantic-aligned motion encoder trained with frame-level text labels so that latents with similar text meaning stay close, which makes the latent space more diffusion-friendly. We also compare single-token conditioning with a multi-token cross-attention scheme and find that cross-attention gives better motion realism and text-motion alignment. With semantically aligned latents, auto-regressive generation, and cross-attention text conditioning, our model sets a new state of the art in human motion generation on standard metrics and in a user study. We will release our code and models for further research and downstream usage.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoLingo\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6587\u672c\u5230\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u8fd0\u52a8\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u6700\u4f18\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u5982\u4f55\u6784\u5efa\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u6700\u4f73\u6ce8\u5165\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5e27\u7ea7\u6587\u672c\u6807\u7b7e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u66f4\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5355\u6807\u8bb0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u591a\u6807\u8bb0\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u6307\u6807\u548c\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b0\u6700\u4f18\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "MoLingo\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5728\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5e03\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4f9b\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u3002"}}

This paper presents SUPER (Sensitivity-based Uncertainty-aware PErformance and Risk assessment) that is a generic and explainable framework that propagates uncertainties via sensitivities for real-time risk assessment in VIO. The scientific novelty lies in the derivation of a real-time risk indicator that is backend-agnostic and exploits the Schur complement blocks of the Gauss-Newton normal matrix to propagate uncertainties. Practically, the Schur complement captures the sensitivity that reflects the influence of the uncertainty on the risk occurrence. Our framework estimates risks on the basis of the residual magnitudes, geometric conditioning, and short horizon temporal trends without requiring ground truth knowledge. Our framework enables to reliably predict trajectory degradation 50 frames ahead with an improvement of 20% to the baseline. In addition, SUPER initiates a stop or relocalization policy with 89.1% recall. The framework is backend agnostic and operates in real time with less than 0.2% additional CPU cost. Experiments show that SUPER provides consistent uncertainty estimates.

As these systems scale, sustainability concerns have intensified, with most assessments focusing on model architecture, hardware efficiency, and deployment infrastructure. However, existing mitigation efforts largely overlook how user interaction practices themselves shape the energy profile of LLM based systems. In this vision paper, we argue that interaction level behavior appears to be an underexamined factor shaping the environmental impact of LLM based systems, and we present this issue across four dimensions. First, extended conversational patterns increase token production and raise the computational cost of inference. Second, expectations of instant responses limit opportunities for energy aware scheduling and workload consolidation. Third, everyday user habits contribute to cumulative operational demand in ways that are rarely quantified. Fourth, the accumulation of context affects memory requirements and reduces the efficiency of long running dialogues. Addressing these challenges requires rethinking how chatbot interactions are designed and conceptualized, and adopting perspectives that recognize sustainability as partly dependent on the conversational norms through which users engage with LLM based systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\u662f\u5f71\u54cdLLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u73af\u5883\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u4e2a\u76f8\u5173\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u5f0f\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7f13\u89e3\u63aa\u65bd\u5927\u591a\u5ffd\u89c6\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b9e\u8df5\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e00\u56e0\u7d20\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\uff1a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u5373\u65f6\u54cd\u5e94\u671f\u671b\u3001\u7528\u6237\u4e60\u60ef\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u79ef\u7d2f\u3002", "result": "\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cdLLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba4\u8bc6\u5230\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u90e8\u5206\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u89c4\u8303\u3002"}}

Existing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods apply uniform adapter dimensions across all transformer layers, leading to suboptimal parameter allocation and reduced adaptation efficiency. We introduce Telescopic Adapters, a novel PEFT framework that employs depth-aware scaling to progressively increase adapter capacity from shallow to deep transformer layers. Our method integrates lightweight bottleneck modules within CLIPSeg's vision and text encoders, with adapter dimensions dynamically scaled based on layer depth and semantic relevance. Using only 613k trainable parameters--244x fewer than end-to-end fine-tuning, Telescopic Adapters achieve superior performance across five diverse medical datasets spanning polyp segmentation, skin lesion detection, and breast ultrasound imaging. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate that deeper layers require substantially more adaptation capacity than shallow layers, validating our telescopic scaling hypothesis.

This approach enables a paradigm shift from file-driven to intent-driven conversational interactions. The framework supports both fully automated execution and human-in-the-loop collaboration, allowing researchers to guide simulation strategies in real time and retain scientific decision-making authority while significantly reducing tedious low-level operations. Validated through multiple case studies, the workflow operates seamlessly in both autonomous and interactive modes, yielding high-fidelity results consistent with standard baselines. As the first application of MCP technology to computational seismology, this study significantly lowers the entry barrier, enhances reproducibility, and offers a promising avenue for advancing computational geophysics toward AI-assisted and automated scientific research.

On HaluEval ($n$=5,000), we observe large effect sizes (Cohen's $d$ ranging from 0.92 to 1.28) across five embedding models with mean cross-model correlation $r$=0.85. Crucially, we derive from the spherical triangle inequality that SGI's discriminative power should increase with question-context angular separation $\u03b8(q,c)$-a theoretical prediction confirmed empirically: effect size rises monotonically from $d$=0.61 -low $\u03b8(q,c)$, to $d$=1.27 -high $\u03b8(q,c)$, with AUC improving from 0.72 to 0.83. Subgroup analysis reveals that SGI excels on long responses ($d$=2.05) and short questions ($d$=1.22), while remaining robust across context lengths. Calibration analysis yields ECE=0.10, indicating SGI scores can serve as probability estimates, not merely rankings.

As a remedy, synthetic simulators are adopted to generate annotated data, with a low annotation cost. However, the domain gap between synthetic and real images hinders the model from being effectively applied to the target domain. Accordingly, we introduce Coarse-to-Fine Hierarchical Alignment (CFHA), a three-stage diffusion-based framework designed to transform synthetic data for UAV-based human detection, narrowing the domain gap while preserving the original synthetic labels. CFHA explicitly decouples global style and local content domain discrepancies and bridges those gaps using three modules: (1) Global Style Transfer -- a diffusion model aligns color, illumination, and texture statistics of synthetic images to the realistic style, using only a small real reference set; (2) Local Refinement -- a super-resolution diffusion model is used to facilitate fine-grained and photorealistic details for the small objects, such as human instances, preserving shape and boundary integrity; (3) Hallucination Removal -- a module that filters out human instances whose visual attributes do not align with real-world data to make the human appearance closer to the target distribution. Extensive experiments on public UAV Sim2Real detection benchmarks demonstrate that our methods significantly improve the detection accuracy compared to the non-transformed baselines.

Despite recent progress, current teleoperation systems still suffer from limitations in efficiency and ergonomics, particularly in challenging scenarios. In this paper, we propose CaFe-TeleVision, a coarse-to-fine teleoperation system with immersive situated visualization for enhanced ergonomics. At its core, a coarse-to-fine control mechanism is proposed in the retargeting module to bridge workspace disparities, jointly optimizing efficiency and physical ergonomics. To stream immersive feedback with adequate visual cues for human vision systems, an on-demand situated visualization technique is integrated in the perception module, which reduces the cognitive load for multi-view processing. The system is built on a humanoid collaborative robot and validated with six challenging bimanual manipulation tasks. User study among 24 participants confirms that CaFe-TeleVision enhances ergonomics with statistical significance, indicating a lower task load and a higher user acceptance during teleoperation. Quantitative results also validate the superior performance of our system across six tasks, surpassing comparative methods by up to 28.89% in success rate and accelerating by 26.81% in completion time.

Such methods discard useful variants, suffer from destructive edits, and explore a brittle search space prone to structural failure. We introduce EvoLattice, a framework that represents an entire population of candidate programs or agent behaviors within a single directed acyclic graph. Each node stores multiple persistent alternatives, and every valid path through the graph defines a distinct executable candidate, yielding a large combinatorial search space without duplicating structure. EvoLattice enables fine-grained alternative-level evaluation by scoring each alternative across all paths in which it appears, producing statistics that reveal how local design choices affect global performance. These statistics provide a dense, data-driven feedback signal for LLM-guided mutation, recombination, and pruning, while preserving successful components. Structural correctness is guaranteed by a deterministic self-repair mechanism that enforces acyclicity and dependency consistency independently of the LLM. EvoLattice naturally extends to agent evolution by interpreting alternatives as prompt fragments or sub-agent behaviors. Across program synthesis (proxy and optimizer meta-learning), EvoLattice yields more stable evolution, greater expressivity, and stronger improvement trajectories than prior LLM-guided methods.

With this in mind, one would expect video reasoning models to reason flexibly across different durations. However, SOTA models are still trained to predict answers in a single turn while processing a large number of frames, akin to watching an entire long video, requiring significant resources. This raises the question: Is it possible to develop performant any-horizon video reasoning systems? Inspired by human behavior, we first propose SAGE, an agent system that performs multi-turn reasoning on long videos while handling simpler problems in a single turn. Secondly, we introduce an easy synthetic data generation pipeline using Gemini-2.5-Flash to train the orchestrator, SAGE-MM, which lies at the core of SAGE. We further propose an effective RL post-training recipe essential for instilling any-horizon reasoning ability in SAGE-MM. Thirdly, we curate SAGE-Bench with an average duration of greater than 700 seconds for evaluating video reasoning ability in real-world entertainment use cases.

These may appear as gradual drifts, transient fluctuations, or abrupt shifts, demanding real-time adaptation that is robust to short-term variation yet responsive to lasting change. We propose a framework for modeling the nonlinear dynamics of robotic systems that can be updated in real time from streaming data. The method decouples representation learning from online adaptation, using latent representations learned offline to support online closed-form Bayesian updates. To handle evolving conditions, we introduce a changepoint-aware mechanism with a latent variable inferred from data likelihoods that indicates continuity or shift. When continuity is likely, evidence accumulates to refine predictions; when a shift is detected, past information is tempered to enable rapid re-learning. This maintains calibrated uncertainty and supports probabilistic reasoning about transient, gradual, or structural change. We prove that the adaptive regret of the framework grows only logarithmically in time and linearly with the number of shifts, competitive with an oracle that knows timings of shift.

However, FL continues to face key challenges, including weak client incentives, privacy risks, and resource constraints. Assessing client reliability is essential for fair incentive allocation and ensuring that each client's data contributes meaningfully to the global model. To this end, we propose MURIM, a MUlti-dimensional Reputation-based Incentive Mechanism that jointly considers client reliability, privacy, resource capacity, and fairness while preventing malicious or unreliable clients from earning undeserved rewards. MURIM allocates incentives based on client contribution, latency, and reputation, supported by a reliability verification module. Extensive experiments on MNIST, FMNIST, and ADULT Income datasets demonstrate that MURIM achieves up to 18% improvement in fairness metrics, reduces privacy attack success rates by 5-9%, and improves robustness against poisoning and noisy-gradient attacks by up to 85% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

However, DETR suffers from inefficient query competition where multiple queries converge to similar positions, leading to redundant computations. We present Route-DETR, which addresses these issues through adaptive pairwise routing in decoder self-attention layers. Our key insight is distinguishing between competing queries (targeting the same object) versus complementary queries (targeting different objects) using inter-query similarity, confidence scores, and geometry. We introduce dual routing mechanisms: suppressor routes that modulate attention between competing queries to reduce duplication, and delegator routes that encourage exploration of different regions. These are implemented via learnable low-rank attention biases enabling asymmetric query interactions. A dual-branch training strategy incorporates routing biases only during training while preserving standard attention for inference, ensuring no additional computational cost.

While above-canopy flight has reached a high level of autonomy, navigating under-canopy remains a significant challenge. The use of autonomous UAVs could reduce the burden of data collection, which has motivated the development of numerous solutions for under-canopy autonomous flight. However, the experiments conducted in the literature and their reporting lack rigor. Very rarely, the density and the difficulty of the test forests are reported, or multiple flights are flown, and the success rate of those flights is reported. The aim of this study was to implement an autonomously flying quadrotor based on a lightweight lidar using openly available algorithms and test its behavior in real forest environments. A set of rigorous experiments was conducted with a quadrotor prototype utilizing the IPC path planner and LTA-OM SLAM algorithm. Based on the results of the first 33 flights, the original system was further enhanced. With the optimized system, 60 flights were performed, resulting in a total of 93 test flights. The optimized system performed significantly better in terms of reliability and flight mission completion times, achieving success rates of 12/15 in a medium-density forest and 15/15 in a dense forest, at a target flight velocity of 1 m/s. At a target flight velocity of 2 m/s, it had a success rate of 12/15 and 5/15, respectively.

Georgiev, G${\u00f3}$mez-Serrano, Tao, and Wagner [GGSTW+25] demonstrate that AI systems can explore new constructions and improve existing bounds, illustrating the growing potential of LLMs to accelerate mathematical discovery. Similarly, Bubeck et al. [BCE+25] show that GPT-5 can meaningfully contribute to scientific workflows, from proposing hypotheses to generating proofs and analyses. Despite these advances, a rigorous evaluation of these models on canonical, graduate-level mathematical theory remains necessary to understand their baseline reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark of four frontier models: GPT-5-Thinking, Gemini-3-Pro, Claude-Sonnet-4.5-Thinking, and Grok-4 against the classic curriculum of Randomized Algorithms by Motwani and Raghavan [MR95].\n  We tasked each model with generating formal LaTeX proofs for a series of lemmas and exercises spanning the textbook. We find that while the top-tier models (Gemini, and Claude) achieve a high accuracy rate (approx. 66%), demonstrating a robust grasp of probabilistic method and formal logic, other models lag significantly in consistency (approx. 40%). We provide a qualitative analysis of the generated proofs, highlighting differences in conciseness, hallucination rates, and logical structure. Our results suggest that while frontier models have reached a threshold of proficiency suitable for graduate-level pedagogical assistance and formalization, significant variance exists in their reliability for rigorous mathematical derivation.

Unlike the regular K-NN attention mechanism, the proposed dynamic K-NN attention mechanism allows the model to adaptively determine the number of attention connections for each spatial location within a slice.

However, during deployment, the parameters of the underlying MPC must usually be fine-tuned. This often renders AMPC impractical as it requires repeatedly generating a new dataset and retraining the neural network. Recent work addresses this problem by adapting AMPC without retraining using approximated sensitivities of the MPC's optimization problem. Currently, this adaption must be done by hand, which is labor-intensive and can be unintuitive for high-dimensional systems. To solve this issue, we propose using Bayesian optimization to tune the parameters of AMPC policies based on experimental data. By combining model-based control with direct and local learning, our approach achieves superior performance to nominal AMPC on hardware, with minimal experimentation. This allows automatic and data-efficient adaptation of AMPC to new system instances and fine-tuning to cost functions that are difficult to directly implement in MPC.

It is crucial to detect both dynamic road users and static objects like traffic signs or lanes as these are required for safe motion planning. However, in many circumstances a complete perception of other objects or lanes is not achievable due to limited sensor ranges, occlusions, and curves. In scenarios where an accurate localization is not possible or for roads where no HD maps are available, an autonomous vehicle must rely solely on its perceived road information. Thus, extending local sensing capabilities through collective perception using vehicle-to-vehicle communication is a promising strategy that has not yet been explored for lane detection.

However, the standard Top-k routing strategy imposes a uniform sparsity pattern that ignores the varying difficulty of tokens. While Top-p routing offers a flexible alternative, existing implementations typically rely on a fixed global probability threshold, which results in uncontrolled computational costs and sensitivity to hyperparameter selection. In this paper, we propose DTop-p MoE, a sparsity-controllable dynamic Top-p routing mechanism. To resolve the challenge of optimizing a non-differentiable threshold, we utilize a Proportional-Integral (PI) Controller that dynamically adjusts the probability threshold to align the running activated-expert sparsity with a specified target. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic routing normalization mechanism that adapts layer-wise routing logits, allowing different layers to learn distinct expert-selection patterns while utilizing a global probability threshold. Extensive experiments on Large Language Models and Diffusion Transformers demonstrate that DTop-p consistently outperforms both Top-k and fixed-threshold Top-p baselines. Our analysis confirms that DTop-p maintains precise control over the number of activated experts while adaptively allocating resources across different tokens and layers. Furthermore, DTop-p exhibits strong scaling properties with respect to expert granularity, expert capacity, model size, and dataset size, offering a robust framework for large-scale MoE pre-training.", "AI": {"tldr": "DTop-p MoE \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001 Top-p \u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 PI \u63a7\u5236\u5668\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6 Top-k \u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c token \u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684 Top-p \u8def\u7531\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u5168\u5c40\u6982\u7387\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a7\u548c\u5bf9\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 DTop-p MoE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6bd4\u4f8b\u79ef\u5206\uff08PI\uff09\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u52a8\u6001 Top-p \u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u6982\u7387\u9608\u503c\u548c\u5c42\u95f4\u8def\u7531\u903b\u8f91\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDTop-p \u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e Top-k \u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u9608\u503c Top-p \u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u5bb9\u91cf\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0a\u7684\u5f3a\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DTop-p MoE \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u5206\u914d\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

While prior work targets general concepts (e.g., styles, celebrities), it fails to address specific brand identifiers. Crucially, we note that brand recognition is multi-dimensional, extending beyond explicit logos to encompass distinctive structural features (e.g., a car's front grille). To tackle this, we introduce unbranding, a novel task for the fine-grained removal of both trademarks and subtle structural brand features, while preserving semantic coherence. To facilitate research, we construct a comprehensive benchmark dataset. Recognizing that existing brand detectors are limited to logos and fail to capture abstract trade dress (e.g., the shape of a Coca-Cola bottle), we introduce a novel evaluation metric based on Vision Language Models (VLMs). This VLM-based metric uses a question-answering framework to probe images for both explicit logos and implicit, holistic brand characteristics. Furthermore, we observe that as model fidelity increases, with newer systems (SDXL, FLUX) synthesizing brand identifiers more readily than older models (Stable Diffusion), the urgency of the unbranding challenge is starkly highlighted. Our results, validated by our VLM metric, confirm unbranding is a distinct, practically relevant problem requiring specialized techniques.

Object perception is the main component of automotive surround sensing. Various metrics already exist for the evaluation of object perception. However, objects can be of different importance depending on their velocity, orientation, distance, size, or the potential damage that could be caused by a collision due to a missed detection.

While prior work largely focuses on pixel-space world models, these approaches face practical limitations in GUI settings, where predicting complex visual elements in future states is often difficult. In this work, we explore an alternative formulation of world modeling for GUI agents, where state transitions are described in natural language rather than predicting raw pixels. First, we introduce MobileWorldBench, a benchmark that evaluates the ability of vision-language models (VLMs) to function as world models for mobile GUI agents. Second, we release MobileWorld, a large-scale dataset consisting of 1.4M samples, that significantly improves the world modeling capabilities of VLMs. Finally, we propose a novel framework that integrates VLM world models into the planning framework of mobile agents, demonstrating that semantic world models can directly benefit mobile agents by improving task success rates.

These factors degrade image quality, while the scarcity and structural repetition of marine datasets limit the diversity of available training data. Although mask-conditioned diffusion models can synthesize layout-aligned samples, they often produce low-diversity outputs when conditioned on low-entropy masks and prompts, limiting their utility for improving robustness. In this paper, we propose a quality-driven and diversity-aware sample expansion pipeline that generates training data entirely at inference time, without retraining the diffusion model. The framework combines two key components:(i) a class-aware style bank that constructs high-entropy, semantically grounded prompts, and (ii) an adaptive annealing sampler that perturbs early conditioning, while a COD-guided proportional controller regulates this perturbation to boost diversity without compromising layout fidelity.

However, the substantial computational demand restricts access to LLM almost exclusively through cloud-based service, which makes LLM-based decision support tools impractical for dairy farming. To address this gap, lightweight alternatives capable of running locally on farm hardware are required. In this work, we benchmarked 20 open-source Small Language Models (SLM) available on HuggingFace under farm-realistic computing constraints. Building on our prior work, we developed an agentic AI system that integrates five task-specific agents: literature search, web search, SQL database interaction, NoSQL database interaction, and graph generation following predictive models. Evaluation was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, five test questions were used for the initial screening to identify models capable of following basic dairy-related instructions and performing reliably in a compute-constrained environment. Models that passed this preliminary stage were then evaluated using 30 questions (five per task category mentioned above, plus one category addressing integrity and misconduct) in phase two. In results, Qwen-4B achieved superior performance across most of task categories, although showed unstable effectiveness in NoSQL database interactions through PySpark. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly evaluating the feasibility of SLM as engines for dairy farming decision-making, with central emphases on privacy and computational efficiency.

This challenge, where a high-performing model fails catastrophically on external datasets, is a critical barrier to trustworthy AI. Addressing this requires moving beyond simple performance metrics toward deeper understanding, making Explainable AI (XAI) an essential diagnostic tool in medical image analysis. We present a rigorous, two-phase approach to diagnose the generalization failure of state-of-the-art State-Space Models (SSMs), specifically UMamaba, applied to cerebrovascular segmentation. We first established a quantifiable domain gap between our Source (RSNA CTA Aneurysm) and Target (TopCoW Circle of Willis CT) datasets, noting significant differences in Z-resolution and background noise. The model's Dice score subsequently plummeted from 0.8604 (Source) to 0.2902 (Target). In the second phase, which is our core contribution, we utilized Seg-XRes-CAM to diagnose the cause of this failure. We quantified the model's focus by measuring the overlap between its attention maps and the Ground Truth segmentations, and between its attention maps and its own Prediction Mask. Our analysis proves the model failed to generalize because its attention mechanism abandoned true anatomical features in the Target domain. Quantitative metrics confirm the model's focus shifted away from the Ground Truth vessels (IoU~0.101 at 0.3 threshold) while still aligning with its own wrong predictions (IoU~0.282 at 0.3 threshold). This demonstrates the model learned spurious correlations, confirming XAI is a powerful diagnostic tool for identifying dataset bias in emerging architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7XAI\u8bca\u65adUMamba\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8111\u8840\u7ba1\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u56e0\u9886\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u800c\u5931\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u9886\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u5931\u8d25\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56AI\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u91cf\u5316\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528Seg-XRes-CAM\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684Dice\u5206\u6570\u4ece0.8604\u964d\u81f30.2902\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u653e\u5f03\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u89e3\u5256\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8f6c\u5411\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "XAI\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u65b0\u5174\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u4e86\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002"}}

The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is often used as a foundation for this, but its signals can be unreliable in obstructed environments due to multi-path effects or loss-of-signal. While existing datasets compensate for the sporadic loss of GNSS signals by incorporating Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) measurements, the commonly used Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) or Fiber Optic Gyroscope (FOG)-based systems do not permit the prolonged study of GNSS-denied environments. To close this gap, we present Odyssey, a LIO dataset with a focus on GNSS-denied environments such as tunnels and parking garages as well as other underrepresented, yet ubiquitous situations such as stop-and-go-traffic, bumpy roads and wide open fields. Our ground truth is derived from a navigation-grade Inertial Navigation System (INS) equipped with a Ring Laser Gyroscope (RLG), offering exceptional bias stability characteristics compared to IMUs used in existing datasets and enabling the prolonged and accurate study of GNSS-denied environments. This makes Odyssey the first publicly available dataset featuring a RLG-based INS. Besides providing data for LIO, we also support other tasks, such as place recognition, through the threefold repetition of all trajectories as well as the integration of external mapping data by providing precise geodetic coordinates.

Existing chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting methods enhance model reasoning by eliciting intermediate steps, but suffer from two major limitations: First, their uniform application tends to induce overthinking on simple tasks. Second, they lack intention abstraction in code generation, such as explicitly modeling core algorithmic design and efficiency, leading models to focus on surface-level structures while neglecting the global problem objective. Inspired by the cognitive economy principle of engaging structured reasoning only when necessary to conserve cognitive resources, we propose RoutingGen, a novel difficulty-aware routing framework that dynamically adapts prompting strategies for code generation. For simple tasks, it adopts few-shot prompting; for more complex ones, it invokes a structured reasoning strategy, termed Intention Chain-of-Thought (ICoT), which we introduce to guide the model in capturing task intention, such as the core algorithmic logic and its time complexity. Experiments across three models and six standard code generation benchmarks show that RoutingGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in most settings, while reducing total token usage by 46.37% on average across settings.

However, existing CP approaches often optimize for vehicle detection performance metrics, underperforming on smaller, safety-critical objects such as pedestrians, where detection failures can be catastrophic. Furthermore, previous CP methods rely on full feature exchange rather than communicating only salient features that help reduce false negatives. To this end, we present FocalComm, a novel collaborative perception framework that focuses on exchanging hard-instance-oriented features among connected collaborative agents. FocalComm consists of two key novel designs: (1) a learnable progressive hard instance mining (HIM) module to extract hard instance-oriented features per agent, and (2) a query-based feature-level (intermediate) fusion technique that dynamically weights these identified features during collaboration. We show that FocalComm outperforms state-of-the-art collaborative perception methods on two challenging real-world datasets (V2X-Real and DAIR-V2X) across both vehicle-centric and infrastructure-centric collaborative setups.

However, a critical dichotomy persists: while models are rigorously benchmarked, the data fueling them remains a black box--characterized by opaque composition, uncertain provenance, and a lack of systematic evaluation. This opacity hinders reproducibility and obscures the causal link between data characteristics and model behaviors. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenDataArena (ODA), a holistic and open platform designed to benchmark the intrinsic value of post-training data. ODA establishes a comprehensive ecosystem comprising four key pillars: (i) a unified training-evaluation pipeline that ensures fair, open comparisons across diverse models (e.g., Llama, Qwen) and domains; (ii) a multi-dimensional scoring framework that profiles data quality along tens of distinct axes; (iii) an interactive data lineage explorer to visualize dataset genealogy and dissect component sources; and (iv) a fully open-source toolkit for training, evaluation, and scoring to foster data research. Extensive experiments on ODA--covering over 120 training datasets across multiple domains on 22 benchmarks, validated by more than 600 training runs and 40 million processed data points--reveal non-trivial insights. Our analysis uncovers the inherent trade-offs between data complexity and task performance, identifies redundancy in popular benchmarks through lineage tracing, and maps the genealogical relationships across datasets. We release all results, tools, and configurations to democratize access to high-quality data evaluation.

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic manipulation by leveraging large language models, yet remain fundamentally limited by Supervised Finetuning (SFT): requiring hundreds of demonstrations per task, rigidly memorizing trajectories, and failing to adapt when deployment conditions deviate from training. We introduce EVOLVE-VLA, a test-time training framework enabling VLAs to continuously adapt through environment interaction with minimal or zero task-specific demonstrations. The key technical challenge is replacing oracle reward signals (unavailable at test time) with autonomous feedback. We address this through a learned progress estimator providing dense feedback, and critically, we design our framework to ``tame'' this inherently noisy signal via two mechanisms: (1) an accumulative progress estimation mechanism smoothing noisy point-wise estimates, and (2) a progressive horizon extension strategy enabling gradual policy evolution.

Furthermore, our method offers additional advantages, including a more cost-efficient search process and the generation of modular, interpretable multi-agent systems with simpler logic.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8eLLM\u81ea\u7531\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u641c\u7d22\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406AI\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7126\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56LLM\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7ec4\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4f9d\u8d56LLM\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u95ee\u7b54\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u548c\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u903b\u8f91\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u867d\u7136\u7f3a\u4e4fLLMs\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u95ee\u7b54\u9886\u57df\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u903b\u8f91\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Key frame sampling is crucial for efficient long-form video understanding. In long video QA, selecting informative frames enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to improve both accuracy and efficiency. KFS-Bench addresses the limitation of prior works that only indirectly assess frame selection quality via QA accuracy. By providing ground-truth annotations of multiple disjoint scenes required per question, KFS-Bench allows us to directly analyze how different sampling approaches capture essential content across an entire long video. Using KFS-Bench, we conduct a comprehensive study of key frame sampling methods and identify that not only sampling precision but also scene coverage and sampling balance are the key factors influencing QA performance. Regarding all the factors, we design a novel sampling quality metric that correlates with QA accuracy. Furthermore, we develop a novel key frame sampling method that leverages question-video relevance to balance sampling diversity against question-frame similarity, thereby improving coverage of relevant scenes. Our adaptively balanced sampling approach achieves superior performance in both key frame sampling and QA performance.

Recent works on trajectory-conditioned video generation address this gap but often rely on 2D trajectories or single modality conditioning, which restricts their ability to produce controllable and consistent robotic demonstrations. We present DRAW2ACT, a depth-aware trajectory-conditioned video generation framework that extracts multiple orthogonal representations from the input trajectory, capturing depth, semantics, shape and motion, and injects them into the diffusion model. Moreover, we propose to jointly generate spatially aligned RGB and depth videos, leveraging cross-modality attention mechanisms and depth supervision to enhance the spatio-temporal consistency. Finally, we introduce a multimodal policy model conditioned on the generated RGB and depth sequences to regress the robot's joint angles.

We introduce HydroGEM (Hydrological Generalizable Encoder for Monitoring), a foundation model for continental-scale streamflow quality control. HydroGEM uses two-stage training: self-supervised pretraining on 6.03 million sequences from 3,724 USGS stations learns hydrological representations, followed by fine-tuning with synthetic anomalies for detection and reconstruction. A hybrid TCN-Transformer architecture (14.2M parameters) captures local temporal patterns and long-range dependencies, while hierarchical normalization handles six orders of magnitude in discharge. On held-out synthetic tests comprising 799 stations with 18 expert-validated anomaly types, HydroGEM achieves F1 = 0.792 for detection and 68.7% reconstruction-error reduction, a 36.3% improvement over existing methods.

While successful navigation demands both global environmental reasoning and local scene comprehension, existing UAV agents typically adopt mono-granularity frameworks that struggle to balance these two aspects. To address this limitation, this work proposes a History-Enhanced Two-Stage Transformer (HETT) framework, which integrates the two aspects through a coarse-to-fine navigation pipeline. Specifically, HETT first predicts coarse-grained target positions by fusing spatial landmarks and historical context, then refines actions via fine-grained visual analysis. In addition, a historical grid map is designed to dynamically aggregate visual features into a structured spatial memory, enhancing comprehensive scene awareness. Additionally, the CityNav dataset annotations are manually refined to enhance data quality. Experiments on the refined CityNav dataset show that HETT delivers significant performance gains, while extensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each component.", "AI": {"tldr": "HETT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5Transformer\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5386\u53f2\u7f51\u683c\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4ee3\u7406\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u7c92\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u5168\u5c40\u73af\u5883\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5386\u53f2\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5Transformer\uff08HETT\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5386\u53f2\u7f51\u683c\u5730\u56fe\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u573a\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6539\u8fdb\u7684CityNav\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cHETT\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HETT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728AVLN\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for pretraining these models on large-scale unlabeled image-tabular data, aiming to learn discriminative representations. However, existing SSL methods for image-tabular representation learning are often confined to specific data cohorts, mainly due to their rigid tabular modeling mechanisms when modeling heterogeneous tabular data. This inter-tabular barrier hinders the multi-modal SSL methods from effectively learning transferrable medical knowledge shared across diverse cohorts. In this paper, we propose a novel SSL framework, namely CITab, designed to learn powerful multi-modal feature representations in a cross-tabular manner. We design the tabular modeling mechanism from a semantic-awareness perspective by integrating column headers as semantic cues, which facilitates transferrable knowledge learning and the scalability in utilizing multiple data sources for pretraining.

Traditional structured light methods typically decode depth correspondences through pixel-domain matching algorithms, resulting in limited robustness under challenging scenarios like occlusions, fine-structured details, and non-Lambertian surfaces. Inspired by recent advances in neural feature matching, we propose a learning-based structured light decoding framework that performs robust correspondence matching within feature space rather than the fragile pixel domain. Our method extracts neural features from the projected patterns and captured infrared (IR) images, explicitly incorporating their geometric priors by building cost volumes in feature space, achieving substantial performance improvements over pixel-domain decoding approaches. To further enhance depth quality, we introduce a depth refinement module that leverages strong priors from large-scale monocular depth estimation models, improving fine detail recovery and global structural coherence. To facilitate effective learning, we develop a physically-based structured light rendering pipeline, generating nearly one million synthetic pattern-image pairs with diverse objects and materials for indoor settings. Experiments demonstrate that our method, trained exclusively on synthetic data with multiple structured light patterns, generalizes well to real-world indoor environments, effectively processes various pattern types without retraining, and consistently outperforms both commercial structured light systems and passive stereo RGB-based depth estimation methods.

Jones"], "title": "Georeferencing complex relative locality descriptions with large language models", "comment": "Provisionally accepted for publication in the International Journal of Geographical Information Science", "summary": "Georeferencing text documents has typically relied on either gazetteer-based methods to assign geographic coordinates to place names, or on language modelling approaches that associate textual terms with geographic locations. However, many location descriptions specify positions relatively with spatial relationships, making geocoding based solely on place names or geo-indicative words inaccurate. This issue frequently arises in biological specimen collection records, where locations are often described through narratives rather than coordinates if they pre-date GPS. Accurate georeferencing is vital for biodiversity studies, yet the process remains labour-intensive, leading to a demand for automated georeferencing solutions. This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to georeference complex locality descriptions automatically, focusing on the biodiversity collections domain. We first identified effective prompting patterns, then fine-tuned an LLM using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) on biodiversity datasets from multiple regions and languages.

For the first time, we explore the use of Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) as the core implicit map representation in a neural SLAM pipeline, a paradigm that trains a lightweight network to directly map 2D image features to 3D global coordinates. SCR networks provide efficient, low-memory 3D map representations, enable extremely fast relocalization, and inherently preserve privacy, making them particularly suitable for neural implicit SLAM.\n  Our system is the first one to achieve strict real-time in neural implicit RGB-D SLAM by relying on a SCR-based representation. We introduce a novel SCR architecture specifically tailored for this purpose and detail the critical design choices required to integrate SCR into a live SLAM pipeline. The resulting framework is simple yet flexible, seamlessly supporting both sparse and dense features, and operates reliably in dynamic environments without special adaptation. We evaluate our approach on established synthetic and real-world benchmarks, demonstrating competitive performance against the state of the art.

However, the added texture parameters introduce significant memory efficiency challenges. Rather than proposing new texture formulations, we take a step back to examine the characteristics of existing textured Gaussian methods and identify two key limitations in common: (1) Textures are typically defined in canonical space, leading to inefficient sampling that wastes textures' capacity on low-contribution regions; and (2) texture parameterization is uniformly assigned across all Gaussians, regardless of their visual complexity, resulting in over-parameterization. In this work, we address these issues through two simple yet effective strategies: adaptive sampling based on the Gaussian density distribution and error-driven anisotropic parameterization that allocates texture resources according to rendering error.

The primary objective is to determine whether LLMs alone can create comprehensive ontologies and, if not, whether human-LLM collaboration can achieve this goal. Consequently, the paper assesses the effectiveness of LLMs in automated ontology development and the enhancement achieved through human-LLM collaboration.\n  Initial ontology generation was performed using One Shot (OS) and Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts, demonstrating the capability of LLMs to autonomously construct ontologies for PD monitoring and alerting. However, these outputs were not comprehensive and required substantial human refinement to enhance their completeness and accuracy.\n  X-HCOME, a hybrid ontology engineering approach that combines human expertise with LLM capabilities, showed significant improvements in ontology comprehensiveness. This methodology resulted in ontologies that are very similar to those constructed by experts.\n  Further experimentation with SimX-HCOME+, another hybrid methodology emphasizing continuous human supervision and iterative refinement, highlighted the importance of ongoing human involvement. This approach led to the creation of more comprehensive and accurate ontologies.\n  Overall, the paper underscores the potential of human-LLM collaboration in advancing ontology engineering, particularly in complex domains like PD. The results suggest promising directions for future research, including the development of specialized GPT models for ontology construction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86LLM\u5728\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u76d1\u6d4b\u672c\u4f53\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7eafLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u4e0d\u591f\u5168\u9762\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982X-HCOME\u548cSimX-HCOME+\uff09\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u672c\u4f53\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u786e\u5b9aLLM\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u72ec\u7acb\u521b\u5efa\u5168\u9762\u7684\u672c\u4f53\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4e0d\u80fd\uff0c\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u6210\u8fd9\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aOne Shot\uff08OS\uff09\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\u3001Chain of Thought\uff08CoT\uff09\u63d0\u793a\u3001X-HCOME\u548cSimX-HCOME+\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u672c\u4f53\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u59cb\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u901a\u8fc7OS\u548cCoT\u63d0\u793a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86LLM\u81ea\u4e3b\u6784\u5efaPD\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u8b66\u62a5\u672c\u4f53\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0d\u591f\u5168\u9762\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u7ec6\u5316\u3002X-HCOME\u548cSimX-HCOME+\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u672c\u4f53\u7684\u5168\u9762\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662fSimX-HCOME+\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec6\u5316\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u534f\u4f5c\u5728\u63a8\u8fdb\u672c\u4f53\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\uff08PD\uff09\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u9886\u57df\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a2\u7d22\u5f00\u53d1\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u672c\u4f53\u6784\u5efa\u7684GPT\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made notable progress in automated chart understanding, yet they remain heavily dependent on explicit textual annotations and the performance degrades markedly when key numerals are absent. To address this limitation, we introduce ChartAgent, a chart understanding framework grounded in Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). Inspired by human cognition, ChartAgent decomposes complex chart analysis into a sequence of observable, replayable steps. Supporting this architecture is an extensible, modular tool library comprising more than a dozen core tools, such as keyelement detection, instance segmentation, and optical character recognition (OCR), which the agent dynamically orchestrates to achieve systematic visual parsing across diverse chart types. Leveraging TIRs transparency and verifiability, ChartAgent moves beyond the black box paradigm by standardizing and consolidating intermediate outputs into a structured Evidence Package, providing traceable and reproducible support for final conclusions. Experiments show that ChartAgent substantially improves robustness under sparse annotation settings, offering a practical path toward trustworthy and extensible systems for chart understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "ChartAgent\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eTIR\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u5e93\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e2d\u95f4\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MLLMs\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u6587\u672c\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u4e14\u5173\u952e\u6570\u5b57\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0cChartAgent\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "ChartAgent\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u5e93\uff08\u5982\u5173\u952e\u5143\u7d20\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u3001OCR\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u534f\u8c03\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u89e3\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316Evidence Package\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e2d\u95f4\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cChartAgent\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u6807\u6ce8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ChartAgent\u901a\u8fc7Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u6807\u6ce8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u4fe1\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

This failure stems from their reliance on ungrounded, text-based Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.While existing multi-modal CoT approaches attempt mitigation, they suffer from two fundamental flaws: (1) decoupled perception and reasoning stages that prevent end-to-end joint optimization, and (2) reliance on expensive, dense localization labels.Thus we introduce OmniDrive-R1, an end-to-end VLM framework designed for autonomous driving, which unifies perception and reasoning through an interleaved Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (iMCoT) mechanism. Our core innovation is an Reinforcement-driven visual grounding capability, enabling the model to autonomously direct its attention and \"zoom in\" on critical regions for fine-grained analysis. This capability is enabled by our pure two-stage reinforcement learning training pipeline and Clip-GRPO algorithm. Crucially, Clip-GRPO introduces an annotation-free, process-based grounding reward.

Specifically, specialist dependency is eliminated by the Virtual Expert Team (VET). The VET collaborates with four virtual experts, including a Knowledge Retriever, Modeler, Coder, and Debugger, to emulate a human expert team for the VDS transferring workflow. These experts specialize in the domain of terminal VDS via a few-shot example learning approach. Through this approach, the experts are able to learn VDS-domain knowledge from a few VDS examples. These examples are retrieved via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism, mitigating the high demand for terminal-specific data.

While small-parameter models are progressively endowed with strong general capabilities, standard Vision Transformer (ViT) encoders remain a critical bottleneck, suffering from excessive latency and memory consumption when processing high-resolution inputs.To address these challenges, we introduce HyperVL, an efficient multimodal large language model tailored for on-device inference. HyperVL adopts an image-tiling strategy to cap peak memory usage and incorporates two novel techniques: (1) a Visual Resolution Compressor (VRC) that adaptively predicts optimal encoding resolutions to eliminate redundant computation, and (2) Dual Consistency Learning (DCL), which aligns multi-scale ViT encoders within a unified framework, enabling dynamic switching between visual branches under a shared LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyperVL achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of comparable size across multiple benchmarks.

In this work, we propose viewing both not as separate tasks but as subtasks of a unifying formulation, speech-conditional facial motion infilling. We explore facial motion infilling as a self-supervised pretext task that also serves as a unifying formulation of dynamic talking face synthesis. To instantiate this idea, we propose FacEDiT, a speech-conditional Diffusion Transformer trained with flow matching. Inspired by masked autoencoders, FacEDiT learns to synthesize masked facial motions conditioned on surrounding motions and speech. This formulation enables both localized generation and edits, such as substitution, insertion, and deletion, while ensuring seamless transitions with unedited regions. In addition, biased attention and temporal smoothness constraints enhance boundary continuity and lip synchronization. To address the lack of a standard editing benchmark, we introduce FacEDiTBench, the first dataset for talking face editing, featuring diverse edit types and lengths, along with new evaluation metrics. Extensive experiments validate that talking face editing and generation emerge as subtasks of speech-conditional motion infilling; FacEDiT produces accurate, speech-aligned facial edits with strong identity preservation and smooth visual continuity while generalizing effectively to talking face generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "FacEDiT\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u97f3\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563Transformer\u7edf\u4e00\u8bf4\u8bdd\u9762\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u8bed\u97f3\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u9996\u4e2a\u7f16\u8f91\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6FacEDiTBench\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u5c06\u8bf4\u8bdd\u9762\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u5176\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u8bed\u97f3\u6761\u4ef6\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u586b\u5145\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8bf4\u8bdd\u9762\u90e8\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FacEDiT\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5408\u6210\u63a9\u7801\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u504f\u7f6e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u7ea6\u675f\u589e\u5f3a\u8fb9\u754c\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u5507\u540c\u6b65\u3002", "result": "FacEDiT\u5728\u8bf4\u8bdd\u9762\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u8bed\u97f3\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684FacEDiTBench\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u7f16\u8f91\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "conclusion": "FacEDiT\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u8bf4\u8bdd\u9762\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u8bed\u97f3\u6761\u4ef6\u8fd0\u52a8\u586b\u5145\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u8bed\u97f3\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3002"}}

Including too few passages may omit critical information, while including too many can introduce noise and reduce the quality of the answer. Traditional approaches, such as fixed Top-$K$ retrieval and single-stage reranking, face the dilemma of selecting the right number of passages. This problem is particularly pronounced for factoid questions, which often require only a few specific pieces of evidence. To address this issue, we introduce \\emph{Context-Picker}, a reasoning-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from similarity-based ranking to minimal sufficient subset selection. Context-Picker treats context selection as a decision-making process optimized via a human-inspired, two-stage reinforcement learning schedule: a \\emph{recall-oriented} stage that prioritizes the coverage of reasoning chains, followed by a \\emph{precision-oriented} stage that aggressively prunes redundancy to distill a compact evidence set. To resolve reward sparsity, we propose an offline evidence distillation pipeline that mines \"minimal sufficient sets\" via a Leave-One-Out (LOO) procedure, providing dense, task-aligned supervision. Experiments on five long-context and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that Context-Picker significantly outperforms strong RAG baselines, achieving superior answer accuracy with comparable or reduced context lengths. Ablation studies indicate that the coarse-to-fine optimization schedule, the redundancy-aware reward shaping, and the rationale-guided format all contribute substantially to these gains.", "AI": {"tldr": "Context-Picker\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u56fa\u5b9aTop-K\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e73\u8861\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4e8b\u5b9e\u578b\u95ee\u9898\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Context-Picker\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9009\u62e9\u89c6\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u53ec\u56de\u5bfc\u5411\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u5bfc\u5411\uff09\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc1\u636e\u84b8\u998f\uff08LOO\uff09\u89e3\u51b3\u5956\u52b1\u7a00\u758f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cContext-Picker\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "conclusion": "Context-Picker\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684RAG\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5176\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u5197\u4f59\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u9020\u548c\u7406\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u683c\u5f0f\u90fd\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u3002"}}

Most existing studies on indoor daylight predictions were developed and tested for static scenes. This study proposes a multimodal deep learning framework that predicts indoor workplane illuminance distributions in real time from non-intrusive images with temporal-spatial features.

Existing strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and ReAct rely on implicit state tracking and lack an explicit problem representation. Inspired by classical AI planning, we propose Model-First Reasoning (MFR), a two-phase paradigm in which the LLM first constructs an explicit model of the problem, defining entities, state variables, actions, and constraints, before generating a solution plan. Across multiple planning domains, including medical scheduling, route planning, resource allocation, logic puzzles, and procedural synthesis, MFR reduces constraint violations and improves solution quality compared to Chain-of-Thought and ReAct. Ablation studies show that the explicit modeling phase is critical for these gains. Our results suggest that many LLM planning failures stem from representational deficiencies rather than reasoning limitations, highlighting explicit modeling as a key component for robust and interpretable AI agents.

To address these limitations, we propose CODSR, a controllable one-step diffusion network for image super-resolution. First, we propose an LQ-guided feature modulation module that leverages original uncompressed information from LQ inputs to provide high-fidelity conditioning for the diffusion process. We then develop a region-adaptive generative prior activation method to effectively enhance perceptual richness without sacrificing local structural fidelity. Finally, we employ a text-matching guidance strategy to fully harness the conditioning potential of text prompts.

While 3DGS exhibits robust reconstruction of scene appearance for novel-view synthesis, it lacks structural representations underlying those appearances (e.g., branching patterns of plants), which limits its applicability to tasks such as plant phenotyping. To achieve both high-fidelity appearance and structural reconstruction, we introduce GaussianPlant, a hierarchical 3DGS representation, which disentangles structure and appearance. Specifically, we employ structure primitives (StPs) to explicitly represent branch and leaf geometry, and appearance primitives (ApPs) to the plants' appearance using 3D Gaussians. StPs represent a simplified structure of the plant, i.e., modeling branches as cylinders and leaves as disks. To accurately distinguish the branches and leaves, StP's attributes (i.e., branches or leaves) are optimized in a self-organized manner. ApPs are bound to each StP to represent the appearance of branches or leaves as in conventional 3DGS. StPs and ApPs are jointly optimized using a re-rendering loss on the input multi-view images, as well as the gradient flow from ApP to StP using the binding correspondence information. We conduct experiments to qualitatively evaluate the reconstruction accuracy of both appearance and structure, as well as real-world experiments to qualitatively validate the practical performance.

While scene graphs offer a structured abstraction of surgical events, their full potential remains untapped. In this work, we introduce ProtoFlow, a novel framework that learns dynamic scene graph prototypes to model complex surgical workflows in an interpretable and robust manner.\n  Methods: ProtoFlow leverages a graph neural network (GNN) encoder-decoder architecture that combines self-supervised pretraining for rich representation learning with a prototype-based fine-tuning stage. This process discovers and refines core prototypes that encapsulate recurring, clinically meaningful patterns of surgical interaction, forming an explainable foundation for workflow analysis.\n  Results: We evaluate our approach on the fine-grained CAT-SG dataset. ProtoFlow not only outperforms standard GNN baselines in overall accuracy but also demonstrates exceptional robustness in limited-data, few-shot scenarios, maintaining strong performance when trained on as few as one surgical video. Our qualitative analyses further show that the learned prototypes successfully identify distinct surgical sub-techniques and provide clear, interpretable insights into workflow deviations and rare complications.\n  Conclusion: By uniting robust representation learning with inherent explainability, ProtoFlow represents a significant step toward developing more transparent, reliable, and data-efficient AI systems, accelerating their potential for clinical adoption in surgical training, real-time decision support, and workflow optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "ProtoFlow\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u624b\u672f\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AI\u8f85\u52a9\u624b\u672f\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u624b\u672f\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9\u63a8\u8fdbAI\u8f85\u52a9\u624b\u672f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u3001\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u4e3a\u624b\u672f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u5b8c\u5168\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "method": "ProtoFlow\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNN\uff09\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fdb\u884c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u578b\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u5c01\u88c5\u91cd\u590d\u3001\u4e34\u5e8a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u624b\u672f\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u539f\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728CAT-SG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cProtoFlow\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6GNN\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u624b\u672f\u89c6\u9891\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u52b2\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u539f\u578b\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u624b\u672f\u5b50\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6d41\u7a0b\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u7f55\u89c1\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "ProtoFlow\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5185\u5728\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u5176\u5728\u624b\u672f\u57f9\u8bad\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u548c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To overcome this, recent approaches attempt zero-shot 4D HOI generation with pre-trained image diffusion models. However, interaction cues are minimally distilled during the generation process, restricting their applicability across diverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose AnchorHOI, a novel framework that thoroughly exploits hybrid priors by incorporating video diffusion models beyond image diffusion models, advancing 4D HOI generation. Nevertheless, directly optimizing high-dimensional 4D HOI with such priors remains challenging, particularly for human pose and compositional motion. To address this challenge, AnchorHOI introduces an anchor-based prior distillation strategy, which constructs interaction-aware anchors and then leverages them to guide generation in a tractable two-step process. Specifically, two tailored anchors are designed for 4D HOI generation: anchor Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) for expressive interaction composition, and anchor keypoints for realistic motion synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchorHOI outperforms previous methods with superior diversity and generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "AnchorHOI\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u951a\u70b9\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb4D\u4eba-\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672c4D\u4eba-\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "AnchorHOI\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u951a\u70b9\uff08NeRF\u548c\u5173\u952e\u70b9\uff09\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAnchorHOI\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "AnchorHOI\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u951a\u70b9\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e864D\u4eba-\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) significantly enhances generation quality and controllability but doubles the computation by requiring both conditional and unconditional forward passes at every timestep. We present OUSAC (Optimized gUidance Scheduling with Adaptive Caching), a framework that accelerates diffusion transformers (DiT) through systematic optimization. Our key insight is that variable guidance scales enable sparse computation: adjusting scales at certain timesteps can compensate for skipping CFG at others, enabling both fewer total sampling steps and fewer CFG steps while maintaining quality. However, variable guidance patterns introduce denoising deviations that undermine standard caching methods, which assume constant CFG scales across steps. Moreover, different transformer blocks are affected at different levels under dynamic conditions. This paper develops a two-stage approach leveraging these insights. Stage-1 employs evolutionary algorithms to jointly optimize which timesteps to skip and what guidance scale to use, eliminating up to 82% of unconditional passes.

However, limited explainability and poor handling of complex spatial relations remain key challenges for real-world use. To address these issues, we introduce RUNE (Reasoning Using Neurosymbolic Entities), an approach that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with neurosymbolic AI to retrieve images by reasoning over the compatibility between detected entities and First-Order Logic (FOL) expressions derived from text queries. Unlike RS-LVLMs that rely on implicit joint embeddings, RUNE performs explicit reasoning, enhancing performance and interpretability. For scalability, we propose a logic decomposition strategy that operates on conditioned subsets of detected entities, guaranteeing shorter execution time compared to neural approaches. Rather than using foundation models for end-to-end retrieval, we leverage them only to generate FOL expressions, delegating reasoning to a neurosymbolic inference module. For evaluation we repurpose the DOTA dataset, originally designed for object detection, by augmenting it with more complex queries than in existing benchmarks. We show the LLM's effectiveness in text-to-logic translation and compare RUNE with state-of-the-art RS-LVLMs, demonstrating superior performance. We introduce two metrics, Retrieval Robustness to Query Complexity (RRQC) and Retrieval Robustness to Image Uncertainty (RRIU), which evaluate performance relative to query complexity and image uncertainty.

In this paper, we propose a novel training- and data-free unlearning framework that enables three distinct forgetting paradigms: (1) global unlearning of selected objects across all domains, (2) domain-specific knowledge removal (e.g., eliminating sketch representations while preserving photo recognition), and (3) complete unlearning in selective domains. By leveraging a multimodal nullspace through synergistic integration of text prompts and synthesized visual prototypes derived from CLIP's joint embedding space, our method efficiently removes undesired class information while preserving the remaining knowledge.

This is because directly recognizing text in degraded documents, particularly in color images, often results in unsatisfactory recognition performance. To address these issues, existing methods train independent generative adversarial networks (GANs) for different color channels to remove shadows and noise, which, in turn, facilitates efficient text information extraction. However, deploying multiple GANs results in long training and inference times. To reduce both training and inference times of document image enhancement and binarization models, we propose MFE-GAN, an efficient GAN-based framework with multi-scale feature extraction (MFE), which incorporates Haar wavelet transformation (HWT) and normalization to process document images before feeding them into GANs for training. In addition, we present novel generators, discriminators, and loss functions to improve the model's performance, and we conduct ablation studies to demonstrate their effectiveness. Experimental results on the Benchmark, Nabuco, and CMATERdb datasets demonstrate that the proposed MFE-GAN significantly reduces the total training and inference times while maintaining comparable performance with respect to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Recent advances of Large Language Models (LMMs) and motion analysis techniques provide new opportunities to address the above limitations. In this paper, we propose SportsGPT, an LLM-driven framework for interpretable sports motion assessment and training guidance, which establishes a closed loop from motion time-series input to professional training guidance. First, given a set of high-quality target models, we introduce MotionDTW, a two-stage time series alignment algorithm designed for accurate keyframe extraction from skeleton-based motion sequences. Subsequently, we design a Knowledge-based Interpretable Sports Motion Assessment Model (KISMAM) to obtain a set of interpretable assessment metrics (e.g., insufficient extension) by constrasting the keyframes with the targe models. Finally, we propose SportsRAG, a RAG-based training guidance model based on Qwen3.

While large tech companies rely on dedicated ML infrastructure engineers to analyze torch traces and benchmarks, such resource-intensive workflows are largely inaccessible to computer vision researchers in general. Among the challenges, pinpointing problematic trace segments within lengthy execution traces remains the most time-consuming task, and is difficult to automate with current ML models, including LLMs. In this work, we present the first benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate and improve ML models' ability to detect anti patterns in traces. Our dataset contains over 600 PyTorch traces from diverse computer vision models classification, detection, segmentation, and generation collected across multiple hardware platforms.

Despite their practical effectiveness,existing methods are inherently limited in both capability and robustness due to their dependence on single-trigger-single-object mappings and fragile pixel-level cues. We propose CIS-BA, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that redefines trigger design by shifting from static object features to continuous inter-object interaction patterns that describe how objects co-occur and interact in a scene. By modeling these patterns as a continuous interaction space, CIS-BA introduces space triggers that, for the first time, enable a multi-trigger-multi-object attack mechanism while achieving robustness through invariant geometric relations. To implement this paradigm, we design CIS-Frame, which constructs space triggers via interaction analysis, formalizes them as class-geometry constraints for sample poisoning, and embeds the backdoor during detector training. CIS-Frame supports both single-object attacks (object misclassification and disappearance) and multi-object simultaneous attacks, enabling complex and coordinated effects across diverse interaction states. Experiments on MS-COCO and real-world videos show that CIS-BA achieves over 97% attack success under complex environments and maintains over 95% effectiveness under dynamic multi-trigger conditions, while evading three state-of-the-art defenses.

Despite the rapid progress in 3D HPE, existing methods are typically trained and evaluated under disparate frameworks, lacking a unified framework for fair comparison. To address these limitations, we propose Fast3DHPE, a modular framework that facilitates rapid reproduction and flexible development of new methods. By standardizing training and evaluation protocols, Fast3DHPE enables fair comparison across 3D human pose estimation methods while significantly improving training efficiency. Within this framework, we introduce FastDDHPose, a Disentangled Diffusion-based 3D Human Pose Estimation method which leverages the strong latent distribution modeling capability of diffusion models to explicitly model the distributions of bone length and bone direction while avoiding further amplification of hierarchical error accumulation. Moreover, we design an efficient Kinematic-Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser that encourages the model to focus on kinematic joint hierarchies while avoiding unnecessary modeling of overly complex joint topologies. Extensive experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that the Fast3DHPE framework enables fair comparison of all methods while significantly improving training efficiency. Within this unified framework, FastDDHPose achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong generalization and robustness in in-the-wild scenarios.

Recent work on semantic uncertainty estimates relies on external models to cluster multiple sampled responses and measure their semantic consistency. However, these clustering methods are often fragile, highly sensitive to minor phrasing variations, and can incorrectly group or separate semantically similar answers, leading to unreliable uncertainty estimates. We propose Semantic Gaussian Process Uncertainty (SGPU), a Bayesian framework that quantifies semantic uncertainty by analyzing the geometric structure of answer embeddings, avoiding brittle clustering. SGPU maps generated answers into a dense semantic space, computes the Gram matrix of their embeddings, and summarizes their semantic configuration via the eigenspectrum.

SH struggle with high-frequency signals, exhibit Gibbs ringing artifacts, and fail to capture specular reflections - a key component of realistic rendering. Although alternatives like spherical Gaussians offer improvements, they add significant optimization complexity. We propose Spherical Voronoi (SV) as a unified framework for appearance representation in 3D Gaussian Splatting. SV partitions the directional domain into learnable regions with smooth boundaries, providing an intuitive and stable parameterization for view-dependent effects. For diffuse appearance, SV achieves competitive results while keeping optimization simpler than existing alternatives. For reflections - where SH fail - we leverage SV as learnable reflection probes, taking reflected directions as input following principles from classical graphics.

To fill this gap, we introduceSkyLume, a large-scale, real-world UAV dataset specifically designed for studying illumination robust 3D reconstruction in urban scene modeling: (1) We collect data from 10 urban regions data comprising more than 100k high resolution UAV images (four oblique views and nadir), where each region is captured at three periods of the day to systematically isolate illumination changes. (2) To support precise evaluation of geometry and appearance, we provide per-scene LiDAR scans and accurate 3D ground-truth for assessing depth, surface normals, and reconstruction quality under varying illumination. (3) For the inverse rendering task, we introduce the Temporal Consistency Coefficient (TCC), a metric that measuress cross-time albedo stability and directly evaluates the robustness of the disentanglement of light and material.

However, acquiring diverse and corner-case data remains costly and inefficient. Generative models have emerged as a promising solution by synthesizing realistic sensor data. However, existing approaches primarily focus on single-modality generation, leading to inefficiencies and misalignment in multimodal sensor data. To address these challenges, we propose OminiGen, which generates aligned multimodal sensor data in a unified framework. Our approach leverages a shared Bird\\u2019s Eye View (BEV) space to unify multimodal features and designs a novel generalizable multimodal reconstruction method, UAE, to jointly decode LiDAR and multi-view camera data.

Using MRI scans and deep learning models, we propose a new multi-view approach that considers spatial relationships between MRI views to detect MGMT methylation status. Importantly, our method extracts information from all three views without using a complicated 3D deep learning model, avoiding issues associated with high parameter count, slow convergence, and substantial memory demands. We also introduce a new technique for tumor slice extraction and show its superiority over existing methods based on multiple evaluation metrics. By comparing our approach to state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method.

Yet most prior systems model human behavior as a translation task co-speech gesture or text-to-motion that maps a fixed utterance to motion clips-without requiring agentic decision-making about when to move, what to do, or how to adapt across multi-turn dialogue. This leads to brittle timing, weak social grounding, and fragmented stacks where speech, text, and motion are trained or inferred in isolation. We introduce ViBES (Voice in Behavioral Expression and Synchrony), a conversational 3D agent that jointly plans language and movement and executes dialogue-conditioned body actions. Concretely, ViBES is a speech-language-behavior (SLB) model with a mixture-of-modality-experts (MoME) backbone: modality-partitioned transformer experts for speech, facial expression, and body motion. The model processes interleaved multimodal token streams with hard routing by modality (parameters are split per expert), while sharing information through cross-expert attention. By leveraging strong pretrained speech-language models, the agent supports mixed-initiative interaction: users can speak, type, or issue body-action directives mid-conversation, and the system exposes controllable behavior hooks for streaming responses. We further benchmark on multi-turn conversation with automatic metrics of dialogue-motion alignment and behavior quality, and observe consistent gains over strong co-speech and text-to-motion baselines. ViBES goes beyond \"speech-conditioned motion generation\" toward agentic virtual bodies where language, prosody, and movement are jointly generated, enabling controllable, socially competent 3D interaction.

However, the limited availability of annotated radar data poses a significant challenge for advancing radar-based perception systems. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework to generate 4D radar point clouds for training and evaluating object detectors. Unlike image-based diffusion, our method is designed to consider the sparsity and unique characteristics of radar point clouds by applying diffusion to a latent point cloud representation. Within this latent space, generation is controlled via conditioning at either the object or scene level. The proposed 4D-RaDiff converts unlabeled bounding boxes into high-quality radar annotations and transforms existing LiDAR point cloud data into realistic radar scenes.

Precise identification of WWTPs from satellite images enables environmental monitoring. Traditional methods like YOLOv8 segmentation require extensive manual labeling.

This study presents a structured methodology for VLM comparison, divided into zero-shot and few-shot streams specifically to identify WWTPs. The YOLOv8 was trained on a governmental dataset of 83,566 high-resolution satellite images from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and UAE: ~85% WWTPs (positives), 15% non-WWTPs (negatives). Evaluated VLMs include LLaMA 3.2 Vision, Qwen 2.5 VL, DeepSeek-VL2, Gemma 3, Gemini, and Pixtral 12B (Mistral), used to identify WWTP components such as circular/rectangular tanks, aeration basins and distinguish confounders via expert prompts producing JSON outputs with confidence and descriptions. The dataset comprises 1,207 validated WWTP locations (198 UAE, 354 KSA, 655 Egypt) and equal non-WWTP sites from field/AI data, as 600mx600m Geo-TIFF images (Zoom 18, EPSG:4326). Zero-shot evaluations on WWTP images showed several VLMs out-performing YOLOv8's true positive rate, with Gemma-3 highest.

Prevailing metrics for evaluating immunization success typically rely on measuring the visual dissimilarity between the output generated from a protected image and a reference output generated from the unprotected original. This approach fundamentally overlooks the core requirement of image immunization, which is to disrupt semantic alignment with attacker intent, regardless of deviation from any specific output. We argue that immunization success should instead be defined by the edited output either semantically mismatching the prompt or suffering substantial perceptual degradations, both of which thwart malicious intent. To operationalize this principle, we propose Synergistic Intermediate Feature Manipulation (SIFM), a method that strategically perturbs intermediate diffusion features through dual synergistic objectives: (1) maximizing feature divergence from the original edit trajectory to disrupt semantic alignment with the expected edit, and (2) minimizing feature norms to induce perceptual degradations. Furthermore, we introduce the Immunization Success Rate (ISR), a novel metric designed to rigorously quantify true immunization efficacy for the first time. ISR quantifies the proportion of edits where immunization induces either semantic failure relative to the prompt or significant perceptual degradations, assessed via Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).

Previous works to enhance VP have primarily focused on improving the quality of LLM-generated visual programs. However, they have neglected to optimize the VP-invoked pre-trained models, which serve as modules for the visual sub-tasks decomposed from the targeted tasks by VP. The difficulty is that there are only final labels of targeted VR tasks rather than labels of sub-tasks. Besides, the non-differentiable nature of VP impedes the direct use of efficient gradient-based optimization methods to leverage final labels for end-to-end learning of the entire VP framework. To overcome these issues, we propose EVPG, a method to Enhance Visual Programming for visual reasoning via Probabilistic Graphs. Specifically, we creatively build a directed probabilistic graph according to the variable dependency relationships during the VP executing process, which reconstructs the non-differentiable VP executing process into a differentiable exact probability inference process on this directed probabilistic graph. As a result, this enables the VP framework to utilize the final labels for efficient, gradient-based optimization in end-to-end supervised learning on targeted VR tasks.

Although existing approaches based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) attempt to improve temporal grounding, they still struggle to faithfully ground their answers in the relevant video evidence, leading to temporal mislocalization and hallucinations. In this work, we present Zoom-Zero, a coarse-to-fine framework that first localizes query-relevant segments and then temporally zooms into the most salient frames for finer-grained visual verification. Our method addresses the limits of GRPO for the GVQA task with two key innovations: (i) a zoom-in accuracy reward that validates the fidelity of temporal grounding prediction and facilitates fine-grained visual verification on grounded frames; (ii) token-selective credit assignment, which attributes rewards to the tokens responsible for temporal localization or answer generation, mitigating GRPO's issue in handling multi-faceted reward signals. Our proposed method advances grounded video question answering, improving temporal grounding by 5.2\\% on NExT-GQA and 4.6\\% on ReXTime, while also enhancing average answer accuracy by 2.4\\%. Additionally, the coarse-to-fine zoom-in during inference further benefits long-form video understanding by preserving critical visual details without compromising global context, yielding an average improvement of 6.4\\% on long-video benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Zoom-Zero\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86GVQA\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eGRPO\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728GVQA\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u6001\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u65f6\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Zoom-Zero\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\uff1a(i) \u653e\u5927\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65f6\u6001\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b(ii) \u4ee4\u724c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3GRPO\u5728\u591a\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728NExT-GQA\u548cReXTime\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u65f6\u6001\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53475.2%\u548c4.6%\uff0c\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53472.4%\uff0c\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53476.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "Zoom-Zero\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86GVQA\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u65f6\u6001\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-explaining framework that integrates Shapley value estimation as an auxiliary task during training, which achieves two key advancements: 1) a fair allocation of the model prediction scores to image patches, ensuring explanations inherently align with the model's decision logic, and 2) enhanced interpretability with minor structural modifications, preserving model performance and compatibility.

In this paper, we introduce a novel setting for MIL methods, inspired by proceedings in Neural Partial Differential Equation (PDE) Solvers. Instead of relying on complex attention-based aggregation, we propose an efficient, aggregator-agnostic framework that removes the complexity of correlation learning from the MIL aggregator. CAPRMIL produces rich context-aware patch embeddings that promote effective correlation learning on downstream tasks. By projecting patch features -- extracted using a frozen patch encoder -- into a small set of global context/morphology-aware tokens and utilizing multi-head self-attention, CAPRMIL injects global context with linear computational complexity with respect to the bag size. Paired with a simple Mean MIL aggregator, CAPRMIL matches state-of-the-art slide-level performance across multiple public pathology benchmarks, while reducing the total number of trainable parameters by 48%-92.8% versus SOTA MILs, lowering FLOPs during inference by 52%-99%, and ranking among the best models on GPU memory efficiency and training time.

Existing methods predominantly rely on learning robust global representations or implicit feature alignment, which often fail to model explicit spatial correspondences crucial for accurate localization. In this work, we propose a novel correspondence-aware feature refinement framework, termed CLNet, that explicitly bridges the semantic and geometric gaps between different views. CLNet decomposes the view alignment process into three learnable and complementary modules: a Neural Correspondence Map (NCM) that spatially aligns cross-view features via latent correspondence fields; a Nonlinear Embedding Converter (NEC) that remaps features across perspectives using an MLP-based transformation; and a Global Feature Recalibration (GFR) module that reweights informative feature channels guided by learned spatial cues. The proposed CLNet can jointly capture both high-level semantics and fine-grained alignments.

Existing detection methods typically rely on manipulation-specific cues, performing well on known forgery types but exhibiting severe limitations against emerging manipulation techniques. This poor generalization stems from their inability to adapt effectively to unseen forgery patterns. To overcome this, we leverage large-scale pretrained models (e.g. CLIP) to proactively probe the feature space, explicitly highlighting distributional gaps between real videos, known forgeries, and unseen manipulations. Specifically, FakeRadar introduces Forgery Outlier Probing, which employs dynamic subcluster modeling and cluster-conditional outlier generation to synthesize outlier samples near boundaries of estimated subclusters, simulating novel forgery artifacts beyond known manipulation types. Additionally, we design Outlier-Guided Tri-Training, which optimizes the detector to distinguish real, fake, and outlier samples using proposed outlier-driven contrastive learning and outlier-conditioned cross-entropy losses. Experiments show that FakeRadar outperforms existing methods across various benchmark datasets for deepfake video detection, particularly in cross-domain evaluations, by handling the variety of emerging manipulation techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "FakeRadar \u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b0\u5174\u4f2a\u9020\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5b9a\u4f2a\u9020\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5bf9\u5df2\u77e5\u4f2a\u9020\u7c7b\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b0\u5174\u4f2a\u9020\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "FakeRadar \u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982 CLIP\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528 Forgery Outlier Probing \u52a8\u6001\u5b50\u805a\u7c7b\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca Outlier-Guided Tri-Training \u7684\u4e09\u5143\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFakeRadar \u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "FakeRadar \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b0\u5174\u4f2a\u9020\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

Standard diagnostic practice combines hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained whole slide images with immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and molecular genetic tests to determine lymphoma subtypes, a process requiring costly equipment, skilled personnel, and causing treatment delays. Deep learning methods could assist pathologists by extracting diagnostic information from routinely available HE-stained slides, yet comprehensive benchmarks for lymphoma subtyping on multicenter data are lacking. In this work, we present the first multicenter lymphoma benchmarking dataset covering four common lymphoma subtypes and healthy control tissue. We systematically evaluate five publicly available pathology foundation models (H-optimus-1, H0-mini, Virchow2, UNI2, Titan) combined with attention-based (AB-MIL) and transformer-based (TransMIL) multiple instance learning aggregators across three magnifications (10x, 20x, 40x). On in-distribution test sets, models achieve multiclass balanced accuracies exceeding 80% across all magnifications, with all foundation models performing similarly and both aggregation methods showing comparable results. The magnification study reveals that 40x resolution is sufficient, with no performance gains from higher resolutions or cross-magnification aggregation. However, on out-of-distribution test sets, performance drops substantially to around 60%, highlighting significant generalization challenges. To advance the field, larger multicenter studies covering additional rare lymphoma subtypes are needed.

Yet automating the animation of vector graphics remains challenging for vision-language models (VLMs) despite recent progress in code generation and motion planning. VLMs routinely mis-handle SVGs, since visually coherent parts are often fragmented into low-level shapes that offer little guidance of which elements should move together. In this paper, we introduce a framework that recovers the semantic structure required for reliable SVG animation and reveals the missing layer that current VLM systems overlook. This is achieved through a statistical aggregation of multiple weak part predictions, allowing the system to stably infer semantics from noisy predictions. By reorganizing SVGs into semantic groups, our approach enables VLMs to produce animations with far greater coherence.

This research tackles two major challenges: capturing the subtle expression details present in real human faces, and reconstructing an intricate 3D head avatar from a single portrait image. To accurately model expression details, VASA-3D leverages the motion latent of VASA-1, a method that yields exceptional realism and vividness in 2D talking heads. A critical element of our work is translating this motion latent to 3D, which is accomplished by devising a 3D head model that is conditioned on the motion latent. Customization of this model to a single image is achieved through an optimization framework that employs numerous video frames of the reference head synthesized from the input image. The optimization takes various training losses robust to artifacts and limited pose coverage in the generated training data. Our experiment shows that VASA-3D produces realistic 3D talking heads that cannot be achieved by prior art, and it supports the online generation of 512x512 free-viewpoint videos at up to 75 FPS, facilitating more immersive engagements with lifelike 3D avatars.", "AI": {"tldr": "VASA-3D\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u97f3\u9891\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5355\u6b213D\u5934\u90e8\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u76843D\u5934\u90e8\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u8096\u50cf\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u590d\u67423D\u5934\u90e8\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u6355\u6349\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u8138\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u8868\u60c5\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "method": "VASA-3D\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528VASA-1\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u6f5c\u5728\u6761\u4ef6\u76843D\u5934\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5b9a\u5236\u3002\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u6709\u9650\u59ff\u6001\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVASA-3D\u751f\u6210\u76843D\u865a\u62df\u5934\u90e8\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u9ad8\u5e27\u7387\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "VASA-3D\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u8096\u50cf\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u76843D\u5934\u90e8\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u7ebf\u751f\u6210512x512\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u9ad8\u8fbe75 FPS\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u4e3a\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u4ea4\u4e92\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u3002"}}

O-Voxel can robustly model arbitrary topology, including open, non-manifold, and fully-enclosed surfaces, while capturing comprehensive surface attributes beyond texture color, such as physically-based rendering parameters. Based on O-Voxel, we design a Sparse Compression VAE which provides a high spatial compression rate and a compact latent space. We train large-scale flow-matching models comprising 4B parameters for 3D generation using diverse public 3D asset datasets. Despite their scale, inference remains highly efficient.

Existing approaches have advanced dynamic NVS by introducing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with implicit deformation fields or indiscriminately assigned time-varying parameters, surpassing NeRF-based methods. However, due to excessive model complexity and parameter redundancy, they incur large model sizes and slow rendering speeds, making them inefficient for real-time applications, particularly on resource-constrained devices. To obtain a more efficient model with fewer redundant parameters, in this paper, we propose Hybrid Gaussian Splatting (HGS), a compact and efficient framework explicitly designed to disentangle static and dynamic regions of a scene within a unified representation. The core innovation of HGS lies in our Static-Dynamic Decomposition (SDD) strategy, which leverages Radial Basis Function (RBF) modeling for Gaussian primitives. Specifically, for dynamic regions, we employ time-dependent RBFs to effectively capture temporal variations and handle abrupt scene changes, while for static regions, we reduce redundancy by sharing temporally invariant parameters. Additionally, we introduce a two-stage training strategy tailored for explicit models to enhance temporal coherence at static-dynamic boundaries. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces model size by up to 98% and achieves real-time rendering at up to 125 FPS at 4K resolution on a single RTX 3090 GPU.

In this paper, we present a unified formulation of different non-parametric quantization methods through the lens of lattice coding.

As a step forward, we explore a few possible candidates, including random lattices, generalized Fibonacci lattices, and densest sphere packing lattices. Among all, we find the Leech lattice-based quantization method, which is dubbed as Spherical Leech Quantization ($\u039b_{24}$-SQ), leads to both a simplified training recipe and an improved reconstruction-compression tradeoff thanks to its high symmetry and even distribution on the hypersphere. In image tokenization and compression tasks, this quantization approach achieves better reconstruction quality across all metrics than BSQ, the best prior art, while consuming slightly fewer bits.

Drawing inspiration from the developmental trajectory of human vision, we propose a progressive blurring curriculum to improve the generalization and robustness of CNNs. Human infants are born with poor visual acuity, gradually refining their ability to perceive fine details. Mimicking this process, we begin training CNNs on highly blurred images during the initial epochs and progressively reduce the blur as training advances. This approach encourages the network to prioritize global structures over high-frequency artifacts, improving robustness against distribution shifts and noisy inputs. Challenging prior claims that blurring in the initial training epochs imposes a stimulus deficit and irreversibly harms model performance, we reveal that early-stage blurring enhances generalization with minimal impact on in-domain accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed curriculum reduces mean corruption error (mCE) by up to 8.30% on CIFAR-10-C and 4.43% on ImageNet-100-C datasets, compared to standard training without blurring. Unlike static blur-based augmentation, which applies blurred images randomly throughout training, our method follows a structured progression, yielding consistent gains across various datasets. Furthermore, our approach complements other augmentation techniques, such as CutMix and MixUp, and enhances both natural and adversarial robustness against common attack methods.

Due to the inherent complexity of the real world, existing models have predominantly been developed and limited to be task-specific. We introduce UNITE, a Unified Semantic Transformer for 3D scene understanding, a novel feed-forward neural network that unifies a diverse set of 3D semantic tasks within a single model. Our model operates on unseen scenes in a fully end-to-end manner and only takes a few seconds to infer the full 3D semantic geometry. Our approach is capable of directly predicting multiple semantic attributes, including 3D scene segmentation, instance embeddings, open-vocabulary features, as well as affordance and articulations, solely from RGB images.

In this paper, we challenge the notion that the low-frequency bias of vanilla MLPs is an intrinsic, architectural limitation to learn high-frequency content, but instead a symptom of stable rank degradation during training. We empirically demonstrate that regulating the network's rank during training substantially improves the fidelity of the learned signal, rendering even simple MLP architectures expressive. Extensive experiments show that using optimizers like Muon, with high-rank, near-orthogonal updates, consistently enhances INR architectures even beyond simple ReLU MLPs. These substantial improvements hold across a diverse range of domains, including natural and medical images, and novel view synthesis, with up to 9 dB PSNR improvements over the previous state-of-the-art.

A central obstacle is the absence of reliable memorization detection mechanisms, limited quantitative evaluation, and poor generalization of existing privacy auditing methods across domains. To address this, we propose to view memorization detection as a unified problem at the intersection of re-identification and copy detection, whose complementary goals cover both identity consistency and augmentation-robust duplication, and introduce Latent Contrastive Memorization Network (LCMem), a cross-domain model evaluated jointly on both tasks. LCMem achieves this through a two-stage training strategy that first learns identity consistency before incorporating augmentation-robust copy detection. Across six benchmark datasets, LCMem achieves improvements of up to 16 percentage points on re-identification and 30 percentage points on copy detection, enabling substantially more reliable memorization detection at scale. Our results show that existing privacy filters provide limited performance and robustness, highlighting the need for stronger protection mechanisms. We show that LCMem sets a new standard for cross-domain privacy auditing, offering reliable and scalable memorization detection.

We identify a key underlying cause: attention collapse in existing attention sharing mechanisms, where either positional embeddings or semantic features dominate visual content retrieval, leading to over-editing or under-editing.To address this issue, we introduce SynPS, a method that Synergistically leverages Positional embeddings and Semantic information for faithful non-rigid image editing. We first propose an editing measurement that quantifies the required editing magnitude at each denoising step. Based on this measurement, we design an attention synergy pipeline that dynamically modulates the influence of positional embeddings, enabling SynPS to balance semantic modifications and fidelity preservation.By adaptively integrating positional and semantic cues, SynPS effectively avoids both over- and under-editing.

However, these denoisers rely largely on generic or hand-crafted priors and often fall short in accurately capturing the complex statistical structure of natural images. As a result, traditional plug-and-play (PnP) methods often lead to suboptimal reconstruction, especially in highly underdetermined regimes. Recently, score-based generative models have emerged as a powerful framework for accurately characterizing sophisticated image distribution. Yet, their direct use for posterior sampling typically incurs prohibitive computational complexity. In this paper, by exploiting the close connection between score-based generative modeling and empirical Bayes denoising, we devise a message-passing framework that integrates a score-based minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) denoiser for compressive image recovery. The resulting algorithm, named score-based turbo message passing (STMP), combines the fast convergence of message passing with the expressive power of score-based generative priors. For practical systems with quantized measurements, we further propose quantized STMP (Q-STMP), which augments STMP with a component-wise MMSE dequantization module. We demonstrate that the asymptotic performance of STMP and Q-STMP can be accurately predicted by a set of state-evolution (SE) equations. Experiments on the FFHQ dataset demonstrate that STMP strikes a significantly better performance-complexity tradeoff compared with competing baselines, and that Q-STMP remains robust even under 1-bit quantization. Remarkably, both STMP and Q-STMP typically converge within 10 iterations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u6846\u67b6\uff08STMP\u548cQ-STMP\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684PnP\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u901a\u7528\u6216\u624b\u5de5\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f46\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u53bb\u566a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\uff08MMSE\uff09\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cSTMP\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u5e73\u8861\uff0cQ-STMP\u57281-bit\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u901a\u5e38\u572810\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u5185\u6536\u655b\u3002", "conclusion": "STMP\u548cQ-STMP\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0cSTMP\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u800cQ-STMP\u57281-bit\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u4e24\u8005\u901a\u5e38\u572810\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u5185\u6536\u655b\u3002"}}

However, video synthesis by artificially shifting and scaling image instance masks fails to accurately model realistic motion in videos, such as perspective changes, movement by parts of one or multiple instances, or camera motion. To tackle this issue, we propose an unsupervised video instance segmentation model trained exclusively on real video data. We start from unsupervised instance segmentation masks on individual video frames. However, these single-frame segmentations exhibit temporal noise and their quality varies through the video. Therefore, we establish temporal coherence by identifying high-quality keymasks in the video by leveraging deep motion priors. The sparse keymask pseudo-annotations are then used to train a segmentation model for implicit mask propagation, for which we propose a Sparse-To-Dense Distillation approach aided by a Temporal DropLoss.

Code: https://github.com/hustvl/SuperCLIP", "summary": "Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) achieves strong generalization in vision-language tasks by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space. However, recent findings show that CLIP-like models still underutilize fine-grained semantic signals in text, and this issue becomes even more pronounced when dealing with long and detailed captions. This stems from CLIP's training objective, which optimizes only global image-text similarity and overlooks token-level supervision - limiting its ability to achieve fine-grained visual-text alignment. To address this, we propose SuperCLIP, a simple yet effective framework that augments contrastive learning with classification-based supervision. By adding only a lightweight linear layer to the vision encoder, SuperCLIP leverages token-level cues to enhance visual-textual alignment - with just a 0.077% increase in total FLOPs, and no need for additional annotated data. Experiments show that SuperCLIP consistently improves zero-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and purely visual tasks. These gains hold regardless of whether the model is trained on original web data or rich re-captioned data, demonstrating SuperCLIP's ability to recover textual supervision in both cases. Furthermore, SuperCLIP alleviates CLIP's small-batch performance drop through classification-based supervision that avoids reliance on large batch sizes.

Here, we show that these barriers can be overcome by building clinical native intelligence directly from real-world medical practice. Our key insight is that large-scale telemedicine programs, where expert centers provide remote consultations across distributed facilities, represent a natural reservoir for learning clinical image interpretation. We present ReVision, a retinal foundation model that learns from the natural alignment between 485,980 color fundus photographs and their corresponding diagnostic reports, accumulated through a decade-long telemedicine program spanning 162 medical institutions across China. Through extensive evaluation across 27 ophthalmic benchmarks, we demonstrate that ReVison enables deployment efficiency with minimal local resources. Without any task-specific training, ReVision achieves zero-shot disease detection with an average AUROC of 0.946 across 12 public benchmarks and 0.952 on 3 independent clinical cohorts. When minimal adaptation is feasible, ReVision matches extensively fine-tuned alternatives while requiring orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and labeled examples. The learned representations also transfer effectively to new clinical sites, imaging domains, imaging modalities, and systemic health prediction tasks. In a prospective reader study with 33 ophthalmologists, ReVision's zero-shot assistance improved diagnostic accuracy by 14.8% across all experience levels.

However, its performance deteriorates markedly at night due to low visibility and varying illumination, e.g., insufficient light causes textureless areas, and moving objects bring blurry regions. To this end, we propose a self-supervised framework named DASP that leverages spatiotemporal priors for nighttime depth estimation. Specifically, DASP consists of an adversarial branch for extracting spatiotemporal priors and a self-supervised branch for learning. In the adversarial branch, we first design an adversarial network where the discriminator is composed of four devised spatiotemporal priors learning blocks (SPLB) to exploit the daytime priors. In particular, the SPLB contains a spatial-based temporal learning module (STLM) that uses orthogonal differencing to extract motion-related variations along the time axis and an axial spatial learning module (ASLM) that adopts local asymmetric convolutions with global axial attention to capture the multiscale structural information. By combining STLM and ASLM, our model can acquire sufficient spatiotemporal features to restore textureless areas and estimate the blurry regions caused by dynamic objects. In the self-supervised branch, we propose a 3D consistency projection loss to bilaterally project the target frame and source frame into a shared 3D space, and calculate the 3D discrepancy between the two projected frames as a loss to optimize the 3D structural consistency and daytime priors.

Recent advancements in MedIR have focused on All-in-One models capable of simultaneously addressing multiple different MedIR tasks. However, due to significant differences in both modality and degradation types, using a shared model for these diverse tasks requires careful consideration of two critical inter-task relationships: task interference, which occurs when conflicting gradient update directions arise across tasks on the same parameter, and task imbalance, which refers to uneven optimization caused by varying learning difficulties inherent to each task. To address these challenges, we propose a task-adaptive Transformer (TAT), a novel framework that dynamically adapts to different tasks through two key innovations. First, a task-adaptive weight generation strategy is introduced to mitigate task interference by generating task-specific weight parameters for each task, thereby eliminating potential gradient conflicts on shared weight parameters. Second, a task-adaptive loss balancing strategy is introduced to dynamically adjust loss weights based on task-specific learning difficulties, preventing task domination or undertraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed TAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in three MedIR tasks--PET synthesis, CT denoising, and MRI super-resolution--both in task-specific and All-in-One settings.

In this work, we present FoodLogAthl-218, a food image dataset constructed from real-world meal records collected through the dietary management application FoodLog Athl. The dataset contains 6,925 images across 218 food categories, with a total of 14,349 bounding boxes. Rich metadata, including meal date and time, anonymized user IDs, and meal-level context, accompany each image. Unlike conventional datasets-where a predefined class set guides web-based image collection-our data begins with user-submitted photos, and labels are applied afterward. This yields greater intra-class diversity, a natural frequency distribution of meal types, and casual, unfiltered images intended for personal use rather than public sharing. In addition to (1) a standard classification benchmark, we introduce two FoodLog-specific tasks: (2) an incremental fine-tuning protocol that follows the temporal stream of users' logs, and (3) a context-aware classification task where each image contains multiple dishes, and the model must classify each dish by leveraging the overall meal context.

Moreover, using a simple survival follow-up label is insufficient to supervise such a complex task. To address these challenges, we propose KEMM, an LLM-driven Knowledge-Enhanced Multimodal Model for cancer survival prediction, which integrates expert reports and prognostic background knowledge. 1) Expert reports, provided by pathologists on a case-by-case basis and refined by large language model (LLM), offer succinct and clinically focused diagnostic statements. This information may typically suggest different survival outcomes. 2) Prognostic background knowledge (PBK), generated concisely by LLM, provides valuable prognostic background knowledge on different cancer types, which also enhances survival prediction. To leverage these knowledge, we introduce the knowledge-enhanced cross-modal (KECM) attention module. KECM can effectively guide the network to focus on discriminative and survival-relevant features from highly redundant modalities.

While this approach has shown promising results for image data, extending dataset distillation methods to video data has proven challenging and often leads to suboptimal performance. In this work, we first identify the core challenge in video set distillation as the substantial increase in learnable parameters introduced by the temporal dimension of video, which complicates optimization and hinders convergence. To address this issue, we observe that a single frame is often sufficient to capture the discriminative semantics of a video. Leveraging this insight, we propose Single-Frame Video set Distillation (SFVD), a framework that distills videos into highly informative frames for each class.

To effectively monitor glacier conditions, it is crucial to consistently estimate positional shifts of glacier calving fronts. AMD-HookNet firstly introduces a pure two-branch convolutional neural network (CNN) for glacier segmentation. Yet, the local nature and translational invariance of convolution operations, while beneficial for capturing low-level details, restricts the model ability to maintain long-range dependencies. In this study, we propose AMD-HookNet++, a novel advanced hybrid CNN-Transformer feature enhancement method for segmenting glaciers and delineating calving fronts in synthetic aperture radar images. Our hybrid structure consists of two branches: a Transformer-based context branch to capture long-range dependencies, which provides global contextual information in a larger view, and a CNN-based target branch to preserve local details. To strengthen the representation of the connected hybrid features, we devise an enhanced spatial-channel attention module to foster interactions between the hybrid CNN-Transformer branches through dynamically adjusting the token relationships from both spatial and channel perspectives. Additionally, we develop a pixel-to-pixel contrastive deep supervision to optimize our hybrid model by integrating pixelwise metric learning into glacier segmentation. Through extensive experiments and comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses on the challenging glacier segmentation benchmark dataset CaFFe, we show that AMD-HookNet++ sets a new state of the art with an IoU of 78.2 and a HD95 of 1,318 m, while maintaining a competitive MDE of 367 m.

Existing MLLMs typically perform textual reasoning solely from a single static mathematical image, overlooking dynamic visual acquisition during reasoning. In contrast, humans repeatedly examine visual image and employ step-by-step reasoning to prove intermediate propositions. This strategy of decomposing the problem-solving process into key logical nodes adheres to Miller's Law in cognitive science. Inspired by this insight, we propose a ViRC framework for multimodal mathematical tasks, introducing a Reason Chunking mechanism that structures multimodal mathematical CoT into consecutive Critical Reasoning Units (CRUs) to simulate human expert problem-solving patterns. CRUs ensure intra-unit textual coherence for intermediate proposition verification while integrating visual information across units to generate subsequent propositions and support structured reasoning. To this end, we present CRUX dataset by using three visual tools and four reasoning patterns to provide explicitly annotated CRUs across multiple reasoning paths for each mathematical problem. Leveraging the CRUX dataset, we propose a progressive training strategy inspired by human cognitive learning, which includes Instructional SFT, Practice SFT, and Strategic RL, aimed at further strengthening the Reason Chunking ability of the model.The resulting ViRC-7B model achieves a 18.8\\% average improvement over baselines across multiple mathematical benchmarks.

Previous methods for articulated object reconstruction either rely on slow optimization with fragile cross-state correspondences or use feed-forward models limited to specific object categories. In contrast, ART treats articulated objects as assemblies of rigid parts, formulating reconstruction as part-based prediction. Our newly designed transformer architecture maps sparse image inputs to a set of learnable part slots, from which ART jointly decodes unified representations for individual parts, including their 3D geometry, texture, and explicit articulation parameters. The resulting reconstructions are physically interpretable and readily exportable for simulation. Trained on a large-scale, diverse dataset with per-part supervision, and evaluated across diverse benchmarks, ART achieves significant improvements over existing baselines and establishes a new state of the art for articulated object reconstruction from image inputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "ART\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7c7b\u522b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u524d\u9988\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u90e8\u4ef6\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u4ece\u7a00\u758fRGB\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa3D\u5173\u8282\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5173\u8282\u7269\u4f53\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u7f13\u6162\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u8de8\u72b6\u6001\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u5bf9\u8c61\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u524d\u9988\u6a21\u578b\u3002ART\u65e8\u5728\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u7c7b\u522b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u524d\u9988\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "ART\u5c06\u5173\u8282\u7269\u4f53\u89c6\u4e3a\u521a\u6027\u90e8\u4ef6\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u5c06\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u50cf\u8f93\u5165\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4e00\u7ec4\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u90e8\u4ef6\u69fd\uff0c\u5e76\u8054\u5408\u89e3\u7801\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5305\u62ec3D\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u660e\u786e\u7684\u5173\u8282\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "ART\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\u5177\u6709\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u5bfc\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "conclusion": "ART\u5728\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u591a\u72b6\u6001RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u76843D\u5173\u8282\u7269\u4f53\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6b64\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

Most existing solutions maintain the memory by compressing historical frames with predefined strategies. However, different to-generate video chunks should refer to different historical cues, which is hard to satisfy with fixed strategies. In this work, we propose MemFlow to address this problem. Specifically, before generating the coming chunk, we dynamically update the memory bank by retrieving the most relevant historical frames with the text prompt of this chunk. This design enables narrative coherence even if new event happens or scenario switches in future frames. In addition, during generation, we only activate the most relevant tokens in the memory bank for each query in the attention layers, which effectively guarantees the generation efficiency. In this way, MemFlow achieves outstanding long-context consistency with negligible computation burden (7.9% speed reduction compared with the memory-free baseline) and keeps the compatibility with any streaming video generation model with KV cache.", "AI": {"tldr": "MemFlow\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4ee4\u724c\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u56fa\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u9891\u5757\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMemFlow\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\u76f8\u5173\u4ee4\u724c\u3002", "result": "MemFlow\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u6781\u4f4e\uff08\u4ec5\u6bd4\u65e0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u57fa\u7ebf\u61627.9%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "MemFlow\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\u76f8\u5173\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In contrast to autoregressive decoders, WAM-Flow performs fully parallel, bidirectional denoising, enabling coarse-to-fine refinement with a tunable compute-accuracy trade-off. Specifically, the approach combines a metric-aligned numerical tokenizer that preserves scalar geometry via triplet-margin learning, a geometry-aware flow objective and a simulator-guided GRPO alignment that integrates safety, ego progress, and comfort rewards while retaining parallel generation. A multi-stage adaptation converts a pre-trained auto-regressive backbone (Janus-1.5B) from causal decoding to non-causal flow model and strengthens road-scene competence through continued multimodal pretraining. Thanks to the inherent nature of consistency model training and parallel decoding inference, WAM-Flow achieves superior closed-loop performance against autoregressive and diffusion-based VLA baselines, with 1-step inference attaining 89.1 PDMS and 5-step inference reaching 90.3 PDMS on NAVSIM v1 benchmark.
