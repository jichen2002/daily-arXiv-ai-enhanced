To appear in IEEE TVCG", "summary": "We propose Probabilistic Inclusion Depth (PID) for the ensemble visualization of scalar fields. By introducing a probabilistic inclusion operator $\\subset_{\\!p}$, our method is a general data depth model supporting ensembles of fuzzy contours, such as soft masks from modern segmentation methods, and conventional ensembles of binary contours. We also advocate to extend contour extraction in scalar field ensembles to become a fuzzy decision by considering the probabilistic distribution of an isovalue to encode the sensitivity information. To reduce the complexity of the data depth computation, an efficient approximation using the mean probabilistic contour is devised. Furthermore, an order of magnitude reduction in computational time is achieved with an efficient parallel algorithm on the GPU. Our new method enables the computation of contour boxplots for ensembles of probabilistic masks, ensembles defined on various types of grids, and large 3D ensembles that are not studied by existing methods. The effectiveness of our method is evaluated with numerical comparisons to existing techniques on synthetic datasets, through examples of real-world ensemble datasets, and expert feedback.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPID\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd1\u4f3c\u548cGPU\u5e76\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u7f51\u683c\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a213D\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u6982\u7387\u63a9\u6a21\u96c6\u6210\u3001\u591a\u79cd\u7f51\u683c\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a213D\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u652f\u6301\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6982\u7387\u5305\u542b\u6df1\u5ea6\uff08PID\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u7cca\u8f6e\u5ed3\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5747\u503c\u6982\u7387\u8f6e\u5ed3\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1GPU\u5e76\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "result": "PID\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u8ba1\u7b97\u6982\u7387\u63a9\u6a21\u96c6\u6210\u3001\u591a\u79cd\u7f51\u683c\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a213D\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7bb1\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "PID\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6982\u7387\u5305\u542b\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u7cca\u8f6e\u5ed3\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

They enable captivating visual arts, immersive virtual reality, and a wide range of engineering and scientific applications. Recent works have extended sky-models to be more comprehensive and inclusive of cloud formations but, as we demonstrate, existing methods fall short in faithfully recreating natural skies. Though in recent years the visual quality of DNN-generated High Dynamic Range Imagery (HDRI) has greatly improved, the environment maps generated by DNN sky-models do not re-light scenes with the same tones, shadows, and illumination as physically captured HDR imagery. In this work, we demonstrate progress in HDR literature to be tangential to sky-modelling as current works cannot support both photorealism and the 22 f-stops required for the Full Dynamic Range (FDR) of outdoor illumination. We achieve this by proposing AllSky, a flexible all-weather sky-model learned directly from physically captured HDRI which we leverage to study the input modalities, tonemapping, conditioning, and evaluation of sky-models. Per user-controlled positioning of the sun and cloud formations, AllSky expands on current functionality by allowing for intuitive user control over environment maps and achieves state-of-the-art sky-model performance.

GPiCA utilizes a unique hybrid representation that combines a triangle mesh and anisotropic 3D Gaussians. This combination maximizes memory and rendering efficiency while maintaining a photorealistic appearance. The triangle mesh is highly efficient in representing surface areas like facial skin, while the 3D Gaussians effectively handle non-surface areas such as hair and beard. To this end, we develop a unified differentiable rendering pipeline that treats the mesh as a semi-transparent layer within the volumetric rendering paradigm of 3D Gaussian Splatting. We train neural networks to decode a facial expression code into three components: a 3D face mesh, an RGBA texture, and a set of 3D Gaussians.

We find significant differences with large effect sizes in 22 of 45 pairwise comparisons, challenging the assumption that npm has the highest amplification due to its many small purpose packages. We observe that 28 percent of Maven projects exceed 10 times amplification, indicating a systematic pattern rather than isolated outliers, compared to 14 percent for RubyGems, 12 percent for npm, and zero percent for Cargo, PyPI, Packagist, CocoaPods, and Pub. We attribute these differences to ecosystem design choices such as dependency resolution behavior, standard library completeness, and platform constraints. Our findings suggest adopting ecosystem specific security strategies, including systematic auditing for Maven environments, targeted outlier detection for npm and RubyGems, and continuation of current practices for ecosystems with controlled amplification. We provide a full replication package with data and analysis scripts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5341\u4e2a\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u653e\u5927\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Maven\u653e\u5927\u500d\u6570\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u53d6\u7279\u5b9a\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u653e\u5927\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u5341\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684500\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56\u653e\u5927\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "Maven\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u653e\u5927\u500d\u6570\u6700\u9ad8\uff0824.70\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u800cCocoaPods\u6700\u4f4e\uff080.32\u500d\uff09\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff08\u5982\u4f9d\u8d56\u89e3\u6790\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5e93\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7b49\uff09\u662f\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u653e\u5927\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u6839\u636e\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u6027\u91c7\u53d6\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Typically, as new data becomes available, an existing solution must be updated to incorporate the latest information. In addition to seeking a high-quality solution for the task at hand, it is also crucial to ensure consistency by minimizing drastic changes from previous solutions. Applying this approach across many iterations, ensures that the solution evolves gradually and smoothly.\n  In this paper, we study the above problem in the context of clustering, specifically focusing on the $k$-center problem. More precisely, we study the following problem: Given a set of points $X$, parameters $k$ and $b$, and a prior clustering solution $H$ for $X$, our goal is to compute a new solution $C$ for $X$, consisting of $k$ centers, which minimizes the clustering cost while introducing at most $b$ changes from $H$.

In UAV-CPNs, UAVs function as dynamic aerial relays, outsourcing tasks generated in the request zone to an expanded service zone, consisting of a diverse range of computing devices, from vehicles with onboard computational capabilities and edge servers to dedicated computing nodes. This approach has the potential to alleviate communication bottlenecks in traditional computing power networks and overcome the \"island effect\" observed in multi-access edge computing. However, how to quantify the network performance under the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of both communication and computing power is a significant challenge, which introduces intricacies beyond those found in conventional networks. To address this, in this paper, we introduce task completion probability as the primary performance metric for evaluating the ability of UAV-CPNs to complete ground users' tasks within specified end-to-end latency requirements. Utilizing theories from stochastic processes and stochastic geometry, we derive analytical expressions that facilitate the assessment of this metric. Our numerical results emphasize that striking a delicate balance between communication and computational capabilities is essential for enhancing the performance of UAV-CPNs.

This paper develops a unified perspective on these phenomena by interpreting self-attention and residual streams as implementing an approximate Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA). In this view, queries and keys define role spaces, values encode fillers, attention weights perform soft unbinding, and residual connections realize superposition of many bound structures. We use this algebraic lens to relate transformer internals to chain-of-thought traces, program-based reasoning, and memory-augmented tool use, and to explain characteristic failure modes such as variable confusion and inconsistency across logically related prompts. Building on this perspective, we propose VSA-inspired architectural biases, including explicit binding/unbinding heads and hyperdimensional memory layers, and training objectives that promote role-filler separation and robust superposition. Finally, we outline metrics for measuring \"VSA-likeness\" and logical compositionality, and pose theoretical and architectural open problems. Overall, the paper argues that viewing attention as soft vector-symbolic computation offers a principled route toward more interpretable and logically reliable reasoning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u91cf\u7b26\u53f7\u67b6\u6784\uff08VSA\uff09\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790Transformer\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u903b\u8f91\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7a33\u5b9a\u7b26\u53f7\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u7b26\u53f7\u67b6\u6784\uff08VSA\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51faVSA\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u504f\u7f6e\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee3\u6570\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c06Transformer\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u3001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5178\u578b\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u89c6\u4e3a\u8f6f\u5411\u91cf\u7b26\u53f7\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We seek a path $P$ starting at $s$ and visiting all the clients so as to minimize the sum of client waiting times (also known as latency) before being visited on the path.\n  In contrast to the symmetric version of this problem (also known as the Deliveryperson problem and the Repairperson problem in the literature), there are significant gaps in our understanding of Directed Latency. The best approximation factor has remained at $O(\\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of clients, for more than a decade [Friggstad, Salavatipour, and Svitkina, '13]. Only recently, [Friggstad and Swamy, '22] presented a constant-factor approximation but in quasi-polynomial time. Both results follow similar ideas: they consider buckets with geometrically-increasing distances, build paths in each bucket, and then stitch together all these paths to get a feasible solution. [Friggstad and Swamy, '22] showed if we guess a vertex from each bucket and augment a standard LP relaxation with these guesses, then one can reduce the stitching cost. Unfortunately, there are logarithmically many buckets so the running time of their algorithm is quasi-polynomial.\n  In this paper, we present the first constant-factor approximation for Directed Latency in polynomial time by introducing a completely new way of bucketing which helps us strengthen a standard LP relaxation with less aggressive guessing.

Socially compliant navigation that accounts for human comfort, social norms, and contextual appropriateness remains underexplored. Vision language models (VLMs) show promise for this task; however, large-scale models incur substantial computational overhead, leading to higher inference latency and energy consumption, which makes them unsuitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address this issue, we investigate the effectiveness of small VLM and propose SocialNav-MoE, an efficient Mixture-of-Experts vision language model for socially compliant navigation with reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). We further introduce a semantic similarity reward (SSR) to effectively leverage RFT for enhancing the decision-making capabilities. Additionally, we study the effectiveness of different small language model types (Phi, Qwen, and StableLM), routing strategies, and vision encoders (CLIP vs. SigLIP, frozen vs. fine-tuned). Experiments on the SNEI dataset demonstrate that SocialNav-MoE achieves an excellent balance between navigation accuracy and efficiency.

This reduces evaluation to shallow retrieval and overlooks the reality of incomplete KGs, where many facts are missing and answers must be inferred from existing facts. We bridge this gap by proposing a methodology for constructing benchmarks under KG incompleteness, which removes direct supporting triples while ensuring that alternative reasoning paths required to infer the answer remain. Experiments on benchmarks constructed using our methodology show that existing methods suffer consistent performance degradation under incompleteness, highlighting their limited reasoning ability. To overcome this limitation, we present the Adaptive Graph Reasoning Agent (GR-Agent).

Several variants have been proposed to accommodate parallel architectures. GPUs, with massive thread-level parallelism and high-bandwidth memory, are a natural fit for accelerating these Bloom filter variants potentially to billions of operations per second. Although CPU-optimized implementations have been well studied, GPU designs remain underexplored. We close this gap by exploring the design space on GPUs along three dimensions: vectorization, thread cooperation, and compute latency.\n  Our evaluation shows that the combination of these optimization points strongly affects throughput, with the largest gains achieved when the filter fits within the GPU's cache domain. We examine how the hardware responds to different parameter configurations and relate these observations to measured performance trends. Crucially, our optimized design overcomes the conventional trade-off between speed and precision, delivering the throughput typically restricted to high-error variants while maintaining the superior accuracy of high-precision configurations. At iso error rate, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by $11.35\\times$ ($15.4\\times$) for bulk filter lookup (construction), respectively, achieving above $92\\%$ of the practical speed-of-light across a wide range of configurations on a B200 GPU.

However, these impressive scores do not necessarily translate to reliable services in real-world use, where users often vary their phrasing, contextual framing, and task formulations. In this paper, we study nuance-oriented reliability: whether models exhibit consistent competence across cousin prompts that convey analogous user intents but with subtle nuances. To quantify this, we introduce a new metric, reliable@k, and develop an automated pipeline that generates high-quality cousin prompts via data augmentation. Building upon this, we construct IFEval++ for systematic evaluation. Across 20 proprietary and 26 open-source LLMs, we find that current models exhibit substantial insufficiency in nuance-oriented reliability -- their performance can drop by up to 61.8% with nuanced prompt modifications. What's more, we characterize it and explore three potential improvement recipes.

Embodied navigation, as a crucial component of such capabilities, leverages the compact and expressive nature of 3DSGs to enable long-horizon reasoning and planning in complex, large-scale environments. However, prior works rely on a static-world assumption, defining traversable space solely based on static spatial layouts and thereby treating interactable obstacles as non-traversable. This fundamental limitation severely undermines their effectiveness in real-world scenarios, leading to limited reachability, low efficiency, and inferior extensibility. To address these issues, we propose HERO, a novel framework for constructing Hierarchical Traversable 3DSGs, that redefines traversability by modeling operable obstacles as pathways, capturing their physical interactivity, functional semantics, and the scene's relational hierarchy.

However, distributed databases also require consistent reads. To guarantee read consistency, a Raft-based system must either accept the high communication overhead of a safety check for each read, or implement leader leases. Prior lease protocols are vaguely specified and hurt availability, so most Raft systems implement them incorrectly or not at all. We introduce LeaseGuard, a novel lease algorithm that relies on guarantees specific to Raft elections. LeaseGuard is simple, rigorously specified in TLA+, and includes two novel optimizations that maximize availability during leader failover. The first optimization restores write throughput quickly, and the second improves read availability. We evaluate LeaseGuard with a simulation in Python and an implementation in LogCabin, the C++ reference implementation of Raft. By replacing LogCabin's default consistency mechanism (quorum checks), LeaseGuard reduces the overhead of consistent reads from one to zero network roundtrips. It also improves write throughput from ~1000 to ~10,000 writes per second, by eliminating contention between writes and quorum reads.

We address this need with a hybrid generator that combines a small hidden Markov model, which captures buffering, streaming, and idle states, with a mixture density network that models the joint distribution of payload length and inter-arrival time (IAT) in each state using Student-t mixtures. The state space and emission family are designed to handle heavy-tailed IAT by anchoring an explicit idle state in the tail and allowing each component to adapt its tail thickness. We evaluate the model on public traces of web, smart home, and encrypted media traffic and compare it with recent neural network and transformer based generators as well as hidden Markov baselines. Across most datasets and metrics, including average per-flow cumulative distribution functions, autocorrelation based measures of temporal structure, and Wasserstein distances between flow descriptors, the proposed generator matches the real traffic most closely in the majority of cases while using orders of magnitude fewer parameters.

AquaDiff integrates a chromatic prior-guided color compensation strategy with a conditional diffusion process, where cross-attention dynamically fuses degraded inputs and noisy latent states at each denoising step. An enhanced denoising backbone with residual dense blocks and multi-resolution attention captures both global color context and local details.

A common strategy for correcting accumulated error is visual loop closure in SLAM, which adjusts the pose graph when the agent revisits previously mapped locations. These techniques typically rely on identifying visual mappings between the current view and previously observed scenes and often require fusing data from multiple sensors.\n  In contrast, this work introduces NeRF-Assisted 3D-3D Pose Alignment (NAP3D), a complementary approach that leverages 3D-3D correspondences between the agent's current depth image and a pre-trained Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). By directly aligning 3D points from the observed scene with synthesized points from the NeRF, NAP3D refines the estimated pose even from novel viewpoints, without relying on revisiting previously observed locations.\n  This robust 3D-3D formulation provides advantages over conventional 2D-3D localization methods while remaining comparable in accuracy and applicability. Experiments demonstrate that NAP3D achieves camera pose correction within 5 cm on a custom dataset, robustly outperforming a 2D-3D Perspective-N-Point baseline. On TUM RGB-D, NAP3D consistently improves 3D alignment RMSE by approximately 6 cm compared to this baseline given varying noise, despite PnP achieving lower raw rotation and translation parameter error in some regimes, highlighting NAP3D's improved geometric consistency in 3D space.

However, traditional batching frameworks are ill-suited for EE LLMs, as not all requests in a batch may be ready to exit at the same time. Existing solutions either force a uniform decision on the batch, which overlooks EE opportunities, or degrade output quality by forcing premature exits. We propose Dynamic Rebatching, a solution where we dynamically reorganize the batch at each early-exit point. Requests that meet the exit criteria are immediately processed, while those that continue are held in a buffer, re-grouped into a new batch, and forwarded to deeper layers. We introduce DREX, an early-exit inference system that implements Dynamic Rebatching with two key optimizations: 1) a copy-free rebatching buffer that avoids physical data movement, and 2) an EE and SLA-aware scheduler that analytically predicts whether a given rebatching operation will be profitable.

Pre-training produces intelligence, and post-training optimizes preferences, but neither guarantees that models reliably satisfy explicit, context-dependent constraints. This missing abstraction explains why highly intelligent models routinely fail in deployment despite strong benchmark performance.\n  We introduce Capability Engineering, the systematic practice of converting requirements into executable specifications and training models to satisfy them by default. We operationalize this practice through CAPE (Capability Achievement via Policy Execution), a protocol implementing a Specify -> Verify -> Correct -> Train loop.\n  CAPE is grounded in two empirical findings: (1) contextual objectivity, where properties appearing subjective become objective once context is fixed (inter-annotator agreement rises from kappa = 0.42 to kappa = 0.98), and (2) verification-fidelity scaling, where verification accuracy improves with model scale (r = 0.94), unlike preference agreement which plateaus at 30 to 50 percent disagreement regardless of compute. Across 109,500 examples in six domains, CAPE reduces violation rates by 81 percent relative to DPO (standard deviation less than 0.3 percent). By replacing per-example annotation with reusable specifications, CAPE reduces costs by 5 to 20 times and shortens timelines from months to weeks.\n  We release the CAPE protocol, PredicateGraph schema, CPL specification language, and policy packs under Apache 2.0.

This is particularly beneficial for video, which dominates network traffic and demands high bandwidth and power, making semantic approaches ideal for conserving resources while maintaining quality. In this paper, we propose a Predictability-aware and Entropy-adaptive Neural Motion Estimation (PENME) method to address challenges related to high latency, high bitrate, and power consumption in video transmission. PENME makes per-frame decisions to select a residual motion extraction model, convolutional neural network, vision transformer, or optical flow, using a five-step policy based on motion strength, global motion consistency, peak sharpness, heterogeneity, and residual error. The residual motions are then transmitted to the receiver, where the frames are reconstructed via motion-compensated updates. Next, a selective diffusion-based refinement, the Latent Consistency Model (LCM-4), is applied on frames that trigger refinement due to low predictability or large residuals, while predictable frames skip refinement. PENME also allocates radio resource blocks with awareness of residual motion and channel state, reducing power consumption and bandwidth usage while maintaining high semantic similarity. Our simulation results on the Vimeo90K dataset demonstrate that the proposed PENME method handles various types of video, outperforming traditional communication, hybrid, and adaptive bitrate semantic communication techniques, achieving 40% lower latency, 90% less transmitted data, and 35% higher throughput.

In the domain of chess, this standard manifests as accuracy benchmarks against strong engines like Stockfish. However, high scalar accuracy does not necessarily imply robust conceptual understanding. This paper argues that standard accuracy metrics fail to distinguish between genuine geometric reasoning and the superficial memorization of canonical board states. To address this gap, we propose a Geometric Stability Framework, a novel evaluation methodology that rigorously tests model consistency under invariant transformations-including board rotation, mirror symmetry, color inversion, and format conversion. We applied this framework to a comparative analysis of six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Kimi K2 Turbo, utilizing a dataset of approximately 3,000 positions. Our results reveal a significant Accuracy-Stability Paradox. While models such as GPT-5.1 achieve near-optimal accuracy on standard positions, they exhibit catastrophic degradation under geometric perturbation, specifically in rotation tasks where error rates surge by over 600%. This disparity suggests a reliance on pattern matching over abstract spatial logic. Conversely, Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Kimi K2 Turbo demonstrate superior dual robustness, maintaining high consistency across all transformation axes. Furthermore, we analyze the trade-off between helpfulness and safety, identifying Gemini 2.5 Flash as the leader in illegal state rejection (96.0%). We conclude that geometric stability provides an orthogonal and essential metric for AI evaluation, offering a necessary proxy for disentangling reasoning capabilities from data contamination and overfitting in large-scale models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u51e0\u4f55\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u8c61\u68cb\u9886\u57df\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u672a\u5fc5\u4ee3\u8868\u7a33\u5065\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6807\u51c6\u68cb\u76d8\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u8868\u9762\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u51e0\u4f55\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff08Geometric Stability Framework\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68cb\u76d8\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u955c\u50cf\u5bf9\u79f0\u3001\u989c\u8272\u53cd\u8f6c\u548c\u683c\u5f0f\u8f6c\u6362\u7b49\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u4e25\u683c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u6027-\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6096\u8bba\uff08Accuracy-Stability Paradox\uff09\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u4f46\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u800c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5219\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u53cc\u91cd\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51e0\u4f55\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e3aAI\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b63\u4ea4\u4e14\u5173\u952e\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u53ca\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

While large language models (LLMs) offer a path to automation, their limited training on HDL code makes end-to-end transpilation brittle and prone to syntax errors. We compare two LLM-driven methods for syntax repair in a MATLAB-to-HDL pipeline: a structured, expert-designed flow that follows a fixed sequence of operations, and a more autonomous agentic approach that uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) \\cite{anthropic2024mcp} to dynamically select its own tools. We study 42 MATLAB signal-processing functions and isolate the syntax-repair stage. Across three model scales, the agentic approach is more effective at resolving initial syntax errors, unblocking a greater number of candidates to proceed through the pipeline. This upstream improvement yields measurable downstream improvements, most notably on mid-sized models, where it increases the simulation reach rate by over 20 percentage points. We hypothesize the gains come from short prompts, aggressive context management, and conditional tool use. Conditional retrieval helps at 8B and 30B; at 235B final-success gains are small and a naive RAG variant attains the highest final success.

We present HERBench, a VideoQA benchmark purpose-built to assess multi-evidence integration across time. Each question requires aggregating at least three non-overlapping evidential cues across distinct video segments, so neither language priors nor a single snapshot can suffice. HERBench comprises 26K five-way multiple-choice questions organized into twelve compositional tasks that probe identity binding, cross-entity relations, temporal ordering, co-occurrence verification, and counting. To make evidential demand measurable, we introduce the Minimum Required Frame-Set (MRFS), the smallest number of frames a model must fuse to answer correctly, and show that HERBench imposes substantially higher demand than prior datasets (mean MRFS 5.5 vs. 2.6-4.2). Evaluating 13 state-of-the-art Video-LLMs on HERBench reveals pervasive failures: accuracies of 31-42% are only slightly above the 20% random-guess baseline. We disentangle this failure into two critical bottlenecks: (1) a retrieval deficit, where frame selectors overlook key evidence, and (2) a fusion deficit, where models fail to integrate information even when all necessary evidence is provided. By making cross-time evidence both unavoidable and quantifiable, HERBench establishes a principled target for advancing robust, compositional video understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "HERBench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684VideoQA\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u8981\u6c42\u6574\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b64\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\uff08VideoQA\uff09\u57fa\u51c6\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u663e\u8457\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9700\u6574\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u79bb\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86HERBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b26K\u4e2a\u4e94\u9009\u4e00\u591a\u9009\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u4e3a12\u4e2a\u7ec4\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6700\u5c0f\u5fc5\u9700\u5e27\u96c6\uff08MRFS\uff09\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u8bc1\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f3013\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684Video-LLMs\u663e\u793a\u666e\u904d\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec5\u7565\u9ad8\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u731c\u6d4b\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0831-42% vs. 20%\uff09\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u878d\u5408\u4e24\u5927\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "conclusion": "HERBench\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

Conventional performance metrics such as precision, recall and the F1-score assess the overall detection accuracy, but they do not consider the safety-relevant aspects of perception. Consequently, perception systems that achieve high scores in these metrics may still cause misdetections that could lead to severe accidents. Therefore, it is important to evaluate not only the overall performance of perception systems, but also their safety. We therefore introduce a novel safety metric for jointly evaluating the most critical perception tasks, object and lane detection. Our proposed framework integrates a new, lightweight object safety metric that quantifies the potential risk associated with object detection errors, as well as an lane safety metric including the interdependence between both tasks that can occur in safety evaluation. The resulting combined safety score provides a unified, interpretable measure of perception safety performance. Using the DeepAccident dataset, we demonstrate that our approach identifies safety critical perception errors that conventional performance metrics fail to capture. Our findings emphasize the importance of safety-centric evaluation methods for perception systems in autonomous driving.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5ea6\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u5982\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u672a\u80fd\u8003\u8651\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u4e8b\u6545\u7684\u8bef\u68c0\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5bf9\u8c61\u5b89\u5168\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u4e0e\u5bf9\u8c61\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u95f4\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u5b58\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u8f66\u9053\u5b89\u5168\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528DeepAccident\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u4f20\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u611f\u77e5\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5ea6\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8054\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u8f66\u9053\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5bf9\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Additionally, most existing methods are built upon Transformer architectures. However, transformers incur a quadratic attention cost, limiting their ability to model long spatial and temporal sequences-particularly on resource-constrained edge platforms. As autonomous driving inherently demands efficient temporal modeling, this challenge severely limits their deployment and real-time performance. Recently, linear attention mechanisms have gained increasing attention due to their superior spatiotemporal complexity. However, existing linear attention architectures are limited to self-attention, lacking support for cross-modal and cross-temporal interactions-both crucial for autonomous driving. In this work, we propose LADY, the first fully linear attention-based generative model for end-to-end autonomous driving. LADY enables fusion of long-range temporal context at inference with constant computational and memory costs, regardless of the history length of camera and LiDAR features. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight linear cross-attention mechanism that enables effective cross-modal information exchange. Experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate that LADY achieves state-of-the-art performance with constant-time and memory complexity, offering improved planning performance and significantly reduced computational cost.

We term this iterative cycle of generation, evaluation, and refinement AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS). Using several open-source ADRS instances (i.e., OpenEvolve, GEPA, and ShinkaEvolve), we demonstrate across ten case studies (e.g., multi-region cloud scheduling, mixture-of-experts load balancing, LLM-based SQL, transaction scheduling) that ADRS-generated solutions can match or even outperform human state-of-the-art designs. Based on these findings, we outline best practices (e.g., level of prompt specification, amount of feedback, robust evaluation) for effectively using ADRS, and we discuss future research directions and their implications. Although we do not yet have a universal recipe for applying ADRS across all of systems research, we hope our preliminary findings, together with the challenges we identify, offer meaningful guidance for future work as researcher effort shifts increasingly toward problem formulation and strategic oversight.

Our approach integrates (i) a pose estimation pipeline to extract hand and face joint coordinates, (ii) a segmentation module that isolates relevant information, and (iii) a ResNet-Transformer backbone to jointly model spatial and temporal dependencies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u624b\u8bed\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u548cTransformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53e3\u8bed\u548c\u4e66\u9762\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u7f8e\u56fd\u624b\u8bed\uff08ASL\uff09\u7528\u6237\u4ecd\u96be\u4ee5\u53d7\u76ca\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u624b\u8bed\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002\u5b64\u7acb\u624b\u8bed\u8bc6\u522b\uff08ISLR\uff09\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u7528\u6237\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u800c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7ba1\u9053\u63d0\u53d6\u624b\u548c\u9762\u90e8\u5173\u8282\u5750\u6807\u3001\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u5757\u9694\u79bb\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caResNet-Transformer\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u5171\u540c\u5efa\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u624b\u8bed\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u5757\u548cResNet-Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u624b\u8bed\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Contemporary AI tools automate this for species with distinctive morphological features but remain largely image-based. Here, we extend Re-ID methodologies by incorporating precise dermatoglyphic textual descriptors-an approach used in forensics but new to ecology. We demonstrate that these specialist semantics abstract and encode animal coat topology using human-interpretable language tags. Drawing on 84,264 manually labelled minutiae across 3,355 images of 185 tigers (Panthera tigris), we evaluate this visual-textual methodology, revealing novel capabilities for cross-modal identity retrieval. To optimise performance, we developed a text-image co-synthesis pipeline to generate 'virtual individuals', each comprising dozens of life-like visuals paired with dermatoglyphic text. Benchmarking against real-world scenarios shows this augmentation significantly boosts AI accuracy in cross-modal retrieval while alleviating data scarcity. We conclude that dermatoglyphic language-guided biometrics can overcome vision-only limitations, enabling textual-to-visual identity recovery underpinned by human-verifiable matchings.

VLA-AN addresses four major limitations of existing large aerial navigation models: the data domain gap, insufficient temporal navigation with reasoning, safety issues with generative action policies, and onboard deployment constraints. First, we construct a high-fidelity dataset utilizing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) to effectively bridge the domain gap. Second, we introduce a progressive three-stage training framework that sequentially reinforces scene comprehension, core flight skills, and complex navigation capabilities. Third, we design a lightweight, real-time action module coupled with geometric safety correction.

However, existing LLM reasoning strategies mainly rely on the LLM itself with fast or slow mode (like o1 thinking) and thus struggle to balance reasoning efficiency and accuracy across queries of varying difficulties. In this paper, we propose Cognitive-Inspired Elastic Reasoning (CogER), a framework inspired by human hierarchical reasoning that dynamically selects the most suitable reasoning strategy for each query. Specifically, CogER first assesses the complexity of incoming queries and assigns them to one of several predefined levels, each corresponding to a tailored processing strategy, thereby addressing the challenge of unobservable query difficulty. To achieve automatic strategy selection, we model the process as a Markov Decision Process and train a CogER-Agent using reinforcement learning. The agent is guided by a reward function that balances solution quality and computational cost, ensuring resource-efficient reasoning. Moreover, for queries requiring external tools, we introduce Cognitive Tool-Assisted Reasoning, which enables the LLM to autonomously invoke external tools within its chain-of-thought.

Existing benchmarks involve simple programs, failing to represent real-world complexities such as inter- or intra-procedural dependencies, core or third-party API calls, highly nested constructs, and non-primitive complex types. Evaluating LLMs under such a simplistic setting poses a significant threat to assumptions about their generalizability in practice. To enable a more realistic evaluation of code reasoning, this paper proposes RE2-Bench, a benchmark of 1,101 reasoning problems, including 195 drawn from mature real-world projects. RE2-Bench leverages static and dynamic program analysis to automatically serialize and deserialize compound, complex, and custom types in real-world code, going far beyond the primitive-only settings used in prior work.\n  A key feature of RE2-Bench is categorizing each reasoning problem as Easy or Hard via a principled majority-vote mechanism over nine interpretable code complexity metrics, resulting in two well-separated and semantically meaningful difficulty categories suitable for precise calibration of LLM reasoning ability. A comprehensive evaluation of six general-purpose and reasoning-oriented LLMs on two widely used code reasoning tasks -- input prediction and output prediction -- using RE2-Bench reveals a significant performance drop from Easy to Hard problems (51.50\\% for input prediction and 42.15\\% for output prediction), confirming that prior evaluations substantially overestimate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "RE2-Bench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b1,101\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u9ad8\u4f30\u4e86LLMs\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ec5\u6d89\u53ca\u7b80\u5355\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9LLMs\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u5927\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5206\u6790\u81ea\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u548c\u53cd\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u5408\u3001\u590d\u6742\u548c\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e5d\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3aEasy\u6216Hard\u3002", "result": "\u5728RE2-Bench\u4e0a\u5bf9\u516d\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u548c\u9762\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u7684LLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4eceEasy\u5230Hard\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff08\u8f93\u5165\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u964d51.50%\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u964d42.15%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "RE2-Bench\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4f30\u4e86LLMs\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u4ee3\u7801\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Designing human-robot systems to meet these demands requires an explicit understanding of the work functions and constraints that shape the feasibility of alternative joint work strategies. Yet existing human-robot interaction frameworks either emphasize computational support for real-time execution or rely on static representations for design, offering limited support for reasoning about coordination dynamics during early-stage conceptual design. To address this gap, this article presents a novel computational framework for analyzing joint work strategies in human-robot systems by integrating techniques from functional modeling with graph-theoretic representations. The framework characterizes collective work in terms of the relationships among system functions and the physical and informational structure of the work environment, while explicitly capturing how coordination demands evolve over time. Its use during conceptual design is demonstrated through a case study in disaster robotics, which shows how the framework can be used to support early trade-space exploration of human-robot coordination strategies and to identify cooperative competencies that support flexible management of coordination overhead. These results show how the framework makes coordination demands and their temporal evolution explicit, supporting design-time reasoning about cooperative competency requirements and work demands prior to implementation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6574\u5408\u529f\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u56fe\u8bba\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u4eba\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5de5\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u529b\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u6301\u6709\u8005\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u652f\u6301\u534f\u8c03\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u529f\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u56fe\u8bba\u8868\u793a\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4eba\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5de5\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u707e\u96be\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65e9\u671f\u6743\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u7ba1\u7406\u534f\u8c03\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u534f\u8c03\u9700\u6c42\u53ca\u5176\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u5408\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u8981\u6c42\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u9700\u6c42\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65bd\u524d\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u6743\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Relaxed Decision Diagrams (DDs) provide a versatile mechanism for deriving such dual bounds by compactly over-approximating the solution space through node merging. However, the quality of these relaxed diagrams, i.e. the tightness of the resulting dual bounds, depends critically on the variable ordering and the merging decisions executed during compilation. While dynamic variable ordering heuristics effectively tighten bounds, they often incur computational overhead when evaluated globally across the entire variable set. To mitigate this trade-off, this work introduces a novel clustering-based framework for variable ordering. Instead of applying dynamic ordering heuristics to the full set of unfixed variables, we first partition variables into clusters. We then leverage this structural decomposition to guide the ordering process, significantly reducing the heuristic's search space. Within this framework, we investigate two distinct strategies: Cluster-to-Cluster, which processes clusters sequentially using problem-specific aggregate criteria (such as cumulative vertex weights in the Maximum Weighted Independent Set Problem (MWISP)), and Pick-and-Sort, which iteratively selects and sorts representative variables from each cluster to balance local diversity with heuristic guidance. Later on, developing some theoretical results on the growth of the size of DDs for MWISP we propose two different policies for setting the number of clusters within the proposed framework. We embed these strategies into a DD-based branch-and-bound algorithm and evaluate them on the MWISP. Across benchmark instances, the proposed methodology consistently reduces computational costs compared to standard dynamic variable ordering baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u53d8\u91cf\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5e76\u5728MWISP\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u91cf\u6392\u5e8f\u867d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u5076\u8fb9\u754c\u7d27\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5168\u5c40\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u8f83\u5927\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff1aCluster-to-Cluster\uff08\u6309\u96c6\u7fa4\u987a\u5e8f\u5904\u7406\uff09\u548cPick-and-Sort\uff08\u8fed\u4ee3\u9009\u62e9\u5e76\u6392\u5e8f\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u53d8\u91cf\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u96c6\u7fa4\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728MWISP\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u91cf\u6392\u5e8f\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u6392\u5e8f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u91cf\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5728MWISP\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Reproducing these bugs is essential for their resolution, but it is extremely challenging due to the inherent nondeterminism of DL models and their tight coupling with hardware and software environments. According to recent studies, only about 3% of DL bugs can be reliably reproduced using manual approaches. To address these challenges, we present RepGen, a novel, automated, and intelligent approach for reproducing deep learning bugs. RepGen constructs a learning-enhanced context from a project, develops a comprehensive plan for bug reproduction, employs an iterative generate-validate-refine mechanism, and thus generates such code using an LLM that reproduces the bug at hand. We evaluate RepGen on 106 real-world deep learning bugs and achieve a reproduction rate of 80.19%, a 19.81% improvement over the state-of-the-art measure.

We introduce PANDA-PLUS-Bench, a curated benchmark dataset derived from expert-annotated prostate biopsies designed specifically to quantify this failure mode. The benchmark comprises nine carefully selected whole slide images from nine unique patients containing diverse Gleason patterns, with non-overlapping tissue patches extracted at both 512x512 and 224x224 pixel resolutions across eight augmentation conditions. Using this benchmark, we evaluate seven foundation models on their ability to separate biological signal from slide-level confounders. Our results reveal substantial variation in robustness across models: Virchow2 achieved the lowest slide-level encoding among large-scale models (81.0%) yet exhibited the second-lowest cross-slide accuracy (47.2%). HistoEncoder, trained specifically on prostate tissue, demonstrated the highest cross-slide accuracy (59.7%) and the strongest slide-level encoding (90.3%), suggesting tissue-specific training may enhance both biological feature capture and slide-specific signatures. All models exhibited measurable within-slide vs. cross-slide accuracy gaps, though the magnitude varied from 19.9 percentage points to 26.9 percentage points.

Existing automated systems are normally task-specific, lacking a unified framework to manage diverse, end-to-end workflows--from data preprocessing to advanced interpretation--across diverse RS applications. To address this gap, this paper introduces CangLing-KnowFlow, a unified intelligent agent framework that integrates a Procedural Knowledge Base (PKB), Dynamic Workflow Adjustment, and an Evolutionary Memory Module. The PKB, comprising 1,008 expert-validated workflow cases across 162 practical RS tasks, guides planning and substantially reduces hallucinations common in general-purpose agents. During runtime failures, the Dynamic Workflow Adjustment autonomously diagnoses and replans recovery strategies, while the Evolutionary Memory Module continuously learns from these events, iteratively enhancing the agent's knowledge and performance. This synergy enables CangLing-KnowFlow to adapt, learn, and operate reliably across diverse, complex tasks. We evaluated CangLing-KnowFlow on the KnowFlow-Bench, a novel benchmark of 324 workflows inspired by real-world applications, testing its performance across 13 top Large Language Model (LLM) backbones, from open-source to commercial. Across all complex tasks, CangLing-KnowFlow surpassed the Reflexion baseline by at least 4% in Task Success Rate. As the first most comprehensive validation along this emerging field, this research demonstrates the great potential of CangLing-KnowFlow as a robust, efficient, and scalable automated solution for complex EO challenges by leveraging expert knowledge (Knowledge) into adaptive and verifiable procedures (Flow).", "AI": {"tldr": "CangLing-KnowFlow\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9065\u611f\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u7ba1\u7406\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8fc7\u7a0b\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff08PKB\uff09\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u8fdb\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6848\u4f8b\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728KnowFlow-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCangLing-KnowFlow\u5728\u6240\u6709\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6bd4Reflexion\u57fa\u7ebf\u81f3\u5c11\u9ad8\u51fa4%\u3002", "conclusion": "CangLing-KnowFlow\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u8fdb\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u5730\u7403\u89c2\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002"}}

Preventing such toxicity before it emerges requires a clear understanding of how harmful conversations unfold.

Our analysis reveals that toxicity can be forecast by tension triggers, sentiment shifts, and specific conversational patterns.\n  We present a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework for predicting conversational derailment on GitHub using a two-step prompting pipeline. First, we generate \\textit{Summaries of Conversation Dynamics} (SCDs) via Least-to-Most (LtM) prompting; then we use these summaries to estimate the \\textit{likelihood of derailment}. Evaluated on Qwen and Llama models, our LtM strategy achieves F1-scores of 0.901 and 0.852, respectively, at a decision threshold of 0.3, outperforming established NLP baselines on conversation derailment. External validation on a dataset of 308 GitHub issue threads (65 toxic, 243 non-toxic) yields an F1-score up to 0.797.

Despite aggressive treatment, the median survival rate is less than 15 months. Accurate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) tumor segmentation is critical for surgical planning, radiotherapy, and disease monitoring. While deep learning models have improved the accuracy of automated segmentation, large-scale pre-trained models generalize poorly and often underperform, producing systematic errors such as false positives, label swaps, and slice discontinuities in slices. These limitations are further compounded by unequal access to GPU resources and the growing environmental cost of large-scale model training. In this work, we propose adaptive post-processing techniques to refine the quality of glioma segmentations produced by large-scale pretrained models developed for various types of tumors. We demonstrated the techniques in multiple BraTS 2025 segmentation challenge tasks, with the ranking metric improving by 14.9 % for the sub-Saharan Africa challenge and 0.9% for the adult glioma challenge. This approach promotes a shift in brain tumor segmentation research from increasingly complex model architectures to efficient, clinically aligned post-processing strategies that are precise, computationally fair, and sustainable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u4f18\u5316\u80f6\u8d28\u7624\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u5728BraTS 2025\u6311\u6218\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5021\u5bfc\u8f6c\u5411\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u4e14\u5e38\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5982\u5047\u9633\u6027\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u4ea4\u6362\u548c\u5207\u7247\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cGPU\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u5747\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u73af\u5883\u6210\u672c\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u80bf\u7624\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u80f6\u8d28\u7624\u5206\u5272\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aBraTS 2025\u5206\u5272\u6311\u6218\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6492\u54c8\u62c9\u4ee5\u5357\u975e\u6d32\u6311\u6218\u7684\u6392\u540d\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8614.9%\uff0c\u6210\u4eba\u80f6\u8d28\u7624\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e860.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u5021\u5c06\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u70b9\u4ece\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u8f6c\u5411\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4e34\u5e8a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u516c\u5e73\u4e14\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u3002"}}

This raises a critical need for novel methods that verify ownership and detect unauthorized, possibly unsafe misuse. While watermarking is established in other domains, physical policies present a unique challenge: remote detection. Existing methods assume access to the robot's internal state, but auditors are often limited to external observations (e.g., video footage). This ``Physical Observation Gap'' means the watermark must be detected from signals that are noisy, asynchronous, and filtered by unknown system dynamics. We formalize this challenge using the concept of a \\textit{glimpse sequence}, and introduce Colored Noise Coherency (CoNoCo), the first watermarking strategy designed for remote detection. CoNoCo embeds a spectral signal into the robot's motions by leveraging the policy's inherent stochasticity. To show it does not degrade performance, we prove CoNoCo preserves the marginal action distribution. Our experiments demonstrate strong, robust detection across various remote modalities, including motion capture and side-way/top-down video footage, in both simulated and real-world robot experiments.

While current state-of-the-art systems rely on closed data or compute-heavy models, TalkVerse offers 2.3 million high-resolution (720p/1080p) audio-video synchronized clips totaling 6.3k hours. These are curated from over 60k hours of video via a transparent pipeline that includes scene-cut detection, aesthetic assessment, strict audio-visual synchronization checks, and comprehensive annotations including 2D skeletons and structured visual/audio-style captions. Leveraging TalkVerse, we present a reproducible 5B DiT baseline built on Wan2.2-5B. By utilizing a video VAE with a high downsampling ratio and a sliding window mechanism with motion-frame context, our model achieves minute-long generation with low drift. It delivers comparable lip-sync and visual quality to the 14B Wan-S2V model but with 10$\\times$ lower inference cost. To enhance storytelling in long videos, we integrate an MLLM director to rewrite prompts based on audio and visual cues.

To overcome this limitation, we propose MiVLA, a generalizable VLA empowered by human-robot mutual imitation pre-training, which leverages inherent behavioral similarity between human hands and robotic arms to build a foundation of strong behavioral priors for both human actions and robotic control. Specifically, our method utilizes kinematic rules with left/right hand coordinate systems for bidirectional alignment between human and robot action spaces. Given human or simulated robot demonstrations, MiVLA is trained to forecast behavior trajectories for one embodiment, and imitate behaviors for another one unseen in the demonstration. Based on this mutual imitation, it integrates the behavioral fidelity of real-world human data with the manipulative diversity of simulated robot data into a unified model, thereby enhancing the generalization capability for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on both simulation and real-world platforms with three robots (ARX, PiPer and LocoMan), demonstrate that MiVLA achieves strong improved generalization capability, outperforming state-of-the-art VLAs (e.g., $\\boldsymbol\u03c0_{0}$, $\\boldsymbol\u03c0_{0.5}$ and H-RDT) by 25% in simulation, and 14% in real-world robot control tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "MiVLA\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b-\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u76f8\u4e92\u6a21\u4eff\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347VLA\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u76f8\u673a\u89c6\u89d2\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u624b\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u81c2\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5de6\u53f3\u624b\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e76\u6a21\u4eff\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u672a\u89c1\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\uff0cMiVLA\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u03c0\u2080\u3001\u03c0\u2080.\u2085\u548cH-RDT\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "MiVLA\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b-\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u76f8\u4e92\u6a21\u4eff\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLA\uff09\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5206\u522b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd525%\u548c14%\u3002"}}

Three experimental conditions (full-page input, individual item input, and optimized multimodal input) were designed to evaluate model performance across different data structures. Quantitative results indicated that unstructured inputs led to significant performance degradation due to segmentation and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) failures. Even under optimized conditions, models exhibited fundamental reasoning flaws. Qualitative analysis revealed that \"Perception Errors\" were dominant, highlighting a \"Perception-Cognition Gap\" where models failed to interpret symbolic meanings in schematic diagrams despite recognizing visual data. Furthermore, models demonstrated a \"Calculation-Conceptualization Discrepancy,\" successfully performing calculations while failing to apply the underlying scientific concepts, and \"Process Hallucination,\" where models skipped visual verification in favor of plausible but unfounded background knowledge. Addressing the challenge of unauthorized AI use in coursework, this study provides actionable cues for designing \"AI-resistant questions\" that target these specific cognitive vulnerabilities.

To bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic analysis of 1,367 papers published in FSE, ASE, and ICSE between 2022 and 2025, identifying key research topics, commonly used benchmarks, industrial relevance, and open-source availability. We then carry out an empirical survey across 17 organizations, collecting 282 responses on six prominent topics, i.e., program analysis, automated testing, code generation/completion, issue resolution, pre-trained code models, and dependency management, through structured questionnaires.

We present Puzzle Curriculum GRPO (PC-GRPO), a supervision-free recipe for RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) that strengthens visual reasoning in VLMs without annotations or external verifiers. PC-GRPO replaces labels with three self-supervised puzzle environments: PatchFit, Rotation (with binary rewards) and Jigsaw (with graded partial credit mitigating reward sparsity).

We further monitor Reasoning-Answer Consistency (RAC) during post-training: mirroring reports for vanilla GRPO in LLMs, RAC typically rises early then degrades; our curriculum delays this decline, and consistency-enforcing reward schemes further boost RAC. RAC correlates with downstream accuracy. Across diverse benchmarks and on Qwen-7B and Qwen-3B backbones, PC-GRPO improves reasoning quality, training stability, and end-task accuracy, offering a practical path to scalable, verifiable, and interpretable RL post-training for VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "PC-GRPO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u76d1\u7763\u7684RL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8c1c\u9898\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8bfe\u7a0b\u63d0\u5347VLMs\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6807\u6ce8\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u7a00\u758f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709RL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982GRPO\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u4e14\u5608\u6742\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u7a00\u758f\u53ca\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7b54\u6848\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "PC-GRPO\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8c1c\u9898\u73af\u5883\uff08PatchFit\u3001Rotation\u548cJigsaw\uff09\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u96be\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u63a8\u7406-\u7b54\u6848\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08RAC\uff09\u3002", "result": "PC-GRPO\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548cQwen-7B/Qwen-3B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PC-GRPO\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8c1c\u9898\u73af\u5883\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86VLMs\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684RL\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Unlike existing variable transmission systems that require additional actuators for active control, the proposed LBVT mechanism leverages a pre-tensioned spring and a four-bar linkage to passively modify the transmission ratio, thereby reducing the complexity of robot joint actuation systems. The effectiveness of the LBVT mechanism is evaluated through simulation-based analyses. The results confirm that the system achieves up to a 40 percent increase in transmission ratio upon reaching a predefined torque threshold, effectively amplifying joint torque when required without additional actuation. Furthermore, the simulations demonstrate a torque amplification effect triggered when the applied force exceeds 18 N, highlighting the system ability to autonomously respond to varying load conditions.

To address this challenge, we propose a Trimodal person identification framework that integrates voice, face, and gesture modalities, while remaining robust to modality loss. Our approach leverages multi-task learning to process each modality independently, followed by a cross-attention and gated fusion mechanisms to facilitate interaction across modalities. Moreover, a confidence-weighted fusion strategy dynamically adapts to missing and low-quality data, ensuring optimal classification even in Unimodal or Bimodal scenarios. We evaluate our method on CANDOR, a newly introduced interview-based multimodal dataset, which we benchmark for the first time. Our results demonstrate that the proposed Trimodal system achieves 99.18% Top-1 accuracy on person identification tasks, outperforming conventional Unimodal and late-fusion approaches.

DTs enable monitoring, simulation, prediction, and optimization to enhance decision making and operational efficiency. A key challenge in multi-layered, model-driven DTs is aligning heterogeneous models across abstraction layers, which can lead to semantic mismatches, inconsistencies, and synchronization issues. Existing methods, relying on static mappings and manual updates, are often inflexible, error-prone, and risk compromising data integrity. To address these limitations, we present a heterogeneous model alignment approach for multi-layered, model-driven DTs. The framework incorporates a flexibility mechanism that allows metamodels to adapt and interconnect seamlessly while maintaining semantic coherence across abstraction layers. It integrates: (i) adaptive conformance mechanisms that link metamodels with evolving models and (ii) a large language model (LLM) validated alignment process that grounds metamodels in domain knowledge, ensuring structural fidelity and conceptual consistency throughout the DT lifecycle. This approach automates semantic correspondences discovery, minimizes manual mapping, and enhances scalability across diverse model types.

Camera-ready for WACV 2026", "summary": "Recent advances in generative AI have enabled the creation of highly realistic digital content, raising concerns around authenticity, ownership, and misuse. While watermarking has become an increasingly important mechanism to trace and protect digital media, most existing image watermarking schemes operate as black boxes, producing global detection scores without offering any insight into how or where the watermark is present. This lack of transparency impacts user trust and makes it difficult to interpret the impact of tampering. In this paper, we present a post-hoc image watermarking method that combines localised embedding with region-level interpretability. Our approach embeds watermark signals in the discrete wavelet transform domain using a statistical block-wise strategy. This allows us to generate detection maps that reveal which regions of an image are likely watermarked or altered. We show that our method achieves strong robustness against common image transformations while remaining sensitive to semantic manipulations. At the same time, the watermark remains highly imperceptible. Compared to prior post-hoc methods, our approach offers more interpretable detection while retaining competitive robustness.

While open-source initiatives have democratized vehicle construction and control software, a substantial gap persists for joint-actuated systems-particularly those requiring waterproof, feedback-enabled actuation suitable for manipulators, grippers, and bioinspired devices. As a result, many research groups face lengthy development cycles, limited reproducibility, and difficulty transitioning laboratory prototypes to field-ready platforms.\n  To address this gap, we introduce an open, cost-effective hardware and software toolkit for underwater manipulation research. The toolkit includes a depth-rated Underwater Robotic Joint (URJ) with early leakage detection, compact control and power management electronics, and a ROS2-based software stack for sensing and multi-mode actuation. All CAD models, fabrication files, PCB sources, firmware, and ROS2 packages are openly released, enabling local manufacturing, modification, and community-driven improvement.\n  The toolkit has undergone extensive laboratory testing and multiple field deployments, demonstrating reliable operation up to 40 m depth across diverse applications, including a 3-DoF underwater manipulator, a tendon-driven soft gripper, and an underactuated sediment sampler. These results validate the robustness, versatility, and reusability of the toolkit for real marine environments.\n  By providing a fully open, field-tested platform, this work aims to lower the barrier to entry for underwater manipulation research, improve reproducibility, and accelerate innovation in underwater field robotics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u7684\u6c34\u4e0b\u64cd\u7eb5\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u5177\u5305\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\uff0c\u5df2\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u548c\u5b9e\u5730\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c34\u4e0b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u672f\u5728\u6d77\u6d0b\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u73af\u5883\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u6d77\u5e95\u5de5\u4e1a\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u6c34\u4e0b\u64cd\u7eb5\u548c\u9a71\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u4ecd\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u3001\u4e13\u6709\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u7814\u7a76\u5bfc\u5411\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u6709\u9650\u83b7\u53d6\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u7684\u3001\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u5177\u5305\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bc4\u7ea7\u7684Underwater Robotic Joint\uff08URJ\uff09\u3001\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u7535\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u7535\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8eROS2\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5806\u6808\u3002\u6240\u6709CAD\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5236\u9020\u6587\u4ef6\u3001PCB\u6e90\u3001\u56fa\u4ef6\u548cROS2\u5305\u90fd\u5df2\u516c\u5f00\u53d1\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u591a\u6b21\u5b9e\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u572840\u7c73\u6df1\u5ea6\u5185\u53ef\u9760\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5305\u62ec3-DoF\u6c34\u4e0b\u64cd\u7eb5\u5668\u3001\u808c\u8171\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8f6f\u5939\u6301\u5668\u548c\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u6c89\u79ef\u7269\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u5f00\u6e90\u3001\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5b9e\u5730\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u6c34\u4e0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5165\u95e8\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u6c34\u4e0b\u73b0\u573a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u672f\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u3002"}}

This limitation constrains the interpretability of automated social network analysis in commercial settings. We present a pose-based computational framework for interaction classification that moves beyond proximity heuristics by modeling the spatiotemporal geometry of anatomical keypoints. Rather than relying on pixel-level appearance or simple distance measures, the proposed method encodes interaction-specific motion signatures from keypoint trajectories, enabling differentiation of social interaction valence. The framework is implemented as an end-to-end computer vision pipeline integrating YOLOv11 for object detection (mAP@0.50: 96.24%), supervised individual identification (98.24% accuracy), ByteTrack for multi-object tracking (81.96% accuracy), ZebraPose for 27-point anatomical keypoint estimation, and a support vector machine classifier trained on pose-derived distance dynamics. On annotated interaction clips collected from a commercial dairy barn, the classifier achieved 77.51% accuracy in distinguishing affiliative and agonistic behaviors using pose information alone. Comparative evaluation against a proximity-only baseline shows substantial gains in behavioral discrimination, particularly for affiliative interactions.

As a result, despite improved semantic generalization, the policy must implicitly infer complex physical dynamics and temporal dependencies solely from robot trajectories. This reliance creates an unsustainable data burden, necessitating continuous, large-scale expert data collection to compensate for the lack of innate physical understanding. We contend that while vision-language pretraining effectively captures semantic priors, it remains blind to physical causality. A more effective paradigm leverages video to jointly capture semantics and visual dynamics during pretraining, thereby isolating the remaining task of low-level control. To this end, we introduce \\model, a novel Video-Action Model (VAM) that pairs a pretrained Internet-scale video model with a flow matching-based action decoder conditioned on its latent representations. The decoder serves as an Inverse Dynamics Model (IDM), generating low-level robot actions from the latent representation of video-space action plans.

Exploring Dependency Update Patterns of Bundled JavaScript Packages on the Web", "comment": "Accepted on ICSE 2026", "summary": "Reusable software components, typically distributed as packages, are a central paradigm of modern software development. The JavaScript ecosystem serves as a prime example, offering millions of packages with their use being promoted as idiomatic. However, download statistics on npm raise security concerns as they indicate a high popularity of vulnerable package versions while their real prevalence on production websites remains unknown. Package version detection mechanisms fill this gap by extracting utilized packages and versions from observed artifacts on the web. Prior research focuses on mechanisms for either hand-selected popular packages in bundles or for single-file resources utilizing the global namespace. This does not allow for a thorough analysis of modern web applications' dependency update behavior at scale. In this work, we improve upon this by presenting Aletheia, a package-agnostic method which dissects JavaScript bundles to identify package versions through algorithms originating from the field of plagiarism detection. We show that this method clearly outperforms the existing approaches in practical settings. Furthermore, we crawl the Tranco top 100,000 domains to reveal that 5% - 20% of domains update their dependencies within 16 weeks. Surprisingly, from a longitudinal perspective, bundled packages are updated significantly faster than their CDN-included counterparts, with consequently up to 10 times fewer known vulnerable package versions included.

This raises a fundamental question: what makes some questions more effective than others? To address this, a quantitative evaluation of question-generation models is essential. Video question generation (VQG) is a topic for video question answering (VideoQA), where questions are generated for given answers. Their evaluation typically focuses on the ability to answer questions, rather than the quality of generated questions. In contrast, we focus on the question quality in eliciting unseen knowledge from human experts. For a continuous improvement of VQG models, we propose a protocol that evaluates the ability by simulating question-answering communication with experts using a question-to-answer retrieval. We obtain the retriever by constructing a novel dataset, EgoExoAsk, which comprises 27,666 QA pairs generated from Ego-Exo4D's expert commentary annotation.

These digital replicas, often utilized as structured repositories of asset-related data, facilitate interoperability across diverse systems. However, extant approaches treat the AAS as a static information model, lacking support for dynamic service integration and system adaptation. The existing body of literature has not yet thoroughly explored the potential for integrating executable behavior, particularly in the form of containerized services, into or from the AAS. This integration could serve to enable proactive functionality. In this paper, we propose a submodel-based architecture that introduces a structured service notion to the AAS, enabling services to dynamically interact with and adapt AAS instances at runtime. This concept is implemented through the extension of a submodel with behavioral definitions, resulting in a modular event-driven architecture capable of deploying containerized services based on embedded trigger conditions. The approach is illustrated through a case study on a 3-axis milling machine.

While numerous performance evaluation metrics exist for assessing perception capabilities, incorporating safety-specific metrics is essential to reliably evaluate object detection systems. A key component for safety evaluation is the ability to distinguish between relevant and non-relevant objects - a challenge addressed by criticality or relevance metrics. This paper presents the first in-depth analysis of criticality metrics for safety evaluation of object detection systems. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we identify and assess a range of applicable metrics. Their effectiveness is empirically validated using the DeepAccident dataset, which features a variety of safety-critical scenarios. To enhance evaluation accuracy, we propose two novel application strategies: bidirectional criticality rating and multi-metric aggregation.

We introduce a scenario-grounded benchmark that evaluates LLMs across biology, chemistry, materials, and physics, where domain experts define research projects of genuine interest and decompose them into modular research scenarios from which vetted questions are sampled. The framework assesses models at two levels: (i) question-level accuracy on scenario-tied items and (ii) project-level performance, where models must propose testable hypotheses, design simulations or experiments, and interpret results. Applying this two-phase scientific discovery evaluation (SDE) framework to state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a consistent performance gap relative to general science benchmarks, diminishing return of scaling up model sizes and reasoning, and systematic weaknesses shared across top-tier models from different providers. Large performance variation in research scenarios leads to changing choices of the best performing model on scientific discovery projects evaluated, suggesting all current LLMs are distant to general scientific \"superintelligence\". Nevertheless, LLMs already demonstrate promise in a great variety of scientific discovery projects, including cases where constituent scenario scores are low, highlighting the role of guided exploration and serendipity in discovery.

Consequently, a 3DGS super-resolution (SR) method is needed to bridge LR inputs and HR rendering. Early 3DGS SR methods rely on single-image SR networks, which lack cross-view consistency and fail to fuse complementary information across views. More recent video-based SR approaches attempt to address this limitation but require strictly sequential frames, limiting their applicability to unstructured multi-view datasets. In this work, we introduce Multi-View Consistent 3D Gaussian Splatting Super-Resolution (MVGSR), a framework that focuses on integrating multi-view information for 3DGS rendering with high-frequency details and enhanced consistency. We first propose an Auxiliary View Selection Method based on camera poses, making our method adaptable for arbitrarily organized multi-view datasets without the need of temporal continuity or data reordering. Furthermore, we introduce, for the first time, an epipolar-constrained multi-view attention mechanism into 3DGS SR, which serves as the core of our proposed multi-view SR network. This design enables the model to selectively aggregate consistent information from auxiliary views, enhancing the geometric consistency and detail fidelity of 3DGS representations.

To probe, we present 3D-Mirage, the first benchmark of real-world illusions (e.g., street art) with precise planar-region annotations and context-restricted crops. To quantify, we propose a Laplacian-based evaluation framework with two metrics: the Deviation Composite Score (DCS) for spurious non-planarity and the Confusion Composite Score (CCS) for contextual instability. To tame this failure, we introduce Grounded Self-Distillation, a parameter-efficient strategy that surgically enforces planarity on illusion ROIs while using a frozen teacher to preserve background knowledge, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

While the value alignment literature has developed techniques for shaping AI values, less attention has been paid to how to determine, under uncertainty, when imperfect alignment is good enough to justify delegation. We argue that rational delegation requires balancing an agent's value (mis)alignment with its epistemic accuracy and its reach (the acts it has available). This paper introduces a formal, decision-theoretic framework to analyze this tradeoff precisely accounting for a principal's uncertainty about these factors. Our analysis reveals a sharp distinction between two delegation scenarios. First, universal delegation (trusting an agent with any problem) demands near-perfect value alignment and total epistemic trust, conditions rarely met in practice. Second, we show that context-specific delegation can be optimal even with significant misalignment. An agent's superior accuracy or expanded reach may grant access to better overall decision problems, making delegation rational in expectation. We develop a novel scoring framework to quantify this ex ante decision. Ultimately, our work provides a principled method for determining when an AI is aligned enough for a given context, shifting the focus from achieving perfect alignment to managing the risks and rewards of delegation under uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790AI\u59d4\u6258\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u7279\u5b9a\u59d4\u6258\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u786e\u5b9a\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u5426\u8db3\u591f\u5408\u7406\u4ee5\u8bc1\u660e\u59d4\u6258\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6b63\u5f53\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b63\u5f0f\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u5206\u6790\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u59d4\u6258\u60c5\u666f\u7684\u9c9c\u660e\u533a\u522b\uff1a\u901a\u7528\u59d4\u6258\u9700\u8981\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u800c\u60c5\u5883\u7279\u5b9a\u59d4\u6258\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u5883\u4e0bAI\u662f\u5426\u8db3\u591f\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5c06\u7126\u70b9\u4ece\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5bf9\u9f50\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7ba1\u7406\u59d4\u6258\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u56de\u62a5\u3002"}}

This raises concerns about intellectual property compliance and the potential unauthorized use of license-restricted code. While membership inference (MI) techniques have been proposed to detect such unauthorized usage, their effectiveness can be undermined by semantically equivalent code transformation techniques, which modify code syntax while preserving semantic.\n  In this work, we systematically investigate whether semantically equivalent code transformation rules might be leveraged to evade MI detection. The results reveal that model accuracy drops by only 1.5% in the worst case for each rule, demonstrating that transformed datasets can effectively serve as substitutes for fine-tuning. Additionally, we find that one of the rules (RenameVariable) reduces MI success by 10.19%, highlighting its potential to obscure the presence of restricted code. To validate these findings, we conduct a causal analysis confirming that variable renaming has the strongest causal effect in disrupting MI detection. Notably, we find that combining multiple transformations does not further reduce MI effectiveness.

High-fidelity lesion area and target organ segmentation constitutes a key component of the computer-assisted surgery workflow. The low contrast levels and noisy backgrounds of ultrasound videos cause missegmentation of organ boundary, which may lead to small object losses and increase boundary segmentation errors. Object tracking in long videos also remains a significant research challenge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a memory bank-based wavelet filtering and fusion network, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure to effectively extract fine-grained detailed spatial features and integrate high-frequency (HF) information. Specifically, memory-based wavelet convolution is presented to simultaneously capture category, detailed information and utilize adjacent information in the encoder. Cascaded wavelet compression is used to fuse multiscale frequency-domain features and expand the receptive field within each convolutional layer. A long short-term memory bank using cross-attention and memory compression mechanisms is designed to track objects in long video. To fully utilize the boundary-sensitive HF details of feature maps, an HF-aware feature fusion module is designed via adaptive wavelet filters in the decoder. In extensive benchmark tests conducted on four ultrasound video datasets (two thyroid nodule, the thyroid gland, the heart datasets) compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method demonstrates marked improvements in segmentation metrics. In particular, our method can more accurately segment small thyroid nodules, demonstrating its effectiveness for cases involving small ultrasound objects in long video.

Attribution methods, which assign credit to input features, have proven effective for explaining the decision making of computer vision models. From these, context attributions have emerged as a promising approach for explaining the behavior of autoregressive LLMs. However, current context attributions produce incomplete explanations by directly relating generated tokens to the prompt, discarding inter-generational influence in the process. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce the Context Attribution via Graph Explanations (CAGE) framework. CAGE introduces an attribution graph: a directed graph that quantifies how each generation is influenced by both the prompt and all prior generations. The graph is constructed to preserve two properties-causality and row stochasticity. The attribution graph allows context attributions to be computed by marginalizing intermediate contributions along paths in the graph. Across multiple models, datasets, metrics, and methods, CAGE improves context attribution faithfulness, achieving average gains of up to 40%.", "AI": {"tldr": "CAGE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u91ca\u5fe0\u5b9e\u602740%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4ee3\u9645\u95f4\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Context Attribution via Graph Explanations (CAGE)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u5411\u56fe\uff08\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\uff09\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u6240\u6709\u5148\u524d\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "CAGE\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u6307\u6807\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CAGE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe40%\u3002"}}

This has led to a push to offload computations to general purpose hardware accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs, and a renewed interest in designing problem-specific accelerators using FPGAs. However, the development process of these problem-specific accelerators currently suffers from the \"two-language problem\": algorithms are developed in one (usually higher-level) language, but the kernels are implemented in another language at a completely different level of abstraction and requiring fundamentally different expertise. To address this problem, we propose a new MLIR-based compiler toolchain that unifies the development process by automatically compiling kernels written in the Julia programming language into SystemVerilog without the need for any additional directives or language customisations. Our toolchain supports both dynamic and static scheduling, directly integrates with the AXI4-Stream protocol to interface with subsystems like on- and off-chip memory, and generates vendor-agnostic RTL. This prototype toolchain is able to synthesize a set of signal processing/mathematical benchmarks that can operate at 100MHz on real FPGA devices, achieving between 59.71% and 82.6% of the throughput of designs generated by state-of-the-art toolchains that only compile from low-level languages like C or C++.

Existing approaches to scalable interpretability use hand-designed agents that make and test hypotheses about how internal activations relate to external behavior. We propose to instead turn this task into an end-to-end training objective, by training interpretability assistants to accurately predict model behavior from activations through a communication bottleneck. Specifically, an encoder compresses activations to a sparse list of concepts, and a decoder reads this list and answers a natural language question about the model. We show how to pretrain this assistant on large unstructured data, then finetune it to answer questions. The resulting architecture, which we call a Predictive Concept Decoder, enjoys favorable scaling properties: the auto-interp score of the bottleneck concepts improves with data, as does the performance on downstream applications. Specifically, PCDs can detect jailbreaks, secret hints, and implanted latent concepts, and are able to accurately surface latent user attributes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684Predictive Concept Decoder\uff08PCD\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u7801-\u89e3\u7801\u67b6\u6784\u538b\u7f29\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5e76\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c06\u6fc0\u6d3b\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u6982\u5ff5\u5217\u8868\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8bfb\u53d6\u8be5\u5217\u8868\u5e76\u56de\u7b54\u5173\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "PCDs\u5728\u5927\u578b\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u74f6\u9888\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u89e3\u91ca\u8bc4\u5206\u968f\u6570\u636e\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u6027\u80fd\u4e5f\u76f8\u5e94\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "PCDs\uff08Predictive Concept Decoders\uff09\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u8d8a\u72f1\u3001\u79d8\u5bc6\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u690d\u5165\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u51c6\u786e\u63ed\u793a\u6f5c\u5728\u7528\u6237\u5c5e\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent AIGC-based approaches partially automate asset creation and rigging, but they either inherit the heavy costs of full 3D pipelines or rely on video-synthesis paradigms that sacrifice 3D controllability and interactivity. We focus on single-image 3D animation generation and argue that progress is fundamentally constrained by a trade-off between rendering quality and 3D control.\n  To address this limitation, we propose a lightweight 3D animation framework that decouples geometric control from appearance synthesis. The core idea is a 2D-3D aligned proxy representation that uses a coarse 3D estimate as a structural carrier, while delegating high-fidelity appearance and view synthesis to learned image-space generative priors. This proxy formulation enables 3D-aware motion control and interaction comparable to classical pipelines, without requiring accurate geometry or expensive optimization, and naturally extends to coherent background animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves efficient animation generation on low-power platforms and outperforms video-based 3D animation generation in identity preservation, geometric and textural consistency, and the level of precise, interactive control it offers to users.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea73D\u52a8\u753b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u51e0\u4f55\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u5916\u89c2\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf3D\u52a8\u753b\u751f\u4ea7\u6d41\u7a0b\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709AIGC\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u7ee7\u627f\u5b8c\u65743D\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u727a\u72723D\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e3D\u63a7\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u76843D\u52a8\u753b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u51e0\u4f55\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u5916\u89c2\u5408\u6210\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5229\u75282D-3D\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5c06\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u59d4\u6258\u7ed9\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u52a8\u753b\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u76843D\u52a8\u753b\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u52a8\u753b\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u7eb9\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u7cbe\u786e\u4ea4\u4e92\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u76843D\u52a8\u753b\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Meanwhile, most of the existing datasets lack the labels indicating the degree of action standardization, and the action quality assessment datasets lack explainability and detailed feedback. Therefore, we define a new Human Action Form Assessment (AFA) task, and introduce a new diverse dataset CoT-AFA, which contains a large scale of fitness and martial arts videos with multi-level annotations for comprehensive video analysis. We enrich the CoT-AFA dataset with a novel Chain-of-Thought explanation paradigm. Instead of offering isolated feedback, our explanations provide a complete reasoning process--from identifying an action step to analyzing its outcome and proposing a concrete solution. Furthermore, we propose a framework named Explainable Fitness Assessor, which can not only judge an action but also explain why and provide a solution. This framework employs two parallel processing streams and a dynamic gating mechanism to fuse visual and semantic information, thereby boosting its analytical capabilities. The experimental results demonstrate that our method has achieved improvements in explanation generation (e.g., +16.0% in CIDEr), action classification (+2.7% in accuracy) and quality assessment (+2.1% in accuracy), revealing great potential of CoT-AFA for future studies.

However, the substantial scale difference between transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image features at the nanoscale and optical microscopy (OM) or immunofluorescence microscopy (IM) images at the microscale poses a challenge for existing multi-modal and multi-scale models in achieving effective feature fusion and improving classification accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a cross-modal ultra-scale learning network (CMUS-Net) for the auxiliary diagnosis of multiple glomerular diseases. CMUS-Net utilizes multiple ultrastructural information to bridge the scale difference between nanometer and micrometer images. Specifically, we introduce a sparse multi-instance learning module to aggregate features from TEM images. Furthermore, we design a cross-modal scale attention module to facilitate feature interaction, enhancing pathological semantic information. Finally, multiple loss functions are combined, allowing the model to weigh the importance among different modalities and achieve precise classification of glomerular diseases. Our method follows the conventional process of renal biopsy pathology diagnosis and, for the first time, performs automatic classification of multiple glomerular diseases including IgA nephropathy (IgAN), membranous nephropathy (MN), and lupus nephritis (LN) based on images from three modalities and two scales. On an in-house dataset, CMUS-Net achieves an ACC of 95.37+/-2.41%, an AUC of 99.05+/-0.53%, and an F1-score of 95.32+/-2.41%. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CMUS-Net outperforms other well-known multi-modal or multi-scale methods and show its generalization capability in staging MN.

Current deepfake detection methods are unreliable for two reasons: (i) distinguishing inauthentic content post-hoc is often impossible (e.g., with memorized samples), leading to an unbounded false positive rate (FPR); and (ii) detection lacks robustness, as adversaries can adapt to known detectors with near-perfect accuracy using minimal computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose a resynthesis framework to determine if a sample is authentic or if its authenticity can be plausibly denied. We make two key contributions focusing on the high-precision, low-recall setting against efficient (i.e., compute-restricted) adversaries. First, we demonstrate that our calibrated resynthesis method is the most reliable approach for verifying authentic samples while maintaining controllable, low FPRs. Second, we show that our method achieves adversarial robustness against efficient adversaries, whereas prior methods are easily evaded under identical compute budgets.

With more LLM users, the KV cache footprint can easily exceed GPU memory capacity, so prior work has proposed to either evict KV cache to lower-tier storage devices, or compress KV cache so that more KV cache can be fit in the fast memory. However, prior work misses an important opportunity: jointly optimizing the eviction and compression decisions across all KV caches to minimize average generation latency without hurting quality.\n  We propose EVICPRESS, a KV-cache management system that applies lossy compression and adaptive eviction to KV cache across multiple storage tiers. Specifically, for each KV cache of a context, EVICPRESS considers the effect of compression and eviction of the KV cache on the average generation quality and delay across all contexts as a whole. To achieve this, EVICPRESS proposes a unified utility function that quantifies the effect of quality and delay of the lossy compression or eviction. To this end, EVICPRESS's profiling module periodically updates the utility function scores on all possible eviction-compression configurations for all contexts and places KV caches using a fast heuristic to rearrange KV caches on all storage tiers, with the goal of maximizing the utility function scores on each storage tier. Compared to the baselines that evict KV cache or compress KV cache, EVICPRESS achieves higher KV-cache hit rates on fast devices, i.e., lower delay, while preserving high generation quality by applying conservative compression to contexts that are sensitive to compression errors.

In this work, we propose an efficient RAW Image Enhancement Network (ERIENet), which parallelly processes multi-scale information with efficient convolution modules, and takes advantage of rich information in green channels to guide the reconstruction of images. Firstly, we introduce an efficient multi-scale fully-parallel architecture with a novel channel-aware residual dense block to extract feature maps, which reduces computational costs and achieves real-time processing speed. Secondly, we introduce a green channel guidance branch to exploit the rich information within the green channels of the input RAW image. It increases the quality of reconstruction results with few parameters and computations. Experiments on commonly used low-light image enhancement datasets show that ERIENet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing low-light RAW images with higher effiency.

They often misinterpret high-frequency sensor noise as valid detail. This creates a \"Noise Trap,\" paradoxically assigning higher scores to noisy images and misguiding fusion algorithms.To address this, we propose the Target-Background Contrast (TBC) metric.

While existing methods achieve promising results in the camera coordinate system by assuming zero camera rotation, this simplification leads to significant errors when transforming the reconstructed mesh to the world coordinate system. To address this challenge, we propose Mesh-Plug, a plug-and-play module that accurately transforms human meshes from camera coordinates to world coordinates. Our key innovation lies in a human-centered approach that leverages both RGB images and depth maps rendered from the initial mesh to estimate camera rotation parameters, eliminating the dependency on environmental cues. Specifically, we first train a camera rotation prediction module that focuses on the human body's spatial configuration to estimate camera pitch angle. Then, by integrating the predicted camera parameters with the initial mesh, we design a mesh adjustment module that simultaneously refines the root joint orientation and body pose.

To address this issue, we propose SLCFormer, a novel spectral-local context transformer framework for effective nighttime lens flare removal.

Furthermore, we introduce a ZernikeVAE-based scatter flare generation pipeline to synthesize physically realistic scatter flares with spatially varying PSFs, bridging optical physics and data-driven training.

Dunn", "Usman Naseem", "Jinman Kim"], "title": "Intersectional Fairness in Vision-Language Models for Medical Image Disease Classification", "comment": null, "summary": "Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly multimodal vision-language models (VLM), often exhibit intersectional biases where models are systematically less confident in diagnosing marginalised patient subgroups. Such bias can lead to higher rates of inaccurate and missed diagnoses due to demographically skewed data and divergent distributions of diagnostic certainty. Current fairness interventions frequently fail to address these gaps or compromise overall diagnostic performance to achieve statistical parity among the subgroups. In this study, we developed Cross-Modal Alignment Consistency (CMAC-MMD), a training framework that standardises diagnostic certainty across intersectional patient subgroups. Unlike traditional debiasing methods, this approach equalises the model's decision confidence without requiring sensitive demographic data during clinical inference. We evaluated this approach using 10,015 skin lesion images (HAM10000) with external validation on 12,000 images (BCN20000), and 10,000 fundus images for glaucoma detection (Harvard-FairVLMed), stratifying performance by intersectional age, gender, and race attributes. In the dermatology cohort, the proposed method reduced the overall intersectional missed diagnosis gap (difference in True Positive Rate, $\u0394$TPR) from 0.50 to 0.26 while improving the overall Area Under the Curve (AUC) from 0.94 to 0.97 compared to standard training. Similarly, for glaucoma screening, the method reduced $\u0394$TPR from 0.41 to 0.31, achieving a better AUC of 0.72 (vs. 0.71 baseline).

Traditional approaches to solving this problem rely on domain-specific counting architectures, which are trained using datasets annotated with a predefined set of object categories. However, recent progress in creating large-scale multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) suggests that these domain-general architectures may offer a flexible alternative for open-set object counting. In this study, we therefore systematically compare the performance of state-of-the-art specialized counting architectures against VLMs on two popular counting datasets, as well as on a novel benchmark specifically created to have a finer-grained control over the visual properties of test images. Our findings show that most VLMs can approximately enumerate the number of items in a visual scene, matching or even surpassing the performance of specialized computer vision architectures. Notably, enumeration accuracy significantly improves when VLMs are prompted to generate intermediate representations (i.e., locations and verbal labels) of each object to be counted. Nevertheless, none of the models can reliably count the number of objects in complex visual scenes, showing that further research is still needed to create AI systems that can reliably deploy counting procedures in realistic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "VLM\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u5bf9\u8c61\u8ba1\u6570\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e13\u7528\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u65f6\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4ecd\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u5bf9\u8c61\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u5bf9\u8c61\u8ba1\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u7075\u6d3b\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u8ba1\u6570\u67b6\u6784\u4e0eVLM\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u6d41\u884c\u8ba1\u6570\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a7\u5236\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u591a\u6570VLM\u80fd\u8fd1\u4f3c\u679a\u4e3e\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u54c1\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e13\u7528\u67b6\u6784\uff1b\u5f53\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u5f85\u8ba1\u6570\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff08\u5982\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6807\u7b7e\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u679a\u4e3e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u591a\u6570\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5728\u679a\u4e3e\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u54c1\u6570\u91cf\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e13\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4ecd\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u8ba1\u6570\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4ecd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u8ba1\u6570\u3002"}}

To achieve effective fusion, it is crucial to fully exploit the complementary information between the two modalities. Traditional CNN-based methods typically rely on channel-wise concatenation with fixed convolutional operators, which limits their adaptability to diverse spatial and spectral variations. While cross-attention mechanisms enable global interactions, they are computationally inefficient and may dilute fine-grained correspondences, making it difficult to capture complex semantic relationships. Recent advances in the Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) architecture have demonstrated impressive success in image generation and editing tasks. Unlike cross-attention, MMDiT employs in-context conditioning to facilitate more direct and efficient cross-modal information exchange. In this paper, we propose MMMamba, a cross-modal in-context fusion framework for pan-sharpening, with the flexibility to support image super-resolution in a zero-shot manner. Built upon the Mamba architecture, our design ensures linear computational complexity while maintaining strong cross-modal interaction capacity.

Existing automated quality assessment methods are largely limited to binary decisions and provide little interpretability. We introduce AutoMAC-MRI, an explainable framework for grading motion artifacts across heterogeneous MR contrasts and orientations. The approach uses supervised contrastive learning to learn a discriminative representation of motion severity. Within this feature space, we compute grade-specific affinity scores that quantify an image's proximity to each motion grade, thereby making grade assignments transparent and interpretable. We evaluate AutoMAC-MRI on more than 5000 expert-annotated brain MRI slices spanning multiple contrasts and views. Experiments assessing affinity scores against expert labels show that the scores align well with expert judgment, supporting their use as an interpretable measure of motion severity.

Another important capability is to read measurements from instruments and apparatus. Here, we tried to mimic a human inspired approach to read measurements from a linear scale. As a test case we have picked reading level from a syringe and a measuring cylinder. For a randomly oriented syringe we carry out transformations to correct the orientation. To make the system efficient and robust, the area of interest is reduced to just the linear scale containing part of the image.

Existing FSAD methods largely rely on pre-trained feature representations to detect anomalies, but the inherent domain gap between pre-trained representations and target FSAD scenarios is often overlooked. This study proposes a Prototypical Learning Guided Context-Aware Segmentation Network (PCSNet) to address the domain gap, thereby improving feature descriptiveness in target scenarios and enhancing FSAD performance. In particular, PCSNet comprises a prototypical feature adaption (PFA) sub-network and a context-aware segmentation (CAS) sub-network. PFA extracts prototypical features as guidance to ensure better feature compactness for normal data while distinct separation from anomalies. A pixel-level disparity classification loss is also designed to make subtle anomalies more distinguishable. Then a CAS sub-network is introduced for pixel-level anomaly localization, where pseudo anomalies are exploited to facilitate the training process. Experimental results on MVTec and MPDD demonstrate the superior FSAD performance of PCSNet, with 94.9% and 80.2% image-level AUROC in an 8-shot scenario, respectively. Real-world applications on automotive plastic part inspection further demonstrate that PCSNet can achieve promising results with limited training samples.

Partially View-aligned Clustering aims to learn correspondences between misaligned view samples to better exploit the potential consistency and complementarity across views, including both aligned and unaligned data. However, most existing PVC methods fail to leverage unaligned data to capture the shared semantics among samples from the same cluster. Moreover, the inherent heterogeneity of multi-view data induces distributional shifts in representations, leading to inaccuracies in establishing meaningful correspondences between cross-view latent features and, consequently, impairing learning effectiveness.

However, a major drawback of this scheme is its tendency to overly generalize, primarily due to the similarities between input and supervisory signals. In order to address this issue, this paper introduces a novel technique called masked reverse knowledge distillation (MRKD). By employing image-level masking (ILM) and feature-level masking (FLM), MRKD transforms the task of image reconstruction into image restoration. Specifically, ILM helps to capture global information by differentiating input signals from supervisory signals. On the other hand, FLM incorporates synthetic feature-level anomalies to ensure that the learned representations contain sufficient local information.

Modeling these bidirectional dynamics in 3D is essential for building expressive avatars and interactive robots. However, existing frameworks often treat talking and listening as independent processes or rely on non-causal full-sequence modeling, hindering temporal coherence across turns. We present TIMAR (Turn-level Interleaved Masked AutoRegression), a causal framework for 3D conversational head generation that models dialogue as interleaved audio-visual contexts. It fuses multimodal information within each turn and applies turn-level causal attention to accumulate conversational history, while a lightweight diffusion head predicts continuous 3D head dynamics that captures both coordination and expressive variability. Experiments on the DualTalk benchmark show that TIMAR reduces Fr\u00e9chet Distance and MSE by 15-30% on the test set, and achieves similar gains on out-of-distribution data.

In this work, we investigate the trade-off through empirical studies, yielding two key observations. First, we discover the reward clustering phenomenon in which many trajectories collapse toward the group-mean reward, offering limited optimization value. Second, we design a heuristic strategy named Optimal Variance Filtering (OVF), and verify that a high-variance subset of trajectories, selected by OVF can outperform the larger, unfiltered group. However, this static, post-sampling OVF approach still necessitates critical computational overhead, as it performs unnecessary sampling for trajectories that are ultimately discarded. To resolve this, we propose Pro-GRPO (Proactive GRPO), a novel dynamic framework that integrates latent feature-based trajectory pruning into the sampling process. Through the early termination of reward-clustered trajectories, Pro-GRPO reduces computational overhead. Leveraging its efficiency, Pro-GRPO employs an \"Expand-and-Prune\" strategy. This strategy first expands the size of initial sampling group to maximize trajectory diversity, then it applies multi-step OVF to the latents, avoiding prohibitive computational costs.

A noteworthy solution is vision-text compression (VTC), exemplified by frameworks like DeepSeek-OCR and Glyph, which convert long texts into dense 2D visual representations, thereby achieving token compression ratios of 3x-20x. However, the impact of this high information density on the core long-context capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) remains under-investigated. To address this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for VTC and systematically assess the performance of VLMs across three long-context understanding settings: VTC-Retrieval, which evaluates the model's ability to retrieve and aggregate information; VTC-Reasoning, which requires models to infer latent associations to locate facts with minimal lexical overlap; and VTC-Memory, which measures comprehensive question answering within long-term dialogue memory.

This work introduces the task of action anticipation in basketball broadcast videos, focusing on predicting which team will gain possession of the ball following a shot attempt. To benchmark this task, a new self-curated dataset comprising 100,000 basketball video clips, over 300 hours of footage, and more than 2,000 manually annotated rebound events is presented. Comprehensive baseline results are reported using state-of-the-art action anticipation methods, representing the first application of deep learning techniques to basketball rebound prediction. Additionally, two complementary tasks, rebound classification and rebound spotting, are explored, demonstrating that this dataset supports a wide range of video understanding applications in basketball, for which no comparable datasets currently exist. Experimental results highlight both the feasibility and inherent challenges of anticipating rebounds, providing valuable insights into predictive modeling for dynamic multi-agent sports scenarios.

We investigate whether preserving marker independence, combined with deliberately shallow architectures, provides a more suitable inductive bias for self-supervised representation learning in multiplex data than increasing model scale. Using a Hodgkin lymphoma CODEX dataset with 145,000 cells and 49 markers, we compare standard early-fusion CNNs with channel-separated architectures, including a marker-aware baseline and our novel shallow Channel-Independent Model (CIM-S) with 5.5K parameters. After contrastive pretraining and linear evaluation, early-fusion models show limited ability to retain marker-specific information and struggle particularly with rare-cell discrimination. Channel-independent architectures, and CIM-S in particular, achieve substantially stronger representations despite their compact size. These findings are consistent across multiple self-supervised frameworks, remain stable across augmentation settings, and are reproducible across both the 49-marker and reduced 18-marker settings. These results show that lightweight, channel-independent architectures can match or surpass deep early-fusion CNNs and foundation models for multiplex representation learning.

However, a fundamental challenge remains: how to efficiently acquire high-quality training data while maintaining annotation reliability? We introduce a self-evolving training pipeline powered by the Calibrated Step Reward System, which converts model-generated trajectories into reliable training signals through trajectory-level calibration, achieving >90% annotation accuracy with 10-100x lower cost. Leveraging this pipeline, we introduce Step-GUI, a family of models (4B/8B) that achieves state-of-the-art GUI performance (8B: 80.2% AndroidWorld, 48.5% OSWorld, 62.6% ScreenShot-Pro) while maintaining robust general capabilities. As GUI agent capabilities improve, practical deployment demands standardized interfaces across heterogeneous devices while protecting user privacy. To this end, we propose GUI-MCP, the first Model Context Protocol for GUI automation with hierarchical architecture that combines low-level atomic operations and high-level task delegation to local specialist models, enabling high-privacy execution where sensitive data stays on-device. Finally, to assess whether agents can handle authentic everyday usage, we introduce AndroidDaily, a benchmark grounded in real-world mobile usage patterns with 3146 static actions and 235 end-to-end tasks across high-frequency daily scenarios (8B: static 89.91%, end-to-end 52.50%).

Once leaked, these templates pose a threat: inverting them can yield photorealistic surrogates that compromise privacy and enable impersonation. Although existing research has achieved relatively realistic face template inversion, the reconstructed facial images exhibit over-smoothed facial-part attributes (eyes, nose, mouth) and limited transferability. To address this problem, we present CLIP-FTI, a CLIP-driven fine-grained attribute conditioning framework for face template inversion. Our core idea is to use the CLIP model to obtain the semantic embeddings of facial features, in order to realize the reconstruction of specific facial feature attributes. Specifically, facial feature attribute embeddings extracted from CLIP are fused with the leaked template via a cross-modal feature interaction network and projected into the intermediate latent space of a pretrained StyleGAN. The StyleGAN generator then synthesizes face images with the same identity as the templates but with more fine-grained facial feature attributes. Experiments across multiple face recognition backbones and datasets show that our reconstructions (i) achieve higher identification accuracy and attribute similarity, (ii) recover sharper component-level attribute semantics, and (iii) improve cross-model attack transferability compared to prior reconstruction attacks. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first method to use additional information besides the face template attack to realize face template inversion and obtains SOTA results.", "AI": {"tldr": "CLIP-FTI\u5229\u7528CLIP\u548cStyleGAN\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u4eba\u8138\u6a21\u677f\u53cd\u6f14\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4eba\u8138\u6a21\u677f\u53cd\u6f14\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5b58\u5728\u9762\u90e8\u90e8\u5206\u5c5e\u6027\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u548c\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0cCLIP-FTI\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u9762\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u6a21\u677f\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3StyleGAN\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u9762\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4eba\u8138\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCLIP-FTI\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7ea7\u5c5e\u6027\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CLIP-FTI\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u548cStyleGAN\u7684\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u4eba\u8138\u6a21\u677f\u53cd\u6f14\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u3002"}}

To overcome these stage-dependent ambiguities, we propose ST-DETrack, a spatiotemporal-fusion dual-decoder network designed to preserve branch identity from budding to flowering. Our architecture integrates a spatial decoder, which leverages geometric priors such as position and angle for early-stage tracking, with a temporal decoder that exploits motion consistency to resolve late-stage occlusions.

The models were trained and evaluated on a wildlife image dataset using a standardized preprocessing approach, which included resizing images to a maximum dimension of 800 pixels, converting them to RGB format, and transforming them into PyTorch tensors. A ratio of 70:30 training and validation split was used for model development. The ResNet-101 model achieved a classification accuracy of 94% and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.91, showing strong performance in extracting deep hierarchical features. The Inception v3 model performed slightly better, attaining a classification accuracy of 95% and a mAP of 0.92, attributed to its efficient multi-scale feature extraction through parallel convolutions. Despite the strong results, both models exhibited challenges when detecting species with similar visual characteristics or those captured under poor lighting and occlusion.

Multi-view learning-based approaches mitigate these issues but often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios, as large-scale multi-view datasets with 3D ground truth are scarce and captured under constrained conditions. To overcome this limitation, recent methods rely on 2D pose estimation combined with 2D-to-3D pose lifting trained on synthetic data. Building on our previous MPL framework, we propose RUMPL, a transformer-based 3D pose lifter that introduces a 3D ray-based representation of 2D keypoints. This formulation makes the model independent of camera calibration and the number of views, enabling universal deployment across arbitrary multi-view configurations without retraining or fine-tuning. A new View Fusion Transformer leverages learned fused-ray tokens to aggregate information along rays, further improving multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RUMPL reduces MPJPE by up to 53% compared to triangulation and over 60% compared to transformer-based image-representation baselines. Results on new benchmarks, including in-the-wild multi-view and multi-person datasets, confirm its robustness and scalability.

While the challenge demonstrates that modern deep learning methods achieve competitive accuracy on T1-weighted MRI, it also claims exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen contrasts and resolutions, assertions that contradict established understanding of domain shift in deep learning. In this paper, we perform an independent re-evaluation of these zero-shot claims using rigorous evaluation protocols while addressing potential sources of instrumentation bias. Our findings reveal a more nuanced picture: (1) deep learning methods perform comparably to iterative optimization on in-distribution T1w images and even on human-adjacent species (macaque), demonstrating improved task understanding; (2) however, performance degrades significantly on out-of-distribution contrasts (T2, T2*, FLAIR), with Cohen's d scores ranging from 0.7-1.5, indicating substantial practical impact on downstream clinical workflows; (3) deep learning methods face scalability limitations on high-resolution data, failing to run on 0.6 mm isotropic images, while iterative methods benefit from increased resolution; and (4) deep methods exhibit high sensitivity to preprocessing choices.

Recent approaches tend to adopt diffusion-based image/video generation models for realistic and expressive animation. However, none of these diffusion models realizes high-fidelity disentangled control between the head pose and facial expression, hindering applications like expression-only or pose-only editing and animation. To address this, we propose DeX-Portrait, a novel approach capable of generating expressive portrait animation driven by disentangled pose and expression signals. Specifically, we represent the pose as an explicit global transformation and the expression as an implicit latent code. First, we design a powerful motion trainer to learn both pose and expression encoders for extracting precise and decomposed driving signals. Then we propose to inject the pose transformation into the diffusion model through a dual-branch conditioning mechanism, and the expression latent through cross attention. Finally, we design a progressive hybrid classifier-free guidance for more faithful identity consistency.

Yu Zhou"], "title": "EmoCaliber: Advancing Reliable Visual Emotion Comprehension via Confidence Verbalization and Calibration", "comment": null, "summary": "Visual Emotion Comprehension (VEC) aims to infer sentiment polarities or emotion categories from affective cues embedded in images. In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have established a popular paradigm in VEC, leveraging their generalizability to unify VEC tasks defined under diverse emotion taxonomies. While this paradigm achieves notable success, it typically formulates VEC as a deterministic task, requiring the model to output a single, definitive emotion label for each image. Such a formulation insufficiently accounts for the inherent subjectivity of emotion perception, overlooking alternative interpretations that may be equally plausible to different viewers. To address this limitation, we propose equipping MLLMs with capabilities to verbalize their confidence in emotion predictions. This additional signal provides users with an estimate of both the plausibility of alternative interpretations and the MLLMs' self-assessed competence, thereby enhancing reliability in practice. Building on this insight, we introduce a three-stage training framework that progressively endows with structured reasoning, teaches to verbalize confidence, and calibrates confidence expression, culminating in EmoCaliber, a confidence-aware MLLM for VEC. Through fair and comprehensive evaluations on the unified benchmark VECBench, EmoCaliber demonstrates overall superiority against existing methods in both emotion prediction and confidence estimation. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and mark a feasible step toward more reliable VEC systems.

To fully exploit the potential of such models, a significant focus has been given to the collection of large amounts of training data that cover multiple remote sensing-specific tasks, such as image captioning or visual question answering. However, the cost of using and training LVLMs is high, due to the large number of parameters. While multiple parameter-efficient adaptation techniques have been explored, the computational costs of training and inference with these models can remain prohibitive for most institutions. In this work, we explore the use of encoder-only architectures and propose a model that can effectively address multi-task learning while remaining compact in terms of the number of parameters. In particular, our model tackles combinations of tasks that are not typically explored in a unified model: the generation of text from remote sensing images and cross-modal retrieval.

Our method comprises two stages. First, a new random face, compatible with the original identity, is generated via inpainting using a diffusion model. Second, the new identity is seamlessly incorporated into each video frame through temporally consistent face swapping with authentic expression transfer. The method is evaluated on a dataset of short video recordings of babies and is compared to the popular anonymization method, DeepPrivacy2. Key metrics assessed include the level of de-identification, preservation of facial attributes, impact on human pose estimation (as an example of a downstream task), and presence of artifacts.

However, its development has been hindered by two major challenges: the lack of an efficient evaluation framework that reliably predicts downstream generation performance, and the difficulty of effectively adapting pretrained language models for visual synthesis. To address these issues, we introduce GRAN-TED, a paradigm to Generate Robust, Aligned, and Nuanced Text Embeddings for Diffusion models. Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose TED-6K, a novel text-only benchmark that enables efficient and robust assessment of an encoder's representational quality without requiring costly end-to-end model training. We demonstrate that performance on TED-6K, standardized via a lightweight, unified adapter, strongly correlates with an encoder's effectiveness in downstream generation tasks. Second, guided by this validated framework, we develop a superior text encoder using a novel two-stage training paradigm. This process involves an initial fine-tuning stage on a Multimodal Large Language Model for better visual representation, followed by a layer-wise weighting method to extract more nuanced and potent text features. Our experiments show that the resulting GRAN-TED encoder not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on TED-6K but also leads to demonstrable performance gains in text-to-image and text-to-video generation.

This motivates effective adaptation under limited supervision. SAM3 concept-driven framework generates masks from textual prompts without requiring task-specific modifications, which may enable this adaptation. We evaluate SAM3 for RS imagery across four target types, comparing textual, geometric, and hybrid prompting strategies, under lightweight fine-tuning scales with increasing supervision, alongside zero-shot inference. Results show that combining semantic and geometric cues yields the highest performance across targets and metrics. Text-only prompting exhibits the lowest performance, with marked score gaps for irregularly shaped targets, reflecting limited semantic alignment between SAM3 textual representations and their overhead appearances. Nevertheless, textual prompting with light fine-tuning offers a practical performance-effort trade-off for geometrically regular and visually salient targets.

However, existing distillation methods typically transfer modality-specific features directly to each sensor, which can distort their unique characteristics and degrade their individual strengths. To address this, we introduce IMKD, a radar-camera fusion framework based on multi-level knowledge distillation that preserves each sensor's intrinsic characteristics while amplifying their complementary strengths. IMKD applies a three-stage, intensity-aware distillation strategy to enrich the fused representation across the architecture: (1) LiDAR-to-Radar intensity-aware feature distillation to enhance radar representations with fine-grained structural cues, (2) LiDAR-to-Fused feature intensity-guided distillation to selectively highlight useful geometry and depth information at the fusion level, fostering complementarity between the modalities rather than forcing them to align, and (3) Camera-Radar intensity-guided fusion mechanism that facilitates effective feature alignment and calibration. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that IMKD reaches 67.0% NDS and 61.0% mAP, outperforming all prior distillation-based radar-camera fusion methods.

A core challenge lies in the limited availability of multi-view data and the tendency of monocular training to yield incomplete 3D head reconstructions. We identify the root cause of this issue as the entanglement between driving signal and target viewpoint when learning from monocular videos. To address this, we propose a transformer-based 3D portrait animation model with learnable data source tokens, so-called bias sinks, which enables unified training across monocular and multi-view datasets. This design leverages the strengths of both data sources during inference: strong generalization from monocular data and full 3D completeness from multi-view supervision. Furthermore, our training procedure yields a smooth latent avatar space that facilitates identity interpolation and flexible fitting to an arbitrary number of input observations. In extensive evaluations on single-view, few-shot, and monocular avatar creation tasks, we verify the efficacy of FlexAvatar. Many existing methods struggle with view extrapolation while FlexAvatar generates complete 3D head avatars with realistic facial animations.

In contrast, professional design tools employ layered representations, allowing isolated edits while preserving consistency. Motivated by this, we propose \\textbf{Qwen-Image-Layered}, an end-to-end diffusion model that decomposes a single RGB image into multiple semantically disentangled RGBA layers, enabling \\textbf{inherent editability}, where each RGBA layer can be independently manipulated without affecting other content. To support variable-length decomposition, we introduce three key components: (1) an RGBA-VAE to unify the latent representations of RGB and RGBA images; (2) a VLD-MMDiT (Variable Layers Decomposition MMDiT) architecture capable of decomposing a variable number of image layers; and (3) a Multi-stage Training strategy to adapt a pretrained image generation model into a multilayer image decomposer. Furthermore, to address the scarcity of high-quality multilayer training images, we build a pipeline to extract and annotate multilayer images from Photoshop documents (PSD). Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses existing approaches in decomposition quality and establishes a new paradigm for consistent image editing.

In this paper, we introduce a robust method for pose estimation and calibration. We consider a set of rigid cameras, each observing the scene from a different perspective, which is a typical camera setup in animal behavior studies and forensic analysis of surveillance footage. Specifically, we analyse the individual components in a structure-from-motion (SfM) pipeline, and identify design choices that improve accuracy. Our main contributions are: (1) we investigate how to best subsample the predicted correspondences from a dense matcher to leverage them in the estimation process. (2) We investigate selection criteria for how to add the views incrementally. In a rigorous quantitative evaluation, we show the effectiveness of our changes, especially for cameras with strong radial distortion (79.9% ours vs. 40.4 vanilla VGGT). Finally, we demonstrate our correspondence subsampling in a global SfM setting where we initialize the poses using VGGT. The proposed pipeline generalizes across a wide range of camera setups, and could thus become a useful tool for animal behavior and forensic analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684SfM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u5b50\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u589e\u91cf\u6dfb\u52a0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5f84\u5411\u7578\u53d8\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u76f8\u673a\u5185\u53c2\u548c\u5916\u53c2\u4f30\u8ba1\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u4ece\u8fd0\u52a8\uff08SfM\uff09\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u7269\u884c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u76d1\u63a7\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u6cd5\u533b\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u4ece\u8fd0\u52a8\uff08SfM\uff09\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5404\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u6700\u4f73\u5730\u5b50\u91c7\u6837\u5bc6\u96c6\u5339\u914d\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u4ee5\u5728\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u5b83\u4eec\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u589e\u91cf\u6dfb\u52a0\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u70c8\u5f84\u5411\u7578\u53d8\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u4e0a\uff0879.9% vs. 40.4%\uff09\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u5728\u5168\u5c40SfM\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u6f14\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u5b50\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u70c8\u5f84\u5411\u7578\u53d8\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0879.9% vs. 40.4%\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u52a8\u7269\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u6cd5\u533b\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6709\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Space-based sensing will enable inspection of RSOs at shorter ranges, independent of atmospheric effects, and from all aspects. The use of a sub-THz inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging and sensing system for SDA has been proposed in previous work, demonstrating the achievement of sub-cm image resolution at ranges of up to 100 km. This work focuses on recognition of external structures by use of sequential feature detection and tracking throughout the aligned ISAR images of the satellites. The Hough transform is employed to detect linear features, which are tracked throughout the sequence. ISAR imagery is generated via a metaheuristic simulator capable of modelling encounters for a variety of deployment scenarios. Initial frame-to-frame alignment is achieved through a series of affine transformations to facilitate later association between image features. A gradient-by-ratio method is used for edge detection within individual ISAR images, and edge magnitude and direction are subsequently used to inform a double-weighted Hough transform to detect features with high accuracy. Feature evolution during sequences of frames is analysed. It is shown that the use of feature tracking within sequences with the proposed approach will increase confidence in feature detection and classification, and an example use-case of robust detection of shadowing as a feature is presented.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eISAR\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a7a\u95f4\u7269\u4f53\u5916\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4fe1\u5fc3\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9634\u5f71\u68c0\u6d4b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8fd1\u5730\u7a7a\u95f4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5c45\u6c11\u7a7a\u95f4\u7269\u4f53\uff08RSOs\uff09\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u611f\u77e5\uff08SDA\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Hough\u53d8\u6362\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u6bd4\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u8fb9\u7f18\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u52a0\u6743Hough\u53d8\u6362\u63d0\u9ad8\u7279\u5f81\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002ISAR\u56fe\u50cf\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u521d\u59cb\u5e27\u5bf9\u9f50\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u5c04\u53d8\u6362\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728ISAR\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4fe1\u5fc3\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9634\u5f71\u68c0\u6d4b\u7528\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u4fe1\u5fc3\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9634\u5f71\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u7528\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

We introduce a new concept of 4D Occupancy Spatio-Temporal Persistence (OccSTeP), which aims to address two tasks: (1) reactive forecasting: ''what will happen next'' and (2) proactive forecasting: \"what would happen given a specific future action\". For the first time, we create a new OccSTeP benchmark with challenging scenarios (e.g., erroneous semantic labels and dropped frames). To address this task, we propose OccSTeP-WM, a tokenizer-free world model that maintains a dense voxel-based scene state and incrementally fuses spatio-temporal context over time. OccSTeP-WM leverages a linear-complexity attention backbone and a recurrent state-space module to capture long-range spatial dependencies while continually updating the scene memory with ego-motion compensation. This design enables online inference and robust performance even when historical sensor input is missing or noisy. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of the OccSTeP concept and our OccSTeP-WM, yielding an average semantic mIoU of 23.70% (+6.56% gain) and occupancy IoU of 35.89% (+9.26% gain).

A common challenge in current methods, however, is the occurrence of Spatial Relationship Hallucinations between the foreground subject and the generated background, including inappropriate scale, positional relationships, and viewpoints. Critically, the subjective nature of spatial rationality makes it challenging to quantify, hindering the use of traditional reward-based RLHF methods. To address this issue, we propose InpaintDPO, the first Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) based framework dedicated to spatial rationality in foreground-conditioned inpainting, ensuring plausible spatial relationships between foreground and background elements. To resolve the gradient conflicts in standard DPO caused by identical foreground in win-lose pairs, we propose MaskDPO, which confines preference optimization exclusively to the background to enhance background spatial relationships, while retaining the inpainting loss in the foreground region for robust foreground preservation. To enhance coherence at the foreground-background boundary, we propose Conditional Asymmetric Preference Optimization, which samples pairs with differentiated cropping operations and applies global preference optimization to promote contextual awareness and enhance boundary coherence. Finally, based on the observation that winning samples share a commonality in plausible spatial relationships, we propose Shared Commonality Preference Optimization to enhance the model's understanding of spatial commonality across high-quality winning samples, further promoting shared spatial rationality.", "AI": {"tldr": "InpaintDPO\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eDPO\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u524d\u666f\u6761\u4ef6\u4fee\u590d\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u524d\u666f\u6761\u4ef6\u4fee\u590d\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u7a7a\u95f4\u5408\u7406\u6027\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u4f7f\u5176\u96be\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfRLHF\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86InpaintDPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ecMaskDPO\uff08\u9650\u5236\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u4e8e\u80cc\u666f\u533a\u57df\uff09\u3001Conditional Asymmetric Preference Optimization\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u88c1\u526a\u64cd\u4f5c\u589e\u5f3a\u8fb9\u754c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u548cShared Commonality Preference Optimization\uff08\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5171\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u89e3\uff09\u3002", "result": "InpaintDPO\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u524d\u666f\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "InpaintDPO\u901a\u8fc7MaskDPO\u3001Conditional Asymmetric Preference Optimization\u548cShared Commonality Preference Optimization\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u524d\u666f\u6761\u4ef6\u4fee\u590d\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u524d\u666f\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002"}}

However, we observe that when only a limited number of crops per image are used, soft labels are prone to local semantic drift: a crop may visually resemble another class, causing its soft embedding to deviate from the ground-truth semantics of the original image. This mismatch between local visual content and global semantic meaning introduces systematic errors and distribution misalignment between training and testing. In this work, we revisit the overlooked role of hard labels and show that, when appropriately integrated, they provide a powerful content-agnostic anchor to calibrate semantic drift. We theoretically characterize the emergence of drift under few soft-label supervision and demonstrate that hybridizing soft and hard labels restores alignment between visual content and semantic supervision. Building on this insight, we propose a new training paradigm, Hard Label for Alleviating Local Semantic Drift (HALD), which leverages hard labels as intermediate corrective signals while retaining the fine-grained advantages of soft labels. Extensive experiments on dataset distillation and large-scale conventional classification benchmarks validate our approach, showing consistent improvements in generalization. On ImageNet-1K, we achieve 42.7% with only 285M storage for soft labels, outperforming prior state-of-the-art LPLD by 9.0%.

In order to align compression models to human perception, prior work has employed differentiable perceptual losses consisting of neural networks calibrated on large-scale datasets of human psycho-visual judgments. We show that, surprisingly, state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) can replicate binary human two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) judgments zero-shot when asked to reason about the differences between pairs of images. Motivated to exploit the powerful zero-shot visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we propose Vision-Language Models for Image Compression (VLIC), a diffusion-based image compression system designed to be post-trained with binary VLM judgments. VLIC leverages existing techniques for diffusion model post-training with preferences, rather than distilling the VLM judgments into a separate perceptual loss network. We show that calibrating this system on VLM judgments produces competitive or state-of-the-art performance on human-aligned visual compression depending on the dataset, according to perceptual metrics and large-scale user studies.

Most state-of-the-art approaches rely on late fusion to combine visual and audio features, but late fusion often fails to capture fine-grained cross-modal interactions, which can be critical for robust performance in unconstrained scenarios. In this paper, we introduce GateFusion, a novel architecture that combines strong pretrained unimodal encoders with a Hierarchical Gated Fusion Decoder (HiGate). HiGate enables progressive, multi-depth fusion by adaptively injecting contextual features from one modality into the other at multiple layers of the Transformer backbone, guided by learnable, bimodally-conditioned gates. To further strengthen multimodal learning, we propose two auxiliary objectives: Masked Alignment Loss (MAL) to align unimodal outputs with multimodal predictions, and Over-Positive Penalty (OPP) to suppress spurious video-only activations. GateFusion establishes new state-of-the-art results on several challenging ASD benchmarks, achieving 77.8% mAP (+9.4%), 86.1% mAP (+2.9%), and 96.1% mAP (+0.5%) on Ego4D-ASD, UniTalk, and WASD benchmarks, respectively, and delivering competitive performance on AVA-ActiveSpeaker.

We propose a way to convert a Foundation Model into a Multi-View Foundation Model. Such a model takes as input a set of images and outputs a feature map for each image such that the features of corresponding points are as consistent as possible. This approach bypasses the need to build a consistent 3D model of the features and allows direct manipulation in the image space. Specifically, we show how to augment Transformers-based foundation models (i.e., DINO, SAM, CLIP) with intermediate 3D-aware attention layers that help match features across different views.

However, due to the capability limitations of the base diffusion language model, the performance of the diffusion vision language model (dVLM) still lags significantly behind that of mainstream models. This leads to a simple yet fundamental question: Is it possible to construct dVLMs based on existing powerful AR models? In response, we propose DiffusionVL, a dVLM family that could be translated from any powerful AR models. Through simple fine-tuning, we successfully adapt AR pre-trained models into the diffusion paradigm. This approach yields two key observations: (1) The paradigm shift from AR-based multimodal models to diffusion is remarkably effective. (2) Direct conversion of an AR language model to a dVLM is also feasible, achieving performance competitive with LLaVA-style visual-instruction-tuning. Further, we introduce a block-decoding design into dVLMs that supports arbitrary-length generation and KV cache reuse, achieving a significant inference speedup. We conduct a large number of experiments. Despite training with less than 5% of the data required by prior methods, DiffusionVL achieves a comprehensive performance improvement-a 34.4% gain on the MMMU-Pro (vision) bench and 37.5% gain on the MME (Cog.) bench-alongside a 2x inference speedup.

Pixels contain information at all levels, ranging from low-level attributes to high-level concepts. Autoencoders represent a classical and long-standing paradigm for learning representations from pixels or other raw inputs. In this work, we demonstrate that autoencoder-based self-supervised learning remains competitive today and can produce strong representations for downstream tasks, while remaining simple, stable, and efficient. Our model, codenamed \"Pixio\", is an enhanced masked autoencoder (MAE) with more challenging pre-training tasks and more capable architectures. The model is trained on 2B web-crawled images with a self-curation strategy with minimal human curation. Pixio performs competitively across a wide range of downstream tasks in the wild, including monocular depth estimation (e.g., Depth Anything), feed-forward 3D reconstruction (i.e., MapAnything), semantic segmentation, and robot learning, outperforming or matching DINOv3 trained at similar scales. Our results suggest that pixel-space self-supervised learning can serve as a promising alternative and a complement to latent-space approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "Pixio\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u578bMAE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08MAE\uff09\u6a21\u578b'Pixio'\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u572820\u4ebf\u5f20\u7f51\u7edc\u722c\u53d6\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u7b5b\u9009\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "Pixio\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u524d\u99883D\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0eDINOv3\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u524d\u9014\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u548c\u8865\u5145\u3002"}}
