In the event-level setting, we show the first polynomial lower bounds on the additive error for insertions-only graph problems such as maximum matching, degree histogram and $k$-core. This is an exponential improvement on the polylogarithmic lower bounds of Fichtenberger et al.[ESA 2021] for the former two problems, and are the first continual release lower bounds for the latter. Our results run counter to the intuition that the difference between insertions-only vs fully dynamic updates causes the gap between polylogarithmic and polynomial additive error. We show that for maximum matching and $k$-core, allowing small multiplicative approximations is what brings the additive error down to polylogarithmic.\n  Beyond graph problems, our techniques also show that polynomial additive error is unavoidable for Simultaneous Norm Estimation in the insertions-only setting. When multiplicative approximations are allowed, we circumvent this lower bound by giving the first continual mechanism with polylogarithmic additive error under $(1+\u03b6)$ multiplicative approximations, for $\u03b6>0$, for estimating all monotone symmetric norms simultaneously.\n  In the item-level setting, we show polynomial lower bounds on the product of the multiplicative and the additive error of continual mechanisms for a large range of graph problems. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first lower bounds for any differentially private continual release mechanism with multiplicative error. To obtain this, we prove a new lower bound on the product of multiplicative and additive error for 1-Way-Marginals, from which we reduce to continual graph problems.

Based on this thesis we published arXiv:2512.14409", "summary": "Democracy relies on making collective decisions through voting. In addition, voting procedures have further applications, for example in the training of artificial intelligence. An essential criterion for determining the winner of a fair election is that all alternatives are treated equally: this is called neutrality. The established Ranked Pairs voting method cannot simultaneously guarantee neutrality and be computationally tractable for election with ties. River, the recently introduced voting method, shares desirable properties with Ranked Pairs and has further advantages, such as a new property related to resistance against manipulation. Both Ranked Pairs and River use a weighted margin graph to model the election. Ties in the election can lead to edges of equal margin. To order the edges in such a case, a tiebreaking scheme must be employed. Many tiebreaks violate neutrality or other important properties. A tiebreaking scheme that preserves neutrality is Parallel Universe Tiebreaking (PUT). Ranked Pairs with PUT is NP-hard to compute.\n  The main result of this thesis shows that River with PUT can be computed in polynomial worst-case runtime: We can check whether an alternative is a River PUT winner, by running River with a specially constructed ordering of the edges. To construct this ordering, we introduce the semi-River diagram which contains the edges that can appear in any River diagram for some arbitrary tiebreak. On this diagram we can compute the River winners, by applying a variant of Prims algorithm per alternative. Additionally, we give an algorithm improve the previous naive runtime of River from $\\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(n^2 \\log n)$, where n is the number of alternatives.", "AI": {"tldr": "River\u6295\u7968\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408PUT\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Ranked Pairs\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e73\u5c40\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e2d\u7acb\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u534aRiver\u56fe\u5904\u7406\u8fb9\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528Prim\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d8\u4f53\u8ba1\u7b97River\u83b7\u80dc\u8005\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660eRiver\u4e0ePUT\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u81f3O(n\u00b2 log n)\u3002", "conclusion": "River\u4e0ePUT\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u534aRiver\u56fe\u548cPrim\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d8\u4f53\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

It is tailored for serverless scalable architectures and uses a log-based rollback recovery protocol. LOG.io supports a general programming model, accommodating non-deterministic operators, interactions with external systems, and arbitrary custom code. It is non-blocking, allowing failed operators to recover independently without interrupting other active operators, thereby leveraging data parallelization, and it facilitates dynamic scaling of operators during pipeline execution. Performance evaluations, conducted within the SAP Data Intelligence system, compare LOG.io with the Asynchronous Barrier Snapshotting (ABS) protocol, originally implemented in Flink. Our experiments show that when there are straggler operators in a data pipeline and the throughput of events is moderate (e.g., 1 event every 100 ms), LOG.io performs as well as ABS during normal processing and outperforms ABS during recovery. Otherwise, ABS performs better than LOG.io for both normal processing and recovery. However, we show that in these cases, data parallelization can largely reduce the overhead of LOG.io while ABS does not improve. Finally, we show that the overhead of data lineage capture, at the granularity of the event and between any two operators in a pipeline, is marginal, with less than 1.5% in all our experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "LOG.io\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u975e\u963b\u585e\u6062\u590d\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u8840\u7f18\u6355\u83b7\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8eABS\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u56de\u6eda\u6062\u590d\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u8840\u7f18\u6355\u83b7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "LOG.io\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u56de\u6eda\u6062\u590d\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u975e\u963b\u585e\u6062\u590d\u3001\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u5916\u90e8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u5141\u8bb8\u52a8\u6001\u6269\u5c55\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728SAP Data Intelligence\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0cLOG.io\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0eABS\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u8840\u7f18\u6355\u83b7\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "LOG.io\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u5b58\u5728\u6ede\u540e\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u4e2d\u7b49\u4e8b\u4ef6\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u65f6\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eABS\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6062\u590d\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cABS\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eLOG.io\u7684\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u8840\u7f18\u6355\u83b7\u7684\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u4f4e\uff08<1.5%\uff09\u3002"}}

Recent works build robot foundation models by extending multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with action outputs, creating vision-language-action (VLA) systems. These efforts are motivated by the intuition that MLLMs' large-scale language and image pretraining can be effectively transferred to the action output modality. In this work, we explore an alternative paradigm of using large-scale video pretraining as a primary modality for building robot foundation models. Unlike static images and language, videos capture spatio-temporal sequences of states and actions in the physical world that are naturally aligned with robotic behavior. We curate an internet-scale video dataset of human activities and task demonstrations, and train, for the first time at a foundation-model scale, an open video model for generative robotics planning. The model produces zero-shot video plans for novel scenes and tasks, which we post-process to extract executable robot actions. We evaluate task-level generalization through third-party selected tasks in the wild and real-robot experiments, demonstrating successful physical execution. Together, these results show robust instruction following, strong generalization, and real-world feasibility. We release both the model and dataset to support open, reproducible video-based robot learning.

However, the data providers of this knowledge face a skewed tradeoff between income and risk: they receive little share of downstream value yet retain copyright and privacy liability, making them reluctant to contribute their assets to LLM services. Existing techniques do not offer a trustworthy and controllable way to use professional knowledge, because they keep providers in the dark and combine knowledge parameters with the underlying LLM backbone.\n  In this paper, we present PKUS, the Professional Knowledge Utilization System, which treats professional knowledge as a first-class, separable artifact. PKUS keeps the backbone model on GPUs and encodes each provider's contribution as a compact adapter that executes only inside an attested Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). A hardware-rooted lifecycle protocol, adapter pruning, multi-provider aggregation, and split-execution scheduling together make this design practical at serving time. On SST-2, MNLI, and SQuAD with GPT-2 Large and Llama-3.2-1B, PKUS preserves model utility, matching the accuracy and F1 of full fine-tuning and plain LoRA, while achieving the lowest per-request latency with 8.1-11.9x speedup over CPU-only TEE inference and naive CPU-GPU co-execution.", "AI": {"tldr": "PKUS \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5229\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 TEE \u548c\u9002\u914d\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u53c2\u4e0e\u610f\u613f\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u9762\u4e34\u6536\u5165\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5931\u8861\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u4fe1\u4e14\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5229\u7528\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u4e86 PKUS \u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "PKUS \u5c06\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u6784\u4ef6\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u9002\u914d\u5668\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u5728 TEE \u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u786c\u4ef6\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u534f\u8bae\u3001\u9002\u914d\u5668\u526a\u679d\u3001\u591a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u805a\u5408\u548c\u5206\u7247\u6267\u884c\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u670d\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cPKUS \u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\uff08\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c F1 \u5206\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f4e\u7684\u6bcf\u8bf7\u6c42\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u6bd4\u7eaf CPU TEE \u63a8\u7406\u548c CPU-GPU \u534f\u540c\u6267\u884c\u5feb 8.1-11.9 \u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "PKUS \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u4fe1\u4e14\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5229\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5e76\u5728\u53ef\u4fe1\u6267\u884c\u73af\u5883\uff08TEE\uff09\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u65e2\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u53c8\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

The system composes optical layouts by arranging components from a three-tier toolbox via semantic retrieval, then validates designs through physics simulation with convergent refinement. The architecture combines intent routing, knowledge-augmented generation, and dual-mode validation (QuTiP and FreeSim). We evaluated 13 experiments spanning fundamental optics (Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, Michelson/Mach-Zehnder interferometry, Bell states, delayed-choice quantum eraser), quantum information protocols (BB84 QKD, Franson interferometry, GHZ states, quantum teleportation, hyperentanglement), and advanced technologies (boson sampling, electromagnetically induced transparency, frequency conversion). The system achieves design-simulation alignment scores of 8--9/10, with simulations faithfully modeling intended physics. A critical finding distinguishes structural correctness from quantitative accuracy: high alignment confirms correct physics architecture, while numerical predictions require expert review. Free-form simulation outperformed constrained frameworks for 11/13 experiments, revealing that quantum optics diversity demands flexible mathematical representations.

Given samples from a distribution $D$ and a confidence parameter $\u03b1$, the goal is to find the smallest volume ellipsoid $E$ which has probability mass $\\Pr_{D}[E] \\ge 1-\u03b1$. Ellipsoids are a highly expressive class of confidence sets as they can capture correlations in the distribution, and can approximate any convex set. This problem has been studied in many different communities. In statistics, this is the classic minimum volume estimator introduced by Rousseeuw as a robust non-parametric estimator of location and scatter. However in high dimensions, it becomes NP-hard to obtain any non-trivial approximation factor in volume when the condition number $\u03b2$ of the ellipsoid (ratio of the largest to the smallest axis length) goes to $\\infty$. This motivates the focus of our paper: can we efficiently find confidence ellipsoids with volume approximation guarantees when compared to ellipsoids of bounded condition number $\u03b2$?\n  Our main result is a polynomial time algorithm that finds an ellipsoid $E$ whose volume is within a $O(\u03b2^{\u03b3d})$ multiplicative factor of the volume of best $\u03b2$-conditioned ellipsoid while covering at least $1-O(\u03b1/\u03b3)$ probability mass for any $\u03b3< \u03b1$. We complement this with a computational hardness result that shows that such a dependence seems necessary up to constants in the exponent. The algorithm and analysis uses the rich primal-dual structure of the minimum volume enclosing ellipsoid and the geometric Brascamp-Lieb inequality. As a consequence, we obtain the first polynomial time algorithm with approximation guarantees on worst-case instances of the robust subspace recovery problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5bfb\u627e\u5177\u6709\u4f53\u79ef\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u692d\u5706\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u786c\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u692d\u5706\u4f53\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u692d\u7403\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\u03b2\u8d8b\u4e8e\u65e0\u7a77\u65f6\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u9ad8\u6548\u627e\u5230\u5177\u6709\u4f53\u79ef\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u692d\u5706\u4f53\u3002", "method": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5206\u6790\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u6700\u5c0f\u4f53\u79ef\u5305\u56f4\u692d\u5706\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u539f\u59cb\u5bf9\u5076\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u51e0\u4f55Brascamp-Lieb\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u7684\u692d\u5706\u4f53\u4f53\u79ef\u5728\u6700\u4f73\u03b2\u6761\u4ef6\u692d\u5706\u4f53\u7684O(\u03b2^{\u03b3d})\u500d\u5185\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8986\u76d6\u81f3\u5c111-O(\u03b1/\u03b3)\u7684\u6982\u7387\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u662f\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u627e\u5230\u5177\u6709\u4f53\u79ef\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u692d\u5706\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u786c\u5ea6\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u8f85\u76f8\u6210\u3002"}}

For network troubleshooting, progress is hindered by the absence of standardized and accessible benchmarks for evaluating LLM agents in dynamic network settings at low operational effort. We present NIKA, the largest public benchmark to date for LLM-driven network incident diagnosis and troubleshooting. NIKA targets both domain experts and especially AI researchers alike, providing zero-effort replay of real-world network scenarios, and establishing well-defined agent-network interfaces for quick agent prototyping. NIKA comprises hundreds of curated network incidents, spanning five network scenarios, from data centers to ISP networks, and covers 54 representative network issues. Lastly, NIKA is modular and extensible by design, offering APIs to facilitate the integration of new network scenarios and failure cases. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLM agents on NIKA and find that while larger models succeed more often in detecting network issues, they still struggle to localize faults and identify root causes.

However, when applied to line-based datasets, such as trajectories or time series, density plots alone are insufficient, as they disrupt path continuity, obscuring smooth trends and rare anomalies. We propose a bin-based illumination model that decouples structure from density to enhance flow and reveal sparse outliers while preserving the original colormap. We introduce a bin-based outlierness metric to rank trajectories. Guided by this ranking, we construct a structural normal map and apply locally-adaptive lighting in the luminance channel to highlight chosen patterns -- from dominant trends to atypical paths -- with acceptable color distortion. Our interactive method enables analysts to prioritize main trends, focus on outliers, or strike a balance between the two.

Although intra-server multipath data transfer between GPU and host memory is theoretically possible, heterogeneous protocols such as PCIe and NVLink currently limit the bandwidth between host memory and GPUs to that of a single PICe link. This limitation resuals in underutilized intra-server bandwidth. To address this issue, we propose Multipath Memory Access (MMA), a scheme that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to enalbe efficient multipath data transfer between GPU and host memory. MMA supports seamless deployment via dynamic library injection, enabling LLM applications to benefit from MMA without requiring any code modification. In our testbed, MMA significantly improves the data transfer bandwidth between the GPU and memory, achieving a peak bandwidth of 245 GB/s-representing a 4.62x speedup compared to the natice single-path bandwidth. End-to-end evaluations demonstrate that MMA reduces the time-to-first-token (TTFT) for LLM serving by 1.14x to 2.38x and decreases model-switching latency in vLLM's sleep mode by 1.12x to 2.48x.", "AI": {"tldr": "MMA\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u63d0\u5347GPU\u4e0e\u4e3b\u673a\u5185\u5b58\u5e26\u5bbd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u5316LLM\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "PCIe\u5e26\u5bbd\u9650\u5236\u6210\u4e3aLLM\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u534f\u8bae\u5bfc\u81f4\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5185\u5e26\u5bbd\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Multipath Memory Access (MMA)\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5e93\u6ce8\u5165\u65e0\u7f1d\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4ee3\u7801\u4fee\u6539\u3002", "result": "MMA\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86245 GB/s\u7684\u5cf0\u503c\u5e26\u5bbd\uff0c\u6bd4\u5355\u8def\u5f84\u5e26\u5bbd\u63d0\u5347\u4e864.62\u500d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86LLM\u670d\u52a1\u7684TTFT\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5207\u6362\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "MMA\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86GPU\u4e0e\u4e3b\u673a\u5185\u5b58\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e26\u5bbd\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u670d\u52a1\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Code and data are available at github.com/srl-ethz/sors", "summary": "The deployment of complex soft robots in multiphysics environments requires advanced simulation frameworks that not only capture interactions between different types of material, but also translate accurately to real-world performance. Soft robots pose unique modeling challenges due to their large nonlinear deformations, material incompressibility, and contact interactions, which complicate both numerical stability and physical accuracy. Despite recent progress, robotic simulators often struggle with modeling such phenomena in a scalable and application-relevant manner. We present SORS (Soft Over Rigid Simulator), a versatile, high-fidelity simulator designed to handle these complexities for soft robot applications. Our energy-based framework, built on the finite element method, allows modular extensions, enabling the inclusion of custom-designed material and actuation models. To ensure physically consistent contact handling, we integrate a constrained nonlinear optimization based on sequential quadratic programming, allowing for stable and accurate modeling of contact phenomena. We validate our simulator through a diverse set of real-world experiments, which include cantilever deflection, pressure-actuation of a soft robotic arm, and contact interactions from the PokeFlex dataset. In addition, we showcase the potential of our framework for control optimization of a soft robotic leg. These tests confirm that our simulator can capture both fundamental material behavior and complex actuation dynamics with high physical fidelity. By bridging the sim-to-real gap in these challenging domains, our approach provides a validated tool for prototyping next-generation soft robots, filling the gap of extensibility, fidelity, and usability in the soft robotic ecosystem.", "AI": {"tldr": "SORS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u80fd\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u63a5\u89e6\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u590d\u6742\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u591a\u7269\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u8981\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u6750\u6599\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5e76\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u5143\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u987a\u5e8f\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u771f\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u5982\u60ac\u81c2\u6881\u504f\u8f6c\u3001\u8f6f\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u7684\u538b\u529b\u9a71\u52a8\u7b49\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5728\u6750\u6599\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u590d\u6742\u9a71\u52a8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "SORS\uff08Soft Over Rigid Simulator\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u539f\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Earlier works like CodeAct, DynaSaur, Code Mode have tried to tackle the first two issues by using the whole Python language as its action space: The number of tools that the agent can call becomes infinite. Python code blocks can execute complex actions into a single step and print only relevant results which helps in keeping the context lean. However, the probabilistic instability issue still remains, as for the same task in the same environment, the agent can follow different trajectories due to the probabilistic nature of LLMs. Therefore, we need procedural memory for consistency and reliability.

This paper introduces the Principle of Proportional Duty (PPD), a novel framework that models how ethical responsibility scales with an agent's epistemic state. The framework reveals that moral duty is not lost to uncertainty but transforms: as uncertainty increases, Action Duty (the duty to act decisively) is proportionally converted into Repair Duty (the active duty to verify, inquire, and resolve uncertainty).\n  This dynamic is expressed by the equation D_total = K[(1-HI) + HI * g(C_signal)], where Total Duty is a function of Knowledge (K), Humility/Uncertainty (HI), and Contextual Signal Strength (C_signal). Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that systems maintaining a baseline humility coefficient (lambda > 0) produce more stable duty allocations and reduce the risk of overconfident decision-making.\n  By formalizing humility as a system parameter, the PPD offers a mathematically tractable approach to moral responsibility that could inform the development of auditable AI decision systems. This paper applies the framework across four domains, clinical ethics, recipient-rights law, economic governance, and artificial intelligence, to demonstrate its cross-disciplinary validity. The findings suggest that proportional duty serves as a stabilizing principle within complex systems, preventing both overreach and omission by dynamically balancing epistemic confidence against contextual risk.", "AI": {"tldr": "PPD\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u9053\u5fb7\u8d23\u4efb\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4f26\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u5efa\u6a21\u51b3\u7b56\uff0cPPD\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8d23\u4efb\u539f\u5219\uff08PPD\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u516c\u5f0f\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "PPD\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4f26\u7406\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6cbb\u7406\u548cAI\u9886\u57df\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "PPD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9053\u5fb7\u8d23\u4efb\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684AI\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

This limitation can be attributed to the fact that MLLMs learn visual understanding primarily from textual descriptions, which constitute a subjective and inherently incomplete supervisory signal. Furthermore, the modest scale of multimodal instruction tuning compared to massive text-only pre-training leads MLLMs to overfit language priors while overlooking visual details. To address these issues, we introduce JARVIS, a JEPA-inspired framework for self-supervised visual enhancement in MLLMs. Specifically, we integrate the I-JEPA learning paradigm into the standard vision-language alignment pipeline of MLLMs training. Our approach leverages frozen vision foundation models as context and target encoders, while training the predictor, implemented as the early layers of an LLM, to learn structural and semantic regularities from images without relying exclusively on language supervision. Extensive experiments on standard MLLM benchmarks show that JARVIS consistently improves performance on vision-centric benchmarks across different LLM families, without degrading multimodal reasoning abilities.

Conventional underwater acoustic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems primarily utilize spatial diversity but suffer from limited array resolution, causing angular ambiguity and insufficient spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). This paper addresses these limitations through acoustic Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (aRIS) to actively generate orthogonally distinguishable virtual paths, significantly enhancing spatial DoFs and channel capacity. An ocean-specific DoF-channel coupling model is established, explicitly deriving conditions for spatial rank enhancement. Subsequently, the optimal geometric locus, termed the Light-Point, is analytically identified, where deploying a single aRIS maximizes DoFs by introducing two and three additional resolvable paths in deep-sea and shallow-sea environments, respectively. Furthermore, an active simultaneous transmitting and reflecting (ASTAR) aRIS architecture with independent beam control and adaptive beam-tracking mechanism integrating unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and acoustic intensity gradient sensing is proposed.

Our approach utilizes Gaussian Splatting, since it is more explicit and thus more amenable to constraints than NeRFs. We leverage segmentation annotations to align the semantic regions of the face, facilitating the reconstruction of a neutral pose from only 11 images (as opposed to requiring a long video). We soft constrain the Gaussians to an underlying triangulated surface in order to provide a more structured Gaussian Splat reconstruction, which in turn informs subsequent perturbations to increase the accuracy of the underlying triangulated surface. The resulting triangulated surface can then be used in a standard graphics pipeline. In addition, and perhaps most impactful, we show how accurate geometry enables the Gaussian Splats to be transformed into texture space where they can be treated as a view-dependent neural texture. This allows one to use high visual fidelity Gaussian Splatting on any asset in a scene without the need to modify any other asset or any other aspect (geometry, lighting, renderer, etc.) of the graphics pipeline.

Motivated by the demand for real-time situational awareness and intelligent operational maintenance, digital twin (DT) technology was initially regarded as a promising solution, owing to its capability to create virtual replicas and emulate physical system behaviors. However, in the context of SAGSIN, the high-fidelity, full-scale modeling paradigm inherent to conventional DTs encounters fundamental limitations, including prohibitive computational overhead, delayed model synchronization, and cross-system semantic gaps. To address these limitations, this survey paper proposes a novel twinning framework: goal-oriented semantic twin (GOST). Unlike DTs that pursue physical mirroring, GOST prioritizes ``utility'' over ``fidelity,'' leveraging semantic technologies and goal-oriented principles to construct lightweight, task-specific representations. This paper systematically articulates the GOST framework through three layers: knowledge-based semantics, data-driven semantics, and goal-oriented principles. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive tutorial on constructing GOST by detailing its core enabling technologies and introduce a multidimensional evaluation framework for GOST. We present a case study targeting collaborative tracking tasks in remote satellite-UAV networks, demonstrating that GOST significantly outperforms conventional DTs in timeliness of perceptual data and collaborative tracking.

The environment of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) presents unique challenges when planning inspection operations that maximise visibility, information, and data quality. Specular reflection of sunlight from spacecraft bodies, self-shadowing, and dynamic lighting in LEO significantly impact the quality of data captured throughout an orbit. This is exacerbated by the relative motion between spacecraft, which introduces variable imaging distances and attitudes during inspection. Planning inspection trajectories with the aide of simulation is a common approach. However, the ability to design and optimise an inspection trajectory specifically to improve the resulting image quality in proximity operations remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present $\\partial$LITE, an end-to-end differentiable simulation pipeline for on-orbit inspection operations. We leverage state-of-the-art differentiable rendering tools and a custom orbit propagator to enable end-to-end optimisation of orbital parameters based on visual sensor data. $\\partial$LITE enables us to automatically design non-obvious trajectories, vastly improving the quality and usefulness of attained data. To our knowledge, our differentiable inspection-planning pipeline is the first of its kind and provides new insights into modern computational approaches to spacecraft mission planning.

Unlike unconstrained text-to-3D approaches, our method operates within a discrete parts vocabulary, enforcing geometric validity, connection constraints, and buildability ordering. Using LDraw as a text-rich intermediate representation, we demonstrate that large language models can be guided with tools to produce valid step-by-step construction sequences and assembly instructions for brick-based prototypes of more than 3000 assembly parts. We introduce a Python library for programmatic model generation and evaluate buildable outputs on complex satellites, aircraft, and architectural domains. The approach aims for demonstrable scalability, modularity, and fidelity that bridges the gap between semantic design intent and manufacturable output. Physical prototyping follows from natural language specifications.

However, current evaluation benchmarks remain predominantly language-centric or heavily reliant on simulated environments, rarely probing the nuanced, knowledge-intensive reasoning essential for practical, real-world scenarios. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the task of Sparsely Grounded Visual Navigation, explicitly designed to evaluate the sequential decision-making abilities of MLLMs in challenging, knowledge-intensive real-world environments. We operationalize this task with CityNav, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing four diverse global cities, specifically constructed to assess raw MLLM-driven agents in city navigation. Agents are required to rely solely on visual inputs and internal multimodal reasoning to sequentially navigate 50+ decision points without additional environmental annotations or specialized architectural modifications. Crucially, agents must autonomously achieve localization through interpreting city-specific cues and recognizing landmarks, perform spatial reasoning, and strategically plan and execute routes to their destinations. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that current state-of-the-art MLLMs and standard reasoning techniques (e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Reflection) significantly underperform in this challenging setting. To address this, we propose Verbalization of Path (VoP), which explicitly grounds the agent's internal reasoning by probing an explicit cognitive map (key landmarks and directions toward the destination) from the MLLMs, substantially enhancing navigation success.

Conventional countermeasures such as fixed power control or static channel hopping are largely ineffective against such adaptive adversaries. This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on the QMIX algorithm to improve the resilience of swarm communications under reactive jamming. We consider a network of multiple transmitter-receiver pairs sharing channels while a reactive jammer with Markovian threshold dynamics senses aggregate power and reacts accordingly. Each agent jointly selects transmit frequency (channel) and power, and QMIX learns a centralized but factorizable action-value function that enables coordinated yet decentralized execution. We benchmark QMIX against a genie-aided optimal policy in a no-channel-reuse setting, and against local Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and a stateless reactive policy in a more general fading regime with channel reuse enabled. Simulation results show that QMIX rapidly converges to cooperative policies that nearly match the genie-aided bound, while achieving higher throughput and lower jamming incidence than the baselines, thereby demonstrating MARL's effectiveness for securing autonomous swarms in contested environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "QMIX\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7MARL\u63d0\u5347\u7fa4\u4f53\u901a\u4fe1\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u5e72\u6270\u5668\u5bf9\u7fa4\u4f53\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u4fe1\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u56fa\u5b9a\u529f\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u6216\u9759\u6001\u4fe1\u9053\u8df3\u53d8\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u6297\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eQMIX\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u9009\u62e9\u4f20\u8f93\u9891\u7387\u548c\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u4f46\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u534f\u8c03\u4e14\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cQMIX\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u66f4\u9ad8\u4e14\u5e72\u6270\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "QMIX\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7fa4\u4f53\u901a\u4fe1\u5728\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u7684\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

MAGINet employs hierarchical residual encoding, spatial-and-channel attention in a bottleneck, and adaptive multi-scale feature fusion in the decoder, yielding sharper albedo boundaries and stronger lighting invariance than prior U-Net variants. The initial albedo prediction is upsampled to $1024\\times1024$ and refined by a lightweight three-layer CNN (RefinementNet).

Together with the refined albedo, these six passes form the complete intrinsic decomposition. Trained with a combination of masked-MSE, VGG, edge, and patch-LPIPS losses on the FFHQ-UV-Intrinsics dataset, the full pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance for diffuse albedo estimation and demonstrates significantly improved fidelity for the complete rendering stack compared to prior methods.

Building on these insights, we introduce SCABENCH, a reproducible benchmark, and INITSCOPE, a lightweight analysis framework linking what code is loaded with what is executed.

While the traditional approach to capturing these evaluations is to conduct a user study, recent work has proposed utilizing machine learning instead. However, existing data-driven methods require large amounts of labeled data, which limits their use in practice. To address this gap, we propose leveraging the few-shot learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve how well a robot can predict a user's perception of its performance, and study this idea experimentally in social navigation tasks. To this end, we extend the SEAN TOGETHER dataset with additional real-world human-robot navigation episodes and participant feedback. Using this augmented dataset, we evaluate the ability of several LLMs to predict human perceptions of robot performance from a small number of in-context examples, based on observed spatio-temporal cues of the robot and surrounding human motion. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can match or exceed the performance of traditional supervised learning models while requiring an order of magnitude fewer labeled instances. We further show that prediction performance can improve with more in-context examples, confirming the scalability of our approach. Additionally, we investigate what kind of sensor-based information an LLM relies on to make these inferences by conducting an ablation study on the input features considered for performance prediction. Finally, we explore the novel application of personalized examples for in-context learning, i.e., drawn from the same user being evaluated, finding that they further enhance prediction accuracy.

While architectural abstractions offer a means to manage these systems, maintaining their consistency with the actual code has been problematic. The Java Platform Module System (JPMS), introduced in Java 9, addresses this limitation by enabling explicit module specification at the language level. JPMS enhances architectural implementation through improved encapsulation and direct specification of ground-truth architectures within Java projects. Although many projects are written in Java, modularizing existing monolithic projects to JPMS modules is an open challenge due to ineffective module recovery by existing architecture recovery techniques. To address this challenge, this paper presents ClassLAR (Class-and Language model-based Architectural Recovery), a novel, lightweight, and efficient approach that recovers Java modules from monolithic Java systems using fully-qualified class names. ClassLAR leverages language models to extract semantic information from package and class names, capturing both structural and functional intent.

Corso", "Eric Sax"], "title": "R4: Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning for Vision-Language Models in 4D Spatio-Temporal Space", "comment": null, "summary": "Humans perceive and reason about their surroundings in four dimensions by building persistent, structured internal representations that encode semantic meaning, spatial layout, and temporal dynamics. These multimodal memories enable them to recall past events, infer unobserved states, and integrate new information into context-dependent reasoning. Inspired by this capability, we introduce R4, a training-free framework for retrieval-augmented reasoning in 4D spatio-temporal space that equips vision-language models (VLMs) with structured, lifelong memory. R4 continuously constructs a 4D knowledge database by anchoring object-level semantic descriptions in metric space and time, yielding a persistent world model that can be shared across agents. At inference, natural language queries are decomposed into semantic, spatial, and temporal keys to retrieve relevant observations, which are integrated into the VLM's reasoning. Unlike classical retrieval-augmented generation methods, retrieval in R4 operates directly in 4D space, enabling episodic and collaborative reasoning without training. Experiments on embodied question answering and navigation benchmarks demonstrate that R4 substantially improves retrieval and reasoning over spatio-temporal information compared to baselines, advancing a new paradigm for embodied 4D reasoning in dynamic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "R4\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa4D\u65f6\u7a7a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d4b\u4e88\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u7ec8\u8eab\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "R4\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u951a\u5b9a\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u63cf\u8ff0\u5728\u5ea6\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u6784\u5efa4D\u77e5\u8bc6\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u952e\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u8eab\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u5bfc\u822a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cR4\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "R4\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa4D\u65f6\u7a7a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8303\u4f8b\u3002"}}

While recent diffusion-based approaches show promise for G-buffer-conditioned image synthesis, they face critical limitations: single-image models like RGBX generate frames independently without temporal consistency, while video models like DiffusionRenderer are too computationally expensive for most consumer gaming sets ups and require complete sequences upfront, making them unsuitable for interactive applications where future frames depend on user input. We introduce FrameDiffuser, an autoregressive neural rendering framework that generates temporally consistent, photorealistic frames by conditioning on G-buffer data and the models own previous output. After an initial frame, FrameDiffuser operates purely on incoming G-buffer data, comprising geometry, materials, and surface properties, while using its previously generated frame for temporal guidance, maintaining stable, temporal consistent generation over hundreds to thousands of frames. Our dual-conditioning architecture combines ControlNet for structural guidance with ControlLoRA for temporal coherence. A three-stage training strategy enables stable autoregressive generation.

Among sharing techniques, NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) offers strong resource isolation by enabling hardware-level GPU partitioning. However, leveraging MIG effectively introduces new challenges. First, resource contention persists due to shared components such as PCIe bandwidth. Second, GPU fragmentation becomes a critical issue, which is different from prior fine-grained GPU sharing work due to MIG's limited number of valid MIG configurations. Fragmentation arises not only from spatial discontinuity but also from rigid profile placement constraints, especially after job arrivals and terminations. To address these issues, we propose an online scheduling framework that integrates conditional load balancing, dynamic partitioning, and job migration. Our approach dynamically adapts job placement to minimize contention and reorganizes GPU allocations to combat both internal and external fragmentation. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves system efficiency.

Building accurate performance models to navigate this vast space requires effective sampling strategies, yet existing methods often struggle with multi-objective optimization and cannot leverage semantic information from documentation. The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) motivates the central question of this work: Can LLMs serve as effective samplers for multi-objective performance modeling? To explore this, we present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the capabilities and characteristics of LLM-driven sampling. We design and implement LLM4Perf, a feedback-based framework, and use it to systematically evaluate the LLM-guided sampling process across four highly configurable, real-world systems. Our study reveals that the LLM-guided approach outperforms traditional baselines in most cases. Quantitatively, LLM4Perf achieves the best performance in nearly 68.8% (77 out of 112) of all evaluation scenarios, demonstrating its superior effectiveness. We find this effectiveness stems from the LLM's dual capabilities of configuration space pruning and feedback-driven strategy refinement.

The approach mirrors the way in which epidemiologists enable public health interventions through statistical evidence before molecular mechanisms are understood. This bypasses the problem of model complexity which plagues current interpretability methods (such as SHAP and mechanistic interpretability) at the scale of deployed models.\n  AI Epidemiology achieves this population-level surveillance by standardising capture of AI-expert interactions into structured assessment fields: risk level, alignment score, and accuracy score. These function as exposure variables which predict output failure through statistical associations, much like cholesterol and blood pressure act as exposure variables predicting cardiac events. Output-failure associations are subsequently validated against expert overrides and real-world outcomes.\n  The framework places zero burden on experts and provides automatic audit trails by passively tracking expert convergence and divergence with AI recommendations. Since it analyses outputs rather than internal model computations, it also provides governance continuity when institutions update models and switch vendors. Finally, by providing reliability scores and semantic assessments (e.g. 'this recommendation resembles 500 cases overridden by experts due to guideline violations'), it enables experts and institutions to detect unreliable AI outputs before they cause harm.

Splatting-based methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) provide faster rendering by rasterizing 3D primitives. RadiantFoam (RF) brought ray tracing back, achieving throughput comparable to Gaussian Splatting by organizing radiance with an explicit Voronoi Diagram (VD). Yet, all the mentioned methods still struggle with precise mesh reconstruction. We address this gap by jointly learning an explicit VD with an implicit Signed Distance Field (SDF). The scene is optimized via ray tracing and regularized by an Eikonal objective. The SDF introduces metric-consistent isosurfaces, which, in turn, bias near-surface Voronoi cell faces to align with the zero level set. The resulting model produces crisper, view-consistent surfaces with fewer floaters and improved topology, while preserving photometric quality and maintaining training speed on par with RadiantFoam.

Unlike traditional deployments where schedulers can treat instances as black boxes, DP+EP architectures exhibit high internal synchronization costs. We identify that immediate request dispatching in such systems leads to severe in-engine queuing and parallelization bubbles, degrading Time-to-First-Token (TTFT). To address this, we propose Staggered Batch Scheduling (SBS), a mechanism that deliberately buffers requests to form optimal execution batches. This temporal decoupling eliminates internal queuing bubbles without compromising throughput. Furthermore, leveraging the scheduling window created by buffering, we introduce a Load-Aware Global Allocation strategy that balances computational load across DP units for both Prefill and Decode phases.

We propose SWIFT-Nav: Stability-aware Waypoint-level Integration of Fuzzy arbitration and TD3 for Navigation, a TD3-based navigation framework that achieves fast, stable convergence to obstacle-aware paths. The system couples a sensor-driven perception front end with a TD3 waypoint policy: the perception module converts LiDAR ranges into a confidence-weighted safety map and goal cues, while the TD3 policy is trained with Prioritised Experience Replay to focus on high-error transitions and a decaying epsilon-greedy exploration schedule that gradually shifts from exploration to exploitation. A lightweight fuzzy-logic layer computes a safety score from radial measurements and near obstacles, gates mode switching and clamps unsafe actions; in parallel, task-aligned reward shaping combining goal progress, clearance, and switch-economy terms provides dense, well-scaled feedback that accelerates learning. Implemented in Webots with proximity-based collision checking, our approach consistently outperforms baselines in trajectory smoothness and generalization to unseen layouts, while preserving real-time responsiveness.

This paper presents a structured synthesis of forty two peer reviewed studies published between 2015 and 2025, identifying nine recurring Kafka design patterns including log compaction, CQRS bus, exactly once pipelines, change data capture, stream table joins, saga orchestration, tiered storage, multi tenant topics, and event sourcing replay. The analysis examines co usage trends, domain specific deployments, and empirical benchmarking practices using standard suites such as TPCx Kafka and the Yahoo Streaming Benchmark, as well as custom workloads. The study highlights significant inconsistencies in configuration disclosure, evaluation rigor, and reproducibility that limit cross study comparison and practical replication.

However, current model-centric agent architectures struggle to self-evolve post-deployment: improving personalization, capability, and efficiency typically requires continuous model retraining/fine-tuning, which incurs prohibitive computational overheads and suffers from an inherent trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency.\n  To enable iterative self-evolution without model retraining, we propose MOBIMEM, a memory-centric agent system. MOBIMEM first introduces three specialized memory primitives to decouple agent evolution from model weights: (1) Profile Memory uses a lightweight distance-graph (DisGraph) structure to align with user preferences, resolving the accuracy-latency trade-off in user profile retrieval; (2) Experience Memory employs multi-level templates to instantiate execution logic for new tasks, ensuring capability generalization; and (3) Action Memory records fine-grained interaction sequences, reducing the reliance on expensive model inference. Building upon this memory architecture, MOBIMEM further integrates a suite of OS-inspired services to orchestrate execution: a scheduler that coordinates parallel sub-task execution and memory operations; an agent record-and-replay (AgentRR) mechanism that enables safe and efficient action reuse; and a context-aware exception handling that ensures graceful recovery from user interruptions and runtime errors.\n  Evaluation on AndroidWorld and top-50 apps shows that MOBIMEM achieves 83.1% profile alignment with 23.83 ms retrieval time (280x faster than GraphRAG baselines), improves task success rates by up to 50.3%, and reduces end-to-end latency by up to 9x on mobile devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "MOBIMEM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5185\u5b58\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u7528\u5185\u5b58\u548cOS\u670d\u52a1\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4ee5\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u96be\u4ee5\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3/\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "MOBIMEM\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u79cd\u4e13\u7528\u5185\u5b58\u539f\u8bed\uff08Profile Memory\u3001Experience Memory\u3001Action Memory\uff09\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u670d\u52a1\uff08\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u3001AgentRR\u673a\u5236\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u5f02\u5e38\u5904\u7406\uff09\u6765\u89e3\u8026\u4ee3\u7406\u8fdb\u5316\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728AndroidWorld\u548ctop-50\u5e94\u7528\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cMOBIMEM\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8683.1%\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u5bf9\u9f50\u300123.83\u6beb\u79d2\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u65f6\u95f4\uff08\u6bd4GraphRAG\u57fa\u7ebf\u5feb280\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe50.3%\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe9\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "MOBIMEM\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u5b58\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

To this end, we present CAMP-VLM (Context-Aware Multi-human behavior Prediction): a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based framework that incorporates contextual features from visual input and spatial awareness from scene graphs to enhance prediction of humans-scene interactions. Due to the lack of suitable datasets for multi-human behavior prediction from an observer view, we perform fine-tuning of CAMP-VLM with synthetic human behavior data generated by a photorealistic simulator, and evaluate the resulting models on both synthetic and real-world sequences to assess their generalization capabilities. Leveraging Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), CAMP-VLM outperforms the best-performing baseline by up to 66.9% in prediction accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "CAMP-VLM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5355\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u89c6\u89d2\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u540c\u6837\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CAMP-VLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08DPO\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "CAMP-VLM\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u51fa66.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "CAMP-VLM\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

To ensure atomic and consistent data access on DM, distributed transaction systems have been adapted, where compute nodes (CNs) rely on one-sided RDMA operations to access remote data in memory nodes (MNs). However, we observe that in existing transaction systems, the RDMA network interface cards at MNs become a primary performance bottleneck. This bottleneck arises from the high volume of one-sided atomic operations used for locks, which hinders the system's ability to scale efficiently.\n  To address this issue, this paper presents Lotus, a scalable distributed transaction system with lock disaggregation on DM. The key innovation of Lotus is to disaggregate locks from data and execute all locks on CNs, thus eliminating the bottleneck at MN RNICs. To achieve efficient lock management on CNs, Lotus employs an application-aware lock management mechanism that leverages the locality of the OLTP workloads to shard locks while maintaining load balance. To ensure consistent transaction processing with lock disaggregation, Lotus introduces a lock-first transaction protocol, which separates the locking phase as the first step in each read-write transaction execution. This protocol allows the system to determine the success of lock acquisitions early and proactively abort conflicting transactions, improving overall efficiency. To tolerate lock loss during CN failures, Lotus employs a lock-rebuild-free recovery mechanism that treats locks as ephemeral and avoids their reconstruction, ensuring lightweight recovery for CN failures. Experimental results demonstrate that Lotus improves transaction throughput by up to 2.1$\\times$ and reduces latency by up to 49.4% compared to state-of-the-art transaction systems on DM.", "AI": {"tldr": "Lotus\u901a\u8fc7\u9501\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u9501\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86DM\u4e2dRDMA\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4e8b\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0cRDMA\u7f51\u7edc\u63a5\u53e3\u5361\u56e0\u9ad8\u9891\u7387\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u9501\u64cd\u4f5c\u6210\u4e3a\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "Lotus\u91c7\u7528\u9501\u89e3\u8026\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06\u9501\u7ba1\u7406\u4ece\u5185\u5b58\u8282\u70b9\u79fb\u81f3\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5e94\u7528\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9501\u7ba1\u7406\u673a\u5236\u548c\u9501\u4f18\u5148\u4e8b\u52a1\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cLotus\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e8b\u52a1\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe2.1\u500d\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e49.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "Lotus\u901a\u8fc7\u9501\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u9501\u7ba1\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4e8b\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

However, their deployment requires generating feasible motions while jointly optimizing morphology and mounted pose under kinematic, dynamic, and physical constraints. Moreover, traditional single-branch designs often extend reach by increasing link length, which can easily violate torque limits at the base joint. To address these challenges, we propose a unified task-driven computational framework that integrates trajectory planning across varying morphologies with the co-optimization of morphology and mounted pose. Within this framework, a hierarchical model predictive control (HMPC) strategy is developed to enable motion planning for both redundant and non-redundant manipulators. For design optimization, the CMA-ES is employed to efficiently explore a hybrid search space consisting of discrete morphology configurations and continuous mounted poses. Meanwhile, a virtual module abstraction is introduced to enable bi-branch morphologies, allowing an auxiliary branch to offload torque from the primary branch and extend the achievable workspace without increasing the capacity of individual joint modules. Extensive simulations and hardware experiments on polishing, drilling, and pick-and-place tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results show that: 1) the framework can generate multiple feasible designs that satisfy kinematic and dynamic constraints while avoiding environmental collisions for given tasks; 2) flexible design objectives, such as maximizing manipulability, minimizing joint effort, or reducing the number of modules, can be achieved by customizing the cost functions; and 3) a bi-branch morphology capable of operating in a large workspace can be realized without requiring more powerful basic modules.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7HMPC\u548cCMA-ES\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u867d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u5b89\u88c5\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u5206\u652f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\u6613\u8fdd\u53cd\u626d\u77e9\u9650\u5236\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08HMPC\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528CMA-ES\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u79bb\u6563\u5f62\u6001\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u5b89\u88c5\u59ff\u6001\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u865a\u62df\u6a21\u5757\u62bd\u8c61\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u5f62\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u5982\u6700\u5927\u5316\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3001\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5173\u8282\u8d1f\u8377\u6216\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u5757\u6570\u91cf\u7b49\u7075\u6d3b\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u5f62\u6001\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u5757\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6269\u5c55\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u9a71\u52a8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u591a\u79cd\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

While attractive for scalability, LaaJs tend to overlook domain specific issues raising concerns about their reliability in critical evaluation tasks. To better understand these limitations in practice, we examine LaaJ behavior in a concrete industrial use case: legacy code modernization via COBOL code generation. In this setting, we find that even production deployed LaaJs can miss domain critical errors, revealing consistent blind spots in their evaluation capabilities.\n  To better understand these blind spots, we analyze generated COBOL programs and associated LaaJs judgments, drawing on expert knowledge to construct a preliminary taxonomy. Based on this taxonomy, we develop a lightweight analytic checker tool that flags over 30 domain specific issues observed in practice.

Effective CE triage requires adaptive decisions that balance retained value against the costs and constraints of processing and labour. This paper presents a novel decision-making framework as a simple deterministic solver over a state-augmented Disassembly Sequencing Planning (DSP) graph. By encoding the disassembly history into the state, our framework enforces the Markov property, enabling optimal, recursive evaluation by ensuring each decision only depends on the previous state. The triage decision involves choices between continuing disassembly or committing to a CE option. The model integrates condition-aware utility based on diagnostic health scores and complex operational constraints. We demonstrate the framework's flexibility with a worked example: the hierarchical triage of electric vehicle (EV) batteries, where decisions are driven by the recursive valuation of components. The example illustrates how a unified formalism enables the accommodation of varying mechanical complexity, safety requirements, and economic drivers. This unified formalism therefore provides a tractable and generalisable foundation for optimising CE triage decisions across diverse products and operational contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u589e\u5f3aDSP\u56fe\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u5faa\u73af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5206\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u7535\u6c60\u793a\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5faa\u73af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5206\u7c7b\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u4ea7\u54c1\u8fdb\u884c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u4fdd\u7559\u4ef7\u503c\u4e0e\u5904\u7406\u548c\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u6210\u672c\u53ca\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u4ea7\u54c1\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u589e\u5f3a\u7684DSP\u56fe\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u62c6\u5378\u5386\u53f2\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u9012\u5f52\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u7535\u6c60\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u5206\u7c7b\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u8981\u6c42\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u72b6\u6001\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u62c6\u5378\u5e8f\u5217\u89c4\u5212\uff08DSP\uff09\u56fe\uff0c\u4e3a\u5faa\u73af\u7ecf\u6d4e\uff08CE\uff09\u5206\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address these issues, we propose FlexKV, a memory-disaggregated KV store with index proxying. Our key idea is to dynamically offload the index to compute nodes, leveraging their powerful CPUs to accelerate index processing and maintain high-performance compute-side caches. Three challenges have to be addressed to enable efficient index proxying on DM, i.e., the load imbalance across compute nodes, the limited memory of compute nodes, and the expensive cache coherence overhead.

To ensure its reliability, it is crucial to accurately replicate interactions between AVs and background traffic, which necessitates effective calibration. However, existing calibration methods often fall short in achieving this goal. To address this gap, this study introduces a simulation platform calibration method that ensures high accuracy at both the vehicle and traffic flow levels. The method offers several key features:(1) with the capability of calibration for vehicle-to-vehicle interaction; (2) with accuracy assurance; (3) with enhanced efficiency; (4) with pipeline calibration capability. The proposed method is benchmarked against a baseline with no calibration and a state-of-the-art calibration method.

Revisiting Automated Compiler Fault Isolation", "comment": "Accepted at ICSE'26", "summary": "Background: Compilers are fundamental to software development, translating high-level source code into executable software systems. Faults in compilers can have severe consequences and thus effective localization and resolution of compiler bugs are crucial. Problem: In practice, developers often examine version history to identify and investigate bug-inducing commit (BIC) for fixing bugs. However, while numerous sophisticated Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) techniques have been proposed for compiler fault isolation, their effectiveness has not been evaluated against the BIC-based strategies widely adopted in practice. Objective: This study aims to bridge this gap by directly comparing a BIC-based strategy, Basic, with representative SBFL techniques in the context of compiler fault localization. The BIC-based strategy closely aligns with common developer practices, as it directly identifies the BIC and treats the files modified in that commit as faulty candidates. Method: The Basic identifies the most recent good release and earliest bad release, and then employs a binary search to pinpoint the bug-inducing commit. All files modified in the identified commit are flagged as potentially faulty. We rigorously compare Basic against SBFL-based techniques using a benchmark consisting of 60 GCC bugs and 60 LLVM bugs. Result: Our analysis reveals that Basic performs comparably to, and in many cases outperforms, state-of-the-art SBFL-based techniques, particularly on the critical Top-1 and Top-5 ranking metrics. Conclusion: This study provides new insights into the practical effectiveness of SBFL-based techniques in real-world compiler debugging scenarios. We recommend that future research adopt Basic as a baseline when developing and evaluating new compiler fault isolation methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eBIC\u7684Basic\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eSBFL\u7684\u6280\u672f\u5728\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u9519\u8bef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Basic\u5728\u591a\u9879\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u9519\u8bef\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u4e25\u91cd\u540e\u679c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6709\u6548\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u9519\u8bef\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5df2\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u57fa\u4e8eSBFL\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6280\u672f\u7528\u4e8e\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u6545\u969c\u9694\u79bb\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6548\u679c\u5c1a\u672a\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eBIC\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "Basic\u7b56\u7565\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u6b63\u5e38\u53d1\u5e03\u548c\u6700\u65e9\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u53d1\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u5206\u67e5\u627e\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5f15\u5165\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u63d0\u4ea4\u3002\u6240\u6709\u5728\u8be5\u63d0\u4ea4\u4e2d\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u88ab\u6807\u8bb0\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u6587\u4ef6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u542b60\u4e2aGCC\u9519\u8bef\u548c60\u4e2aLLVM\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u5bf9Basic\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eSBFL\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0cBasic\u5728\u5173\u952eTop-1\u548cTop-5\u6392\u540d\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eSBFL\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u8c03\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8eSBFL\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6709\u6548\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u8bae\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b0\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u6545\u969c\u9694\u79bb\u65b9\u6cd5\u65f6\u91c7\u7528Basic\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

We benchmark a diverse set of open-source and closed-source VLMs on 27 agricultural classification datasets from the AgML collection, spanning 162 classes across plant disease, pest and damage, and plant and weed species identification. Across all tasks, zero-shot VLMs substantially underperform a supervised task-specific baseline (YOLO11), which consistently achieves markedly higher accuracy than any foundation model. Under multiple-choice prompting, the best-performing VLM (Gemini-3 Pro) reaches approximately 62% average accuracy, while open-ended prompting yields much lower performance, with raw accuracies typically below 25%. Applying LLM-based semantic judging increases open-ended accuracy (for example, from 21% to 30% for top models) and alters model rankings, demonstrating that evaluation methodology meaningfully affects reported conclusions. Among open-source models, Qwen-VL-72B performs best, approaching closed-source performance under constrained prompting but still trailing top proprietary systems. Task-level analysis shows that plant and weed species classification is consistently easier than pest and damage identification, which remains the most challenging category across models.

However, current OSIL methods are primarily limited to short-horizon tasks, thus limiting their applicability to complex, long-horizon manipulations. To address this limitation, we propose ManiLong-Shot, a novel framework that enables effective OSIL for long-horizon prehensile manipulation tasks. ManiLong-Shot structures long-horizon tasks around physical interaction events, reframing the problem as sequencing interaction-aware primitives instead of directly imitating continuous trajectories. This primitive decomposition can be driven by high-level reasoning from a vision-language model (VLM) or by rule-based heuristics derived from robot state changes. For each primitive, ManiLong-Shot predicts invariant regions critical to the interaction, establishes correspondences between the demonstration and the current observation, and computes the target end-effector pose, enabling effective task execution. Extensive simulation experiments show that ManiLong-Shot, trained on only 10 short-horizon tasks, generalizes to 20 unseen long-horizon tasks across three difficulty levels via one-shot imitation, achieving a 22.8% relative improvement over the SOTA. Additionally, real-robot experiments validate ManiLong-Shot's ability to robustly execute three long-horizon manipulation tasks via OSIL, confirming its practical applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "ManiLong-Shot\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u5143\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u77ed\u89c6\u91ce\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "ManiLong-Shot\u5229\u7528\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e8b\u4ef6\u91cd\u6784\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u89c4\u5219\u9a71\u52a8\u57fa\u5143\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u5173\u952e\u4e0d\u53d8\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u6f14\u793a\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4ec5\u8bad\u7ec310\u4e2a\u77ed\u89c6\u91ce\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cManiLong-Shot\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u572820\u4e2a\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8622.8%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ManiLong-Shot\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u57fa\u5143\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u590d\u6742\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002"}}

We introduce a statistical framework to quantify their coupling strength and behavioral similarity to real faults using publicly available bugs datasets: CleanML, DeepFD, DeepLocalize, and defect4ML. Mutants are generated using state-of-the-art tools representing both approaches.\n  Results show that pre-training mutants exhibit consistently stronger coupling and higher behavioral similarity to real faults than post-training mutants, indicating greater realism.

Although one might query an LLM directly rather than a SQL-based knowledge graph, concerns such as cost, speed, safety, and confidence may arise, especially in high-volume operations.

These included erroneous, off-topic, free-text, overly general, and inconsistent LLM responses, as well as allowing for multi-element responses. DV was built with features intended to mitigate these issues.

Unlike passive rewilding approaches, the proposed system uses deep feature-space analysis to identify and preserve visually diverse vegetation patches in camera images by selectively deactivating the mower blades. A ResNet50 network pretrained on PlantNet300K provides ecologically meaningful embeddings, from which a global deviation metric estimates biodiversity without species-level supervision. These estimates drive a selective mowing algorithm that dynamically alternates between mowing and conservation behavior. The system was implemented on a modified commercial robotic mower and validated both in a controlled mock-up lawn and on real garden datasets. Results demonstrate a strong correlation between embedding-space dispersion and expert biodiversity assessment, confirming the feasibility of deep visual diversity as a proxy for ecological richness and the effectiveness of the proposed mowing decision approach.

Conventional approaches estimate the flying robot's position using fixed cameras observing pre-attached markers, which could be constrained by limited distance and susceptible to capture failure. To address this issue, we improve the ground-aerial localization framework in a more comprehensive manner, which integrates active vision, single-ranging, inertial odometry, and optical flow. First, the designed active vision subsystem mounted on the ground vehicle can be dynamically rotated to detect and track infrared markers on the aerial robot, improving the field of view and the target recognition with a single camera. Meanwhile, the incorporation of single-ranging extends the feasible distance and enhances re-capture capability under visual degradation. During estimation, a dimension-reduced estimator fuses multi-source measurements based on polynomial approximation with an extended sliding window, balancing computational efficiency and redundancy. Considering different sensor fidelities, an adaptive sliding confidence evaluation algorithm is implemented to assess measurement quality and dynamically adjust the weighting parameters based on moving variance. Finally, extensive experiments under conditions such as smoke interference, illumination variation, obstacle occlusion, prolonged visual loss, and extended operating range demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves robust online localization, with an average root mean square error of approximately 0.09 m, while maintaining resilience to capture loss and sensor failures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5730\u9762-\u7a7a\u4e2d\u534f\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7efc\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u98de\u884c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u548c\u9884\u9644\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8ddd\u79bb\u9650\u5236\u548c\u6355\u83b7\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5730\u9762-\u7a7a\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7efc\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u5355\u70b9\u6d4b\u8ddd\u3001\u60ef\u6027\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u548c\u5149\u6d41\u6280\u672f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u65cb\u8f6c\u5730\u9762\u8f66\u8f86\u4e0a\u7684\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u6765\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7a7a\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u7ea2\u5916\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ef4\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ed1\u52a8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u70df\u96fe\u5e72\u6270\u3001\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u969c\u788d\u7269\u906e\u6321\u7b49\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\u7ea6\u4e3a0.09\u7c73\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6355\u83b7\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6545\u969c\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u97e7\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5730\u9762-\u7a7a\u4e2d\u534f\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u7efc\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u98de\u884c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

Yet, where in the model this reliance resides, and how it affects performance, remains poorly understood. We present the first concept-level interpretability study of LLMs in SE, analyzing three tasks - code completion, translation, and refinement - through the lens of internal comment representation. Using Concept Activation Vectors (CAV), we show that LLMs not only internalize comments as distinct latent concepts but also differentiate between subtypes such as Javadocs, inline, and multiline comments. By systematically activating and deactivating these concepts in the LLMs' embedding space, we observed significant, model-specific, and task-dependent shifts in performance ranging from -90% to +67%.

Most of the standard RAG frameworks regard all retrieved information as equally reliable, overlooking the varying credibility and interconnected nature of large textual corpora. GraphRAG approaches offer potential improvement to RAG systems by integrating knowledge graphs, which structure information into nodes and edges, capture entity relationships, and enable multi-step logical traversal. However, GraphRAG is not always an ideal solution as it depends on high-quality graph representations of the corpus, which requires either pre-existing knowledge graphs that are expensive to build and update, or automated graph construction pipelines that are often unreliable. Moreover, systems following this paradigm typically use large language models to guide graph traversal and evidence retrieval, leading to challenges similar to those encountered with standard RAG. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG framework that employs the spreading activation algorithm to retrieve information from a corpus of documents interconnected by automatically constructed knowledge graphs, thereby enhancing the performance of large language models on complex tasks such as multi-hop question answering. Experiments show that our method achieves better or comparable performance to iterative RAG methodologies, while also being easily integrable as a plug-and-play module with a wide range of RAG-based approaches. Combining our method with chain-of-thought iterative retrieval yields up to a 39\\% absolute gain in answer correctness compared to naive RAG, achieving these results with small open-weight language models and highlighting its effectiveness in resource-constrained settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u65b0\u578bRAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u7d22\u591a\u6b65\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u4e14\u6807\u51c6RAG\u6846\u67b6\u5ffd\u89c6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u5173\u8054\u6027\u3002GraphRAG\u867d\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u8c31\u6216\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6784\u5efa\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ece\u7531\u81ea\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u6587\u6863\u5e93\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u8fed\u4ee3\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u4e0e\u8fed\u4ee3RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u8fed\u4ee3\u68c0\u7d22\u65f6\uff0c\u7b54\u6848\u6b63\u786e\u7387\u6bd4\u6734\u7d20RAG\u63d0\u534739%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u578bRAG\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u591a\u79cdRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u3002"}}

To overcome these limitations, we (1) extend a pretrained video diffusion model with a parallel, dedicated action diffusion model that preserves pretrained knowledge, (2) introduce a Bridge Attention mechanism to enable effective cross-modal interaction, and (3) design an action refinement module to convert coarse actions into precise controls for low-resolution datasets.

More precisely, the problem considers two key decisions: (i) whether to deploy additional edge servers or upgrade those already installed, and (ii) how tasks should be offloaded so that the average number of tasks that meet their delay requirement is maximized. The framework specifically involves: (i) deployment of new servers combined with capacity upgrades for existing servers, and (ii) the optimal task offloading to maximize the average number of tasks with a delay requirement. It also considers the following constraints: (i) budget per stage, (ii) server deployment and upgrade cost (in $) and cost depreciation rate, (iii) computation resource of servers, (iv) number of tasks and their growth rate (in %), and (v) the increase in task sizes and stricter delay requirements over time. We present two solutions: a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and an efficient heuristic algorithm (M-ESU/H). MILP yields the optimal solution for small networks, whereas M-ESU/H is used in large-scale networks. For small networks, the simulation results show that the solution computed by M-ESU/H is within 1.25% of the optimal solution while running several orders of magnitude faster. For large networks, M-ESU/H is compared against three alternative heuristic solutions that consider only server deployment, or giving priority to server deployment or upgrade. Our experiments show that M-ESU/H yields up to 21.57% improvement in task satisfaction under identical budget and demand growth conditions, confirming its scalability and practical value for long-term MEC systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "M-ESU\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u8fb9\u7f18\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5347\u7ea7\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5378\u8f7d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u6ee1\u8db3\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5347\u7ea7\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5378\u8f7d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6ee1\u8db3\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86M-ESU\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bMILP\u6a21\u578b\u548cM-ESU/H\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u578b\u548c\u5927\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "M-ESU/H\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff08\u504f\u5dee1.25%\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u4efb\u52a1\u6ee1\u8db3\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe21.57%\u3002", "conclusion": "M-ESU\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7MILP\u6a21\u578b\u548cM-ESU/H\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8fb9\u7f18\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5347\u7ea7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5927\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

E-SDS integrates VLMs with real-time terrain sensor analysis to automatically generate reward functions that facilitate training of robust perceptive locomotion policies, grounded by example videos. Evaluated on a Unitree G1 humanoid across four distinct terrains (simple, gaps, obstacles, stairs), E-SDS uniquely enabled successful stair descent, while policies trained with manually-designed rewards or a non-perceptive automated baseline were unable to complete the task. In all terrains, E-SDS also reduced velocity tracking error by 51.9-82.6%. Our framework reduces the human effort of reward design from days to less than two hours while simultaneously producing more robust and capable locomotion policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "E-SDS\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408VLM\u548c\u5730\u5f62\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5730\u5f62\u4e2d\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eVLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5730\u5f62\u4e2d\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "E-SDS\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u5730\u5f62\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u793a\u4f8b\u89c6\u9891\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5177\u6709\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u5f62\uff08\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u95f4\u9699\u3001\u969c\u788d\u3001\u697c\u68af\uff09\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0cE-SDS\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u5b8c\u6210\u697c\u68af\u4e0b\u964d\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u901f\u5ea6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8651.9-82.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "E-SDS\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5730\u5f62\uff08\u5982\u697c\u68af\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, their extensive computational requirements make them cost-prohibitive for routine enterprise use. This limitation motivates the exploration of Small Language Models (SLMs), which can deliver comparable performance in targeted applications while drastically reducing infrastructure overhead (Irugalbandara et al., 2023). In this work, we investigate the feasibility of replacing LLM-driven workflows with optimized SLMs. We trained a domain-adapted SLM to execute representative tasks traditionally handled by LLMs, such as document summarization, query answering, and structured data interpretation. As part of the experiment, we investigated the fine-tuning of facebook/opt-350m model (single epoch only) using the Hugging Face TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning), specifically the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) trainer. The OPT-350M model was released by Meta AI in 2022 as part of the OPT (Open Pretrained Transformer) family of models. Similar studies demonstrate that even models at the 350M parameter scale can meaningfully contribute to instruction-tuning pipelines (Mekala et al., 2024). Experimental results demonstrated that our fine-tuned SLM achieves exceptional performance with a 77.55\\% pass rate on ToolBench evaluation, significantly outperforming all baseline models including ChatGPT-CoT (26.00\\%), ToolLLaMA-DFS (30.18\\%), and ToolLLaMA-CoT (16.27\\%).

To address this challenge, we propose a closed-loop evaluation platform for end-to-end autonomous driving, which can generate adversarial interactions in real-world scenes. In our platform, the real-world image generator cooperates with an adversarial traffic policy to evaluate various end-to-end models trained on real-world data. The generator, based on flow matching, efficiently and stably generates real-world images according to the traffic environment information. The efficient adversarial surrounding vehicle policy is designed to model challenging interactions and create corner cases that current autonomous driving systems struggle to handle. Experimental results demonstrate that the platform can generate realistic driving images efficiently. Through evaluating the end-to-end models such as UniAD and VAD, we demonstrate that based on the adversarial policy, our platform evaluates the performance degradation of the tested model in corner cases.

As a result, the observed geometry is incomplete, and grasp estimation algorithms perform suboptimally. To address this limitation, we leverage diffusion models to perform category-level 3D shape completion from partial depth observations obtained from a single view, reconstructing complete object geometries to provide richer context for grasp planning. Our method focuses on common household items with diverse geometries, generating full 3D shapes that serve as input to downstream grasp inference networks. Unlike prior work, which primarily considers isolated objects or minimal clutter, we evaluate shape completion and grasping in realistic clutter scenarios with household objects. In preliminary evaluations on a cluttered scene, our approach consistently results in better grasp success rates than a naive baseline without shape completion by 23% and over a recent state of the art shape completion approach by 19%.

Estimating FOD from single-shell low angular resolution dMRI (LAR-FOD) is limited by accuracy, whereas estimating FOD from multi-shell high angular resolution dMRI (HAR-FOD) requires a long scanning time, which limits its applicability. Diffusion models have shown promise in estimating HAR-FOD based on LAR-FOD. However, using diffusion models to efficiently generate HAR-FOD is challenging due to the large number of spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients in FOD. Here, we propose a 3D multi-channel patch diffusion model to predict HAR-FOD from LAR-FOD. We design the FOD-patch adapter by introducing the prior brain anatomy for more efficient patch-based learning. Furthermore, we introduce a voxel-level conditional coordinating module to enhance the global understanding of the model.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their direct application to time series forecasting has proven ineffective. We address this gap by repositioning the LLM as an intelligent judge that evaluates, explains, and strategically coordinates an ensemble of foundation models. To overcome the LLM's inherent lack of domain-specific knowledge on time series, we introduce an R1-style finetuning process, guided by SHAP-based faithfulness scores, which teaches the model to interpret ensemble weights as meaningful causal statements about temporal dynamics. The trained agent then engages in iterative, multi-turn conversations to perform forward-looking assessments, provide causally-grounded explanations for its weighting decisions, and adaptively refine the optimization strategy. Validated on the GIFT-Eval benchmark on 23 datasets across 97 settings, our approach significantly outperforms leading time series foundation models on both CRPS and MASE metrics, establishing new state-of-the-art results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u534f\u8c03\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4f18\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b0SOTA\u3002", "motivation": "\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u5355\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528R1\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8eSHAP\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u89e3\u91ca\u96c6\u6210\u6743\u91cd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u56e0\u679c\u9648\u8ff0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728GIFT-Eval\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u572823\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u768497\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u9886\u5148\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0cCRPS\u548cMASE\u6307\u6807\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

Methods that have SOTA (State-of-the-Art) accuracy, often involve a large number of parameters and incur substantial computational cost. Many lightweight variants have been proposed to reduce the model size and computational cost of them. However, several of these methods still contain components that are not well suited for efficient deployment on edge devices. Moreover, models that primarily emphasize inference speed on edge devices often suffer from limited accuracy due to their overly simplified designs.

In addition to adopting the self-attention module, LAPX advances the stage design and refine the lightweight attention modules.

They use GenAI to clarify concepts, solve complex problems, and, in some cases, complete assignments by copying and pasting model-generated contents. While GenAI has the potential to enhance learning experience, it also raises concerns around misinformation, hallucinated outputs, and its potential to undermine critical thinking and problem-solving skills. In response, many universities, colleges, departments, and instructors have begun to develop and adopt policies to guide responsible integration of GenAI into learning environments. However, these policies vary widely across institutions and contexts, and their evolving nature often leaves students uncertain about expectations and best practices. To address this challenge, the authors designed and implemented an automated system for discovering and categorizing AI-related policies found in course syllabi and institutional policy websites. The system combines unsupervised topic modeling techniques to identify key policy themes with large language models (LLMs) to classify the level of GenAI allowance and other requirements in policy texts. The developed application achieved a coherence score of 0.73 for topic discovery. In addition, GPT-4.0-based classification of policy categories achieved precision between 0.92 and 0.97, and recall between 0.85 and 0.97 across eight identified topics. By providing structured and interpretable policy information, this tool promotes the safe, equitable, and pedagogically aligned use of GenAI technologies in education.

This provides an ideal platform for innovation in both mechanical design and stylized motion control. In this paper, we bring Olaf to life in the physical world, relying on reinforcement learning guided by animation references for control. To create the illusion of Olaf's feet moving along his body, we hide two asymmetric legs under a soft foam skirt. To fit actuators inside the character, we use spherical and planar linkages in the arms, mouth, and eyes. Because the walk cycle results in harsh contact sounds, we introduce additional rewards that noticeably reduce impact noise.

However, existing pipelines for synthetic data generation often rely on tens of thousands of real API calls to enhance generalization, incurring prohibitive costs while lacking multi-hop reasoning and self-reflection. To address these limitations, we introduce ToolForge, an automated synthesis framework that achieves strong real-world tool-calling performance by constructing only a small number of virtual tools, eliminating the need for real API calls. ToolForge leverages a (question, golden context, answer) triple to synthesize large-scale tool-learning data specifically designed for multi-hop search scenarios, further enriching the generated data through multi-hop reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms. To ensure data fidelity, we employ a Multi-Layer Validation Framework that integrates both rule-based and model-based assessments. Empirical results show that a model with only 8B parameters, when trained on our synthesized data, outperforms GPT-4o on multiple benchmarks.

This paper introduces a novel camera calibration method using a designed collimator system. Our collimator system provides a reliable and controllable calibration environment for the camera. Exploiting the unique optical geometry property of our collimator system, we introduce an angle invariance constraint and further prove that the relative motion between the calibration target and camera conforms to a spherical motion model. This constraint reduces the original 6DOF relative motion between target and camera to a 3DOF pure rotation motion. Using spherical motion constraint, a closed-form linear solver for multiple images and a minimal solver for two images are proposed for camera calibration. Furthermore, we propose a single collimator image calibration algorithm based on the angle invariance constraint. This algorithm eliminates the requirement for camera motion, providing a novel solution for flexible and fast calibration. The performance of our method is evaluated in both synthetic and real-world experiments, which verify the feasibility of calibration using the collimator system and demonstrate that our method is superior to existing baseline methods.

Their cascaded design further propagates perception errors, degrading downstream planning and control. Vision-Action (VA) models address some limitations by learning direct mappings from visual inputs to actions, but they remain opaque, sensitive to distribution shifts, and lack structured reasoning or instruction-following capabilities. Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal learning has motivated the emergence of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks, which integrate perception with language-grounded decision making. By unifying visual understanding, linguistic reasoning, and actionable outputs, VLAs offer a pathway toward more interpretable, generalizable, and human-aligned driving policies. This work provides a structured characterization of the emerging VLA landscape for autonomous driving. We trace the evolution from early VA approaches to modern VLA frameworks and organize existing methods into two principal paradigms: End-to-End VLA, which integrates perception, reasoning, and planning within a single model, and Dual-System VLA, which separates slow deliberation (via VLMs) from fast, safety-critical execution (via planners). Within these paradigms, we further distinguish subclasses such as textual vs. numerical action generators and explicit vs. implicit guidance mechanisms. We also summarize representative datasets and benchmarks for evaluating VLA-based driving systems and highlight key challenges and open directions, including robustness, interpretability, and instruction fidelity. Overall, this work aims to establish a coherent foundation for advancing human-compatible autonomous driving systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2dVision-Language-Action (VLA) \u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u53ca\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u4eba\u7c7b\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u611f\u77e5\u9519\u8bef\u4f1a\u4f20\u64ad\u81f3\u4e0b\u6e38\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u3002VLA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u4e14\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u65e9\u671f\u7684VA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5230\u73b0\u4ee3VLA\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e3a\u4e24\u5927\u4e3b\u8981\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u7aef\u5230\u7aefVLA\u548c\u53cc\u7cfb\u7edfVLA\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u5b50\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u68b3\u7406\u4e86VLA\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u5982\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86VLA\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Although interaction detection for humans has been actively studied, a non-trivial challenge lies in cattle interaction detection, specifically the lack of a comprehensive behavioral dataset that includes interactions, as the interactions of grazing cattle are rare events. We, therefore, propose CattleAct, a data-efficient method for interaction detection by decomposing interactions into the combinations of actions by individual cattle. Specifically, we first learn an action latent space from a large-scale cattle action dataset. Then, we embed rare interactions via the fine-tuning of the pre-trained latent space using contrastive learning, thereby constructing a unified latent space of actions and interactions.

Scaling robot egocentric data collection remains impractical due to high cost and limited diversity, whereas large-scale human egocentric videos offer a scalable alternative that naturally capture rich interaction context and causal structure. The key challenge is to convert raw egocentric videos into structured and reliable embodiment training supervision. Accordingly, we propose an Egocentric2Embodiment translation pipeline that transforms first-person videos into multi-level, schema-driven VQA supervision with enforced evidence grounding and temporal consistency, enabling the construction of the Egocentric2Embodiment dataset (E2E-3M) at scale. An egocentric-aware embodied brain, termed PhysBrain, is obtained by training on the E2E-3M dataset.

Specifically, we prove monotone descent to a local minimum under fixed initialization, convergence in probability under Binomial Point Process (BPP) initialization, and almost sure convergence under mild decay conditions. These results provide the first stochastic convergence guarantees for harmonic-mean-based clustering.

Traditional methods for PDE solving are cumbersome, relying on manual setup and domain expertise. While Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINNs) introduced end-to-end neural network-based solutions, and frameworks like DeepXDE further enhanced automation, these approaches still depend on expert knowledge and lack full autonomy. In this work, we frame PDE solving as tool invocation via LLM-driven agents and introduce PDE-Agent, the first toolchain-augmented multi-agent collaboration framework, inheriting the reasoning capacity of LLMs and the controllability of external tools and enabling automated PDE solving from natural language descriptions. PDE-Agent leverages the strengths of multi-agent and multi-tool collaboration through two key innovations: (1) A Prog-Act framework with graph memory for multi-agent collaboration, which enables effective dynamic planning and error correction via dual-loop mechanisms (localized fixes and global revisions). (2) A Resource-Pool integrated with a tool-parameter separation mechanism for multi-tool collaboration. This centralizes the management of runtime artifacts and resolves inter-tool dependency gaps in existing frameworks. To validate and evaluate this new paradigm for PDE solving , we develop PDE-Bench, a multi-type PDE Benchmark for agent-based tool collaborative solving, and propose multi-level metrics for assessing tool coordination.

Recent advances have demonstrated the significant potential of 2D foundation models for low-shot 3D part segmentation. However, it is still an open problem that how to effectively aggregate 2D knowledge from foundation models to 3D. Existing methods either ignore geometric structures for 3D feature learning or neglects the high-quality grouping clues from SAM, leading to under-segmentation and inconsistent part labels. We devise a novel SAM segment graph-based propagation method, named SegGraph, to explicitly learn geometric features encoded within SAM's segmentation masks. Our method encodes geometric features by modeling mutual overlap and adjacency between segments while preserving intra-segment semantic consistency. We construct a segment graph, conceptually similar to an atlas, where nodes represent segments and edges capture their spatial relationships (overlap/adjacency). Each node adaptively modulates 2D foundation model features, which are then propagated via a graph neural network to learn global geometric structures. To enforce intra-segment semantic consistency, we map segment features to 3D points with a novel view-direction-weighted fusion attenuating contributions from low-quality segments. Extensive experiments on PartNet-E demonstrate that our method outperforms all competing baselines by at least 6.9 percent mIoU. Further analysis reveals that SegGraph achieves particularly strong performance on small components and part boundaries, demonstrating its superior geometric understanding.

Benchmarking in robotics is historically challenging due to the stochasticity, reproducibility, and time-consuming nature of real-world rollouts. This challenge is exacerbated for recent generalist policies, which has to be evaluated across a wide variety of scenes and tasks. Evaluation in simulation offers a scalable complement to real world evaluations, but the visual and physical domain gap between existing simulation benchmarks and the real world has made them an unreliable signal for policy improvement. Furthermore, building realistic and diverse simulated environments has traditionally required significant human effort and expertise. To bridge the gap, we introduce Policy Evaluation and Environment Reconstruction in Simulation (PolaRiS), a scalable real-to-sim framework for high-fidelity simulated robot evaluation. PolaRiS utilizes neural reconstruction methods to turn short video scans of real-world scenes into interactive simulation environments. Additionally, we develop a simple simulation data co-training recipe that bridges remaining real-to-sim gaps and enables zero-shot evaluation in unseen simulation environments. Through extensive paired evaluations between simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that PolaRiS evaluations provide a much stronger correlation to real world generalist policy performance than existing simulated benchmarks. Its simplicity also enables rapid creation of diverse simulated environments.

Prevailing efforts to address this through enhancing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are trapped in a dilemma: template-based datasets are scalable but structurally rigid, while manual annotation is linguistically diverse but unscalable and, critically, computationally imprecise. We introduce SPRITE, a novel framework that overcomes this dilemma by leveraging simulators and large models to programmatically synthesize scalable, diverse, and high-quality spatial reasoning data. The core innovation of SPRITE is to reframe ground-truth generation as a code-generation task. We utilize LLMs to compile complex spatial questions into executable programs, which are then verified against high-precision scene meta-information extracted from simulators. This ensures our ground truth is both computationally precise and verifiable, while the generative power of LLMs provides vast linguistic diversity. Leveraging this pipeline, we have curated a dataset encompassing 3 simulators, 11k+ scenes, and 300k+ image/video instruction-tuning pairs. We demonstrate that a VLM trained on our data achieves significant performance gains on multiple spatial benchmarks and outperforms other open-source datasets of equivalent size. Furthermore, a scalability analysis confirms our hypothesis that overcoming the low-diversity nature of traditional template methods is essential for building robust, generalizable spatial intelligence.

In a local Fisher chart around an instruction-tuned base, we estimate an alignment subspace with projector P_A and optimize:\n  L_AlignMerge = L_geo + lambda_align * L_align + lambda_bud * L_bud,\n  where L_geo keeps the merge close to its experts in Fisher-Rao geometry, L_align penalizes motion along alignment-sensitive directions, and L_bud enforces a soft alignment budget. As the alignment functional we use the decoding-invariant Alignment Quality Index (AQI), a latent-space criterion that captures how cleanly aligned and misaligned behaviors separate in representation space.\n  Across five model families (LLaMA-3 8B, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2, Phi-3.5, Gemma 2), merging safety anchors with task experts, AlignMerge improves alignment metrics (AQI, toxicity, LLM-judge alignment) while matching or exceeding the best expert on instruction-following, reasoning, and helpfulness.

We introduce AMUSE, a benchmark designed around tasks that are inherently agentic, requiring models to decompose complex audio-visual interactions into planning, grounding, and reflection steps. It evaluates MLLMs across three modes zero-shot, guided, and agentic and six task families, including spatio-temporal speaker grounding and multimodal dialogue summarization. Across all modes, current models exhibit weak multi-speaker reasoning and inconsistent behavior under both non-agentic and agentic evaluation.

To validate the impact of Avatar4D, we focus on sports, where domain-specific human actions and movement patterns pose unique challenges for motion understanding. In this setting, we introduce Syn2Sport, a large-scale synthetic dataset spanning sports, including baseball and ice hockey. Avatar4D features high-fidelity 4D (3D geometry over time) human motion sequences with varying player appearances rendered in diverse environments.

Despite recent progress in Large Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs), generating radiology reports that are both visually grounded and clinically accurate remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often rely on large labeled corpora for pre-training, costly task-specific preference data, or retrieval-based methods. However, these strategies do not adequately mitigate hallucinations arising from poor cross-modal alignment between visual and linguistic representations. To address these limitations, we propose VALOR:Visual Alignment of Medical Vision-Language Models for GrOunded Radiology Report Generation. Our method introduces a reinforcement learning-based post-alignment framework utilizing Group-Relative Proximal Optimization (GRPO). The training proceeds in two stages: (1) improving the Med-VLM with textual rewards to encourage clinically precise terminology, and (2) aligning the vision projection module of the textually grounded model with disease findings, thereby guiding attention toward image re gions most relevant to the diagnostic task.

Expressing safety policies as sequents, we propose \\textsc{QuadSentinel}, a four-agent guard (state tracker, policy verifier, threat watcher, and referee) that compiles these policies into machine-checkable rules built from predicates over observable state and enforces them online. Referee logic plus an efficient top-$k$ predicate updater keeps costs low by prioritizing checks and resolving conflicts hierarchically. Measured on ST-WebAgentBench (ICML CUA~'25) and AgentHarm (ICLR~'25), \\textsc{QuadSentinel} improves guardrail accuracy and rule recall while reducing false positives. Against single-agent baselines such as ShieldAgent (ICML~'25), it yields better overall safety control.

Moreover, OAK produces interpretable saliency maps, focusing on hands for Action, faces for Mood, and backgrounds for Location, promoting transparency and trust while enabling adaptive and generalizable categorization.", "AI": {"tldr": "OAK\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408CLIP\u548cGCD\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u653ead-hoc\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u805a\u7c7b\u52a8\u6001\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u6269\u5c55ad-hoc\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOAK\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684CLIP\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u5c11\u91cf\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316CLIP\u7684\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u76ee\u6807\u548cGCD\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u805a\u7c7b\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728Stanford\u548cClevr-4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cOAK\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5728Stanford Mood\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523087.4%\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7CLIP\u548cGCD\u8d85\u8fc750%\u3002", "conclusion": "OAK\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408CLIP\u7684\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u76ee\u6807\u548cGCD\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u805a\u7c7b\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u56fe\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002"}}

In long-horizon workflows, errors accumulate quickly and irreversible actions can cause unintended consequences, motivating critic models that assess each action before execution. While critic models offer a promising solution, their effectiveness is hindered by the lack of diverse, high-quality GUI feedback data and public critic benchmarks for step-level evaluation in computer use. To bridge these gaps, we introduce OS-Oracle that makes three core contributions: (1) a scalable data pipeline for synthesizing cross-platform GUI critic data; (2) a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and consistency-preserving group relative policy optimization (CP-GRPO); (3) OS-Critic Bench, a holistic benchmark for evaluating critic model performance across Mobile, Web, and Desktop platforms. Leveraging this framework, we curate a high-quality dataset containing 310k critic samples. The resulting critic model, OS-Oracle-7B, achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source VLMs on OS-Critic Bench, and surpasses proprietary models on the mobile domain.

However, comparing point clouds faces significant challenges due to their unstructured nature and the complex geometry of the surfaces they represent. Traditional geometric metrics such as Hausdorff and Chamfer distances often fail to capture global statistical structure and exhibit sensitivity to outliers, while existing Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence approximations for Gaussian Mixture Models can produce unbounded or numerically unstable values. This paper introduces an information geometric framework for 3D point cloud shape analysis by representing point clouds as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) on a statistical manifold. We prove that the space of GMMs forms a statistical manifold and propose the Modified Symmetric Kullback-Leibler (MSKL) divergence with theoretically guaranteed upper and lower bounds, ensuring numerical stability for all GMM comparisons. Through comprehensive experiments on human pose discrimination (MPI-FAUST dataset) and animal shape comparison (G-PCD dataset), we demonstrate that MSKL provides stable and monotonically varying values that directly reflect geometric variation, outperforming traditional distances and existing KL approximations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u76843D\u70b9\u4e91\u5f62\u72b6\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6b63\u5bf9\u79f0KL\u6563\u5ea6\uff08MSKL\uff09\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u51e0\u4f55\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08\u5982Hausdorff\u548cChamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5168\u5c40\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u4e14\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709KL\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u503c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u70b9\u4e91\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff08GMMs\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4fee\u6b63\u5bf9\u79f0Kullback-Leibler\uff08MSKL\uff09\u6563\u5ea6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728MPI-FAUST\u548cG-PCD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMSKL\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u53cd\u6620\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MSKL\u6563\u5ea6\u57283D\u70b9\u4e91\u5f62\u72b6\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u7684KL\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we propose ForenAgent, a multi-round interactive IFD framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and iteratively refine Python-based low-level tools around the detection objective, thereby achieving more flexible and interpretable forgery analysis. ForenAgent follows a two-stage training pipeline combining Cold Start and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning to enhance its tool interaction capability and reasoning adaptability progressively. Inspired by human reasoning, we design a dynamic reasoning loop comprising global perception, local focusing, iterative probing, and holistic adjudication, and instantiate it as both a data-sampling strategy and a task-aligned process reward. For systematic training and evaluation, we construct FABench, a heterogeneous, high-quality agent-forensics dataset comprising 100k images and approximately 200k agent-interaction question-answer pairs.

It has been observed that in diffusion models, certain high-quality initial noise patterns lead to better generation results than others. However, there remains a lack of dedicated learning frameworks that enable NVS models to learn such high-quality noise. To obtain high-quality initial noise from random Gaussian noise, we make the following contributions. First, we design a discretized Euler inversion method to inject image semantic information into random noise, thereby constructing paired datasets of random and high-quality noise. Second, we propose a learning framework based on an encoder-decoder network (EDN) that directly transforms random noise into high-quality noise. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed EDN can be seamlessly plugged into various NVS models, such as SV3D and MV-Adapter, achieving significant performance improvements across multiple datasets.

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide open-world semantic priors, they lack grounding in 3D geometry and temporal dynamics. Conversely, geometric perception captures structure and motion but remains semantically sparse. We propose SNOW (Scene Understanding with Open-World Knowledge), a training-free and backbone-agnostic framework for unified 4D scene understanding that integrates VLM-derived semantics with point cloud geometry and temporal consistency. SNOW processes synchronized RGB images and 3D point clouds, using HDBSCAN clustering to generate object-level proposals that guide SAM2-based segmentation. Each segmented region is encoded through our proposed Spatio-Temporal Tokenized Patch Encoding (STEP), producing multimodal tokens that capture localized semantic, geometric, and temporal attributes. These tokens are incrementally integrated into a 4D Scene Graph (4DSG), which serves as 4D prior for downstream reasoning. A lightweight SLAM backend anchors all STEP tokens spatially in the environment, providing the global reference alignment, and ensuring unambiguous spatial grounding across time. The resulting 4DSG forms a queryable, unified world model through which VLMs can directly interpret spatial scene structure and temporal dynamics. Experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks demonstrate that SNOW enables precise 4D scene understanding and spatially grounded inference, thereby setting new state-of-the-art performance in several settings, highlighting the importance of structured 4D priors for embodied reasoning and autonomous robotics.", "AI": {"tldr": "SNOW\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u4e0e\u9aa8\u5e72\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408VLM\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u70b9\u4e91\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u6784\u5efa4D\u573a\u666f\u56fe\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f3D\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u63a5\u5730\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u53c8\u8bed\u4e49\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6574\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "SNOW\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528HDBSCAN\u805a\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ea7\u63d0\u6848\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SAM2\u5206\u5272\u548cSTEP\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u6784\u5efa4D\u573a\u666f\u56fe\uff084DSG\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7SLAM\u540e\u7aef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u951a\u5b9a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSNOW\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u76844D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a5\u5730\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SNOW\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408VLM\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u70b9\u4e91\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u76844D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u53164D\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We demonstrate that this framework helps clarify the design space of adaptation strategies in agentic AI, makes their trade-offs explicit, and provides practical guidance for selecting or switching among strategies during system design. We then review the representative approaches in each category, analyze their strengths and limitations, and highlight key open challenges and future opportunities.

Experiments on RoboCasa Human-50, LIBERO, and real-world manipulation tasks show that GeoPredict consistently outperforms strong VLA baselines, especially in geometry-intensive and spatially demanding scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "GeoPredict\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7684VLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u53473D\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u57283D\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e3D\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002GeoPredict\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u76843D\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "GeoPredict\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u7f16\u7801\u8fd0\u52a8\u5386\u53f2\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u6b653D\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u8f68\u8ff9\uff09\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u60273D\u9ad8\u65af\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u9884\u6d4b\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8f68\u8ff9\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7ec6\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5757\u4ec5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7684\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4ec5\u9700\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u67e5\u8be2\u4ee4\u724c\u3002", "result": "\u5728RoboCasa Human-50\u3001LIBERO\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cGeoPredict\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709VLA\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u5bc6\u96c6\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "GeoPredict\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86VLA\u6a21\u578b\u57283D\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u3002"}}

Proof of Quality (PoQ) replaces cryptographic verification of computation with consensus over output quality, but the original formulation ignores heterogeneous computational costs across inference and evaluator nodes. This paper introduces a cost-aware PoQ framework that integrates explicit efficiency measurements into the reward mechanism for both types of nodes. The design combines ground truth token level F1, lightweight learned evaluators, and GPT based judgments within a unified evaluation pipeline, and adopts a linear reward function that balances normalized quality and cost.\n  Experiments on extractive question answering and abstractive summarization use five instruction tuned LLMs ranging from TinyLlama-1.1B to Llama-3.2-3B and three evaluation models spanning cross encoder and bi encoder architectures. Results show that a semantic textual similarity bi encoder achieves much higher correlation with both ground truth and GPT scores than cross encoders, indicating that evaluator architecture is a critical design choice for PoQ. Quality-cost analysis further reveals that the largest models in the pool are also the most efficient in terms of quality per unit latency. Monte Carlo simulations over 5\\,000 PoQ rounds demonstrate that the cost-aware reward scheme consistently assigns higher average rewards to high quality low cost inference models and to efficient evaluators, while penalizing slow low quality nodes. These findings suggest that cost-aware PoQ provides a practical foundation for economically sustainable decentralized LLM inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5PoQ\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u6548\u7387\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u5e73\u8861\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316LLM\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u73b0\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7F1\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5b66\u4e60\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eGPT\u7684\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u5e73\u8861\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u6587\u672c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u53cc\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u8bb0\u548cGPT\u5206\u6570\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u8d28\u91cf-\u6210\u672c\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u6700\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5355\u4f4d\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u6700\u6709\u6548\u3002\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5956\u52b1\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8282\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u7684PoQ\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316LLM\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Yet, after more than a decade of hype, its measurable impact remains modest outside a few high-profile scientific and commercial successes.

We argue that while current AI may influence physics, physics has significantly more to offer this generation of AI. Current architectures - large language models, reasoning models, and agentic AI - can depend on trillions of meaningless parameters, suffer from distributional bias, lack uncertainty quantification, provide no mechanistic insights, and fail to capture even elementary scientific laws. We review critiques of these limits, highlight opportunities in quantum AI and analogue computing, and lay down a roadmap for the adoption of 'Big AI': a synthesis of theory-based rigour with the flexibility of machine learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6279\u8bc4\u5f53\u524dAI\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684'Big AI'\u53d1\u5c55\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1AI\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u53d8\u9769\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\u4ecd\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5c11\u6570\u9ad8\u8c03\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5546\u4e1a\u6210\u529f\u6848\u4f8b\u3002\u5f53\u524dAI\u6280\u672f\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u610f\u4e49\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u5b9a\u5f8b\u6355\u6349\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u5f53\u524dAI\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5982\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4ee3\u7406AI\uff09\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50AI\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "result": "\u6587\u7ae0\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5f53\u524dAI\u6280\u672f\u7684\u591a\u91cd\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6765\u63a8\u52a8AI\u53d1\u5c55\u7684'Big AI'\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684AI\u53d1\u5c55\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5373'Big AI'\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524dAI\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

However, due to the difficulty of collecting and annotating multi-view images, the datasets for multi-view counting have a limited number of multi-view frames and scenes. To solve the problem of limited data, one approach is to collect synthetic data to bypass the annotating step, while another is to propose semi- or weakly-supervised or unsupervised methods that demand less multi-view data. In this paper, we propose two semi-supervised multi-view crowd counting frameworks by ranking the multi-view fusion models of different numbers of input views, in terms of the model predictions or the model uncertainties. Specifically, for the first method (vanilla model), we rank the multi-view fusion models' prediction results of different numbers of camera-view inputs, namely, the model's predictions with fewer camera views shall not be larger than the predictions with more camera views.

This requires a compact, semantically rich scene representation that captures where objects are, how they function, and which parts are actionable. Scene graphs are a natural choice, yet prior work often separates spatial and functional relations, treats scenes as static snapshots without object states or temporal updates, and overlooks information most relevant for accomplishing the current task. To address these limitations, we introduce MomaGraph, a unified scene representation for embodied agents that integrates spatial-functional relationships and part-level interactive elements. However, advancing such a representation requires both suitable data and rigorous evaluation, which have been largely missing. We thus contribute MomaGraph-Scenes, the first large-scale dataset of richly annotated, task-driven scene graphs in household environments, along with MomaGraph-Bench, a systematic evaluation suite spanning six reasoning capabilities from high-level planning to fine-grained scene understanding. Built upon this foundation, we further develop MomaGraph-R1, a 7B vision-language model trained with reinforcement learning on MomaGraph-Scenes. MomaGraph-R1 predicts task-oriented scene graphs and serves as a zero-shot task planner under a Graph-then-Plan framework.

The model is trained using the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) framework, which, compared to diffusion model-based alternatives, delivers a more robust PSR reconstruction with substantially shorter inference times, a crucial advantage for practical deployment. FLIM_PSR_k not only enables faster image acquisition but can also alleviate SNR limitations in autofluorescence-based FLIM. Blind testing on held-out patient-derived tumor tissue samples demonstrates that FLIM_PSR_k reliably achieves a super-resolution factor of k = 5, resulting in a 25-fold increase in the space-bandwidth product of the output images and revealing fine architectural features lost in lower-resolution inputs, with statistically significant improvements across various image quality metrics.

However, there still lacks a driving-targeted dense geometry perception model that can adapt to different scenarios and camera configurations. To bridge this gap, we propose a Driving Visual Geometry Transformer (DVGT), which reconstructs a global dense 3D point map from a sequence of unposed multi-view visual inputs. We first extract visual features for each image using a DINO backbone, and employ alternating intra-view local attention, cross-view spatial attention, and cross-frame temporal attention to infer geometric relations across images. We then use multiple heads to decode a global point map in the ego coordinate of the first frame and the ego poses for each frame. Unlike conventional methods that rely on precise camera parameters, DVGT is free of explicit 3D geometric priors, enabling flexible processing of arbitrary camera configurations.

However, text editing within images remains largely unexplored, as it requires generating legible characters while preserving semantic, geometric, and contextual coherence. To fill this gap, we introduce TextEditBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark that explicitly focuses on text-centric regions in images. Beyond basic pixel manipulations, our benchmark emphasizes reasoning-intensive editing scenarios that require models to understand physical plausibility, linguistic meaning, and cross-modal dependencies. We further propose a novel evaluation dimension, Semantic Expectation (SE), which measures reasoning ability of model to maintain semantic consistency, contextual coherence, and cross-modal alignment during text editing. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art editing systems reveal that while current models can follow simple textual instructions, they still struggle with context-dependent reasoning, physical consistency, and layout-aware integration.

While recent deep learning approaches have improved the state of the art, they often struggle to capture architectural reasoning: the precedence of topological relationships over geometric instantiation, the propagation of functional constraints through adjacency networks, and the emergence of circulation patterns from local connectivity decisions. To address these fundamental challenges, this paper introduces GFLAN, a generative framework that restructures floor plan synthesis through explicit factorization into topological planning and geometric realization. Given a single exterior boundary and a front-door location, our approach departs from direct pixel-to-pixel or wall-tracing generation in favor of a principled two-stage decomposition. Stage A employs a specialized convolutional architecture with dual encoders -- separating invariant spatial context from evolving layout state -- to sequentially allocate room centroids within the building envelope via discrete probability maps over feasible placements. Stage B constructs a heterogeneous graph linking room nodes to boundary vertices, then applies a Transformer-augmented graph neural network (GNN) that jointly regresses room boundaries.", "AI": {"tldr": "GFLAN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u89e3\uff08\u62d3\u6251\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\uff09\u6539\u8fdb\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u697c\u5c42\u5e73\u9762\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6355\u6349\u5efa\u7b51\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5982\u62d3\u6251\u5173\u7cfb\u4f18\u5148\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u7ea6\u675f\u901a\u8fc7\u90bb\u63a5\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u7b49\u3002GFLAN\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u57fa\u672c\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "GFLAN\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u5177\u6709\u53cc\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u6563\u6982\u7387\u56fe\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u5305\u7edc\u5185\u5206\u914d\u623f\u95f4\u4e2d\u5fc3\u70b9\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u6784\u5efa\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\uff0c\u5e94\u7528Transformer\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8054\u5408\u56de\u5f52\u623f\u95f4\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "GFLAN\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u697c\u5c42\u5e73\u9762\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u62d3\u6251\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u5230\u50cf\u7d20\u6216\u5899\u8ffd\u8e2a\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GFLAN\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u697c\u5c42\u5e73\u9762\u751f\u6210\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u62d3\u6251\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u697c\u5c42\u5e73\u9762\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6355\u6349\u5efa\u7b51\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

This work identifies these mismatches and proposes cuPilot, a strategy-coordinated multi-agent framework that introduces strategy as an intermediate semantic representation for kernel evolution. Key contributions include a strategy-coordinated evolution algorithm, roofline-guided prompting, and strategy-level population initialization.

However, these approaches still face two challenges when dealing with time-varying degradations. First, the degradation can dominate temporal modeling, confusing the model to focus on artifacts rather than the video content. Second, current methods typically rely on large models to handle all-in-one restoration, concealing those underlying difficulties. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight all-in-one video restoration network, LaverNet, with only 362K parameters. To mitigate the impact of degradations on temporal modeling, we introduce a novel propagation mechanism that selectively transmits only degradation-agnostic features across frames. Through LaverNet, we demonstrate that strong all-in-one restoration can be achieved with a compact network. Despite its small size, less than 1\\% of the parameters of existing models, LaverNet achieves comparable, even superior performance across benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7f51\u7edcLaverNet\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5168\u529f\u80fd\u89c6\u9891\u6062\u590d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5168\u529f\u80fd\u89c6\u9891\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u53d8\u9000\u5316\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u9000\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3b\u5bfc\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6df7\u6dc6\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\uff1b\u4e14\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u63a9\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5168\u529f\u80fd\u89c6\u9891\u6062\u590d\u7f51\u7edcLaverNet\uff08\u4ec5362K\u53c2\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4f20\u9012\u4e0e\u9000\u5316\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "LaverNet\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b1%\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "LaverNet\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u6781\u5c11\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5168\u529f\u80fd\u89c6\u9891\u6062\u590d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Despite progress in improving visual realism through advanced simulators and generative AI, recent studies reveal that pixel-level fidelity alone does not ensure reliable transfer from simulation to the real world. What truly matters is whether the system-under-test (SUT) bases its decisions on the same causal evidence in both real and simulated environments - not just whether images \"look real\" to humans. This paper addresses the lack of such a behavior-grounded fidelity measure by introducing Decisive Feature Fidelity (DFF), a new SUT-specific metric that extends the existing fidelity spectrum to capture mechanism parity - the agreement in causal evidence underlying the SUT's decisions across domains. DFF leverages explainable-AI (XAI) methods to identify and compare the decisive features driving the SUT's outputs for matched real-synthetic pairs. We further propose practical estimators based on counterfactual explanations, along with a DFF-guided calibration scheme to enhance simulator fidelity. Experiments on 2126 matched KITTI-VirtualKITTI2 pairs demonstrate that DFF reveals discrepancies overlooked by conventional output-value fidelity. Furthermore, results show that DFF-guided calibration improves decisive-feature and input-level fidelity without sacrificing output value fidelity across diverse SUTs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff08DFF\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7XAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u56e0\u679c\u8bc1\u636e\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eDFF\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u786e\u4fdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8bc1\u636e\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u7f3a\u4e4f\u884c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff08DFF\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\uff08XAI\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u9a71\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u53caDFF\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u57282126\u5bf9KITTI-VirtualKITTI2\u5339\u914d\u5bf9\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDFF\u80fd\u591f\u63ed\u793a\u4f20\u7edf\u8f93\u51fa\u503c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14DFF\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u7ea7\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "DFF\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63ed\u793a\u4f20\u7edf\u8f93\u51fa\u503c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7DFF\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u8f93\u51fa\u503c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

This paper proposes a fusion localization method based on ridge estimation, combining the advantages of rich scene information from sequential imagery with the high precision of laser ranging to enhance localization accuracy. Under limited conditions such as long distances, small intersection angles, and large inclination angles, the column vectors of the design matrix have serious multicollinearity when using the least squares estimation algorithm. The multicollinearity will lead to ill-conditioned problems, resulting in significant instability and low robustness.

The key obstacles are the interrelated issues of sensing coverage, sensing reliability, and the dynamic participation of vehicles. To tackle these, we propose QUIDS, a QUality-informed Incentive-driven multi-agent Dispatching System, which ensures high sensing coverage and reliability under budget constraints. QUIDS introduces a novel metric, Aggregated Sensing Quality (ASQ), to quantitatively capture QoI by integrating both coverage and reliability. We also develop a Mutually Assisted Belief-aware Vehicle Dispatching algorithm that estimates sensing reliability and allocates incentives under uncertainty, further improving ASQ. Evaluation using real-world data from a metropolitan NVMCS deployment shows QUIDS improves ASQ by 38% over non-dispatching scenarios and by 10% over state-of-the-art methods. It also reduces reconstruction map errors by 39-74% across algorithms.

In typical deployments, visual data captured at edge devices (clients) is transmitted to the server for VLM inference. However, resizing the original image (global image) to match the vision encoder's input resolution often discards fine-grained details, leading to accuracy degradation. To overcome this limitation, we design a two-stage framework. In the first stage, the server performs inference on the global image and identifies a region of interest (RoI) using the VLM's internal attention. The min-entropy of the output tokens is then computed as a confidence measure to determine whether retransmission is required. If the min-entropy exceeds a predefined threshold, the server requests the edge device to send a detail-preserved local image of the RoI. The server then refines its inference by jointly leveraging the global and local images. This selective retransmission strategy ensures that only essential visual content is transmitted.

Although graphics processors dominate modern artificial-intelligence deployment, most consumer hardware--including laptops, desktops, industrial controllers, and embedded systems--relies on central processing units. Despite this, the computational laws governing central-processing-unit-only inference for local language and vision-language workloads remain largely unexplored. We systematically benchmark large language and vision-language models on two representative central-processing-unit tiers widely used for local inference: a MacBook Pro M2, reflecting mainstream laptop-class deployment, and a Raspberry Pi 5, representing constrained, low-power embedded settings. Using a unified methodology based on continuous sampling of processor and memory usage together with area-under-curve integration, we characterize how computational load scales with input text length for language models and with image resolution for vision-language models. We uncover two empirical scaling laws: (1) computational cost for language-model inference scales approximately linearly with token length; and (2) vision-language models exhibit a preprocessing-driven \"resolution knee\", where compute remains constant above an internal resolution clamp and decreases sharply below it. Beyond these laws, we show that quantum-inspired compression reduces processor and memory usage by up to 71.9% and energy consumption by up to 62%, while preserving or improving semantic accuracy. These results provide a systematic quantification of multimodal central-processing-unit-only scaling for local language and vision-language workloads, and they identify model compression and input-resolution preprocessing as effective, low-cost levers for sustainable edge inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528CPU\u8fdb\u884c\u672c\u5730\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1GPU\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6d88\u8d39\u786c\u4ef6\u4ecd\u4f9d\u8d56CPU\uff0c\u800c\u5173\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528CPU\u8fdb\u884c\u672c\u5730\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u89c4\u5f8b\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u91c7\u6837\u5904\u7406\u5668\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0b\u9762\u79ef\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540cCPU\u5c42\u7ea7\u4e0a\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u6761\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6269\u5c55\u89c4\u5f8b\uff1a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u6807\u8bb0\u957f\u5ea6\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ebf\u6027\u6269\u5c55\uff1b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9884\u5904\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u201c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u62d0\u70b9\u201d\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u542f\u53d1\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u5904\u7406\u5668\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u8fbe71.9%\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe62%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bed\u4e49\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528CPU\u8fdb\u884c\u672c\u5730\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9884\u5904\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u8fb9\u7f18\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u6760\u6746\u3002"}}

However, directly applying LDMs to HDR remains challenging due to: (1) limited dynamic-range representation caused by 8-bit latent compression, (2) high inference cost from multi-step denoising, and (3) content hallucination inherent to generative nature. To address these challenges, we introduce GMODiff, a gain map-driven one-step diffusion framework for multi-exposure HDR reconstruction. Instead of reconstructing full HDR content, we reformulate HDR reconstruction as a conditionally guided Gain Map (GM) estimation task, where the GM encodes the extended dynamic range while retaining the same bit depth as LDR images. We initialize the denoising process from an informative regression-based estimate rather than pure noise, enabling the model to generate high-quality GMs in a single denoising step. Furthermore, recognizing that regression-based models excel in content fidelity while LDMs favor perceptual quality, we leverage regression priors to guide both the denoising process and latent decoding of the LDM, suppressing hallucinations while preserving structural accuracy.

Although such personalization through memory offers clear benefits, it also introduces risks of bias.

However, extending these advances to multi-character settings is non-trivial, especially when position swap is involved. Beyond mere scaling, the core challenge lies in enforcing correct Identity Correspondence (IC) between characters in reference and generated frames. To address this, we introduce EverybodyDance, a systematic solution targeting IC correctness in multi-character animation. EverybodyDance is built around the Identity Matching Graph (IMG), which models characters in the generated and reference frames as two node sets in a weighted complete bipartite graph. Edge weights, computed via our proposed Mask-Query Attention (MQA), quantify the affinity between each pair of characters. Our key insight is to formalize IC correctness as a graph structural metric and to optimize it during training. We also propose a series of targeted strategies tailored for multi-character animation, including identity-embedded guidance, a multi-scale matching strategy, and pre-classified sampling, which work synergistically. Finally, to evaluate IC performance, we curate the Identity Correspondence Evaluation benchmark, dedicated to multi-character IC correctness.

Existing benchmarks like BrowseComp and xBench-DeepSearch emphasize complex reasoning searches requiring multi-hop synthesis but neglect Fuzzy Exploratory Search, namely queries that are vague and multifaceted, where users seek the most relevant webpage rather than a single factual answer. To address this gap, we introduce Needle in the Web, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate modern search agents and LLM-based systems on their ability to retrieve and reason over real-world web content in response to ambiguous, exploratory queries under varying levels of difficulty. Needle in the Web comprises 663 questions spanning seven distinct domains. To ensure high query quality and answer uniqueness, we employ a flexible methodology that reliably generates queries of controllable difficulty based on factual claims of web contents. We benchmark three leading LLMs and three agent-based search systems on Needle in the Web, finding that most models struggle: many achieve below 35% accuracy, and none consistently excel across domains or difficulty levels. These findings reveal that Needle in the Web presents a significant challenge for current search systems and highlights the open problem of effective fuzzy retrieval under semantic ambiguity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Needle in the Web \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u641c\u7d22\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6b64\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u5ffd\u89c6\u6a21\u7cca\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u641c\u7d22\uff08Fuzzy Exploratory Search\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u7528\u6237\u5bfb\u6c42\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7f51\u9875\u800c\u975e\u5355\u4e00\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u63a7\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u9875\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u58f0\u660e\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e35%\uff0c\u4e14\u6ca1\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6216\u96be\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\u6301\u7eed\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "Needle in the Web \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u6a21\u7cca\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u641c\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u65f6\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

In this paper, we argue that many errors, including apparent motion failures, originate from the model's inability to construct a semantically correct or logically consistent initial frame. We introduce Factorized Video Generation (FVG), a pipeline that decouples these tasks by decomposing the Text-to-Video generation into three specialized stages: (1) Reasoning, where a Large Language Model (LLM) rewrites the video prompt to describe only the initial scene, resolving temporal ambiguities; (2) Composition, where a Text-to-Image (T2I) model synthesizes a high-quality, compositionally-correct anchor frame from this new prompt; and (3) Temporal Synthesis, where a video model, finetuned to understand this anchor, focuses its entire capacity on animating the scene and following the prompt. Our decomposed approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the T2V CompBench benchmark and significantly improves all tested models on VBench2. Furthermore, we show that visual anchoring allows us to cut the number of sampling steps by 70% without any loss in performance, leading to a substantial speed-up in sampling.

This paper introduces Prefix Probing, a black-box harmful content detection method that compares the conditional log-probabilities of \"agreement/execution\" versus \"refusal/safety\" opening prefixes and leverages prefix caching to reduce detection overhead to near first-token latency. During inference, the method requires only a single log-probability computation over the probe prefixes to produce a harmfulness score and apply a threshold, without invoking any additional models or multi-stage inference. To further enhance the discriminative power of the prefixes, we design an efficient prefix construction algorithm that automatically discovers highly informative prefixes, substantially improving detection performance.

We are witnessing the rise of a dangerous literacy gap, where a focus on the functional, operational skills of using AI tools is eclipsing the development of critical and ethical reasoning about them. This position paper argues for a systemic shift toward comprehensive AI literacy that centers human agency - the empowered capacity for intentional, critical, and responsible choice. This principle applies to all stakeholders in the educational ecosystem: it is the student's agency to question, create with, or consciously decide not to use AI based on the task; it is the teacher's agency to design learning experiences that align with instructional values, rather than ceding pedagogical control to a tool. True literacy involves teaching about agency itself, framing technology not as an inevitability to be adopted, but as a choice to be made. This requires a deep commitment to critical thinking and a robust understanding of epistemology. Through the AI Literacy, Fluency, and Competency frameworks described in this paper, educators and students will become agents in their own human-centric approaches to AI, providing necessary pathways to clearly articulate the intentions informing decisions and attitudes toward AI and the impact of these decisions on academic work, career, and society.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u547c\u5401\u6559\u80b2\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f6c\u5411\u4ee5\u4eba\u7c7b\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u5168\u9762AI\u7d20\u517b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u8003\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u9009\u62e9\u6743\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u88ab\u52a8\u63a5\u53d7\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6559\u80b2\u6846\u67b6\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9AI\u6280\u672f\u5feb\u901f\u666e\u53ca\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u6280\u80fd\u4e0e\u6279\u5224\u6027\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u601d\u8003\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8131\u8282\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7AI\u7d20\u517b\u3001\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u548c\u80fd\u529b\u6846\u67b6\uff08AI Literacy, Fluency, and Competency frameworks\uff09\u6765\u652f\u6301\u6559\u80b2\u8005\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee5\u4eba\u7c7b\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684AI\u7d20\u517b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6559\u80b2\u8005\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u6001\u5ea6\u8868\u8fbe\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3b\u5f20\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4ee5\u4eba\u7c7b\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u5168\u9762AI\u7d20\u517b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5b66\u751f\u548c\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u9009\u62e9\u6743\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6280\u672f\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u8003\u3002"}}

In the first stage, an adaptive UV sampling strategy converts Breps into graphs representation with geometric and topological information. We then design a hierarchical BrepEncoder to extract features from geometry (i.e., faces and edges) and topology, producing both a single global token and a sequence of node tokens. Then we align the global token with text embeddings from a frozen CLIP text encoder (ViT-L/14) via contrastive learning. In the second stage, we integrate the pretrained BrepEncoder into an LLM. We then align its sequence of node tokens using a three-stage progressive training strategy: (1) training an MLP-based semantic mapping from Brep representation to 2D with 2D-LLM priors. (2) performing fine-tuning of the LLM. (3) designing a Mixture-of-Query Experts (MQE) to enhance geometric diversity modeling.

Existing zero-shot object counting (ZOC) methods that infer exemplars from text either rely on open-vocabulary detectors, which often yield multi-instance candidates, or on random patch sampling, which fails to accurately delineate object instances. To address this, we propose CountZES, a training-free framework for object counting via zero-shot exemplar selection. CountZES progressively discovers diverse exemplars through three synergistic stages: Detection-Anchored Exemplar (DAE), Density-Guided Exemplar (DGE), and Feature-Consensus Exemplar (FCE). DAE refines open-vocabulary detections to isolate precise single-instance exemplars. DGE introduces a density-driven, self-supervised paradigm to identify statistically consistent and semantically compact exemplars, while FCE reinforces visual coherence through feature-space clustering. Together, these stages yield a diverse, complementary exemplar set that balances textual grounding, count consistency, and feature representativeness.

Evaluating Agentic Frameworks for Diagram-Grounded Geometry Problem Solving and Reasoning", "comment": "Accepted to the ARR October 2025 cycle", "summary": "Diagram-grounded geometry problem solving is a critical benchmark for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), yet the benefits of multi-agent design over single-agent remain unclear. We systematically compare single-agent and multi-agent pipelines on four visual math benchmarks: Geometry3K, MathVerse, OlympiadBench, and We-Math. For open-source models, multi-agent consistently improves performance. For example, Qwen-2.5-VL (7B) gains +6.8 points and Qwen-2.5-VL (32B) gains +3.3 on Geometry3K, and both Qwen-2.5-VL variants see further gains on OlympiadBench and We-Math. In contrast, the closed-source Gemini-2.0-Flash generally performs better in single-agent mode on classic benchmarks, while multi-agent yields only modest improvements on the newer We-Math dataset. These findings show that multi-agent pipelines provide clear benefits for open-source models and can assist strong proprietary systems on newer, less familiar benchmarks, but agentic decomposition is not universally optimal.

To that end, we curate, for the first time, 23.7K gaze-primed human motion sequences for reaching target object locations from five publicly available datasets, i.e., HD-EPIC, MoGaze, HOT3D, ADT, and GIMO. We pre-train a text-conditioned diffusion-based motion generation model, then fine-tune it conditioned on goal pose or location, on our curated sequences. Importantly, we evaluate the ability of the generated motion to imitate natural human movement through several metrics, including the 'Reach Success' and a newly introduced 'Prime Success' metric. On the largest dataset, HD-EPIC, our model achieves 60% prime success and 89% reach success when conditioned on the goal object location.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u4eff\u81ea\u7136\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6ce8\u89c6\u542f\u52a8\u548c\u5230\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6a21\u4eff\u81ea\u7136\u884c\u4e3a\u5982\u6ce8\u89c6\u542f\u52a8\u548c\u5230\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u65f6\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u5148\u4ece\u4e94\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7b5b\u9009\u4e8623.7K\u4e2a\u6ce8\u89c6\u542f\u52a8\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6839\u636e\u76ee\u6807\u59ff\u6001\u6216\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728HD-EPIC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u7269\u4f53\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8660%\u7684\u6ce8\u89c6\u542f\u52a8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c89%\u7684\u5230\u8fbe\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u6a21\u4eff\u81ea\u7136\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6ce8\u89c6\u542f\u52a8\u548c\u5230\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

However, the VAR paradigm suffers from sharply increased computational complexity and running time at large-scale steps. Although existing acceleration methods reduce runtime for large-scale steps, but rely on manual step selection and overlook the varying importance of different stages in the generation process. To address this challenge, we present StageVAR, a systematic study and stage-aware acceleration framework for VAR models. Our analysis shows that early steps are critical for preserving semantic and structural consistency and should remain intact, while later steps mainly refine details and can be pruned or approximated for acceleration. Building on these insights, StageVAR introduces a plug-and-play acceleration strategy that exploits semantic irrelevance and low-rank properties in late-stage computations, without requiring additional training. Our proposed StageVAR achieves up to 3.4x speedup with only a 0.01 drop on GenEval and a 0.26 decrease on DPG, consistently outperforming existing acceleration baselines.

To enable proactive pain management, we propose a hybrid machine learning and large language model pipeline that predicts pain episodes within 48 and 72 hours of hospitalization using both structured and unstructured electronic health record data. A retrospective cohort of 266 inpatients was analyzed, with features including demographics, tumor stage, vital signs, and WHO-tiered analgesic use. The machine learning module captured temporal medication trends, while the large language model interpreted ambiguous dosing records and free-text clinical notes.

In this work, we investigate how a model can acquire both human-like and self-consistent reasoning capability for blind image quality assessment (BIQA).

Then, we adopt reinforcement learning, using human annotations as reward signals to guide the model toward human-like perception and reasoning. To enable the model to internalize self-consistent reasoning capability, we design a reward that drives the model to infer the image quality purely from self-generated descriptions. Empirically, our approach achieves score prediction performance comparable to state-of-the-art BIQA systems under general metrics, including Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. In addition to the rating score, we assess human-model alignment using ROUGE-1 to measure the similarity between model-generated and human perception-reasoning chains.

Currently, the field heavily relies on facial expression recognition (FER) because visual channel conveys rich emotional cues. However, facial expressions are often used as social tools rather than manifestations of genuine inner emotions. To understand and bridge this gap between FER and ER, we introduce eye behaviors as an important emotional cue and construct an Eye-behavior-aided Multimodal Emotion Recognition (EMER) dataset. To collect data with genuine emotions, spontaneous emotion induction paradigm is exploited with stimulus material, during which non-invasive eye behavior data, like eye movement sequences and eye fixation maps, is captured together with facial expression videos. To better illustrate the gap between ER and FER, multi-view emotion labels for mutimodal ER and FER are separately annotated. Furthermore, based on the new dataset, we design a simple yet effective Eye-behavior-aided MER Transformer (EMERT) that enhances ER by bridging the emotion gap. EMERT leverages modality-adversarial feature decoupling and a multitask Transformer to model eye behaviors as a strong complement to facial expressions. In the experiment, we introduce seven multimodal benchmark protocols for a variety of comprehensive evaluations of the EMER dataset. The results show that the EMERT outperforms other state-of-the-art multimodal methods by a great margin, revealing the importance of modeling eye behaviors for robust ER. To sum up, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the importance of eye behaviors in ER, advancing the study on addressing the gap between FER and ER for more robust ER performance.

Existing compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning, often degrade critical linguistic properties and lack formal guarantees for preserving model behavior. We propose Temporal Logic-Guided Large Language Model Compression (TOGGLE), a novel framework that leverages Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to formally specify and enforce linguistic properties during compression. TOGGLE employs an STL robustness-guided Bayesian optimization to systematically explore layer-wise quantization and pruning configurations, generating compressed models that formally satisfy specified linguistic constraints without retraining or fine-tuning. Evaluating TOGGLE on four LLM architectures (GPT-2, DeepSeek-V2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B, and Mistral 7B), we achieve up to 3.3x reduction in computational costs (FLOPs) and up to a 68.8% reduction in model size while satisfying all linguistic properties.

Conventional detectors such as YOLO are optimised for standard image sizes (for example, 640x640 pixels) and often struggle with the computational demands of 4K or higher-resolution imagery typical of 360-degree vision. To address these limitations, we introduce YOLO11-4K, an efficient real-time detection framework tailored for 4K panoramic images. The architecture incorporates a novel multi-scale detection head with a P2 layer to improve sensitivity to small objects often missed at coarser scales, and a GhostConv-based backbone to reduce computational complexity without sacrificing representational power. To enable evaluation, we manually annotated the CVIP360 dataset, generating 6,876 frame-level bounding boxes and producing a publicly available, detection-ready benchmark for 4K panoramic scenes. YOLO11-4K achieves 0.95 mAP at 0.50 IoU with 28.3 milliseconds inference per frame, representing a 75 percent latency reduction compared to YOLO11 (112.3 milliseconds), while also improving accuracy (mAP at 0.50 of 0.95 versus 0.908). This balance of efficiency and precision enables robust object detection in expansive 360-degree environments, making the framework suitable for real-world high-resolution panoramic applications.

Here we argue that this patchwork AGI hypothesis needs to be given serious consideration, and should inform the development of corresponding safeguards and mitigations. The rapid deployment of advanced AI agents with tool-use capabilities and the ability to communicate and coordinate makes this an urgent safety consideration. We therefore propose a framework for distributional AGI safety that moves beyond evaluating and aligning individual agents.

The 2D component of the final 3D human pose benefits from the detected 2D poses, whereas its depth counterpart must be estimated from scratch. The lifting-based methods encode the detected 2D pose and unknown depth in an entangled feature space, explicitly introducing depth uncertainty to the detected 2D pose, thereby limiting overall estimation accuracy. This work reveals that the depth representation is pivotal for the estimation process. Specifically, when depth is in an initial, completely unknown state, jointly encoding depth features with 2D pose features is detrimental to the estimation process. In contrast, when depth is initially refined to a more dependable state via network-based estimation, encoding it together with 2D pose information is beneficial. To address this limitation, we present a Mixture-of-Experts network for monocular 3D pose estimation named PoseMoE. Our approach introduces: (1) A mixture-of-experts network where specialized expert modules refine the well-detected 2D pose features and learn the depth features. This mixture-of-experts design disentangles the feature encoding process for 2D pose and depth, therefore reducing the explicit influence of uncertain depth features on 2D pose features. (2) A cross-expert knowledge aggregation module is proposed to aggregate cross-expert spatio-temporal contextual information. This step enhances features through bidirectional mapping between 2D pose and depth.

Existing responsible AI and governance efforts provide important normative principles but often lack enforceable engineering mechanisms that operate throughout the system lifecycle. This paper introduces the Social Responsibility Stack (SRS), a six-layer architectural framework that embeds societal values into AI systems as explicit constraints, safeguards, behavioural interfaces, auditing mechanisms, and governance processes. SRS models responsibility as a closed-loop supervisory control problem over socio-technical systems, integrating design-time safeguards with runtime monitoring and institutional oversight. We develop a unified constraint-based formulation, introduce safety-envelope and feedback interpretations, and show how fairness, autonomy, cognitive burden, and explanation quality can be continuously monitored and enforced. Case studies in clinical decision support, cooperative autonomous vehicles, and public-sector systems illustrate how SRS translates normative objectives into actionable engineering and operational controls.

However, existing grounding benchmarks suffer from significant limitations: they either provide insufficient data volume and narrow domain coverage, or focus excessively on a single platform and require highly specialized domain knowledge. In this work, we present VenusBench-GD, a comprehensive, bilingual benchmark for GUI grounding that spans multiple platforms, enabling hierarchical evaluation for real-word applications. VenusBench-GD contributes as follows: (i) we introduce a large-scale, cross-platform benchmark with extensive coverage of applications, diverse UI elements, and rich annotated data, (ii) we establish a high-quality data construction pipeline for grounding tasks, achieving higher annotation accuracy than existing benchmarks, and (iii) we extend the scope of element grounding by proposing a hierarchical task taxonomy that divides grounding into basic and advanced categories, encompassing six distinct subtasks designed to evaluate models from complementary perspectives. Our experimental findings reveal critical insights: general-purpose multimodal models now match or even surpass specialized GUI models on basic grounding tasks. In contrast, advanced tasks, still favor GUI-specialized models, though they exhibit significant overfitting and poor robustness.

In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Reasoner, an on-policy joint training framework designed to enhance reasoning by co-evolving an LLM reasoner and an LLM-based discriminator through adversarial reinforcement learning. A compute-efficient review schedule partitions each reasoning chain into logically complete slices of comparable length, and the discriminator evaluates each slice's soundness with concise, structured justifications. Learning couples complementary signals: the LLM reasoner is rewarded for logically consistent steps that yield correct answers, while the discriminator earns rewards for correctly detecting errors or distinguishing traces in the reasoning process. This produces dense, well-calibrated, on-policy step-level rewards that supplement sparse exact-match signals, improving credit assignment, increasing sample efficiency, and enhancing overall reasoning quality of LLMs. Across various mathematical benchmarks, the method delivers consistent gains over strong baselines with standard RL post-training. Specifically, on AIME24, we improve DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from 54.0 to 61.3 (+7.3) and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B from 43.7 to 53.7 (+10.0).

However, learning effective representations for skeleton-based temporal action localization remains challenging and underexplored. Unlike video-level {action} recognition, detecting action boundaries requires temporally sensitive features that capture subtle differences between adjacent frames where labels change. To this end, we formulate a snippet discrimination pretext task for self-supervised pretraining, which densely projects skeleton sequences into non-overlapping segments and promotes features that distinguish them across videos via contrastive learning.

Instead of relying on costly pixel-level annotations, the proposed method utilizes image-level labels to generate clinically meaningful heatmaps that highlight pneumonia-affected regions. Furthermore, we evaluate seven pre-trained deep learning models, including a Vision Transformer, under identical training conditions, using focal loss and patient-wise splits to prevent data leakage. Experimental results suggest that all models achieved high classification accuracy (96--98\\%), with ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0 showing the best overall performance and MobileNet-V3 providing an efficient lightweight alternative.

Previous training-time defenses rely on adversarial fine-tuning, which requires labeled data and costly retraining, while existing test-time strategies fail to reliably distinguish between clean and adversarial inputs, thereby preventing both adversarial robustness and clean accuracy from reaching their optimum. To address these limitations, we propose Test-Time Padding (TTP), a lightweight defense framework that performs adversarial detection followed by targeted adaptation at inference. TTP identifies adversarial inputs via the cosine similarity shift between CLIP feature embeddings computed before and after spatial padding, yielding a universal threshold for reliable detection across architectures and datasets. For detected adversarial cases, TTP employs trainable padding to restore disrupted attention patterns, coupled with a similarity-aware ensemble strategy for a more robust final prediction. For clean inputs, TTP leaves them unchanged by default or optionally integrates existing test-time adaptation techniques for further accuracy gains. Comprehensive experiments on diverse CLIP backbones and fine-grained benchmarks show that TTP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art test-time defenses, delivering substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without compromising clean accuracy.

In other words, we reconstruct not only the the currently visible parts of the scene, but also all previously viewed parts, which enables replaying the complete reconstruction across all timesteps.\n  Our method decomposes the scene into a set of rigid 3D primitives, which are assumed to be moving throughout the scene. Using estimated dense 2D correspondences, we jointly infer the rigid motion of these primitives through an optimisation pipeline, yielding a 4D reconstruction of the scene, i.e. providing 3D geometry dynamically moving through time. To achieve this, we also introduce a mechanism to extrapolate motion for objects that become invisible, employing motion-grouping techniques to maintain continuity.\n  The resulting system enables 4D spatio-temporal awareness, offering capabilities such as replayable 3D reconstructions of articulated objects through time, multi-object scanning, and object permanence.

Most existing works either train lightweight adapters or refine intermediate features to achieve better generalization on unseen domains. However, they both overlook the fact that long-term pre-trained VFMs often exhibit artifacts, which hinder the utilization of valuable representations and ultimately degrade DGSS performance. Inspired by causal mechanisms, we observe that these artifacts are associated with non-causal factors, which usually reside in the low- and high-frequency components of the VFM spectrum. In this paper, we explicitly examine the causal and non-causal factors of features within VFMs for DGSS, and propose a simple yet effective method to identify and disentangle them, enabling more robust domain generalization. Specifically, we propose Causal-Tune, a novel fine-tuning strategy designed to extract causal factors and suppress non-causal ones from the features of VFMs. First, we extract the frequency spectrum of features from each layer using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). A Gaussian band-pass filter is then applied to separate the spectrum into causal and non-causal components. To further refine the causal components, we introduce a set of causal-aware learnable tokens that operate in the frequency domain, while the non-causal components are discarded. Finally, refined features are transformed back into the spatial domain via inverse DCT and passed to the next layer. Extensive experiments conducted on various cross-domain tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of Causal-Tune. In particular, our method achieves superior performance under adverse weather conditions, improving +4.8% mIoU over the baseline in snow conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Causal-Tune\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bbVFMs\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4e0e\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u63d0\u5347DGSS\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u96ea\u5929\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0bmIoU\u63d0\u53474.8%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VFMs\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u9891\u8c31\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u4f4e\u9891\u6210\u5206\uff09\u5bf9DGSS\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCausal-Tune\uff0c\u5229\u7528DCT\u548cGaussian\u5e26\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u5206\u79bb\u7279\u5f81\u9891\u8c31\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4e0e\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee4\u724c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u96ea\u5929\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0bmIoU\u63d0\u53474.8%\u3002", "conclusion": "Causal-Tune\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5206\u79bbVFMs\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4e0e\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86DGSS\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

Unlike current works that take predefined external toolkits or generate images during thinking, however, humans can form flexible visual-text imagination and interactions during thinking without predefined toolkits, where one important reason is that humans construct the visual-text thinking process in a unified space inside the brain. Inspired by this capability, given that current MLLMs already encode visual and text information in the same feature space, we hold that visual tokens can be seamlessly inserted into the reasoning process carried by text tokens, where ideally, all visual imagination processes can be encoded by the latent features. To achieve this goal, we propose Sketch-in-Latents (SkiLa), a novel paradigm for unified multi-modal reasoning that expands the auto-regressive capabilities of MLLMs to natively generate continuous visual embeddings, termed latent sketch tokens, as visual thoughts. During multi-step reasoning, the model dynamically alternates between textual thinking mode for generating textual think tokens and visual sketching mode for generating latent sketch tokens. A latent visual semantics reconstruction mechanism is proposed to ensure these latent sketch tokens are semantically grounded.

Recent Top-K sparse attention approaches reduce the computation of DiTs by compressing tokens into block-wise representation and selecting a small set of relevant key blocks, but still suffer from (i) quadratic selection cost on compressed tokens and (ii) increasing K required to maintain model quality as sequences grow. We identify that their inefficiency is due to the single-level design, as a single coarse level is insufficient to represent the global structure. In this paper, we introduce Log-linear Sparse Attention (LLSA), a trainable sparse attention mechanism for extremely long token sequences that reduces both selection and attention costs from quadratic to log-linear complexity by utilizing a hierarchical structure. LLSA performs hierarchical Top-K selection, progressively adopting sparse Top-K selection with the indices found at the previous level, and introduces a Hierarchical KV Enrichment mechanism that preserves global context while using fewer tokens of different granularity during attention computation. To support efficient training, we develop a high-performance GPU implementation that uses only sparse indices for both the forward and backward passes, eliminating the need for dense attention masks. We evaluate LLSA on high-resolution pixel-space image generation without using patchification and VAE encoding. LLSA accelerates attention inference by 28.27x and DiT training by 6.09x on 256x256 pixel token sequences, while maintaining generation quality. The results demonstrate that LLSA offers a promising direction for training long-sequence DiTs efficiently.

One such application, indoor multimedia geolocation, has the potential to become a crucial aid for law enforcement in the fight against human trafficking, child exploitation, and other serious crimes. While outdoor multimedia geolocation has been widely explored, its indoor counterpart remains underdeveloped due to challenges such as similar room layouts, frequent renovations, visual ambiguity, indoor lighting variability, unreliable GPS signals, and limited datasets in sensitive domains. This paper introduces a pipeline that uses electric sockets as consistent indoor markers for geolocation, since plug socket types are standardised by country or region. The three-stage deep learning pipeline detects plug sockets (YOLOv11, mAP@0.5 = 0.843), classifies them into one of 12 plug socket types (Xception, accuracy = 0.912), and maps the detected socket types to countries (accuracy = 0.96 at >90% threshold confidence). To address data scarcity, two dedicated datasets were created: socket detection dataset of 2,328 annotated images expanded to 4,072 through augmentation, and a classification dataset of 3,187 images across 12 plug socket classes. The pipeline was evaluated on the Hotels-50K dataset, focusing on the TraffickCam subset of crowd-sourced hotel images, which capture real-world conditions such as poor lighting and amateur angles. This dataset provides a more realistic evaluation than using professional, well-lit, often wide-angle images from travel websites.

However, the same power raises serious privacy concerns: personal images can be easily manipulated for identity impersonation, misinformation, or other malicious uses, all without the owner's consent. While prior work has explored input perturbations to protect against misuse in personalized text-to-image generation, the robustness of modern, large-scale in-context DiT-based models remains largely unexamined. In this paper, we propose DeContext, a new method to safeguard input images from unauthorized in-context editing. Our key insight is that contextual information from the source image propagates to the output primarily through multimodal attention layers. By injecting small, targeted perturbations that weaken these cross-attention pathways, DeContext breaks this flow, effectively decouples the link between input and output. This simple defense is both efficient and robust.

However, existing SAR-oriented deep learning is constrained by data scarcity, while the physically grounded speckle noise in SAR imagery further hampers fine-grained semantic representation learning. To address these challenges, we propose SARMAE, a Noise-Aware Masked Autoencoder for self-supervised SAR representation learning. Specifically, we construct SAR-1M, the first million-scale SAR dataset, with additional paired optical images, to enable large-scale pre-training. Building upon this, we design Speckle-Aware Representation Enhancement (SARE), which injects SAR-specific speckle noise into masked autoencoders to facilitate noise-aware and robust representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic Anchor Representation Constraint (SARC), which leverages paired optical priors to align SAR features and ensure semantic consistency.

Recent works inject semantics from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) either externally via representation alignment or internally by jointly modeling only a narrow slice of VFM features inside the diffusion process, under-utilizing the rich, nonlinear, multi-layer spatial semantics available. We introduce REGLUE (Representation Entanglement with Global-Local Unified Encoding), a unified latent diffusion framework that jointly models (i) VAE image latents, (ii) compact local (patch-level) VFM semantics, and (iii) a global (image-level) [CLS] token within a single SiT backbone. A lightweight convolutional semantic compressor nonlinearly aggregates multi-layer VFM features into a low-dimensional, spatially structured representation, which is entangled with the VAE latents in the diffusion process. An external alignment loss further regularizes internal representations toward frozen VFM targets. On ImageNet 256x256, REGLUE consistently improves FID and accelerates convergence over SiT-B/2 and SiT-XL/2 baselines, as well as over REPA, ReDi, and REG. Extensive experiments show that (a) spatial VFM semantics are crucial, (b) non-linear compression is key to unlocking their full benefit, and (c) global tokens and external alignment act as complementary, lightweight enhancements within our global-local-latent joint modeling framework.

Our experiments show that models trained on a large set of generators exhibit partial transferability to inpainting-based edits and can reliably detect medium- and large-area manipulations or regeneration-style inpainting, outperforming many existing ad hoc detection approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u4fee\u590d\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5927\u9762\u79ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u65f6\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e34\u65f6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210AI\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u4f7f\u5f97\u9ad8\u5ea6\u903c\u771f\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u64cd\u4f5c\uff08\u5982\u4fee\u590d\u548c\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u7f16\u8f91\uff09\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u88ab\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u5229\u7528\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5b8c\u5168\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u539f\u672c\u7528\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u4fee\u590d\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3001\u63a9\u7801\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u5177\u6709\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7b49\u548c\u5927\u9762\u79ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6216\u518d\u751f\u5f0f\u4fee\u590d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u4fee\u590d\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7b49\u548c\u5927\u9762\u79ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6216\u518d\u751f\u5f0f\u4fee\u590d\u65f6\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u4e34\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Manual landmarking is time-consuming, operator-dependent, and sensitive to variability across scanners and sites, limiting the reproducibility of automated approaches. There is a need for multi-source annotated datasets to develop artificial intelligence-assisted fetal growth assessment methods. To address this bottleneck, we present an open, multi-centre, multi-device benchmark dataset of fetal US images with expert anatomical landmark annotations for clinically used fetal biometric measurements. These measurements include head bi-parietal and occipito-frontal diameters, abdominal transverse and antero-posterior diameters, and femoral length. The dataset contains 4,513 de-identified US images from 1,904 subjects acquired at three clinical sites using seven different US devices. We provide standardised, subject-disjoint train/test splits, evaluation code, and baseline results to enable fair and reproducible comparison of methods. Using an automatic biometry model, we quantify domain shift and demonstrate that training and evaluation confined to a single centre substantially overestimate performance relative to multi-centre testing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available multi-centre, multi-device, landmark-annotated dataset that covers all primary fetal biometry measures, providing a robust benchmark for domain adaptation and multi-centre generalisation in fetal biometry and enabling more reliable AI-assisted fetal growth assessment across centres.

Micro gestures involve subtle motion patterns, which make constructing datasets with precise skeletons and frame-level annotations difficult. To this end, we develop a multi-view self-supervised pipeline to automatically generate skeleton data, complemented by heuristic rules and expert refinement for semi-automatic annotation. Based on this pipeline, we introduce OMG-Bench, the first large-scale public benchmark for skeleton-based online micro gesture recognition. It features 40 fine-grained gesture classes with 13,948 instances across 1,272 sequences, characterized by subtle motions, rapid dynamics, and continuous execution. To tackle these challenges, we propose Hierarchical Memory-Augmented Transformer (HMATr), an end-to-end framework that unifies gesture detection and classification by leveraging hierarchical memory banks which store frame-level details and window-level semantics to preserve historical context. In addition, it employs learnable position-aware queries initialized from the memory to implicitly encode gesture positions and semantics. Experiments show that HMATr outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.6\\% in detection rate, establishing a strong baseline for online micro gesture recognition.

Built upon the powerful DiT-based generative foundation model, we systematically evaluate different control schemes, showing that a text-image-mask joint attention scheme combined with full fine-tuning of the image and mask branches significantly enhances the effectiveness of RS semantic segmentation data synthesis, particularly in few-shot and complex-scene scenarios.

However, existing methods like auto-rigging and pose-conditioned generation often struggle with challenges such as inaccurate skinning weight prediction, topological imperfections, and poor pose conformance, limiting their robustness and generalizability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Make-It-Poseable, a novel feed-forward framework that reformulates character posing as a latent-space transformation problem. Instead of deforming mesh vertices as in traditional pipelines, our method reconstructs the character in new poses by directly manipulating its latent representation. At the core of our method is a latent posing transformer that manipulates shape tokens based on skeletal motion. This process is facilitated by a dense pose representation for precise control. To ensure high-fidelity geometry and accommodate topological changes, we also introduce a latent-space supervision strategy and an adaptive completion module. Our method demonstrates superior performance in posing quality. It also naturally extends to 3D editing applications like part replacement and refinement.", "AI": {"tldr": "Make-It-Poseable \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u524d\u9988\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u6362\u89e3\u51b33D\u89d2\u8272\u59ff\u52bf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u652f\u63013D\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76843D\u89d2\u8272\u59ff\u52bf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u52a8\u7ed1\u5b9a\u548c\u59ff\u52bf\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u6743\u91cd\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u62d3\u6251\u7f3a\u9677\u548c\u59ff\u52bf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u59ff\u52bf\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u76f4\u63a5\u64cd\u4f5c\u5f62\u72b6\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5bc6\u96c6\u59ff\u52bf\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u76d1\u7763\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8865\u5168\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u53d8\u5316\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "result": "Make-It-Poseable \u5728\u59ff\u52bf\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u7136\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u90e8\u4ef6\u66ff\u6362\u548c\u7ec6\u5316\u7b493D\u7f16\u8f91\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "Make-It-Poseable \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u524d\u9988\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u89d2\u8272\u59ff\u52bf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u6362\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u89d2\u8272\u59ff\u52bf\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u4e863D\u7f16\u8f91\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

In contrast to the curved stochastic transport paths induced by diffusion, FlowDet learns simpler and straighter paths resulting in faster scaling of detection performance as the number of inference steps grows. We find that this reformulation enables us to outperform diffusion based detection systems (as well as non-generative baselines) across a wide range of experiments, including various precision/recall operating points using multiple feature backbones and datasets. In particular, when evaluating under recall-constrained settings, we can highlight the effects of the generative transport without over-compensating with large numbers of proposals.

However, it is challenging to reconstruct realistic and diverse full-body poses based on sparse signals obtained by head-mounted displays, which are the main devices in AR/VR scenarios. Existing methods for pose reconstruction often incur high computational costs or rely on separately modeling spatial and temporal dependencies, making it difficult to balance accuracy, temporal coherence, and efficiency. To address this problem, we propose KineST, a novel kinematics-guided state space model, which effectively extracts spatiotemporal dependencies while integrating local and global pose perception. The innovation comes from two core ideas. Firstly, in order to better capture intricate joint relationships, the scanning strategy within the State Space Duality framework is reformulated into kinematics-guided bidirectional scanning, which embeds kinematic priors. Secondly, a mixed spatiotemporal representation learning approach is employed to tightly couple spatial and temporal contexts, balancing accuracy and smoothness. Additionally, a geometric angular velocity loss is introduced to impose physically meaningful constraints on rotational variations for further improving motion stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KineST has superior performance in both accuracy and temporal consistency within a lightweight framework.

Traditional models often employ random queries as anchors, optimizing them successively. Recent advancements complement or replace these random queries with detections from auxiliary networks. We propose a more intuitive and efficient approach by using BEV feature cells directly as anchors. This end-to-end approach leverages the dense grid of BEV queries, considering each cell as a potential object for the final detection task. As a result, we introduce a novel two-stage anchor generation method specifically designed for multi-camera 3D object detection. To address the scaling issues of attention with a large number of queries, we apply BEV-based Non-Maximum Suppression, allowing gradients to flow only through non-suppressed objects. This ensures efficient training without the need for post-processing. By using BEV features from encoders such as BEVFormer directly as object queries, temporal BEV information is inherently embedded. Building on the temporal BEV information already embedded in our object queries, we introduce a hybrid temporal modeling approach by integrating prior detections to further enhance detection performance. Evaluating our method on the nuScenes dataset shows consistent and significant improvements in NDS and mAP over the baseline, even with sparser BEV grids and therefore fewer initial anchors. It is particularly effective for small objects, enhancing pedestrian detection with a 3.8% mAP increase on nuScenes and an 8% increase in LET-mAP on Waymo. Applying our method, named DenseBEV, to the challenging Waymo Open dataset yields state-of-the-art performance, achieving a LET-mAP of 60.7%, surpassing the previous best by 5.4%.

Two distinct datasets were employed for training and evaluation, yielding notable findings. The YOLOv8 Nano variant demonstrated a precision of 0.964 and mAP50 of 0.918 on the LPR task, while the YOLOv8 Small variant exhibited a precision of 0.92 and mAP50 of 0.91 on the Character Recognition task. A custom method for character sequencing was introduced, effectively sequencing the detected characters based on their x-axis positions.

However, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems - such as Multimodal AI for Radiology Applications (MAIRA-2) and Medical Pathways Language Model-Multimodal (MedPaLM-M) - depend on large-scale multimodal training, clinical metadata, and multiple imaging views, making them resource-intensive and inaccessible for most settings. We introduce a compact image-to-text architecture that generates the Findings section of chest X-ray reports from a single frontal image. The model combines a frozen Self-Distillation with No Labels v3 (DINOv3) Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder with a Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) decoder enhanced by layer-wise anatomical attention. This mechanism integrates lung and heart segmentation masks through hierarchical Gaussian smoothing, biasing attention toward clinically relevant regions without adding trainable parameters. Evaluated on the official Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-Chest X-ray (MIMIC-CXR) dataset using Chest Radiograph Expert (CheXpert) and Radiology Graph (RadGraph) metrics, our approach achieved substantial gains: CheXpert Macro-F1 for five key pathologies increased by 168% (0.083 -> 0.238) and Micro-F1 by 146% (0.137 -> 0.337), while broader performance across 14 observations improved by 86% (0.170 -> 0.316). Structural coherence also improved, with RadGraph F1 rising by 9.7%. Despite its small size and purely image-conditioned design, the model demonstrates that decoder-level anatomical guidance improves spatial grounding and enhances coherence in clinically relevant regions.

We argue that satisfying these constraints can lead to benchmark drift over time, where the static benchmark judges fail to keep up with newer model capabilities. We show that benchmark drift is a significant problem for GenEval, one of the most popular T2I benchmarks. Although GenEval was well-aligned with human judgment at the time of its release, it has drifted far from human judgment over time -- resulting in an absolute error of as much as 17.7% for current models. This level of drift strongly suggests that GenEval has been saturated for some time, as we verify via a large-scale human study. To help fill this benchmarking gap, we introduce a new benchmark, GenEval 2, with improved coverage of primitive visual concepts and higher degrees of compositionality, which we show is more challenging for current models. We also introduce Soft-TIFA, an evaluation method for GenEval 2 that combines judgments for visual primitives, which we show is more well-aligned with human judgment and argue is less likely to drift from human-alignment over time (as compared to more holistic judges such as VQAScore). Although we hope GenEval 2 will provide a strong benchmark for many years, avoiding benchmark drift is far from guaranteed and our work, more generally, highlights the importance of continual audits and improvement for T2I and related automated model evaluation benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper identifies benchmark drift in T2I evaluation, introduces GenEval 2 and Soft-TIFA as improved solutions, and stresses the need for ongoing benchmark audits.", "motivation": "To address the problem of benchmark drift in T2I model evaluation, where static benchmarks fail to keep up with evolving model capabilities.", "method": "The authors propose GenEval 2, a new benchmark with improved coverage of visual concepts and compositionality, and Soft-TIFA, an evaluation method combining judgments for visual primitives.", "result": "GenEval 2 and Soft-TIFA are shown to be more challenging for current models and better aligned with human judgment, reducing drift.", "conclusion": "The paper highlights the issue of benchmark drift in T2I model evaluation and introduces GenEval 2 with Soft-TIFA as a more robust and human-aligned benchmark, emphasizing the need for continual audits."}}

The planner decomposes instructions via step-by-step reasoning and explicitly grounds them to target regions; the editor then applies changes using a training-free attention-region injection mechanism, enabling precise, parallel multi-region edits without iterative inpainting. To strengthen planning, we apply GRPO-based reinforcement learning using 1K instruction-only examples, yielding substantial gains in reasoning fidelity and format reliability.

However, training state-of-the-art models remains notoriously difficult, with current approaches often struggling to balance robustness against true imperceptibility. This work introduces Pixel Seal, which sets a new state-of-the-art for image and video watermarking. We first identify three fundamental issues of existing methods: (i) the reliance on proxy perceptual losses such as MSE and LPIPS that fail to mimic human perception and result in visible watermark artifacts; (ii) the optimization instability caused by conflicting objectives, which necessitates exhaustive hyperparameter tuning; and (iii) reduced robustness and imperceptibility of watermarks when scaling models to high-resolution images and videos. To overcome these issues, we first propose an adversarial-only training paradigm that eliminates unreliable pixel-wise imperceptibility losses. Second, we introduce a three-stage training schedule that stabilizes convergence by decoupling robustness and imperceptibility.

We thoroughly evaluate the robustness and imperceptibility of Pixel Seal on different image types and across a wide range of transformations, and show clear improvements over the state-of-the-art.

While SAM3 provides a powerful spatio-temporal framework for video object segmentation, its performance in surgical scenes is limited by indiscriminate memory updates, fixed memory capacity, and weak identity recovery after occlusions. We propose ReMeDI-SAM3, a training-free memory-enhanced extension of SAM3, that addresses these limitations through three components: (i) relevance-aware memory filtering with a dedicated occlusion-aware memory for storing pre-occlusion frames, (ii) a piecewise interpolation scheme that expands the effective memory capacity, and (iii) a feature-based re-identification module with temporal voting for reliable post-occlusion identity disambiguation. Together, these components mitigate error accumulation and enable reliable recovery after occlusions. Evaluations on EndoVis17 and EndoVis18 under a zero-shot setting show absolute mcIoU improvements of around 7% and 16%, respectively, over vanilla SAM3, outperforming even prior training-based approaches.

However, deploying VLLMs for downstream tasks such as video recommendation remains challenging, since real systems require multi-video inputs, lightweight backbones, low-latency sequential inference, and rapid response. In practice, (1) decode-only generation yields high latency for sequential inference, (2) typical interfaces do not support multi-video inputs, and (3) constraining outputs to language discards fine-grained visual details that matter for downstream vision tasks. We argue that these limitations stem from the absence of a representation that preserves pixel-level detail while leveraging world knowledge. We present LinkedOut, a representation that extracts VLLM world knowledge directly from video to enable fast inference, supports multi-video histories, and removes the language bottleneck. LinkedOut extracts semantically grounded, knowledge-aware tokens from raw frames using VLLMs, guided by promptable queries and optional auxiliary modalities. We introduce a cross-layer knowledge fusion MoE that selects the appropriate level of abstraction from the rich VLLM features, enabling personalized, interpretable, and low-latency recommendation. To our knowledge, LinkedOut is the first VLLM-based video recommendation method that operates on raw frames without handcrafted labels, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks.

However, these 2D methods often compromise 3D consistency and speed, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios, such as digital twins or telepresence. In contrast, 3D-aware facial animation feedforward methods -- built upon explicit 3D representations, such as neural radiance fields or Gaussian splatting -- ensure 3D consistency and achieve faster inference speed, but come with inferior expression details. In this paper, we aim to combine their strengths by distilling knowledge from a 2D diffusion-based method into a feed-forward encoder, which instantly converts an in-the-wild single image into a 3D-consistent, fast yet expressive animatable representation. Our animation representation is decoupled from the face's 3D representation and learns motion implicitly from data, eliminating the dependency on pre-defined parametric models that often constrain animation capabilities. Unlike previous computationally intensive global fusion mechanisms (e.g., multiple attention layers) for fusing 3D structural and animation information, our design employs an efficient lightweight local fusion strategy to achieve high animation expressivity. As a result, our method runs at 107.31 FPS for animation and pose control while achieving comparable animation quality to the state-of-the-art, surpassing alternative designs that trade speed for quality or vice versa.

We study the design space of data, architecture, and control, and introduce \\emph{EasyV2V}, a simple and effective framework for instruction-based video editing. On the data side, we compose existing experts with fast inverses to build diverse video pairs, lift image edit pairs into videos via single-frame supervision and pseudo pairs with shared affine motion, mine dense-captioned clips for video pairs, and add transition supervision to teach how edits unfold. On the model side, we observe that pretrained text-to-video models possess editing capability, motivating a simplified design. Simple sequence concatenation for conditioning with light LoRA fine-tuning suffices to train a strong model. For control, we unify spatiotemporal control via a single mask mechanism and support optional reference images. Overall, EasyV2V works with flexible inputs, e.g., video+text, video+mask+text, video+mask+reference+text, and achieves state-of-the-art video editing results, surpassing concurrent and commercial systems.

This paper presents FlashPortrait, an end-to-end video diffusion transformer capable of synthesizing ID-preserving, infinite-length videos while achieving up to 6x acceleration in inference speed. In particular, FlashPortrait begins by computing the identity-agnostic facial expression features with an off-the-shelf extractor. It then introduces a Normalized Facial Expression Block to align facial features with diffusion latents by normalizing them with their respective means and variances, thereby improving identity stability in facial modeling. During inference, FlashPortrait adopts a dynamic sliding-window scheme with weighted blending in overlapping areas, ensuring smooth transitions and ID consistency in long animations. In each context window, based on the latent variation rate at particular timesteps and the derivative magnitude ratio among diffusion layers, FlashPortrait utilizes higher-order latent derivatives at the current timestep to directly predict latents at future timesteps, thereby skipping several denoising steps and achieving 6x speed acceleration. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of FlashPortrait both qualitatively and quantitatively.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlashPortrait\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u9762\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u957f\u8096\u50cf\u52a8\u753b\u751f\u6210\u548c6\u500d\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u957f\u8096\u50cf\u52a8\u753b\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "FlashPortrait\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u73b0\u6210\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u8eab\u4efd\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u5757\u5c06\u9762\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u52a0\u6743\u6df7\u5408\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u957f\u52a8\u753b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u5316\u7387\u548c\u6269\u6563\u5c42\u95f4\u7684\u5bfc\u6570\u5e45\u5ea6\u6bd4\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u9636\u6f5c\u5728\u5bfc\u6570\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8df3\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2a\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFlashPortrait\u5728\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u957f\u52a8\u753b\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe6\u500d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "FlashPortrait\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u957f\u8096\u50cf\u52a8\u753b\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe6\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002"}}

To address this, we introduce AuditDM, an automated framework that actively discovers and rectifies MLLM failure modes by auditing their divergence. AuditDM fine-tunes an MLLM as an auditor via reinforcement learning to generate challenging questions and counterfactual images that maximize disagreement among target models. Once trained, the auditor uncovers diverse, interpretable exemplars that reveal model weaknesses and serve as annotation-free data for rectification. When applied to SoTA models like Gemma-3 and PaliGemma-2, AuditDM discovers more than 20 distinct failure types. Fine-tuning on these discoveries consistently improves all models across 16 benchmarks, and enables a 3B model to surpass its 28B counterpart.

However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality of training data. Web-crawled and synthetic image datasets often contain low-quality or redundant samples, which lead to degraded visual fidelity, unstable training, and inefficient computation. Hence, effective data selection is crucial for improving data efficiency. Existing approaches rely on costly manual curation or heuristic scoring based on single-dimensional features in Text-to-Image data filtering. Although meta-learning based method has been explored in LLM, there is no adaptation for image modalities. To this end, we propose **Alchemist**, a meta-gradient-based framework to select a suitable subset from large-scale text-image data pairs. Our approach automatically learns to assess the influence of each sample by iteratively optimizing the model from a data-centric perspective. Alchemist consists of two key stages: data rating and data pruning. We train a lightweight rater to estimate each sample's influence based on gradient information, enhanced with multi-granularity perception. We then use the Shift-Gsampling strategy to select informative subsets for efficient model training. Alchemist is the first automatic, scalable, meta-gradient-based data selection framework for Text-to-Image model training. Experiments on both synthetic and web-crawled datasets demonstrate that Alchemist consistently improves visual quality and downstream performance.

However, existing diffusion-based approaches are often trained on paired data of simple editing operations, which fundamentally limits their ability to generalize to diverse and complex, real-world instructions. To address this generalization gap, we propose VIVA, a scalable framework for instruction-based video editing that leverages VLM-guided encoding and reward optimization. First, we introduce a VLM-based instructor that encodes the textual instruction, the first frame of the source video, and an optional reference image into visually-grounded instruction representations, providing fine-grained spatial and semantic context for the diffusion transformer backbone. Second, we propose a post-training stage, Edit-GRPO, which adapts Group Relative Policy Optimization to the domain of video editing, directly optimizing the model for instruction-faithful, content-preserving, and aesthetically pleasing edits using relative rewards. Furthermore, we propose a data construction pipeline designed to synthetically generate diverse, high-fidelity paired video-instruction data of basic editing operations. Extensive experiments show that VIVA achieves superior instruction following, generalization, and editing quality over state-of-the-art methods.

By compressing images into compact latent representations, tokenizers enable generative models to operate in lower-dimensional spaces, thereby improving computational efficiency and reducing complexity.

To address this, we propose \\textbf{SFTok}, a discrete tokenizer that incorporates a multi-step iterative mechanism for precise reconstruction. By integrating \\textbf{self-forcing guided visual reconstruction} and \\textbf{debias-and-fitting training strategy}, SFTok resolves the training-inference inconsistency in multi-step process, significantly enhancing image reconstruction quality. At a high compression rate of only 64 tokens per image, SFTok achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality on ImageNet (rFID = 1.21) and demonstrates exceptional performance in class-to-image generation tasks (gFID = 2.29).", "AI": {"tldr": "SFTok\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6807\u8bb0\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6b65\u8fed\u4ee3\u548c\u72ec\u7279\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6807\u8bb0\u5668\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5982\u8fde\u7eed\u6807\u8bb0\u5668\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SFTok\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6b65\u8fed\u4ee3\u673a\u5236\u3001\u81ea\u5f3a\u5236\u5f15\u5bfc\u89c6\u89c9\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u53bb\u504f\u62df\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6807\u8bb0\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6bcf\u56fe\u50cf\u4ec564\u4e2a\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u4e0b\uff0cSFTok\u5728ImageNet\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86rFID = 1.21\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7c7b\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff08gFID = 2.29\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "SFTok\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u79bb\u6563\u6807\u8bb0\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6b65\u8fed\u4ee3\u673a\u5236\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, producing 3D videos remains costly and complex, while automatic Monocular-to-Stereo conversion is hindered by the limitations of the multi-stage ``Depth-Warp-Inpaint'' (DWI) pipeline. This paradigm suffers from error propagation, depth ambiguity, and format inconsistency between parallel and converged stereo configurations. To address these challenges, we introduce UniStereo, the first large-scale unified dataset for stereo video conversion, covering both stereo formats to enable fair benchmarking and robust model training. Building upon this dataset, we propose StereoPilot, an efficient feed-forward model that directly synthesizes the target view without relying on explicit depth maps or iterative diffusion sampling. Equipped with a learnable domain switcher and a cycle consistency loss, StereoPilot adapts seamlessly to different stereo formats and achieves improved consistency.

Instead of training models to output features for downstream use, we train them to generate embeddings to perform predictive tasks directly. This work explores such a shift from learning representations to learning models. Specifically, models learn to predict future patch embeddings conditioned on past ones, using causal masking and stop gradient, which we refer to as Next-Embedding Predictive Autoregression (NEPA). We demonstrate that a simple Transformer pretrained on ImageNet-1k with next embedding prediction as its sole learning objective is effective - no pixel reconstruction, discrete tokens, contrastive loss, or task-specific heads. This formulation retains architectural simplicity and scalability, without requiring additional design complexity. NEPA achieves strong results across tasks, attaining 83.8% and 85.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ViT-B and ViT-L backbones after fine-tuning, and transferring effectively to semantic segmentation on ADE20K.

Single-image refocusing is still difficult. It involves recovering sharp content and creating realistic bokeh. Current methods have significant drawbacks. They need all-in-focus inputs, depend on synthetic data from simulators, and have limited control over aperture. We introduce Generative Refocusing, a two-step process that uses DeblurNet to recover all-in-focus images from various inputs and BokehNet for creating controllable bokeh. Our main innovation is semi-supervised training. This method combines synthetic paired data with unpaired real bokeh images, using EXIF metadata to capture real optical characteristics beyond what simulators can provide. Our experiments show we achieve top performance in defocus deblurring, bokeh synthesis, and refocusing benchmarks. Additionally, our Generative Refocusing allows text-guided adjustments and custom aperture shapes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGenerative Refocusing\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u5149\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6563\u7126\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u4e14\u652f\u6301\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "motivation": "\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u805a\u7126\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u5168\u805a\u7126\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u4e14\u5149\u5708\u63a7\u5236\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u6b65\u6cd5\uff1aDeblurNet\u6062\u590d\u5168\u805a\u7126\u56fe\u50cf\uff0cBokehNet\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u63a7\u6563\u7126\u6548\u679c\u3002\u521b\u65b0\u70b9\u662f\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5408\u6210\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u548c\u672a\u914d\u5bf9\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6563\u7126\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5229\u7528EXIF\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6355\u6349\u771f\u5b9e\u5149\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u6563\u7126\u5408\u6210\u548c\u91cd\u805a\u7126\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u652f\u6301\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u5149\u5708\u3002", "conclusion": "Generative Refocusing\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u5149\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u6563\u7126\u5408\u6210\u548c\u91cd\u805a\u7126\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u5149\u5708\u5f62\u72b6\u3002"}}

Unlike text-only approaches and existing trajectory-controlled image-to-video methods, our multimodal approach combines trajectories -- encoding motion, timing, and visibility -- with natural language for semantic intent and reference images for visual grounding of object identity, enabling the generation of coherent, controllable events that include multi-agent interactions, object entry/exit, reference-guided appearance and counterintuitive events. The resulting videos demonstrate not only temporal coherence but also emergent consistency, preserving object identity and scene despite temporary disappearance.
