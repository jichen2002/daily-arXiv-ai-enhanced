Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出一种结合学习和投影的方法，将2D材质数据融合到3D几何中，通过高斯泼溅和神经细化提升渲染真实感，优化生产流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D重建方法在重光照场景中因缺乏精确的空间变化材质参数而表现不足，而2D扩散模型在预测基于物理的渲染属性方面表现优异，但将2D材质图转移到重建的3D几何上仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的框架通过结合基于学习和投影的方法，成功将2D材质数据融合到3D几何中，显著提升了渲染的准确性和视觉真实感，优化了内容生产流程的效率。

Abstract: Manual modeling of material parameters and 3D geometry is a time consuming yet essential task in the gaming and film industries. While recent advances in 3D reconstruction have enabled accurate approximations of scene geometry and appearance, these methods often fall short in relighting scenarios due to the lack of precise, spatially varying material parameters. At the same time, diffusion models operating on 2D images have shown strong performance in predicting physically based rendering (PBR) properties such as albedo, roughness, and metallicity. However, transferring these 2D material maps onto reconstructed 3D geometry remains a significant challenge. We propose a framework for fusing 2D material data into 3D geometry using a combination of novel learning-based and projection-based approaches. We begin by reconstructing scene geometry via Gaussian Splatting. From the input images, a diffusion model generates 2D maps for albedo, roughness, and metallic parameters. Any existing diffusion model that can convert images or videos to PBR materials can be applied. The predictions are further integrated into the 3D representation either by optimizing an image-based loss or by directly projecting the material parameters onto the Gaussians using Gaussian ray tracing. To enhance fine-scale accuracy and multi-view consistency, we further introduce a light-weight neural refinement step (Neural Merger), which takes ray-traced material features as input and produces detailed adjustments. Our results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform existing techniques in both quantitative metrics and perceived visual realism. This enables more accurate, relightable, and photorealistic renderings from reconstructed scenes, significantly improving the realism and efficiency of asset creation workflows in content production pipelines.

Abstract: We present an energy-efficient anti-UAV system that integrates frame-based and event-driven object tracking to enable reliable detection of small and fast-moving drones. The system reconstructs binary event frames using run-length encoding, generates region proposals, and adaptively switches between frame mode and event mode based on object size and velocity. A Fast Object Tracking Unit improves robustness for high-speed targets through adaptive thresholding and trajectory-based classification. The neural processing unit supports both grayscale-patch and trajectory inference with a custom instruction set and a zero-skipping MAC architecture, reducing redundant neural computations by more than 97 percent. Implemented in 40 nm CMOS technology, the 2 mm^2 chip achieves 96 pJ per frame per pixel and 61 pJ per event at 0.8 V, and reaches 98.2 percent recognition accuracy on public UAV datasets across 50 to 400 m ranges and 5 to 80 pixels per second speeds. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art end-to-end energy efficiency for anti-UAV systems.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于视觉的轨迹分析方案，通过自适应CLAHE-SIFT和KNN-RANSAC算法，有效解决商用车AEB系统低速误触发问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决商用车AEB系统在低速运行时因CAN信号不准确导致的‘零速刹车’问题。

Method: 利用NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier平台处理盲点摄像头的视频序列，结合自适应CLAHE增强的SIFT特征提取和KNN-RANSAC匹配，通过多帧轨迹位移统计和双阈值状态决策矩阵精确分类车辆运动状态。

Result: 在真实数据集（32,454个视频片段）中，静态检测F1-score达99.96%，运动状态识别达97.78%，处理延迟14.2毫秒。现场部署显示误刹车事件减少89%，紧急刹车成功率100%。

Conclusion: 该解决方案有效解决了商用车AEB系统在低速运行时的误触发问题，显著降低了误刹车事件（减少89%），并实现了100%的紧急刹车成功率。

Abstract: A vision-based trajectory analysis solution is proposed to address the "zero-speed braking" issue caused by inaccurate Controller Area Network (CAN) signals in commercial vehicle Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) systems during low-speed operation. The algorithm utilizes the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier platform to process sequential video frames from a blind spot camera, employing self-adaptive Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)-enhanced Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) feature extraction and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)-Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) matching. This allows for precise classification of the vehicle's motion state (static, vibration, moving). Key innovations include 1) multiframe trajectory displacement statistics (5-frame sliding window), 2) a dual-threshold state decision matrix, and 3) OBD-II driven dynamic Region of Interest (ROI) configuration. The system effectively suppresses environmental interference and false detection of dynamic objects, directly addressing the challenge of low-speed false activation in commercial vehicle safety systems. Evaluation in a real-world dataset (32,454 video segments from 1,852 vehicles) demonstrates an F1-score of 99.96% for static detection, 97.78% for moving state recognition, and a processing delay of 14.2 milliseconds (resolution 704x576). The deployment on-site shows an 89% reduction in false braking events, a 100% success rate in emergency braking, and a fault rate below 5%.

### [5] [LouvreSAE: Sparse Autoencoders for Interpretable and Controllable Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18930)
*Raina Panda,Daniel Fein,Arpita Singhal,Mark Fiore,Maneesh Agrawala,Matyas Bohacek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LouvreSAE通过稀疏自编码器学习艺术风格和构图概念，实现无需模型更新的快速风格转移，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常通过微调、适配器或提示工程引入风格，计算成本高且风格与主题可能纠缠不清，因此需要一种更轻量、可解释的方法。

Method: 利用艺术特定的稀疏自编码器（SAE）在生成图像模型的潜在嵌入上学习风格和构图概念，构建风格配置文件以实现风格转移。

Result: 在ArtBench10上验证，LouvreSAE在风格评估（VGG风格损失和CLIP风格分数）上达到或超越现有方法，速度提升1.7-20倍，且具有可解释性。

Conclusion: LouvreSAE提供了一种无需模型更新或优化的艺术风格转移方法，通过稀疏自编码器学习风格和构图概念，实现了快速且可解释的风格转移。

Abstract: Artistic style transfer in generative models remains a significant challenge, as existing methods often introduce style only via model fine-tuning, additional adapters, or prompt engineering, all of which can be computationally expensive and may still entangle style with subject matter. In this paper, we introduce a training- and inference-light, interpretable method for representing and transferring artistic style. Our approach leverages an art-specific Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) on top of latent embeddings of generative image models. Trained on artistic data, our SAE learns an emergent, largely disentangled set of stylistic and compositional concepts, corresponding to style-related elements pertaining brushwork, texture, and color palette, as well as semantic and structural concepts. We call it LouvreSAE and use it to construct style profiles: compact, decomposable steering vectors that enable style transfer without any model updates or optimization. Unlike prior concept-based style transfer methods, our method requires no fine-tuning, no LoRA training, and no additional inference passes, enabling direct steering of artistic styles from only a few reference images. We validate our method on ArtBench10, achieving or surpassing existing methods on style evaluations (VGG Style Loss and CLIP Score Style) while being 1.7-20x faster and, critically, interpretable.

*Kaijie Chen,Zhiyang Xu,Ying Shen,Zihao Lin,Yuguang Yao,Lifu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuperFlow 通过改进采样和信用分配，显著提升流模型的训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于流的生成模型在 RL 训练中存在采样效率低和信用分配偏差的问题。

Method: 提出 SuperFlow，一个基于方差感知采样调整组大小并与连续时间流动力学一致的步级优势计算的 RL 训练框架。

Result: SuperFlow 仅需原始训练步骤的 5.4% 至 56.3%，训练时间减少 5.2% 至 16.7%，在 T2I 任务中性能提升显著。

Conclusion: SuperFlow 在文本到图像任务中显著提升了性能，同时大幅减少了训练时间和步骤，无需架构更改。

Abstract: Recent progress in flow-based generative models and reinforcement learning (RL) has improved text-image alignment and visual quality. However, current RL training for flow models still has two main problems: (i) GRPO-style fixed per-prompt group sizes ignore variation in sampling importance across prompts, which leads to inefficient sampling and slower training; and (ii) trajectory-level advantages are reused as per-step estimates, which biases credit assignment along the flow. We propose SuperFlow, an RL training framework for flow-based models that adjusts group sizes with variance-aware sampling and computes step-level advantages in a way that is consistent with continuous-time flow dynamics. Empirically, SuperFlow reaches promising performance while using only 5.4% to 56.3% of the original training steps and reduces training time by 5.2% to 16.7% without any architectural changes. On standard text-to-image (T2I) tasks, including text rendering, compositional image generation, and human preference alignment, SuperFlow improves over SD3.5-M by 4.6% to 47.2%, and over Flow-GRPO by 1.7% to 16.0%.

Result: 通过分割人类输入，背景偏差减少了3.78%；通过提示调优，VLLMs的人类聚焦推理能力提升了9.85%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过引入分割的人类输入和优化提示设计，可以有效减少背景偏差，提升模型对人类动作的识别能力。

Abstract: Human action recognition models often rely on background cues rather than human movement and pose to make predictions, a behavior known as background bias. We present a systematic analysis of background bias across classification models, contrastive text-image pretrained models, and Video Large Language Models (VLLM) and find that all exhibit a strong tendency to default to background reasoning. Next, we propose mitigation strategies for classification models and show that incorporating segmented human input effectively decreases background bias by 3.78%. Finally, we explore manual and automated prompt tuning for VLLMs, demonstrating that prompt design can steer predictions towards human-focused reasoning by 9.85%.

Result: 在CIFAR-100和细粒度数据集上，SCS-SupCon显著优于现有方法，最高提升3.9个百分点。

Conclusion: SCS-SupCon框架通过引入可学习的温度和偏置参数，以及明确的风格距离约束，显著提升了细粒度图像分类任务的性能，并在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Image classification is hindered by subtle inter-class differences and substantial intra-class variations, which limit the effectiveness of existing contrastive learning methods. Supervised contrastive approaches based on the InfoNCE loss suffer from negative-sample dilution and lack adaptive decision boundaries, thereby reducing discriminative power in fine-grained recognition tasks. To address these limitations, we propose Sigmoid-based Common and Style Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCS-SupCon). Our framework introduces a sigmoid-based pairwise contrastive loss with learnable temperature and bias parameters to enable adaptive decision boundaries. This formulation emphasizes hard negatives, mitigates negative-sample dilution, and more effectively exploits supervision. In addition, an explicit style-distance constraint further disentangles style and content representations, leading to more robust feature learning. Comprehensive experiments on six benchmark datasets, including CUB200-2011 and Stanford Dogs, demonstrate that SCS-SupCon achieves state-of-the-art performance across both CNN and Transformer backbones. On CIFAR-100 with ResNet-50, SCS-SupCon improves top-1 accuracy over SupCon by approximately 3.9 percentage points and over CS-SupCon by approximately 1.7 points under five-fold cross-validation. On fine-grained datasets, it outperforms CS-SupCon by 0.4--3.0 points. Extensive ablation studies and statistical analyses further confirm the robustness and generalization of the proposed framework, with Friedman tests and Nemenyi post-hoc evaluations validating the stability of the observed improvements.

### [9] [A Modular Framework for Single-View 3D Reconstruction of Indoor Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17955)
*Yuxiao Li*

TL;DR: 提出模块化框架，分两步完成单视图室内场景3D重建：先用扩散技术预测完整视图，再转换为3D。实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法直接从2D图像预测3D形状，因室内环境的复杂实例形状和遮挡问题导致重建质量有限。本文旨在通过分步处理克服这一限制。

Conclusion: 该框架在室内设计、房地产和增强现实等领域具有潜在的应用前景，且在3D-Front数据集上的实验表明，其在视觉质量和重建准确性方面优于当前最先进的方法。

Abstract: We propose a modular framework for single-view indoor scene 3D reconstruction, where several core modules are powered by diffusion techniques. Traditional approaches for this task often struggle with the complex instance shapes and occlusions inherent in indoor environments. They frequently overshoot by attempting to predict 3D shapes directly from incomplete 2D images, which results in limited reconstruction quality. We aim to overcome this limitation by splitting the process into two steps: first, we employ diffusion-based techniques to predict the complete views of the room background and occluded indoor instances, then transform them into 3D. Our modular framework makes contributions to this field through the following components: an amodal completion module for restoring the full view of occluded instances, an inpainting model specifically trained to predict room layouts, a hybrid depth estimation technique that balances overall geometric accuracy with fine detail expressiveness, and a view-space alignment method that exploits both 2D and 3D cues to ensure precise placement of instances within the scene. This approach effectively reconstructs both foreground instances and the room background from a single image. Extensive experiments on the 3D-Front dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in terms of both visual quality and reconstruction accuracy. The framework holds promising potential for applications in interior design, real estate, and augmented reality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 茶叶病害若不及时识别会导致重大经济损失，手动识别效率低且不可靠，自动化系统能提高识别效率和成功率。

Method: 使用了预训练模型DenseNet、Inception和EfficientNet（仅用于集成模型），并引入两种注意力模块提升性能。

Result: 集成模型达到了85.68%的最高准确率，并引入可解释AI提升模型可解释性。

Conclusion: 本研究开发了一个自动化系统，能够高效分类茶叶病害，帮助农民及时采取措施减少损失。

Abstract: Tea is among the most widely consumed drinks globally. Tea production is a key industry for many countries. One of the main challenges in tea harvesting is tea leaf diseases. If the spread of tea leaf diseases is not stopped in time, it can lead to massive economic losses for farmers. Therefore, it is crucial to identify tea leaf diseases as soon as possible. Manually identifying tea leaf disease is an ineffective and time-consuming method, without any guarantee of success. Automating this process will improve both the efficiency and the success rate of identifying tea leaf diseases. The purpose of this study is to create an automated system that can classify different kinds of tea leaf diseases, allowing farmers to take action to minimize the damage. A novel dataset was developed specifically for this study. The dataset contains 5278 images across seven classes. The dataset was pre-processed prior to training the model. We deployed three pretrained models: DenseNet, Inception, and EfficientNet. EfficientNet was used only in the ensemble model. We utilized two different attention modules to improve model performance. The ensemble model achieved the highest accuracy of 85.68%. Explainable AI was introduced for better model interpretability.

TL;DR: ALIGN-Parts通过集合对齐和跨模态特征整合，实现了3D语义部分分割和命名，统一了多个数据集并支持零样本匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集的部分标注定义不一致，限制了鲁棒性训练，需要一种能够统一命名并支持开放词汇匹配的方法。

Method: ALIGN-Parts通过将部分命名作为直接集合对齐任务，结合几何、外观和语义知识，实现了高效的3D部分分割和命名。

Result: 该方法创建了一个包含1,794个独特3D部分的统一本体，并展示了在新数据集上的应用，同时提出了两个新评估指标。

Conclusion: ALIGN-Parts成功地将3D物体分割为语义部分，并通过统一的命名系统整合了多个数据集，展示了在零样本匹配和下游任务中的潜力。

Abstract: We address semantic 3D part segmentation: decomposing objects into parts with meaningful names. While datasets exist with part annotations, their definitions are inconsistent across datasets, limiting robust training. Previous methods produce unlabeled decompositions or retrieve single parts without complete shape annotations. We propose ALIGN-Parts, which formulates part naming as a direct set alignment task. Our method decomposes shapes into partlets - implicit 3D part representations - matched to part descriptions via bipartite assignment. We combine geometric cues from 3D part fields, appearance from multi-view vision features, and semantic knowledge from language-model-generated affordance descriptions. Text-alignment loss ensures partlets share embedding space with text, enabling a theoretically open-vocabulary matching setup, given sufficient data. Our efficient and novel, one-shot, 3D part segmentation and naming method finds applications in several downstream tasks, including serving as a scalable annotation engine. As our model supports zero-shot matching to arbitrary descriptions and confidence-calibrated predictions for known categories, with human verification, we create a unified ontology that aligns PartNet, 3DCoMPaT++, and Find3D, consisting of 1,794 unique 3D parts. We also show examples from our newly created Tex-Parts dataset. We also introduce 2 novel metrics appropriate for the named 3D part segmentation task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper compares OCR-MT pipelines with VLLMs for translating handwritten Marathi legal documents, aiming to improve legal information access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The urgent need for scalable, accurate translation systems to digitize legal records in India's courts drives this research.

Method: The research compares traditional OCR-MT pipelines with Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) for end-to-end handwritten text translation.

Result: The evaluation on a curated dataset of handwritten Marathi legal documents highlights the performance differences between the two approaches.

Conclusion: The study provides actionable insights for developing robust, edge-deployable solutions to enhance access to legal information for non-native speakers and legal professionals.

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition (HTR) and machine translation continue to pose significant challenges, particularly for low-resource languages like Marathi, which lack large digitized corpora and exhibit high variability in handwriting styles. The conventional approach to address this involves a two-stage pipeline: an OCR system extracts text from handwritten images, which is then translated into the target language using a machine translation model. In this work, we explore and compare the performance of traditional OCR-MT pipelines with Vision Large Language Models that aim to unify these stages and directly translate handwritten text images in a single, end-to-end step. Our motivation is grounded in the urgent need for scalable, accurate translation systems to digitize legal records such as FIRs, charge sheets, and witness statements in India's district and high courts. We evaluate both approaches on a curated dataset of handwritten Marathi legal documents, with the goal of enabling efficient legal document processing, even in low-resource environments. Our findings offer actionable insights toward building robust, edge-deployable solutions that enhance access to legal information for non-native speakers and legal professionals alike.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像数据集中小肺结节等关键异常发现代表性不足和标注不一致的问题。

Method: NodMAISI是一个基于解剖约束的CT合成和增强框架，结合了标准化数据标注流程、ControlNet-conditioned rectified-flow生成器和病灶感知增强技术。

Result: NodMAISI在六个公共测试数据集上表现出更高的分布保真度和病灶检测灵敏度，尤其在亚厘米结节上表现突出，并在恶性分类任务中显著提升了AUC值。

Conclusion: NodMAISI框架在提高肺结节检测的敏感性和恶性分类性能方面表现出色，尤其在数据稀缺情况下显著缩小了性能差距。

Abstract: Objective: Although medical imaging datasets are increasingly available, abnormal and annotation-intensive findings critical to lung cancer screening, particularly small pulmonary nodules, remain underrepresented and inconsistently curated. Methods: We introduce NodMAISI, an anatomically constrained, nodule-oriented CT synthesis and augmentation framework trained on a unified multi-source cohort (7,042 patients, 8,841 CTs, 14,444 nodules). The framework integrates: (i) a standardized curation and annotation pipeline linking each CT with organ masks and nodule-level annotations, (ii) a ControlNet-conditioned rectified-flow generator built on MAISI-v2's foundational blocks to enforce anatomy- and lesion-consistent synthesis, and (iii) lesion-aware augmentation that perturbs nodule masks (controlled shrinkage) while preserving surrounding anatomy to generate paired CT variants. Results: Across six public test datasets, NodMAISI improved distributional fidelity relative to MAISI-v2 (real-to-synthetic FID range 1.18 to 2.99 vs 1.69 to 5.21). In lesion detectability analysis using a MONAI nodule detector, NodMAISI substantially increased average sensitivity and more closely matched clinical scans (IMD-CT: 0.69 vs 0.39; DLCS24: 0.63 vs 0.20), with the largest gains for sub-centimeter nodules where MAISI-v2 frequently failed to reproduce the conditioned lesion. In downstream nodule-level malignancy classification trained on LUNA25 and externally evaluated on LUNA16, LNDbv4, and DLCS24, NodMAISI augmentation improved AUC by 0.07 to 0.11 at <=20% clinical data and by 0.12 to 0.21 at 10%, consistently narrowing the performance gap under data scarcity.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, commonly known as, drones pose increasing risks in civilian and defense settings, demanding accurate and real-time drone detection systems. However, detecting drones is challenging because of their small size, rapid movement, and low visual contrast. A modified architecture of YolovN called the YolovN-CBi is proposed that incorporates the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and the Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) to improve sensitivity to small object detections. A curated training dataset consisting of 28K images is created with various flying objects and a local test dataset is collected with 2500 images consisting of very small drone objects. The proposed architecture is evaluated on four benchmark datasets, along with the local test dataset. The baseline Yolov5 and the proposed Yolov5-CBi architecture outperform newer Yolo versions, including Yolov8 and Yolov12, in the speed-accuracy trade-off for small object detection. Four other variants of the proposed CBi architecture are also proposed and evaluated, which vary in the placement and usage of CBAM and BiFPN. These variants are further distilled using knowledge distillation techniques for edge deployment, using a Yolov5m-CBi teacher and a Yolov5n-CBi student. The distilled model achieved a mA@P0.5:0.9 of 0.6573, representing a 6.51% improvement over the teacher's score of 0.6171, highlighting the effectiveness of the distillation process. The distilled model is 82.9% faster than the baseline model, making it more suitable for real-time drone detection. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed CBi architecture, together with the distilled lightweight models in advancing efficient and accurate real-time detection of small UAVs.

Motivation: 为了解决神经网络在安全部署中的分布外（OOD）检测问题，并实现隐私保护的面部认证与表情识别。

Method: FOODER采用多编码器多解码器架构（BP和ILED组件）进行面部认证，并结合ResNet和MobileViT网络进行动态与静态表情分类。

Conclusion: FOODER框架通过雷达数据实现了高精度的面部认证和表情识别，同时保护用户隐私，其性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for the safe deployment of neural networks, as it enables the identification of samples outside the training domain. We present FOODER, a real-time, privacy-preserving radar-based framework that integrates OOD-based facial authentication with facial expression recognition. FOODER operates using low-cost frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar and exploits both range-Doppler and micro range-Doppler representations. The authentication module employs a multi-encoder multi-decoder architecture with Body Part (BP) and Intermediate Linear Encoder-Decoder (ILED) components to classify a single enrolled individual as in-distribution while detecting all other faces as OOD. Upon successful authentication, an expression recognition module is activated. Concatenated radar representations are processed by a ResNet block to distinguish between dynamic and static facial expressions. Based on this categorization, two specialized MobileViT networks are used to classify dynamic expressions (smile, shock) and static expressions (neutral, anger). This hierarchical design enables robust facial authentication and fine-grained expression recognition while preserving user privacy by relying exclusively on radar data. Experiments conducted on a dataset collected with a 60 GHz short-range FMCW radar demonstrate that FOODER achieves an AUROC of 94.13% and an FPR95 of 18.12% for authentication, along with an average expression recognition accuracy of 94.70%. FOODER outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection methods and several transformer-based architectures while operating efficiently in real time.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of outdoor street scenes plays a key role in applications such as autonomous driving, mobile robotics, and assistive technology for visually-impaired pedestrians. For these applications, accurately distinguishing between key surfaces and objects such as roads, sidewalks, vehicles, and pedestrians is essential for maintaining safety and minimizing risks. Semantic segmentation must be robust to different environments, lighting and weather conditions, and sensor noise, while being performed in real-time. We propose a region-level, uncertainty-gated retrieval mechanism that improves segmentation accuracy and calibration under domain shift. Our best method achieves an 11.3% increase in mean intersection-over-union while reducing retrieval cost by 87.5%, retrieving for only 12.5% of regions compared to 100% for always-on baseline.

Motivation: 高分辨率冠层高度测绘对森林管理和生物多样性监测至关重要，但现有深度学习方法在数据可访问性和空间分辨率之间存在权衡。

Method: SERA-H是一个端到端模型，结合了超分辨率模块（EDSR）和时间注意力编码（UTAE），在ALS高密度LiDAR数据的监督下训练，利用免费的Sentinel-1和Sentinel-2（10米）时间序列数据生成2.5米分辨率的高度图。

Result: 在法国的一个开源基准数据集上评估，SERA-H的MAE为2.6米，决定系数为0.82，不仅优于标准Sentinel-1/2基线，还达到或超过了依赖商业高分辨率影像（SPOT-6/7、PlanetScope、Maxar）的方法的性能。

Conclusion: SERA-H通过结合高分辨率监督和时间序列中的时空信息，能够重建超出输入传感器原生分辨率的细节，为高频率自由测绘森林提供了可能，且精度与昂贵的商业影像相当。

Abstract: High-resolution mapping of canopy height is essential for forest management and biodiversity monitoring. Although recent studies have led to the advent of deep learning methods using satellite imagery to predict height maps, these approaches often face a trade-off between data accessibility and spatial resolution. To overcome these limitations, we present SERA-H, an end-to-end model combining a super-resolution module (EDSR) and temporal attention encoding (UTAE). Trained under the supervision of high-density LiDAR data (ALS), our model generates 2.5 m resolution height maps from freely available Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 (10 m) time series data. Evaluated on an open-source benchmark dataset in France, SERA-H, with a MAE of 2.6 m and a coefficient of determination of 0.82, not only outperforms standard Sentinel-1/2 baselines but also achieves performance comparable to or better than methods relying on commercial very high-resolution imagery (SPOT-6/7, PlanetScope, Maxar). These results demonstrate that combining high-resolution supervision with the spatiotemporal information embedded in time series enables the reconstruction of details beyond the input sensors' native resolution. SERA-H opens the possibility of freely mapping forests with high revisit frequency, achieving accuracy comparable to that of costly commercial imagery.

Conclusion: EndoStreamDepth显著提升了内窥镜视频流的单目深度估计性能，生成了具有清晰解剖边界的深度图，这对于机器人手术等下游任务至关重要。

Abstract: This work presents EndoStreamDepth, a monocular depth estimation framework for endoscopic video streams. It provides accurate depth maps with sharp anatomical boundaries for each frame, temporally consistent predictions across frames, and real-time throughput. Unlike prior work that uses batched inputs, EndoStreamDepth processes individual frames with a temporal module to propagate inter-frame information. The framework contains three main components: (1) a single-frame depth network with endoscopy-specific transformation to produce accurate depth maps, (2) multi-level Mamba temporal modules that leverage inter-frame information to improve accuracy and stabilize predictions, and (3) a hierarchical design with comprehensive multi-scale supervision, where complementary loss terms jointly improve local boundary sharpness and global geometric consistency. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on two publicly available colonoscopy depth estimation datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation methods, EndoStreamDepth substantially improves performance, and it produces depth maps with sharp, anatomically aligned boundaries, which are essential to support downstream tasks such as automation for robotic surgery.

Abstract: Diffusion models learn strong image priors that can be leveraged to solve inverse problems like medical image reconstruction. However, for real-world applications such as 3D Computed Tomography (CT) imaging, directly training diffusion models on 3D data presents significant challenges due to the high computational demands of extensive GPU resources and large-scale datasets. Existing works mostly reuse 2D diffusion priors to address 3D inverse problems, but fail to fully realize and leverage the generative capacity of diffusion models for high-dimensional data. In this study, we propose a novel 3D patch-based diffusion model that can learn a fully 3D diffusion prior from limited data, enabling scalable generation of high-resolution 3D images. Our core idea is to learn the prior of 3D patches to achieve scalable efficiency, while coupling local and global information to guarantee high-quality 3D image generation, by modeling the joint distribution of position-aware 3D local patches and downsampled 3D volume as global context. Our approach not only enables high-quality 3D generation, but also offers an unprecedentedly efficient and accurate solution to high-resolution 3D inverse problems. Experiments on 3D CT reconstruction across multiple datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both performance and efficiency, notably achieving high-resolution 3D reconstruction of $512 \times 512 \times 256$ ($\sim$20 mins).

Abstract: Accurate medical image segmentation is essential for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. While recent interactive foundation models (e.g., nnInteractive) enhance generalization through large-scale multimodal pretraining, they still depend on precise prompts and often perform below expectations in contexts that are underrepresented in their training data. We present AtlasSegFM, an atlas-guided framework that customizes available foundation models to clinical contexts with a single annotated example. The core innovations are: 1) a pipeline that provides context-aware prompts for foundation models via registration between a context atlas and query images, and 2) a test-time adapter to fuse predictions from both atlas registration and the foundation model. Extensive experiments across public and in-house datasets spanning multiple modalities and organs demonstrate that AtlasSegFM consistently improves segmentation, particularly for small, delicate structures. AtlasSegFM provides a lightweight, deployable solution one-shot customization of foundation models in real-world clinical workflows. The code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: MACE-Dance框架通过级联的Mixture-of-Experts（MoE）方法，在音乐驱动的舞蹈视频生成任务中实现了高质量视觉外观和真实人体运动的联合优化，并在3D舞蹈生成和姿态驱动图像动画方面达到了SOTA性能。

Abstract: With the rise of online dance-video platforms and rapid advances in AI-generated content (AIGC), music-driven dance generation has emerged as a compelling research direction. Despite substantial progress in related domains such as music-driven 3D dance generation, pose-driven image animation, and audio-driven talking-head synthesis, existing methods cannot be directly adapted to this task. Moreover, the limited studies in this area still struggle to jointly achieve high-quality visual appearance and realistic human motion. Accordingly, we present MACE-Dance, a music-driven dance video generation framework with cascaded Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). The Motion Expert performs music-to-3D motion generation while enforcing kinematic plausibility and artistic expressiveness, whereas the Appearance Expert carries out motion- and reference-conditioned video synthesis, preserving visual identity with spatiotemporal coherence. Specifically, the Motion Expert adopts a diffusion model with a BiMamba-Transformer hybrid architecture and a Guidance-Free Training (GFT) strategy, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in 3D dance generation. The Appearance Expert employs a decoupled kinematic-aesthetic fine-tuning strategy, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in pose-driven image animation. To better benchmark this task, we curate a large-scale and diverse dataset and design a motion-appearance evaluation protocol. Based on this protocol, MACE-Dance also achieves state-of-the-art performance. Project page: https://macedance.github.io/

Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a powerful generative modeling approach with flexible choices of source distribution. While Gaussian distributions are commonly used, the potential for better alternatives in high-dimensional data generation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel 2D simulation that captures high-dimensional geometric properties in an interpretable 2D setting, enabling us to analyze the learning dynamics of flow matching during training. Based on this analysis, we derive several key insights about flow matching behavior: (1) density approximation can paradoxically degrade performance due to mode discrepancy, (2) directional alignment suffers from path entanglement when overly concentrated, (3) Gaussian's omnidirectional coverage ensures robust learning, and (4) norm misalignment incurs substantial learning costs. Building on these insights, we propose a practical framework that combines norm-aligned training with directionally-pruned sampling. This approach maintains the robust omnidirectional supervision essential for stable flow learning, while eliminating initializations in data-sparse regions during inference. Importantly, our pruning strategy can be applied to any flow matching model trained with a Gaussian source, providing immediate performance gains without the need for retraining. Empirical evaluations demonstrate consistent improvements in both generation quality and sampling efficiency. Our findings provide practical insights and guidelines for source distribution design and introduce a readily applicable technique for improving existing flow matching models.

Conclusion: ALIGN方法通过整合LiDAR几何和图像语义，提出了一种新颖的查询初始化策略，显著提高了3D物体检测的准确性，特别是在遮挡或拥挤场景中。

Abstract: Recent query-based 3D object detection methods using camera and LiDAR inputs have shown strong performance, but existing query initialization strategies,such as random sampling or BEV heatmap-based sampling, often result in inefficient query usage and reduced accuracy, particularly for occluded or crowded objects. To address this limitation, we propose ALIGN (Advanced query initialization with LiDAR and Image GuidaNce), a novel approach for occlusion-robust, object-aware query initialization. Our model consists of three key components: (i) Occlusion-aware Center Estimation (OCE), which integrates LiDAR geometry and image semantics to estimate object centers accurately (ii) Adaptive Neighbor Sampling (ANS), which generates object candidates from LiDAR clustering and supplements each object by sampling spatially and semantically aligned points around it and (iii) Dynamic Query Balancing (DQB), which adaptively balances queries between foreground and background regions. Our extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that ALIGN consistently improves performance across multiple state-of-the-art detectors, achieving gains of up to +0.9 mAP and +1.2 NDS, particularly in challenging scenes with occlusions or dense crowds. Our code will be publicly available upon publication.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of implicit object representations in recognizing multi-part objects under occluded or out-of-distribution conditions.

Method: A novel approach leveraging explicit graph representations for parts and a co-part object discovery algorithm.

Result: Marked improvements in object discovery quality and accurate recognition in challenging contexts, with better performance in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in discovering object-centric representations, especially in occluded and out-of-distribution contexts, and shows potential for advancing the field.

Abstract: Discovering object-centric representations from images can significantly enhance the robustness, sample efficiency and generalizability of vision models. Works on images with multi-part objects typically follow an implicit object representation approach, which fail to recognize these learned objects in occluded or out-of-distribution contexts. This is due to the assumption that object part-whole relations are implicitly encoded into the representations through indirect training objectives. We address this limitation by proposing a novel method that leverages on explicit graph representations for parts and present a co-part object discovery algorithm. We then introduce three benchmarks to evaluate the robustness of object-centric methods in recognizing multi-part objects within occluded and out-of-distribution settings. Experimental results on simulated, realistic, and real-world images show marked improvements in the quality of discovered objects compared to state-of-the-art methods, as well as the accurate recognition of multi-part objects in occluded and out-of-distribution contexts. We also show that the discovered object-centric representations can more accurately predict key object properties in a downstream task, highlighting the potential of our method to advance the field of object-centric representations.

Motivation: 理解空间开放性对提高住宅质量和设计至关重要，但现有研究往往单独处理其影响因素。

Method: 通过平面可见性分析（VGA）从平面图中计算2D开放性，使用Mask2Former语义分割模型从室内图像中提取3D开放性。

Result: 结果显示，客厅可见性增加，整体开放性在1990年代达到峰值。空间分析揭示了开放性、租金和建筑特征之间的部分相关性。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一个新的多维数据驱动框架，用于量化住宅空间开放性，并将其与城市和市场动态联系起来。

Abstract: Understanding spatial openness is vital for improving residential quality and design; however, studies often treat its influencing factors separately. This study developed a quantitative framework to evaluate the spatial openness in housing from two- (2D) and three- (3D) dimensional perspectives. Using data from 4,004 rental units in Tokyo's 23 wards, we examined the temporal and spatial variations in openness and its relationship with rent and housing attributes. 2D openness was computed via planar visibility using visibility graph analysis (VGA) from floor plans, whereas 3D openness was derived from interior images analysed using Mask2Former, a semantic segmentation model that identifies walls, ceilings, floors, and windows. The results showed an increase in living room visibility and a 1990s peak in overall openness. Spatial analyses revealed partial correlations among openness, rent, and building characteristics, reflecting urban redevelopment trends. Although the 2D and 3D openness indicators were not directly correlated, higher openness tended to correspond to higher rent. The impression scores predicted by the existing models were only weakly related to openness, suggesting that the interior design and furniture more strongly shape perceived space. This study offers a new multidimensional data-driven framework for quantifying residential spatial openness and linking it with urban and market dynamics.

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在处理空间信息时存在系统性偏差，表现为优先描述左侧内容，这种偏差与模型架构而非训练数据指令相关。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding visual content, yet systematic biases in their spatial processing remain largely unexplored. This work identifies and characterizes a systematic spatial attention bias where VLMs consistently prioritize describing left-positioned content before right-positioned content in horizontally concatenated images. Through controlled experiments on image pairs using both open-source and closed-source models, we demonstrate that this bias persists across different architectures, with models describing left-positioned content first in approximately 97% of cases under neutral prompting conditions. Testing on an Arabic-finetuned model reveals that the bias persists despite right-to-left language training, ruling out language reading direction as the primary cause. Investigation of training dataset annotation guidelines from PixMo and Visual Genome reveals no explicit left-first ordering instructions, suggesting the bias is consistent with architectural factors rather than explicit training data instructions. These findings reveal fundamental limitations in how current VLMs process spatial information.

*Shahram Najam Syed,Yitian Hu,Yuchao Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合优化深度、姿态和辐射场的框架，实现了大规模场景的高精度3D重建和新视角合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模场景中单目视频的3D重建问题，避免因孤立求解深度、姿态和辐射场导致的尺度模糊、姿态漂移和全局NeRF无法建模大范围内容的问题。

Method: 结合了Vision-Transformer (ViT)深度网络、多尺度特征束调整层和增量局部辐射场层次结构，解决了深度、姿态和辐射场的联合优化问题。

Result: 在Tanks and Temples基准测试中，绝对轨迹误差降至0.001-0.021米，比BARF低18倍，比NoPe-NeRF低2倍，同时保持亚像素级的相对姿态误差。

Conclusion: 该论文展示了一种联合学习框架，能够在大规模场景中实现无漂移的3D重建和高保真新视角合成，仅需单个未校准的RGB摄像头。

Abstract: Photorealistic 3-D reconstruction from monocular video collapses in large-scale scenes when depth, pose, and radiance are solved in isolation: scale-ambiguous depth yields ghost geometry, long-horizon pose drift corrupts alignment, and a single global NeRF cannot model hundreds of metres of content. We introduce a joint learning framework that couples all three factors and demonstrably overcomes each failure case. Our system begins with a Vision-Transformer (ViT) depth network trained with metric-scale supervision, giving globally consistent depths despite wide field-of-view variations. A multi-scale feature bundle-adjustment (BA) layer refines camera poses directly in feature space--leveraging learned pyramidal descriptors instead of brittle keypoints--to suppress drift on unconstrained trajectories. For scene representation, we deploy an incremental local-radiance-field hierarchy: new hash-grid NeRFs are allocated and frozen on-the-fly when view overlap falls below a threshold, enabling city-block-scale coverage on a single GPU. Evaluated on the Tanks and Temples benchmark, our method reduces Absolute Trajectory Error to 0.001-0.021 m across eight indoor-outdoor sequences--up to 18x lower than BARF and 2x lower than NoPe-NeRF--while maintaining sub-pixel Relative Pose Error. These results demonstrate that metric-scale, drift-free 3-D reconstruction and high-fidelity novel-view synthesis are achievable from a single uncalibrated RGB camera.

Method: 提出了Split-Fidelity Aware Projection Module (Split-FAPM)和Deformable Semantic Fusion (DSF)模块，结合预训练的RIFE骨干网络和DINOv3 Vision Transformer的语义先验。

Result: 在SNU-FILM数据集上，SG-RIFE在FID/LPIPS指标上优于LDMVFI，且质量接近Consec. BB，同时运行速度显著更快。

Conclusion: SG-RIFE通过语义引导和高效微调策略，成功在实时视频帧插值任务中实现了接近扩散模型的感知质量，同时保持了较高的运行速度。

Abstract: Real-time Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) has long been dominated by flow-based methods like RIFE, which offer high throughput but often fail in complicated scenarios involving large motion and occlusion. Conversely, recent diffusion-based approaches (e.g., Consec. BB) achieve state-of-the-art perceptual quality but suffer from prohibitive latency, rendering them impractical for real-time applications. To bridge this gap, we propose Semantic-Guided RIFE (SG-RIFE). Instead of training from scratch, we introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that augments a pre-trained RIFE backbone with semantic priors from a frozen DINOv3 Vision Transformer. We propose a Split-Fidelity Aware Projection Module (Split-FAPM) to compress and refine high-dimensional features, and a Deformable Semantic Fusion (DSF) module to align these semantic priors with pixel-level motion fields. Experiments on SNU-FILM demonstrate that semantic injection provides a decisive boost in perceptual fidelity. SG-RIFE outperforms diffusion-based LDMVFI in FID/LPIPS and achieves quality comparable to Consec. BB on complex benchmarks while running significantly faster, proving that semantic consistency enables flow-based methods to achieve diffusion-competitive perceptual quality in near real-time.

Conclusion: 提出的SDCM网络通过光谱差异和跨模态语义一致性学习，有效解决了高光谱图像中的类内和类间相似性问题，并在两个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral images with high spectral resolution provide new insights into recognizing subtle differences in similar substances. However, object detection in hyperspectral images faces significant challenges in intra- and inter-class similarity due to the spatial differences in hyperspectral inter-bands and unavoidable interferences, e.g., sensor noises and illumination. To alleviate the hyperspectral inter-bands inconsistencies and redundancy, we propose a novel network termed \textbf{S}pectral \textbf{D}iscrepancy and \textbf{C}ross-\textbf{M}odal semantic consistency learning (SDCM), which facilitates the extraction of consistent information across a wide range of hyperspectral bands while utilizing the spectral dimension to pinpoint regions of interest. Specifically, we leverage a semantic consistency learning (SCL) module that utilizes inter-band contextual cues to diminish the heterogeneity of information among bands, yielding highly coherent spectral dimension representations. On the other hand, we incorporate a spectral gated generator (SGG) into the framework that filters out the redundant data inherent in hyperspectral information based on the importance of the bands. Then, we design the spectral discrepancy aware (SDA) module to enrich the semantic representation of high-level information by extracting pixel-level spectral features. Extensive experiments on two hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance when compared with other ones.

Conclusion: 本研究通过构建首个古代植物种子图像分类数据集（APS）并设计专用框架（APSNet），成功实现了高精度的种子分类，为大规模、系统化的考古研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Understanding the dietary preferences of ancient societies and their evolution across periods and regions is crucial for revealing human-environment interactions. Seeds, as important archaeological artifacts, represent a fundamental subject of archaeobotanical research. However, traditional studies rely heavily on expert knowledge, which is often time-consuming and inefficient. Intelligent analysis methods have made progress in various fields of archaeology, but there remains a research gap in data and methods in archaeobotany, especially in the classification task of ancient plant seeds. To address this, we construct the first Ancient Plant Seed Image Classification (APS) dataset. It contains 8,340 images from 17 genus- or species-level seed categories excavated from 18 archaeological sites across China. In addition, we design a framework specifically for the ancient plant seed classification task (APSNet), which introduces the scale feature (size) of seeds based on learning fine-grained information to guide the network in discovering key "evidence" for sufficient classification. Specifically, we design a Size Perception and Embedding (SPE) module in the encoder part to explicitly extract size information for the purpose of complementing fine-grained information. We propose an Asynchronous Decoupled Decoding (ADD) architecture based on traditional progressive learning to decode features from both channel and spatial perspectives, enabling efficient learning of discriminative features. In both quantitative and qualitative analyses, our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art image classification methods, achieving an accuracy of 90.5%. This demonstrates that our work provides an effective tool for large-scale, systematic archaeological research.

TL;DR: Loom is a diffusion-transformer framework for interleaved text-image generation, outperforming baselines in coherence and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of jointly generating coherent visual frames and aligned textual descriptions in a single sequence, enabling tasks like style transfer, compositional synthesis, and procedural tutorials.

Method: Loom extends the Bagel model through full-parameter fine-tuning and an interleaved architecture that alternates textual and visual embeddings for multi-condition reasoning and sequential planning. It uses a language planning strategy to decompose user instructions into stepwise prompts and frame embeddings, guiding synthesis.

Result: Loom achieves an average gain of 2.6 points over the baseline Anole in text-to-interleaved tasks and shows strong improvements over unified and diffusion editing baselines.

Conclusion: Loom significantly outperforms baseline models like Anole in interleaved text-image generation tasks, achieving better compositionality, temporal coherence, and text-image alignment.

Abstract: Interleaved text-image generation aims to jointly produce coherent visual frames and aligned textual descriptions within a single sequence, enabling tasks such as style transfer, compositional synthesis, and procedural tutorials. We present Loom, a unified diffusion-transformer framework for interleaved text-image generation. Loom extends the Bagel unified model via full-parameter fine-tuning and an interleaved architecture that alternates textual and visual embeddings for multi-condition reasoning and sequential planning. A language planning strategy first decomposes a user instruction into stepwise prompts and frame embeddings, which guide temporally consistent synthesis. For each frame, Loom conditions on a small set of sampled prior frames together with the global textual context, rather than concatenating all history, yielding controllable and efficient long-horizon generation. Across style transfer, compositional generation, and tutorial-like procedures, Loom delivers superior compositionality, temporal coherence, and text-image alignment. Experiments demonstrate that Loom substantially outperforms the open-source baseline Anole, achieving an average gain of 2.6 points (on a 5-point scale) across temporal and semantic metrics in text-to-interleaved tasks. We also curate a 50K interleaved tutorial dataset and demonstrate strong improvements over unified and diffusion editing baselines.

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型（VLMs）的广泛应用，基于VLM的属性推断攻击成为严重隐私威胁，现有方法在隐私保护和用户体验之间难以取得平衡。

Method: 提出了一种新型保护方法，通过联合优化隐私抑制和效用保留，并在视觉一致性约束下进行。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的保护方法在抑制隐私属性推断的同时保持了高视觉一致性和用户体验，展示了其在真实世界VLM部署中的强实用性。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) become widely adopted, VLM-based attribute inference attacks have emerged as a serious privacy concern, enabling adversaries to infer private attributes from images shared on social media. This escalating threat calls for dedicated protection methods to safeguard user privacy. However, existing methods often degrade the visual quality of images or interfere with vision-based functions on social media, thereby failing to achieve a desirable balance between privacy protection and user experience. To address this challenge, we propose a novel protection method that jointly optimizes privacy suppression and utility preservation under a visual consistency constraint. While our method is conceptually effective, fair comparisons between methods remain challenging due to the lack of publicly available evaluation datasets. To fill this gap, we introduce VPI-COCO, a publicly available benchmark comprising 522 images with hierarchically structured privacy questions and corresponding non-private counterparts, enabling fine-grained and joint evaluation of protection methods in terms of privacy preservation and user experience. Building upon this benchmark, experiments on multiple VLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces PAR below 25%, keeps NPAR above 88%, maintains high visual consistency, and generalizes well to unseen and paraphrased privacy questions, demonstrating its strong practical applicability for real-world VLM deployments.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一个视觉暗模式检测框架，通过YOLOv12x模型和迁移学习优化，实现了92.8%的高检测准确率和40.5 FPS的实时推理速度，证明了其在实际在线环境中的有效性。

Abstract: With the accelerating pace of digital transformation and the widespread adoption of online platforms, both social and technical concerns regarding dark patterns-user interface designs that undermine users' ability to make informed and rational choices-have become increasingly prominent. As corporate online platforms grow more sophisticated in their design strategies, there is a pressing need for proactive and real-time detection technologies that go beyond the predominantly reactive approaches employed by regulatory authorities. In this paper, we propose a visual dark pattern detection framework that improves both detection accuracy and real-time performance. To this end, we constructed a proprietary visual object detection dataset by manually collecting 4,066 UI/UX screenshots containing dark patterns from 194 websites across six major industrial sectors in South Korea and abroad. The collected images were annotated with five representative UI components commonly associated with dark patterns: Button, Checkbox, Input Field, Pop-up, and QR Code. This dataset has been publicly released to support further research and development in the field. To enable real-time detection, this study adopted the YOLOv12x object detection model and applied transfer learning to optimize its performance for visual dark pattern recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves a high detection accuracy of 92.8% in terms of mAP@50, while maintaining a real-time inference speed of 40.5 frames per second (FPS), confirming its effectiveness for practical deployment in online environments. Furthermore, to facilitate future research and contribute to technological advancements, the dataset constructed in this study has been made publicly available at https://github.com/B4E2/B4E2-DarkPattern-YOLO-DataSet.

Abstract: Place recognition is a critical component of autonomous vehicles and robotics, enabling global localization in GPS-denied environments. Recent advances have spurred significant interest in multimodal place recognition (MPR), which leverages complementary strengths of multiple modalities. Despite its potential, most existing MPR methods still face three key challenges: (1) dynamically adapting to arbitrary modality inputs within a unified framework, (2) maintaining robustness with missing or degraded modalities, and (3) generalizing across diverse sensor configurations and setups. In this paper, we propose UniMPR, a unified framework for multimodal place recognition. Using only one trained model, it can seamlessly adapt to any combination of common perceptual modalities (e.g., camera, LiDAR, radar). To tackle the data heterogeneity, we unify all inputs within a polar BEV feature space. Subsequently, the polar BEVs are fed into a multi-branch network to exploit discriminative intra-model and inter-modal features from any modality combinations. To fully exploit the network's generalization capability and robustness, we construct a large-scale training set from multiple datasets and introduce an adaptive label assignment strategy for extensive pre-training. Experiments on seven datasets demonstrate that UniMPR achieves state-of-the-art performance under varying sensor configurations, modality combinations, and environmental conditions. Our code will be released at https://github.com/QiZS-BIT/UniMPR.

Conclusion: PACGNet通过SCG和PFMG模块的创新设计，有效解决了跨模态噪声和特征金字塔层次结构破坏的问题，在无人机车辆和VEDAI数据集上达到了新的最先进性能。

Abstract: Object detection in aerial imagery is a critical task in applications such as UAV reconnaissance. Although existing methods have extensively explored feature interaction between different modalities, they commonly rely on simple fusion strategies for feature aggregation. This introduces two critical flaws: it is prone to cross-modal noise and disrupts the hierarchical structure of the feature pyramid, thereby impairing the fine-grained detection of small objects. To address this challenge, we propose the Pyramidal Adaptive Cross-Gating Network (PACGNet), an architecture designed to perform deep fusion within the backbone. To this end, we design two core components: the Symmetrical Cross-Gating (SCG) module and the Pyramidal Feature-aware Multimodal Gating (PFMG) module. The SCG module employs a bidirectional, symmetrical "horizontal" gating mechanism to selectively absorb complementary information, suppress noise, and preserve the semantic integrity of each modality. The PFMG module reconstructs the feature hierarchy via a progressive hierarchical gating mechanism. This leverages the detailed features from a preceding, higher-resolution level to guide the fusion at the current, lower-resolution level, effectively preserving fine-grained details as features propagate. Through evaluations conducted on the DroneVehicle and VEDAI datasets, our PACGNet sets a new state-of-the-art benchmark, with mAP50 scores reaching 81.7% and 82.1% respectively.

Motivation: 高保真、基于物理的渲染（PBR）材质创建通常需要专业设备和专家后期处理，限制了其普及。MatE旨在通过单张图像简化这一过程。

Conclusion: MatE方法通过单张图像生成可平铺的PBR材质，有效解决了传统方法依赖专业设备和专家处理的问题，实现了材质创建的民主化。

Abstract: The creation of high-fidelity, physically-based rendering (PBR) materials remains a bottleneck in many graphics pipelines, typically requiring specialized equipment and expert-driven post-processing. To democratize this process, we present MatE, a novel method for generating tileable PBR materials from a single image taken under unconstrained, real-world conditions. Given an image and a user-provided mask, MatE first performs coarse rectification using an estimated depth map as a geometric prior, and then employs a dual-branch diffusion model. Leveraging a learned consistency from rotation-aligned and scale-aligned training data, this model further rectify residual distortions from the coarse result and translate it into a complete set of material maps, including albedo, normal, roughness and height. Our framework achieves invariance to the unknown illumination and perspective of the input image, allowing for the recovery of intrinsic material properties from casual captures. Through comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of our approach, enabling users to create realistic materials from real-world image.

Abstract: Bone Age Assessment (BAA) is a widely used clinical technique that can accurately reflect an individual's growth and development level, as well as maturity. In recent years, although deep learning has advanced the field of bone age assessment, existing methods face challenges in efficiently balancing global features and local skeletal details. This study aims to develop an automated bone age assessment system based on a two-stream deep learning architecture to achieve higher accuracy in bone age assessment. We propose the BoNet+ model incorporating global and local feature extraction channels. A Transformer module is introduced into the global feature extraction channel to enhance the ability in extracting global features through multi-head self-attention mechanism. A RFAConv module is incorporated into the local feature extraction channel to generate adaptive attention maps within multiscale receptive fields, enhancing local feature extraction capabilities. Global and local features are concatenated along the channel dimension and optimized by an Inception-V3 network. The proposed method has been validated on the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) and Radiological Hand Pose Estimation (RHPE) test datasets, achieving mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 3.81 and 5.65 months, respectively. These results are comparable to the state-of-the-art. The BoNet+ model reduces the clinical workload and achieves automatic, high-precision, and more objective bone age assessment.

Motivation: 现有方法在密集冠层阶段的VI饱和和冬小麦地面真实标注有限的情况下，特征表达能力不足，且深度学习基准存在领域差距和高数据需求问题。

Method: 提出MCVI-SANet，一种轻量级半监督视觉模型，包含新设计的VI-SABlock和VICReg-based半监督策略。

Result: MCVI-SANet在10次重复实验中达到最先进准确度，LAI平均R2为0.8123，RMSE为0.4796；SPAD平均R2为0.6846，RMSE为2.4222。

Conclusion: MCVI-SANet通过结合半监督学习和农学先验知识，为基于遥感的精准农业提供了一种有前景的方法。

Abstract: Vegetation index (VI) saturation during the dense canopy stage and limited ground-truth annotations of winter wheat constrain accurate estimation of LAI and SPAD. Existing VI-based and texture-driven machine learning methods exhibit limited feature expressiveness. In addition, deep learning baselines suffer from domain gaps and high data demands, which restrict their generalization. Therefore, this study proposes the Multi-Channel Vegetation Indices Saturation Aware Net (MCVI-SANet), a lightweight semi-supervised vision model. The model incorporates a newly designed Vegetation Index Saturation-Aware Block (VI-SABlock) for adaptive channel-spatial feature enhancement. It also integrates a VICReg-based semi-supervised strategy to further improve generalization. Datasets were partitioned using a vegetation height-informed strategy to maintain representativeness across growth stages. Experiments over 10 repeated runs demonstrate that MCVI-SANet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The model attains an average R2 of 0.8123 and RMSE of 0.4796 for LAI, and an average R2 of 0.6846 and RMSE of 2.4222 for SPAD. This performance surpasses the best-performing baselines, with improvements of 8.95% in average LAI R2 and 8.17% in average SPAD R2. Moreover, MCVI-SANet maintains high inference speed with only 0.10M parameters. Overall, the integration of semi-supervised learning with agronomic priors provides a promising approach for enhancing remote sensing-based precision agriculture.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful priors for image editing tasks such as inpainting and local modification, where the objective is to generate realistic content that remains consistent with observed regions. In particular, zero-shot approaches that leverage a pretrained diffusion model, without any retraining, have been shown to achieve highly effective reconstructions. However, state-of-the-art zero-shot methods typically rely on a sequence of surrogate likelihood functions, whose scores are used as proxies for the ideal score. This procedure however requires vector-Jacobian products through the denoiser at every reverse step, introducing significant memory and runtime overhead. To address this issue, we propose a new likelihood surrogate that yields simple and efficient to sample Gaussian posterior transitions, sidestepping the backpropagation through the denoiser network. Our extensive experiments show that our method achieves strong observation consistency compared with fine-tuned baselines and produces coherent, high-quality reconstructions, all while significantly reducing inference cost.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene representations have enabled high-fidelity novel view synthesis, yet adapting to discrete scene changes and constructing interactive 3D environments remain open challenges in vision and robotics. Existing approaches focus solely on updating a single scene without supporting novel-state synthesis. Others rely on diffusion-based object-background decoupling that works on one state at a time and cannot fuse information across multiple observations. To address these limitations, we introduce RecurGS, a recurrent fusion framework that incrementally integrates discrete Gaussian scene states into a single evolving representation capable of interaction. RecurGS detects object-level changes across consecutive states, aligns their geometric motion using semantic correspondence and Lie-algebra based SE(3) refinement, and performs recurrent updates that preserve historical structures through replay supervision. A voxelized, visibility-aware fusion module selectively incorporates newly observed regions while keeping stable areas fixed, mitigating catastrophic forgetting and enabling efficient long-horizon updates. RecurGS supports object-level manipulation, synthesizes novel scene states without requiring additional scans, and maintains photorealistic fidelity across evolving environments. Extensive experiments across synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework delivers high-quality reconstructions with substantially improved update efficiency, providing a scalable step toward continuously interactive Gaussian worlds.

Conclusion: 通过微调的SAM 2模型和新标注的数据集，为马赛克图像的实时分割提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Art is widely recognized as a reflection of civilization and mosaics represent an important part of cultural heritage. Mosaics are an ancient art form created by arranging small pieces, called tesserae, on a surface using adhesive. Due to their age and fragility, they are prone to damage, highlighting the need for digital preservation. This paper addresses the problem of digitizing mosaics by segmenting the tesserae to separate them from the background within the broader field of Image Segmentation in Computer Vision. We propose a method leveraging Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) by Meta AI, a foundation model that outperforms most conventional segmentation models, to automatically segment mosaics. Due to the limited open datasets in the field, we also create an annotated dataset of mosaic images to fine-tune and evaluate the model. Quantitative evaluation on our testing dataset shows notable improvements compared to the baseline SAM 2 model, with Intersection over Union increasing from 89.00% to 91.02% and Recall from 92.12% to 95.89%. Additionally, on a benchmark proposed by a prior approach, our model achieves an F-measure 3% higher than previous methods and reduces the error in the absolute difference between predicted and actual tesserae from 0.20 to just 0.02. The notable performance of the fine-tuned SAM 2 model together with the newly annotated dataset can pave the way for real-time segmentation of mosaic images.

Abstract: Accurately retrieving images that are semantically similar remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision, as traditional methods often fail to capture the relational and contextual nuances of a scene. We introduce PRISm (Pruning-based Image Retrieval via Importance Prediction on Semantic Graphs), a multimodal framework that advances image-to-image retrieval through two novel components. First, the Importance Prediction Module identifies and retains the most critical objects and relational triplets within an image while pruning irrelevant elements. Second, the Edge-Aware Graph Neural Network explicitly encodes relational structure and integrates global visual features to produce semantically informed image embeddings. PRISm achieves image retrieval that closely aligns with human perception by explicitly modeling the semantic importance of objects and their interactions, capabilities largely absent in prior approaches. Its architecture effectively combines relational reasoning with visual representation, enabling semantically grounded retrieval. Extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate consistently superior top-ranked performance, while qualitative analyses show that PRISm accurately captures key objects and interactions, producing interpretable and semantically meaningful results.

Abstract: Multi-prompt learning methods have emerged as an effective approach for facilitating the rapid adaptation of vision-language models to downstream tasks with limited resources. Existing multi-prompt learning methods primarily focus on utilizing various meticulously designed prompts within a single foundation vision-language model to achieve superior performance. However, the overlooked model-prompt matching bias hinders the development of multi-prompt learning, i.e., the same prompt can convey different semantics across distinct vision-language models, such as CLIP-ViT-B/16 and CLIP-ViT-B/32, resulting in inconsistent predictions of identical prompt. To mitigate the impact of this bias on downstream tasks, we explore an ensemble learning approach to sufficiently aggregate the benefits of diverse predictions. Additionally, we further disclose the presence of sample-prompt matching bias, which originates from the prompt-irrelevant semantics encapsulated in the input samples. Thus, directly utilizing all information from the input samples for generating weights of ensemble learning can lead to suboptimal performance. In response, we extract prompt-relevant semantics from input samples by leveraging the guidance of the information theory-based analysis, adaptively calculating debiased ensemble weights. Overall, we propose Adaptive-Debiased Ensemble MultiPrompt Learning, abbreviated as AmPLe, to mitigate the two types of bias simultaneously. Extensive experiments on three representative tasks, i.e., generalization to novel classes, new target datasets, and unseen domain shifts, show that AmPLe can widely outperform existing methods. Theoretical validation from a causal perspective further supports the effectiveness of AmPLe.

Abstract: Event-based cameras (ECs) have emerged as bio-inspired sensors that report pixel brightness changes asynchronously, offering unmatched speed and efficiency in vision sensing. Despite their high dynamic range, temporal resolution, low power consumption, and computational simplicity, traditional monochrome ECs face limitations in detecting static or slowly moving objects and lack color information essential for certain applications. To address these challenges, we present a novel approach that integrates a Digital Light Processing (DLP) projector, forming Active Structured Light (ASL) for RGB-D sensing. By combining the benefits of ECs and projection-based techniques, our method enables the detection of color and the depth of each pixel separately. Dynamic projection adjustments optimize bandwidth, ensuring selective color data acquisition and yielding colorful point clouds without sacrificing spatial resolution. This integration, facilitated by a commercial TI LightCrafter 4500 projector and a monocular monochrome EC, not only enables frameless RGB-D sensing applications but also achieves remarkable performance milestones. With our approach, we achieved a color detection speed equivalent to 1400 fps and 4 kHz of pixel depth detection, significantly advancing the realm of computer vision across diverse fields from robotics to 3D reconstruction methods.

Abstract: Precise grading of meniscal horn tears is critical in knee injury diagnosis but remains underexplored in automated MRI analysis. Existing methods often rely on coarse study-level labels or binary classification, lacking localization and severity information. In this paper, we introduce MeniMV, a multi-view benchmark dataset specifically designed for horn-specific meniscus injury grading. MeniMV comprises 3,000 annotated knee MRI exams from 750 patients across three medical centers, providing 6,000 co-registered sagittal and coronal images. Each exam is meticulously annotated with four-tier (grade 0-3) severity labels for both anterior and posterior meniscal horns, verified by chief orthopedic physicians. Notably, MeniMV offers more than double the pathology-labeled data volume of prior datasets while uniquely capturing the dual-view diagnostic context essential in clinical practice. To demonstrate the utility of MeniMV, we benchmark multiple state-of-the-art CNN and Transformer-based models. Our extensive experiments establish strong baselines and highlight challenges in severity grading, providing a valuable foundation for future research in automated musculoskeletal imaging.

Conclusion: 提出的对象中心框架在三个基准测试（Charades-STA、QVHighlights和TACoS）上均优于现有方法，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Most existing video moment retrieval methods rely on temporal sequences of frame- or clip-level features that primarily encode global visual and semantic information. However, such representations often fail to capture fine-grained object semantics and appearance, which are crucial for localizing moments described by object-oriented queries involving specific entities and their interactions. In particular, temporal dynamics at the object level have been largely overlooked, limiting the effectiveness of existing approaches in scenarios requiring detailed object-level reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric framework for moment retrieval. Our method first extracts query-relevant objects using a scene graph parser and then generates scene graphs from video frames to represent these objects and their relationships. Based on the scene graphs, we construct object-level feature sequences that encode rich visual and semantic information. These sequences are processed by a relational tracklet transformer, which models spatio-temporal correlations among objects over time. By explicitly capturing object-level state changes, our framework enables more accurate localization of moments aligned with object-oriented queries. We evaluated our method on three benchmarks: Charades-STA, QVHighlights, and TACoS. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks.

Abstract: Domain gaps arising from variations in imaging devices and population distributions pose significant challenges for machine learning in medical image analysis. Existing image-to-image translation methods primarily aim to learn mappings between domains, often generating diverse synthetic data with variations in anatomical scale and shape, but they usually overlook spatial correspondence during the translation process. For clinical applications, traceability, defined as the ability to provide pixel-level correspondences between original and translated images, is equally important. This property enhances clinical interpretability but has been largely overlooked in previous approaches. To address this gap, we propose Plasticine, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first end-to-end image-to-image translation framework explicitly designed with traceability as a core objective. Our method combines intensity translation and spatial transformation within a denoising diffusion framework. This design enables the generation of synthetic images with interpretable intensity transitions and spatially coherent deformations, supporting pixel-wise traceability throughout the translation process.

Conclusion: Adaptive-VoCo通过动态压缩率选择，显著提升了多模态任务的性能，为高效且鲁棒的视觉语言模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on multimodal understanding and reasoning tasks. However, handling high-dimensional visual features often incurs substantial computational and memory costs. VoCo-LLaMA alleviates this issue by compressing visual patch tokens into a few VoCo tokens, reducing computational overhead while preserving strong cross-modal alignment. Nevertheless, such approaches typically adopt a fixed compression rate, limiting their ability to adapt to varying levels of visual complexity. To address this limitation, we propose Adaptive-VoCo, a framework that augments VoCo-LLaMA with a lightweight predictor for adaptive compression. This predictor dynamically selects an optimal compression rate by quantifying an image's visual complexity using statistical cues from the vision encoder, such as patch token entropy and attention map variance. Furthermore, we introduce a joint loss function that integrates rate regularization with complexity alignment. This enables the model to balance inference efficiency with representational capacity, particularly in challenging scenarios. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms fixed-rate baselines across multiple multimodal tasks, highlighting the potential of adaptive visual compression for creating more efficient and robust VLMs.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) offers a unique capability for all-weather, space-based maritime activity monitoring by capturing and imaging strong reflections from ships at sea. A well-defined challenge in this domain is ship type classification. Due to the high diversity and complexity of ship types, accurate recognition is difficult and typically requires specialized deep learning models. These models, however, depend on large, high-quality ground-truth datasets to achieve robust performance and generalization. Furthermore, the growing variety of SAR satellites operating at different frequencies and spatial resolutions has amplified the need for more annotated datasets to enhance model accuracy. To address this, we present the NovaSAR Automated Ship Target Recognition (NASTaR) dataset. This dataset comprises of 3415 ship patches extracted from NovaSAR S-band imagery, with labels matched to AIS data. It includes distinctive features such as 23 unique classes, inshore/offshore separation, and an auxiliary wake dataset for patches where ship wakes are visible. We validated the dataset applicability across prominent ship-type classification scenarios using benchmark deep learning models. Results demonstrate over 60% accuracy for classifying four major ship types, over 70% for a three-class scenario, more than 75% for distinguishing cargo from tanker ships, and over 87% for identifying fishing vessels.

Conclusion: GTMA框架通过动态表示优化有效解决了模态不对称问题，显著提升了开放世界应用中的零样本和少样本性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) struggle in open-world applications, where out-of-distribution (OOD) concepts often trigger cross-modal alignment collapse and severely degrade zero-shot performance. We identify the root cause as modal asymmetry: while the visual encoder can extract discriminative features from unseen images, the text encoder is constrained by a fixed discrete vocabulary and cannot synthesize new semantic anchors. Existing approaches such as CoOp or LoRA provide only partial remedies, as they remain confined to the pre-trained semantic space.
  To overcome this bottleneck, we propose dynamic representation optimization, realized through the Guided Target-Matching Adaptation (GTMA) framework. At inference time, GTMA constructs a continuous pseudo-word embedding that best aligns with an OOD image's visual anchor, effectively bypassing vocabulary limitations. The optimization is driven by an adaptive gradient-based representation policy optimization algorithm, which incorporates semantic regularization to preserve plausibility and compatibility with the model's prior knowledge.
  Experiments on ImageNet-R and the VISTA-Beyond benchmark demonstrate that GTMA improves zero-shot and few-shot OOD accuracy by up to 15-20 percent over the base VLM while maintaining performance on in-distribution concepts. Ablation studies further confirm the necessity of pseudo-word optimization.

Abstract: Event cameras offer a high temporal resolution over traditional frame-based cameras, which makes them suitable for motion and structure estimation. However, it has been unclear how event-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) approaches could leverage fine-grained temporal information of sparse events. This work proposes a framework to address the trade-off between accuracy and temporal resolution in event-based 3DGS. Our key idea is to decouple the rendering into two branches: event-by-event geometry (depth) rendering and snapshot-based radiance (intensity) rendering, by using ray-tracing and the image of warped events. The extensive evaluation shows that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the real-world datasets and competitive performance on the synthetic dataset. Also, the proposed method works without prior information (e.g., pretrained image reconstruction models) or COLMAP-based initialization, is more flexible in the event selection number, and achieves sharp reconstruction on scene edges with fast training time. We hope that this work deepens our understanding of the sparse nature of events for 3D reconstruction. The code will be released.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于多源不确定性融合的检测框架，有效区分AI生成与自然图像，尤其在分布偏移和对抗攻击下表现稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成图像越来越逼真，区分它们与自然图像变得更具挑战性。

Method: 结合Fisher信息、蒙特卡洛Dropout的熵不确定性以及高斯过程分类器的预测方差，通过粒子群优化学习最优权重并确定自适应拒绝阈值。

Result: 组合不确定性方法在未见生成器上保持约70%的错误拒绝率，成功过滤多数误分类AI样本，并在对抗攻击中表现良好。

Conclusion: 多源不确定性融合为AI生成图像检测提供了弹性且自适应的解决方案。

Abstract: As AI-generated images become increasingly photorealistic, distinguishing them from natural images poses a growing challenge. This paper presents a robust detection framework that leverages multiple uncertainty measures to decide whether to trust or reject a model's predictions. We focus on three complementary techniques: Fisher Information, which captures the sensitivity of model parameters to input variations; entropy-based uncertainty from Monte Carlo Dropout, which reflects predictive variability; and predictive variance from a Deep Kernel Learning framework using a Gaussian Process classifier. To integrate these diverse uncertainty signals, Particle Swarm Optimisation is used to learn optimal weightings and determine an adaptive rejection threshold. The model is trained on Stable Diffusion-generated images and evaluated on GLIDE, VQDM, Midjourney, BigGAN, and StyleGAN3, each introducing significant distribution shifts. While standard metrics such as prediction probability and Fisher-based measures perform well in distribution, their effectiveness degrades under shift. In contrast, the Combined Uncertainty measure consistently achieves an incorrect rejection rate of approximately 70 percent on unseen generators, successfully filtering most misclassified AI samples. Although the system occasionally rejects correct predictions from newer generators, this conservative behaviour is acceptable, as rejected samples can support retraining. The framework maintains high acceptance of accurate predictions for natural images and in-domain AI data. Under adversarial attacks using FGSM and PGD, the Combined Uncertainty method rejects around 61 percent of successful attacks, while GP-based uncertainty alone achieves up to 80 percent. Overall, the results demonstrate that multi-source uncertainty fusion provides a resilient and adaptive solution for AI-generated image detection.

TL;DR: Point-VLA通过视觉提示增强语言指令，显著提升了VLA模型在复杂场景中的对象引用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型在仅依赖文本提示时，对象引用能力受限，尤其是在杂乱或分布外场景中。

Method: 提出了Point-VLA，一种即插即用的策略，通过显式视觉提示（如边界框）增强语言指令，以解决引用模糊并实现精确的对象级定位。开发了自动数据标注流程以高效扩展视觉基础数据集。

Result: 在多样化真实世界引用任务中，Point-VLA表现优于纯文本指令VLA，尤其是在杂乱或未见对象场景中，展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Point-VLA通过像素级视觉定位有效解决了对象引用模糊问题，实现了更通用的具身控制。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models align vision and language with embodied control, but their object referring ability remains limited when relying solely on text prompt, especially in cluttered or out-of-distribution (OOD) scenes. In this study, we introduce the Point-VLA, a plug-and-play policy that augments language instructions with explicit visual cues (e.g., bounding boxes) to resolve referential ambiguity and enable precise object-level grounding. To efficiently scale visually grounded datasets, we further develop an automatic data annotation pipeline requiring minimal human effort. We evaluate Point-VLA on diverse real-world referring tasks and observe consistently stronger performance than text-only instruction VLAs, particularly in cluttered or unseen-object scenarios, with robust generalization. These results demonstrate that Point-VLA effectively resolves object referring ambiguity through pixel-level visual grounding, achieving more generalizable embodied control.

Abstract: Chronic wounds, including diabetic foot ulcers which affect up to one-third of people with diabetes, impose a substantial clinical and economic burden, with U.S. healthcare costs exceeding 25 billion dollars annually. Current wound assessment remains predominantly subjective, leading to inconsistent classification and delayed interventions. We present WoundNet-Ensemble, an Internet of Medical Things system leveraging a novel ensemble of three complementary deep learning architectures: ResNet-50, the self-supervised Vision Transformer DINOv2, and Swin Transformer, for automated classification of six clinically distinct wound types. Our system achieves 99.90 percent ensemble accuracy on a comprehensive dataset of 5,175 wound images spanning diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, venous ulcers, thermal burns, pilonidal sinus wounds, and fungating malignant tumors. The weighted fusion strategy demonstrates a 3.7 percent improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we implement a longitudinal wound healing tracker that computes healing rates, severity scores, and generates clinical alerts. This work demonstrates a robust, accurate, and clinically deployable tool for modernizing wound care through artificial intelligence, addressing critical needs in telemedicine and remote patient monitoring. The implementation and trained models will be made publicly available to support reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLN基准局限于固定、小规模数据集和简单的物理模拟，限制了模拟到现实的泛化洞察，并造成了研究空白。任务碎片化阻碍了统一/共享进展，而有限的数据规模无法满足现代基于LLM的预训练需求。

Conclusion: VLNVerse旨在缩小模拟导航与现实世界泛化之间的差距，为研究界提供了一个关键工具，以推动可扩展、通用型具身运动代理的研究。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Vision-Language Navigation (VLN), existing benchmarks remain confined to fixed, small-scale datasets with naive physical simulation. These shortcomings limit the insight that the benchmarks provide into sim-to-real generalization, and create a significant research gap. Furthermore, task fragmentation prevents unified/shared progress in the area, while limited data scales fail to meet the demands of modern LLM-based pretraining. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VLNVerse: a new large-scale, extensible benchmark designed for Versatile, Embodied, Realistic Simulation, and Evaluation. VLNVerse redefines VLN as a scalable, full-stack embodied AI problem. Its Versatile nature unifies previously fragmented tasks into a single framework and provides an extensible toolkit for researchers. Its Embodied design moves beyond intangible and teleporting "ghost" agents that support full-kinematics in a Realistic Simulation powered by a robust physics engine. We leverage the scale and diversity of VLNVerse to conduct a comprehensive Evaluation of existing methods, from classic models to MLLM-based agents. We also propose a novel unified multi-task model capable of addressing all tasks within the benchmark. VLNVerse aims to narrow the gap between simulated navigation and real-world generalization, providing the community with a vital tool to boost research towards scalable, general-purpose embodied locomotion agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MDA方法在源模型预训练上缺乏统一框架，多为临时方案（如权重共享或独立训练），无法充分利用源域分布的相似性。

Method: 采用分层贝叶斯框架，利用不同源数据分布的相似性优化MDA的预训练过程。

Result: 在Daily-DA RGB视频数据集上，贝叶斯框架在人类动作识别任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的贝叶斯框架在MDA任务中显著提升了识别准确率，相比现有方法有17.29%的改进。

Abstract: Multisource domain adaptation (MDA) aims to use multiple source datasets with available labels to infer labels on a target dataset without available labels for target supervision. Prior works on MDA in the literature is ad-hoc as the pretraining of source models is either based on weight sharing or uses independently trained models. This work proposes a Bayesian framework for pretraining in MDA by considering that the distributions of different source domains are typically similar. The Hierarchical Bayesian Framework uses similarity between the different source data distributions to optimize the pretraining for MDA. Experiments using the proposed Bayesian framework for MDA show that our framework improves accuracy on recognition tasks for a large benchmark dataset. Performance comparison with state-of-the-art MDA methods on the challenging problem of human action recognition in multi-domain benchmark Daily-DA RGB video shows the proposed Bayesian Framework offers a 17.29% improvement in accuracy when compared to the state-of-the-art methods in the literature.

Motivation: 解决基于深度学习的手语识别模型计算资源需求高、难以在边缘设备上部署的问题。

Method: 采用并行双向储备计算（PBRC）架构，结合MediaPipe实时手部跟踪技术，提取手部关节坐标作为输入特征。

Result: 在WLASL数据集上，系统达到top-1、top-5和top-10准确率分别为60.85%、85.86%和91.74%，训练时间大幅缩短至18.67秒。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种轻量级的手语识别系统，结合并行双向储备计算（PBRC）与MediaPipe，显著降低了计算资源需求，适合边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) facilitates communication between deaf and hearing communities. Deep learning based SLR models are commonly used but require extensive computational resources, making them unsuitable for deployment on edge devices. To address these limitations, we propose a lightweight SLR system that combines parallel bidirectional reservoir computing (PBRC) with MediaPipe. MediaPipe enables real-time hand tracking and precise extraction of hand joint coordinates, which serve as input features for the PBRC architecture. The proposed PBRC architecture consists of two echo state network (ESN) based bidirectional reservoir computing (BRC) modules arranged in parallel to capture temporal dependencies, thereby creating a rich feature representation for classification. We trained our PBRC-based SLR system on the Word-Level American Sign Language (WLASL) video dataset, achieving top-1, top-5, and top-10 accuracies of 60.85%, 85.86%, and 91.74%, respectively. Training time was significantly reduced to 18.67 seconds due to the intrinsic properties of reservoir computing, compared to over 55 minutes for deep learning based methods such as Bi-GRU. This approach offers a lightweight, cost-effective solution for real-time SLR on edge devices.

Motivation: Med-LVLMs在临床应用中因视觉理解未对齐而产生幻觉输出，主要由于视觉表示学习不足和视觉注意力对齐差。

Method: 提出了MEDALIGN框架，通过从特定领域的CLIP模型转移视觉对齐知识，引入两种蒸馏损失：空间感知视觉对齐损失和注意力感知蒸馏损失。

Result: 在医学报告生成和医学视觉问答基准测试中，MEDALIGN显著提升了性能和可解释性，输出更视觉接地。

Conclusion: MEDALIGN通过空间感知视觉对齐损失和注意力感知蒸馏损失，有效提升了Med-LVLMs的性能和可解释性，减少了幻觉输出。

Abstract: Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) have shown promising results in clinical applications, but often suffer from hallucinated outputs due to misaligned visual understanding. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations contributing to this issue: insufficient visual representation learning and poor visual attention alignment. To address these problems, we propose MEDALIGN, a simple, lightweight alignment distillation framework that transfers visual alignment knowledge from a domain-specific Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model to Med-LVLMs. MEDALIGN introduces two distillation losses: a spatial-aware visual alignment loss based on visual token-level similarity structures, and an attention-aware distillation loss that guides attention toward diagnostically relevant regions. Extensive experiments on medical report generation and medical visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks show that MEDALIGN consistently improves both performance and interpretability, yielding more visually grounded outputs.

Method: 首先使用数据驱动的基础模型初始化核心组件，包括物体网格和姿态、场景点云以及手部姿态，然后应用两阶段优化方法恢复从抓取到交互的完整手-物体运动，确保与输入视频中观察到的场景信息一致。

Result: 成功构建了一个能够从单目RGB视频中重建场景内物体操作的系统，解决了场景重建、手-物体深度模糊以及物理交互合理性等挑战。

Conclusion: 该系统首次实现了从单目RGB视频中重建场景内物体操作的问题，通过数据驱动的基础模型和两阶段优化方法，解决了现有方法在度量准确性和实用性上的不足。

Abstract: We build the first system to address the problem of reconstructing in-scene object manipulation from a monocular RGB video. It is challenging due to ill-posed scene reconstruction, ambiguous hand-object depth, and the need for physically plausible interactions. Existing methods operate in hand centric coordinates and ignore the scene, hindering metric accuracy and practical use. In our method, we first use data-driven foundation models to initialize the core components, including the object mesh and poses, the scene point cloud, and the hand poses. We then apply a two-stage optimization that recovers a complete hand-object motion from grasping to interaction, which remains consistent with the scene information observed in the input video.

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show great potential in natural image understanding. Yet, they perform well, mainly on reasoning in-view contents within the image frame. This paper presents the first study on out-of-view (OOV) understanding, i.e., the ability to reason objects, activities, and scenes beyond the visible frame of a perspective view. Our technical contributions are threefold. First, we design OpenView, a four-stage pipeline to massively generate multi-choice VQA by leveraging panoramic imagery to enable context-rich and spatial-grounded VQA synthesis with free-view framing. Second, we curate OpenView-Dataset, a high-quality synthetic dataset from diverse real-world panoramas to empower MLLMs upon supervised fine-tuning. Third, we build OpenView-Bench, a benchmark that jointly measures choice and rationale accuracy for interpretable and diagnosable evaluation. Experimental results show that despite having a large gap from human performance in OOV VQA answer selection, upon empowered by OpenView, multiple MLLMs can consistently boost their performance, uplifted from 48.6% to 64.1% on average.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的混合3D深度学习模型在PAS诊断中表现出色，展示了作为计算机辅助诊断工具的潜力，有望提高诊断的一致性和准确性。

Abstract: Placenta Accreta Spectrum (PAS) is a serious obstetric condition that can be challenging to diagnose with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) due to variability in radiologists' interpretations. To overcome this challenge, a hybrid 3D deep learning model for automated PAS detection from volumetric MRI scans is proposed in this study. The model integrates a 3D DenseNet121 to capture local features and a 3D Vision Transformer (ViT) to model global spatial context. It was developed and evaluated on a retrospective dataset of 1,133 MRI volumes. Multiple 3D deep learning architectures were also evaluated for comparison. On an independent test set, the DenseNet121-ViT model achieved the highest performance with a five-run average accuracy of 84.3%. These results highlight the strength of hybrid CNN-Transformer models as a computer-aided diagnosis tool. The model's performance demonstrates a clear potential to assist radiologists by providing a robust decision support to improve diagnostic consistency across interpretations, and ultimately enhance the accuracy and timeliness of PAS diagnosis.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的基于策略优化的轻量级代理框架在无标签环境中有效解决了复杂图像修复的效率问题，并在多种退化场景下实现了与现有方法相当或更优的性能。

Abstract: Complex image restoration aims to recover high-quality images from inputs affected by multiple degradations such as blur, noise, rain, and compression artifacts. Recent restoration agents, powered by vision-language models and large language models, offer promising restoration capabilities but suffer from significant efficiency bottlenecks due to reflection, rollback, and iterative tool searching. Moreover, their performance heavily depends on degradation recognition models that require extensive annotations for training, limiting their applicability in label-free environments. To address these limitations, we propose a policy optimization-based restoration framework that learns an lightweight agent to determine tool-calling sequences. The agent operates in a sequential decision process, selecting the most appropriate restoration operation at each step to maximize final image quality. To enable training within label-free environments, we introduce a novel reward mechanism driven by multimodal large language models, which act as human-aligned evaluator and provide perceptual feedback for policy improvement. Once trained, our agent executes a deterministic restoration plans without redundant tool invocations, significantly accelerating inference while maintaining high restoration quality. Extensive experiments show that despite using no supervision, our method matches SOTA performance on full-reference metrics and surpasses existing approaches on no-reference metrics across diverse degradation scenarios.

Conclusion: 语义化的基于图推理的视觉地点识别（VPR）是一种可行且可解释的替代方案，特别适合对安全性敏感和资源受限的场景。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) in long-term deployment requires reasoning beyond pixel similarity: systems must make transparent, interpretable decisions that remain robust under lighting, weather and seasonal change. We present Text2Graph VPR, an explainable semantic localization system that converts image sequences into textual scene descriptions, parses those descriptions into structured scene graphs, and reasons over the resulting graphs to identify places. Scene graphs capture objects, attributes and pairwise relations; we aggregate per-frame graphs into a compact place representation and perform retrieval with a dual-similarity mechanism that fuses learned Graph Attention Network (GAT) embeddings and a Shortest-Path (SP) kernel for structural matching. This hybrid design enables both learned semantic matching and topology-aware comparison, and -- critically -- produces human-readable intermediate representations that support diagnostic analysis and improve transparency in the decision process. We validate the system on Oxford RobotCar and MSLS (Amman/San Francisco) benchmarks and demonstrate robust retrieval under severe appearance shifts, along with zero-shot operation using human textual queries. The results illustrate that semantic, graph-based reasoning is a viable and interpretable alternative for place recognition, particularly suited to safety-sensitive and resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Generating or editing images directly from Neural signals has immense potential at the intersection of neuroscience, vision, and Brain-computer interaction. In this paper, We present Uni-Neur2Img, a unified framework for neural signal-driven image generation and editing. The framework introduces a parameter-efficient LoRA-based neural signal injection module that independently processes each conditioning signal as a pluggable component, facilitating flexible multi-modal conditioning without altering base model parameters. Additionally, we employ a causal attention mechanism accommodate the long-sequence modeling demands of conditional generation tasks. Existing neural-driven generation research predominantly focuses on textual modalities as conditions or intermediate representations, resulting in limited exploration of visual modalities as direct conditioning signals. To bridge this research gap, we introduce the EEG-Style dataset. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across public benchmarks and self-collected neural signal datasets: (1) EEG-driven image generation on the public CVPR40 dataset; (2) neural signal-guided image editing on the public Loongx dataset for semantic-aware local modifications; and (3) EEG-driven style transfer on our self-collected EEG-Style dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in generation fidelity, editing consistency, and style transfer quality while maintaining low computational overhead and strong scalability to additional modalities. Thus, Uni-Neur2Img offers a unified, efficient, and extensible solution for bridging neural signals and visual content generation.

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了零样本学习（ZSL）模型在类级别和概念级别攻击下的脆弱性，并提出了新的攻击方法（CBEA、CPconA、NCPconA），强调了提升ZSL模型对抗鲁棒性的必要性。

Abstract: Zero-shot Learning (ZSL) aims to enable image classifiers to recognize images from unseen classes that were not included during training. Unlike traditional supervised classification, ZSL typically relies on learning a mapping from visual features to predefined, human-understandable class concepts. While ZSL models promise to improve generalization and interpretability, their robustness under systematic input perturbations remain unclear. In this study, we present an empirical analysis about the robustness of existing ZSL methods at both classlevel and concept-level. Specifically, we successfully disrupted their class prediction by the well-known non-target class attack (clsA). However, in the Generalized Zero-shot Learning (GZSL) setting, we observe that the success of clsA is only at the original best-calibrated point. After the attack, the optimal bestcalibration point shifts, and ZSL models maintain relatively strong performance at other calibration points, indicating that clsA results in a spurious attack success in the GZSL. To address this, we propose the Class-Bias Enhanced Attack (CBEA), which completely eliminates GZSL accuracy across all calibrated points by enhancing the gap between seen and unseen class probabilities.Next, at concept-level attack, we introduce two novel attack modes: Class-Preserving Concept Attack (CPconA) and NonClass-Preserving Concept Attack (NCPconA). Our extensive experiments evaluate three typical ZSL models across various architectures from the past three years and reveal that ZSL models are vulnerable not only to the traditional class attack but also to concept-based attacks. These attacks allow malicious actors to easily manipulate class predictions by erasing or introducing concepts. Our findings highlight a significant performance gap between existing approaches, emphasizing the need for improved adversarial robustness in current ZSL models.

*Yue Wen,Liang Song,Hesheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SplatBright是一个通用的3D高斯框架，通过物理引导的光照建模和几何-外观解耦，实现了低光稀疏视图的3D重建和增强，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在低光稀疏视图3D重建中面临的曝光不平衡、色彩保真度下降以及视图不一致性问题。

Method: 采用双分支预测器进行3D高斯参数的几何初始化，并通过频率先验和外观细化模块实现光照、材质和视图相关线索的分离。

Result: 在公开和自收集数据集上的实验表明，SplatBright在新型视图合成、跨视图一致性和对未见低光场景的泛化能力上优于现有2D和3D方法。

Conclusion: SplatBright 是第一个通用的3D高斯框架，用于从稀疏的sRGB输入中联合进行低光增强和重建，相比现有方法在视图一致性和泛化能力上表现更优。

Abstract: Low-light 3D reconstruction from sparse views remains challenging due to exposure imbalance and degraded color fidelity. While existing methods struggle with view inconsistency and require per-scene training, we propose SplatBright, which is, to our knowledge, the first generalizable 3D Gaussian framework for joint low-light enhancement and reconstruction from sparse sRGB inputs. Our key idea is to integrate physically guided illumination modeling with geometry-appearance decoupling for consistent low-light reconstruction. Specifically, we adopt a dual-branch predictor that provides stable geometric initialization of 3D Gaussian parameters. On the appearance side, illumination consistency leverages frequency priors to enable controllable and cross-view coherent lighting, while an appearance refinement module further separates illumination, material, and view-dependent cues to recover fine texture. To tackle the lack of large-scale geometrically consistent paired data, we synthesize dark views via a physics-based camera model for training. Extensive experiments on public and self-collected datasets demonstrate that SplatBright achieves superior novel view synthesis, cross-view consistency, and better generalization to unseen low-light scenes compared with both 2D and 3D methods.

Result: 在RSICD、RSITMD和RS5M三个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的跨模态门控注意力和正负感知注意力机制显著提升了遥感图像-文本检索任务中对伪匹配对（PMPs）的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) image-text retrieval faces significant challenges in real-world datasets due to the presence of Pseudo-Matched Pairs (PMPs), semantically mismatched or weakly aligned image-text pairs, which hinder the learning of reliable cross-modal alignments. To address this issue, we propose a novel retrieval framework that leverages Cross-Modal Gated Attention and a Positive-Negative Awareness Attention mechanism to mitigate the impact of such noisy associations. The gated module dynamically regulates cross-modal information flow, while the awareness mechanism explicitly distinguishes informative (positive) cues from misleading (negative) ones during alignment learning. Extensive experiments on three benchmark RS datasets, i.e., RSICD, RSITMD, and RS5M, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in handling real-world mismatches and PMPs in RS image-text retrieval tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频大语言模型中的感知幻觉问题严重限制了其实际应用，现有方法往往牺牲模型的理解和推理能力。

Method: SmartSight通过生成多个候选响应，利用Temporal Attention Collapse评分评估每个响应的幻觉程度，并通过Visual Attention Vanishing点提高效率。

Result: SmartSight将Qwen2.5-VL-7B在VRIPT-HAL上的幻觉率降低了10.59%，在VideoMMMU上的性能提升了8.86%。

Conclusion: SmartSight有效提高了开源视频大语言模型的可靠性，显著减少了幻觉现象，同时提升了视频理解和推理能力。

Abstract: Despite Video Large Language Models having rapidly advanced in recent years, perceptual hallucinations pose a substantial safety risk, which severely restricts their real-world applicability. While several methods for hallucination mitigation have been proposed, they often compromise the model's capacity for video understanding and reasoning. In this work, we propose SmartSight, a pioneering step to address this issue in a training-free manner by leveraging the model's own introspective capabilities. Specifically, SmartSight generates multiple candidate responses to uncover low-hallucinated outputs that are often obscured by standard greedy decoding. It assesses the hallucination of each response using the Temporal Attention Collapse score, which measures whether the model over-focuses on trivial temporal regions of the input video when generating the response. To improve efficiency, SmartSight identifies the Visual Attention Vanishing point, enabling more accurate hallucination estimation and early termination of hallucinated responses, leading to a substantial reduction in decoding cost. Experiments show that SmartSight substantially lowers hallucinations for Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 10.59% on VRIPT-HAL, while simultaneously enhancing video understanding and reasoning, boosting performance on VideoMMMU by up to 8.86%. These results highlight SmartSight's effectiveness in improving the reliability of open-source Video-LLMs.

Motivation: 传统文本到图像扩散推理采用同步时间步调度，限制了图像细节和纹理的控制。

Method: 提出了异步推理机制，将潜在状态的时间步与去噪器的条件时间步解耦，并引入轻量级时间步预测模块（TPM）和Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）训练方法。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium和Flux.1-dev上，该方法在MS-COCO 2014和T2I-CompBench数据集上优化了综合奖励（Image Reward、HPSv2、CLIP Score和Pick Score的平均值），表现一致提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过异步推理机制和轻量级时间步预测模块（TPM）优化了文本到图像扩散推理，在保持图像更新计划不变的同时，提高了图像细节和纹理丰富度的控制能力。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion inference typically follows synchronized schedules, where the numerical integrator advances the latent state to the same timestep at which the denoiser is conditioned. We propose an asynchronous inference mechanism that decouples these two, allowing the denoiser to be conditioned at a different, learned timestep while keeping image update schedule unchanged. A lightweight timestep prediction module (TPM), trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), selects a more feasible conditioning timestep based on the current state, effectively choosing a desired noise level to control image detail and textural richness. At deployment, a scaling hyper-parameter can be used to interpolate between the original and de-synchronized timesteps, enabling conservative or aggressive adjustments. To keep the study computationally affordable, we cap the inference at 15 steps for SD3.5 and 10 steps for Flux. Evaluated on Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium and Flux.1-dev across MS-COCO 2014 and T2I-CompBench datasets, our method optimizes a composite reward that averages Image Reward, HPSv2, CLIP Score and Pick Score, and shows consistent improvement.

Abstract: We present brat (brain report alignment transformer), a multi-view representation learning framework for brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) trained on MRIs paired with clinical reports. Brain MRIs present unique challenges due to the presence of numerous, highly varied, and often subtle abnormalities that are localized to a few slices within a 3D volume. To address these challenges, we introduce a brain MRI dataset $10\times$ larger than existing ones, containing approximately 80,000 3D scans with corresponding radiology reports, and propose a multi-view pre-training approach inspired by advances in document retrieval. We develop an implicit query-feature matching mechanism and adopt concepts from quality-diversity to obtain multi-view embeddings of MRIs that are aligned with the clinical features given by report sentences. We evaluate our approach across multiple vision-language and vision tasks, demonstrating substantial performance improvements. The brat foundation models are publicly released.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了预训练视频模型在多视图几何任务中的强大适应性和性能，通过简单的线性解码器和迭代优化即可达到最先进水平。

Abstract: This paper presents an investigation of vision transformer learning for multi-view geometry tasks, such as optical flow estimation, by fine-tuning video foundation models. Unlike previous methods that involve custom architectural designs and task-specific pretraining, our research finds that general-purpose models pretrained on videos can be readily transferred to multi-view problems with minimal adaptation. The core insight is that general-purpose attention between patches learns temporal and spatial information for geometric reasoning. We demonstrate that appending a linear decoder to the Transformer backbone produces satisfactory results, and iterative refinement can further elevate performance to stateof-the-art levels. This conceptually simple approach achieves top cross-dataset generalization results for optical flow estimation with end-point error (EPE) of 0.69, 1.78, and 3.15 on the Sintel clean, Sintel final, and KITTI datasets, respectively. Our method additionally establishes a new record on the online test benchmark with EPE values of 0.79, 1.88, and F1 value of 3.79. Applications to 3D depth estimation and stereo matching also show strong performance, illustrating the versatility of video-pretrained models in addressing geometric vision tasks.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在密集视图设置中预测过多基元且无法控制基元数量的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段优化过程：第一阶段是像素对齐高斯训练（PGT），学习初始基元预测；第二阶段是重要性感知高斯微调（IGF），学习对基元进行排序并根据目标基元数量自适应调整参数。

Result: 在多个密集视图设置下的实验表明，EcoSplat 在严格的基元数量约束下表现稳健且优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EcoSplat 是一种效率可控的前馈 3DGS 框架，能够在推理时根据目标基元数量自适应预测 3D 表示，适用于灵活的下游渲染任务。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient one-pass scene reconstruction, providing 3D representations for novel view synthesis without per-scene optimization. However, existing methods typically predict pixel-aligned primitives per-view, producing an excessive number of primitives in dense-view settings and offering no explicit control over the number of predicted Gaussians. To address this, we propose EcoSplat, the first efficiency-controllable feed-forward 3DGS framework that adaptively predicts the 3D representation for any given target primitive count at inference time. EcoSplat adopts a two-stage optimization process. The first stage is Pixel-aligned Gaussian Training (PGT) where our model learns initial primitive prediction. The second stage is Importance-aware Gaussian Finetuning (IGF) stage where our model learns rank primitives and adaptively adjust their parameters based on the target primitive count. Extensive experiments across multiple dense-view settings show that EcoSplat is robust and outperforms state-of-the-art methods under strict primitive-count constraints, making it well-suited for flexible downstream rendering tasks.

Abstract: Image correction and rectangling are valuable tasks in practical photography systems such as smartphones. Recent remarkable advancements in deep learning have undeniably brought about substantial performance improvements in these fields. Nevertheless, existing methods mainly rely on task-specific architectures. This significantly restricts their generalization ability and effective application across a wide range of different tasks. In this paper, we introduce the Unified Rectification Framework (UniRect), a comprehensive approach that addresses these practical tasks from a consistent distortion rectification perspective. Our approach incorporates various task-specific inverse problems into a general distortion model by simulating different types of lenses. To handle diverse distortions, UniRect adopts one task-agnostic rectification framework with a dual-component structure: a {Deformation Module}, which utilizes a novel Residual Progressive Thin-Plate Spline (RP-TPS) model to address complex geometric deformations, and a subsequent Restoration Module, which employs Residual Mamba Blocks (RMBs) to counteract the degradation caused by the deformation process and enhance the fidelity of the output image. Moreover, a Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoEs) structure is designed to circumvent heavy task competition in multi-task learning due to varying distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our models have achieved state-of-the-art performance compared with other up-to-date methods.

Abstract: Predicting breast cancer recurrence risk is a critical clinical challenge. This study investigates the potential of computational pathology to stratify patients using deep learning on routine Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained whole-slide images (WSIs). We developed and compared three Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) frameworks -- CLAM-SB, ABMIL, and ConvNeXt-MIL-XGBoost -- on an in-house dataset of 210 patient cases. The models were trained to predict 5-year recurrence risk, categorized into three tiers (low, medium, high), with ground truth labels established by the 21-gene Recurrence Score. Features were extracted using the UNI and CONCH pre-trained models. In a 5-fold cross-validation, the modified CLAM-SB model demonstrated the strongest performance, achieving a mean Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.836 and a classification accuracy of 76.2%.

Conclusion: $M^3-Verse$ 提供了一个具有挑战性的新测试平台，以促进下一代模型的发展，这些模型能更全面地理解动态视觉世界。

Abstract: Modern Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated extraordinary ability in static image and single-state spatial-temporal understanding. However, their capacity to comprehend the dynamic changes of objects within a shared spatial context between two distinct video observations, remains largely unexplored. This ability to reason about transformations within a consistent environment is particularly crucial for advancements in the field of spatial intelligence. In this paper, we introduce $M^3-Verse$, a Multi-Modal, Multi-State, Multi-Dimensional benchmark, to formally evaluate this capability. It is built upon paired videos that provide multi-perspective observations of an indoor scene before and after a state change. The benchmark contains a total of 270 scenes and 2,932 questions, which are categorized into over 50 subtasks that probe 4 core capabilities. We evaluate 16 state-of-the-art LMMs and observe their limitations in tracking state transitions. To address these challenges, we further propose a simple yet effective baseline that achieves significant performance improvements in multi-state perception. $M^3-Verse$ thus provides a challenging new testbed to catalyze the development of next-generation models with a more holistic understanding of our dynamic visual world.

Conclusion: MAG框架通过解耦内存压缩和帧生成任务，显著提升了长视频生成中的历史场景一致性，同时保持了在标准视频生成基准上的竞争力。

Abstract: Frame-level autoregressive (frame-AR) models have achieved significant progress, enabling real-time video generation comparable to bidirectional diffusion models and serving as a foundation for interactive world models and game engines. However, current approaches in long video generation typically rely on window attention, which naively discards historical context outside the window, leading to catastrophic forgetting and scene inconsistency; conversely, retaining full history incurs prohibitive memory costs. To address this trade-off, we propose \textbf{Memorize-and-Generate (MAG)}, a framework that decouples memory compression and frame generation into distinct tasks. Specifically, we train a memory model to compress historical information into a compact KV cache, and a separate generator model to synthesize subsequent frames utilizing this compressed representation. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{MAG-Bench} to strictly evaluate historical memory retention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAG achieves superior historical scene consistency while maintaining competitive performance on standard video generation benchmarks.

Abstract: The ability for AI agents to "think with images" requires a sophisticated blend of reasoning and perception. However, current open multimodal agents still largely fall short on the reasoning aspect crucial for real-world tasks like analyzing documents with dense charts/diagrams and navigating maps. To address this gap, we introduce O3-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal reasoning with interleaved attention to visual details. O3-Bench features challenging problems that require agents to piece together subtle visual information from distinct image areas through multi-step reasoning. The problems are highly challenging even for frontier systems like OpenAI o3, which only obtains 40.8% accuracy on O3-Bench. To make progress, we propose InSight-o3, a multi-agent framework consisting of a visual reasoning agent (vReasoner) and a visual search agent (vSearcher) for which we introduce the task of generalized visual search -- locating relational, fuzzy, or conceptual regions described in free-form language, beyond just simple objects or figures in natural images. We then present a multimodal LLM purpose-trained for this task via reinforcement learning. As a plug-and-play agent, our vSearcher empowers frontier multimodal models (as vReasoners), significantly improving their performance on a wide range of benchmarks. This marks a concrete step towards powerful o3-like open systems. Our code and dataset can be found at https://github.com/m-Just/InSight-o3 .

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) deliver strong vision-language performance but at high computational cost, driven by numerous visual tokens processed by the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder. Existing token pruning strategies are inadequate: LLM-stage token pruning overlooks the ViT's overhead, while conventional ViT token pruning, without language guidance, risks discarding textually critical visual cues and introduces feature distortions amplified by the ViT's bidirectional attention. To meet these challenges, we propose IPCV, a training-free, information-preserving compression framework for MLLM visual encoders. IPCV enables aggressive token pruning inside the ViT via Neighbor-Guided Reconstruction (NGR) that temporarily reconstructs pruned tokens to participate in attention with minimal overhead, then fully restores them before passing to the LLM. Besides, we introduce Attention Stabilization (AS) to further alleviate the negative influence from token pruning by approximating the K/V of pruned tokens. It can be directly applied to previous LLM-side token pruning methods to enhance their performance. Extensive experiments show that IPCV substantially reduces end-to-end computation and outperforms state-of-the-art training-free token compression methods across diverse image and video benchmarks.

Motivation: The motivation stems from the observation that existing action recognition methods often overlook the multi-granularity nature of actions, leading to suboptimal performance. The authors aim to address this by comprehensively capturing spatio-temporal cues across various scales.

Method: The proposed method, Context-Aware Network (CAN), includes two core modules: the Multi-scale Temporal Cue Module (MTCM) for extracting temporal cues at multiple scales, and the Group Spatial Cue Module (GSCM) for extracting spatial cues at different scales by grouping feature maps.

Result: CAN achieves competitive results on five benchmark datasets: 50.4% on Something-Something V1, 63.9% on Something-Something V2, 88.4% on Diving48, 74.9% on Kinetics-400, and 86.9% on UCF101, outperforming most mainstream methods.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that capturing multi-scale spatio-temporal cues is essential for robust action recognition, as demonstrated by the competitive performance of the Context-Aware Network (CAN) across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Action recognition is a critical task in video understanding, requiring the comprehensive capture of spatio-temporal cues across various scales. However, existing methods often overlook the multi-granularity nature of actions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Context-Aware Network (CAN). CAN consists of two core modules: the Multi-scale Temporal Cue Module (MTCM) and the Group Spatial Cue Module (GSCM). MTCM effectively extracts temporal cues at multiple scales, capturing both fast-changing motion details and overall action flow. GSCM, on the other hand, extracts spatial cues at different scales by grouping feature maps and applying specialized extraction methods to each group. Experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets (Something-Something V1 and V2, Diving48, Kinetics-400, and UCF101) demonstrate the effectiveness of CAN. Our approach achieves competitive performance, outperforming most mainstream methods, with accuracies of 50.4% on Something-Something V1, 63.9% on Something-Something V2, 88.4% on Diving48, 74.9% on Kinetics-400, and 86.9% on UCF101. These results highlight the importance of capturing multi-scale spatio-temporal cues for robust action recognition.

Motivation: 强化学习在掩码生成模型中的应用因多步迭代优化过程的高计算成本和次优结果而面临挑战。

Conclusion: MaskFocus通过聚焦关键步骤，成功实现了对掩码生成模型的有效策略优化，并在多个文本到图像基准测试中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential for post-training language models and autoregressive visual generative models, but adapting RL to masked generative models remains challenging. The core factor is that policy optimization requires accounting for the probability likelihood of each step due to its multi-step and iterative refinement process. This reliance on entire sampling trajectories introduces high computational cost, whereas natively optimizing random steps often yields suboptimal results. In this paper, we present MaskFocus, a novel RL framework that achieves effective policy optimization for masked generative models by focusing on critical steps. Specifically, we determine the step-level information gain by measuring the similarity between the intermediate images at each sampling step and the final generated image. Crucially, we leverage this to identify the most critical and valuable steps and execute focused policy optimization on them. Furthermore, we design a dynamic routing sampling mechanism based on entropy to encourage the model to explore more valuable masking strategies for samples with low entropy. Extensive experiments on multiple Text-to-Image benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have seen a shift towards unified, transformer-based foundation models that can handle multiple conditional inputs in-context. However, these models have primarily focused on modalities like text, images, and depth maps, while strictly time-synchronous signals like audio have been underexplored. This paper introduces In-Context Audio Control of video diffusion transformers (ICAC), a framework that investigates the integration of audio signals for speech-driven video generation within a unified full-attention architecture, akin to FullDiT. We systematically explore three distinct mechanisms for injecting audio conditions: standard cross-attention, 2D self-attention, and unified 3D self-attention. Our findings reveal that while 3D attention offers the highest potential for capturing spatio-temporal audio-visual correlations, it presents significant training challenges. To overcome this, we propose a Masked 3D Attention mechanism that constrains the attention pattern to enforce temporal alignment, enabling stable training and superior performance. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves strong lip synchronization and video quality, conditioned on an audio stream and reference images.

Conclusion: Eff-GRot提出了一种高效且通用的旋转估计方法，通过单次前向传播直接预测物体旋转，无需特定对象或类别的训练。

Abstract: We introduce Eff-GRot, an approach for efficient and generalizable rotation estimation from RGB images. Given a query image and a set of reference images with known orientations, our method directly predicts the object's rotation in a single forward pass, without requiring object- or category-specific training. At the core of our framework is a transformer that performs a comparison in the latent space, jointly processing rotation-aware representations from multiple references alongside a query. This design enables a favorable balance between accuracy and computational efficiency while remaining simple, scalable, and fully end-to-end. Experimental results show that Eff-GRot offers a promising direction toward more efficient rotation estimation, particularly in latency-sensitive applications.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖的流派标签通常噪声大、粗糙、不可用或不足以捕捉真实音乐的多样性，导致节奏错位或风格漂移。

Method: 提出TempoMoE，一种分层次的节奏感知混合专家模块，通过组织不同节奏范围的专家组，结合多尺度节拍专家捕获细粒度和长程节奏动态。

Result: 实验表明，TempoMoE在舞蹈质量和节奏对齐方面达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: TempoMoE通过引入分层次的节奏感知专家模块，显著提升了舞蹈生成的质量和节奏对齐效果，无需依赖额外的音乐流派标签。

Abstract: Music to 3D dance generation aims to synthesize realistic and rhythmically synchronized human dance from music. While existing methods often rely on additional genre labels to further improve dance generation, such labels are typically noisy, coarse, unavailable, or insufficient to capture the diversity of real-world music, which can result in rhythm misalignment or stylistic drift. In contrast, we observe that tempo, a core property reflecting musical rhythm and pace, remains relatively consistent across datasets and genres, typically ranging from 60 to 200 BPM. Based on this finding, we propose TempoMoE, a hierarchical tempo-aware Mixture-of-Experts module that enhances the diffusion model and its rhythm perception. TempoMoE organizes motion experts into tempo-structured groups for different tempo ranges, with multi-scale beat experts capturing fine- and long-range rhythmic dynamics. A Hierarchical Rhythm-Adaptive Routing dynamically selects and fuses experts from music features, enabling flexible, rhythm-aligned generation without manual genre labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TempoMoE achieves state-of-the-art results in dance quality and rhythm alignment.

Abstract: The rapid growth of short-form video platforms increases the need for privacy-preserving moderation, as cloud-based pipelines expose raw videos to privacy risks, high bandwidth costs, and inference latency. To address these challenges, we propose an on-device federated learning framework for video violence detection that integrates self-supervised VideoMAE representations, LoRA-based parameter-efficient adaptation, and defense-in-depth privacy protection.

Conclusion: VDC策略通过检测无支持的令牌并用验证过的主导令牌替换，显著减少了LVLMs中的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, yet hallucinations remain a persistent challenge. This work presents a systematic analysis of the internal evolution of visual perception and token generation in LVLMs, revealing two key patterns. First, perception follows a three-stage GATE process: early layers perform a Global scan, intermediate layers Approach and Tighten on core content, and later layers Explore supplementary regions. Second, generation exhibits an SAD (Subdominant Accumulation to Dominant) pattern, where hallucinated tokens arise from the repeated accumulation of subdominant tokens lacking support from attention (visual perception) or feed-forward network (internal knowledge). Guided by these findings, we devise the VDC (Validated Dominance Correction) strategy, which detects unsupported tokens and replaces them with validated dominant ones to improve output reliability. Extensive experiments across multiple models and benchmarks confirm that VDC substantially mitigates hallucinations.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在合成复杂人类动作时存在局限性，主要由于像素级训练目标的内在约束，导致模型偏向外观保真度而忽视运动学原理。

Method: EchoMotion扩展了DiT框架，采用双分支架构处理多模态token，并提出了MVS-RoPE（统一3D位置编码）和Motion-Video两阶段训练策略。

Conclusion: EchoMotion通过联合建模外观和人类运动的分布，显著提升了复杂人类动作视频生成的质量，证明了显式表示人类运动对外观建模的互补性。

Abstract: Video generation models have advanced significantly, yet they still struggle to synthesize complex human movements due to the high degrees of freedom in human articulation. This limitation stems from the intrinsic constraints of pixel-only training objectives, which inherently bias models toward appearance fidelity at the expense of learning underlying kinematic principles. To address this, we introduce EchoMotion, a framework designed to model the joint distribution of appearance and human motion, thereby improving the quality of complex human action video generation. EchoMotion extends the DiT (Diffusion Transformer) framework with a dual-branch architecture that jointly processes tokens concatenated from different modalities. Furthermore, we propose MVS-RoPE (Motion-Video Syncronized RoPE), which offers unified 3D positional encoding for both video and motion tokens. By providing a synchronized coordinate system for the dual-modal latent sequence, MVS-RoPE establishes an inductive bias that fosters temporal alignment between the two modalities. We also propose a Motion-Video Two-Stage Training Strategy. This strategy enables the model to perform both the joint generation of complex human action videos and their corresponding motion sequences, as well as versatile cross-modal conditional generation tasks. To facilitate the training of a model with these capabilities, we construct HuMoVe, a large-scale dataset of approximately 80,000 high-quality, human-centric video-motion pairs. Our findings reveal that explicitly representing human motion is complementary to appearance, significantly boosting the coherence and plausibility of human-centric video generation.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于Transformer的框架，结合Latent Diffusion Models（LDMs），显著提升了EEG信号在语义结构建模和零样本泛化方面的性能，标志着EEG信号通用语义解释的重要进展。

Abstract: Advances in neuroscience and artificial intelligence have enabled preliminary decoding of brain activity. However, despite the progress, the interpretability of neural representations remains limited. A significant challenge arises from the intrinsic properties of electroencephalography (EEG) signals, including high noise levels, spatial diffusion, and pronounced temporal variability. To interpret the neural mechanism underlying thoughts, we propose a transformers-based framework to extract spatial-temporal representations associated with observed visual stimuli from EEG recordings. These features are subsequently incorporated into the attention mechanisms of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) to facilitate the reconstruction of visual stimuli from brain activity. The quantitative evaluations on publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method excels at modeling the semantic structures from EEG signals; achieving up to 6.5% increase in latent space clustering accuracy and 11.8% increase in zero shot generalization across unseen classes while having comparable Inception Score and Fréchet Inception Distance with existing baselines. Our work marks a significant step towards generalizable semantic interpretation of the EEG signals.

Abstract: Concept-driven counterfactuals explain decisions of classifiers by altering the model predictions through semantic changes. In this paper, we present a novel approach that leverages cross-modal decompositionality and image-specific concepts to create counterfactual scenarios expressed in natural language. We apply the proposed interpretability framework, termed Decompose and Explain (DeX), to the challenging domain of image privacy decisions, which are contextual and subjective. This application enables the quantification of the differential contributions of key scene elements to the model prediction. We identify relevant decision factors via a multi-criterion selection mechanism that considers both image similarity for minimal perturbations and decision confidence to prioritize impactful changes. This approach evaluates and compares diverse explanations, and assesses the interdependency and mutual influence among explanatory properties. By leveraging image-specific concepts, DeX generates image-grounded, sparse explanations, yielding significant improvements over the state of the art. Importantly, DeX operates as a training-free framework, offering high flexibility. Results show that DeX not only uncovers the principal contributing factors influencing subjective decisions, but also identifies underlying dataset biases allowing for targeted mitigation strategies to improve fairness.

Abstract: Automating crash video analysis is essential to leverage the growing availability of driving video data for traffic safety research and accountability attribution in autonomous driving. Crash video analysis is a challenging multitask problem due to the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of crash events in video data and the diverse analytical requirements involved. It requires capabilities spanning crash recognition, temporal grounding, and high-level video understanding. Existing models, however, cannot perform all these tasks within a unified framework, and effective training strategies for such models remain underexplored. To fill these gaps, this paper proposes CrashChat, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) for multitask traffic crash analysis, built upon VideoLLaMA3. CrashChat acquires domain-specific knowledge through instruction fine-tuning and employs a novel multitask learning strategy based on task decoupling and grouping, which maximizes the benefit of joint learning within and across task groups while mitigating negative transfer. Numerical experiments on consolidated public datasets demonstrate that CrashChat consistently outperforms existing MLLMs across model scales and traditional vision-based methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance. It reaches near-perfect accuracy in crash recognition, a 176\% improvement in crash localization, and a 40\% improvement in the more challenging pre-crash localization. Compared to general MLLMs, it substantially enhances textual accuracy and content coverage in crash description and reasoning tasks, with 0.18-0.41 increases in BLEU scores and 0.18-0.42 increases in ROUGE scores. Beyond its strong performance, CrashChat is a convenient, end-to-end analytical tool ready for practical implementation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络常利用与任务语义无关的捷径特征，当这些特征与敏感属性相关时，会导致模型性能偏差。现有方法多基于定性、图像级检查，且假设线索是肉眼可见的，限制了在医学影像等领域的应用。

Method: OSCAR通过将图像级任务归因图转换为数据集级排名配置文件，并在平衡基线模型（BA）、测试模型（TS）和敏感属性预测器（SA）之间进行比较，计算这些排名配置文件的成对、部分和偏差相关性，生成量化指标。

Result: 实验表明，OSCAR的相关性指标（i）在不同种子和分区中稳定，（ii）对训练数据中捷径特征与输出标签的关联程度敏感，（iii）能区分局部和扩散的捷径特征。通过简单测试时衰减方法，可减少最差组性能差异。

Conclusion: OSCAR提供了一种轻量级的像素空间审计方法，能够生成统计决策规则和空间映射，帮助用户测试、定位并减轻对捷径特征的依赖。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often exploit shortcuts. These are spurious cues which are associated with output labels in the training data but are unrelated to task semantics. When the shortcut features are associated with sensitive attributes, shortcut learning can lead to biased model performance. Existing methods for localising and understanding shortcut learning are mostly based upon qualitative, image-level inspection and assume cues are human-visible, limiting their use in domains such as medical imaging. We introduce OSCAR (Ordinal Scoring Correlations for Attribution Representations), a model-agnostic framework for quantifying shortcut learning and localising shortcut features. OSCAR converts image-level task attribution maps into dataset-level rank profiles of image regions and compares them across three models: a balanced baseline model (BA), a test model (TS), and a sensitive attribute predictor (SA). By computing pairwise, partial, and deviation-based correlations on these rank profiles, we produce a set of quantitative metrics that characterise the degree of shortcut reliance for TS, together with a ranking of image-level regions that contribute most to it. Experiments on CelebA, CheXpert, and ADNI show that our correlations are (i) stable across seeds and partitions, (ii) sensitive to the level of association between shortcut features and output labels in the training data, and (iii) able to distinguish localised from diffuse shortcut features. As an illustration of the utility of our method, we show how worst-group performance disparities can be reduced using a simple test-time attenuation approach based on the identified shortcut regions. OSCAR provides a lightweight, pixel-space audit that yields statistical decision rules and spatial maps, enabling users to test, localise, and mitigate shortcut reliance.

Conclusion: FiNDR通过推理增强的大型多模态模型（LMM）为词汇无关的细粒度图像识别提供了可扩展、全自动的解决方案，其性能超越了依赖人工定义词汇的基线方法。

Abstract: Vocabulary-free fine-grained image recognition aims to distinguish visually similar categories within a meta-class without a fixed, human-defined label set. Existing solutions for this problem are limited by either the usage of a large and rigid list of vocabularies or by the dependency on complex pipelines with fragile heuristics where errors propagate across stages. Meanwhile, the ability of recent large multi-modal models (LMMs) equipped with explicit or implicit reasoning to comprehend visual-language data, decompose problems, retrieve latent knowledge, and self-correct suggests a more principled and effective alternative. Building on these capabilities, we propose FiNDR (Fine-grained Name Discovery via Reasoning), the first reasoning-augmented LMM-based framework for vocabulary-free fine-grained recognition. The system operates in three automated steps: (i) a reasoning-enabled LMM generates descriptive candidate labels for each image; (ii) a vision-language model filters and ranks these candidates to form a coherent class set; and (iii) the verified names instantiate a lightweight multi-modal classifier used at inference time. Extensive experiments on popular fine-grained classification benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance under the vocabulary-free setting, with a significant relative margin of up to 18.8% over previous approaches. Remarkably, the proposed method surpasses zero-shot baselines that exploit pre-defined ground-truth names, challenging the assumption that human-curated vocabularies define an upper bound. Additionally, we show that carefully curated prompts enable open-source LMMs to match proprietary counterparts. These findings establish reasoning-augmented LMMs as an effective foundation for scalable, fully automated, open-world fine-grained visual recognition.

Conclusion: Delta-LLaVA的设计在效率和可扩展性上均表现出色，推理吞吐量提升高达55%，训练速度显著加快。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) combine visual and textual representations to enable rich reasoning capabilities. However, the high computational cost of processing dense visual tokens remains a major bottleneck. A critical component in this pipeline is the visual projector, which bridges the vision encoder and the language model. Standard designs often employ a simple multi-layer perceptron for direct token mapping, but this approach scales poorly with high-resolution inputs, introducing significant redundancy. We present Delta-LLaVA, a token-efficient projector that employs a low-rank DeltaProjection to align multi-level vision features into a compact subspace before further interaction. On top of this base alignment, lightweight Transformer blocks act as specialization layers, capturing both global and local structure under constrained token budgets. Extensive experiments and ablations demonstrate that this base-then-specialize design yields consistent gains across multiple benchmarks with only 144 tokens, highlighting the importance of token formation prior to scaling interaction capacity. With Delta-LLaVA, inference throughput improves by up to 55%, while end-to-end training accelerates by nearly 4-5x in pretraining and over 1.5x in finetuning, highlighting the dual benefits of our design in both efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: 通过修改训练数据而非模型架构，提出了一种新颖的数据中心方法，成功提升了3D生成模型的对称性。实验证明，生成的形状在对称性和一致性上优于原始模型和数据集中的对象。

Abstract: We propose a novel data-centric approach to promote symmetry in 3D generative models by modifying the training data rather than the model architecture. Our method begins with an analysis of reflectional symmetry in both real-world 3D shapes and samples generated by state-of-the-art models. We hypothesize that training a generative model exclusively on half-objects, obtained by reflecting one half of the shapes along the x=0 plane, enables the model to learn a rich distribution of partial geometries which, when reflected during generation, yield complete shapes that are both visually plausible and geometrically symmetric. To test this, we construct a new dataset of half-objects from three ShapeNet classes (Airplane, Car, and Chair) and train two generative models. Experiments demonstrate that the generated shapes are symmetrical and consistent, compared with the generated objects from the original model and the original dataset objects.

Conclusion: VOIC通过显式分离可见区域和遮挡区域的监督与推理，显著提升了单目3D语义场景补全的性能，实现了最先进的效果。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a critical task for autonomous driving and robotic scene understanding. It aims to infer a complete 3D volumetric representation of both semantics and geometry from a single image. Existing methods typically focus on end-to-end 2D-to-3D feature lifting and voxel completion. However, they often overlook the interference between high-confidence visible-region perception and low-confidence occluded-region reasoning caused by single-image input, which can lead to feature dilution and error propagation.
  To address these challenges, we introduce an offline Visible Region Label Extraction (VRLE) strategy that explicitly separates and extracts voxel-level supervision for visible regions from dense 3D ground truth. This strategy purifies the supervisory space for two complementary sub-tasks: visible-region perception and occluded-region reasoning. Building on this idea, we propose the Visible-Occluded Interactive Completion Network (VOIC), a novel dual-decoder framework that explicitly decouples SSC into visible-region semantic perception and occluded-region scene completion. VOIC first constructs a base 3D voxel representation by fusing image features with depth-derived occupancy. The visible decoder focuses on generating high-fidelity geometric and semantic priors, while the occlusion decoder leverages these priors together with cross-modal interaction to perform coherent global scene reasoning.
  Extensive experiments on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI360 benchmarks demonstrate that VOIC outperforms existing monocular SSC methods in both geometric completion and semantic segmentation accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现有方法虽能实现高面部保真度，但忽略了视觉上下文（如光照、皮肤纹理、环境色调），导致‘语义-视觉失调’和不自然的‘贴纸效应’。

Method: DVI采用零样本框架，利用VAE潜在空间的统计特性（均值和方差）作为全局视觉氛围的轻量级描述符，并通过参数无关的特征调制机制和动态时间粒度调度器实现。

Result: DVI在视觉一致性和氛围保真度上表现优异，且在身份保持方面稳健，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DVI框架通过解耦语义和视觉流，无需参数微调即可显著提升视觉一致性和氛围保真度，同时在IBench评估中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent tuning-free identity customization methods achieve high facial fidelity but often overlook visual context, such as lighting, skin texture, and environmental tone. This limitation leads to ``Semantic-Visual Dissonance,'' where accurate facial geometry clashes with the input's unique atmosphere, causing an unnatural ``sticker-like'' effect. We propose **DVI (Disentangled Visual-Identity)**, a zero-shot framework that orthogonally disentangles identity into fine-grained semantic and coarse-grained visual streams. Unlike methods relying solely on semantic vectors, DVI exploits the inherent statistical properties of the VAE latent space, utilizing mean and variance as lightweight descriptors for global visual atmosphere. We introduce a **Parameter-Free Feature Modulation** mechanism that adaptively modulates semantic embeddings with these visual statistics, effectively injecting the reference's ``visual soul'' without training. Furthermore, a **Dynamic Temporal Granularity Scheduler** aligns with the diffusion process, prioritizing visual atmosphere in early denoising stages while refining semantic details later. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DVI significantly enhances visual consistency and atmospheric fidelity without parameter fine-tuning, maintaining robust identity preservation and outperforming state-of-the-art methods in IBench evaluations.

Conclusion: 该方法通过总法向曲率正则化成功实现了具有锐利边缘和精确各向同性特性的解决方案，且无需复杂参数调整，对参数选择具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation for curvature regularization by penalizing normal curvatures from multiple directions. This total normal curvature regularization is capable of producing solutions with sharp edges and precise isotropic properties. To tackle the resulting high-order nonlinear optimization problem, we reformulate it as the task of finding the steady-state solution of a time-dependent partial differential equation (PDE) system. Time discretization is achieved through operator splitting, where each subproblem at the fractional steps either has a closed-form solution or can be efficiently solved using advanced algorithms. Our method circumvents the need for complex parameter tuning and demonstrates robustness to parameter choices. The efficiency and effectiveness of our approach have been rigorously validated in the context of surface and image smoothing problems.

Motivation: 现有方法（如KG-SP）在状态和对象识别准确率及组合权重考量上存在不足，需改进以提升组合识别的合理性和准确性。

Method: 提出了SASOW方法，在状态和对象分类器中引入自注意力机制，并在组合时考虑状态与对象的权重。

Conclusion: SASOW通过引入自注意力机制和状态-对象权重考量，显著提升了组合零样本学习的识别准确率，尤其在未见组合上表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Object recognition has become prevalent across various industries. However, most existing applications are limited to identifying objects alone, without considering their associated states. The ability to recognize both the state and object simultaneously remains less common. One approach to address this is by treating state and object as a single category during training. However, this approach poses challenges in data collection and training since it requires comprehensive data for all possible combinations. Compositional Zero-shot Learning (CZSL) emerges as a viable solution by treating the state and object as distinct categories during training. CZSL facilitates the identification of novel compositions even in the absence of data for every conceivable combination. The current state-of-the-art method, KG-SP, addresses this issue by training distinct classifiers for states and objects, while leveraging a semantic model to evaluate the plausibility of composed compositions. However, KG-SP's accuracy in state and object recognition can be further improved, and it fails to consider the weighting of states and objects during composition. In this study, we propose SASOW, an enhancement of KG-SP that considers the weighting of states and objects while improving composition recognition accuracy. First, we introduce self-attention mechanisms into the classifiers for states and objects, leading to enhanced accuracy in recognizing both. Additionally, we incorporate the weighting of states and objects during composition to generate more reasonable and accurate compositions. Our validation process involves testing SASOW on three established benchmark datasets. Experimental outcomes affirm when compared against OW-CZSL approach, KG-SP, SASOW showcases improvements of 2.1%, 1.7%, and 0.4% in terms of accuracy for unseen compositions across the MIT-States, UT Zappos, and C-GQA datasets, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法计算冗余且忽视点云几何先验，需设计更高效且利用几何关系的方案。

Method: 采用迭代最近点（ICP）算法和基于Sinkhorn的软匹配，结合静态、动态和缺失实例的三类设计。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和panoptic nuScenes上表现优于最先进方法，无需额外训练或输入。

Conclusion: ICP-4D框架通过几何关系实现了高效且无需训练的4D LiDAR全景分割，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Dominant paradigms for 4D LiDAR panoptic segmentation are usually required to train deep neural networks with large superimposed point clouds or design dedicated modules for instance association. However, these approaches perform redundant point processing and consequently become computationally expensive, yet still overlook the rich geometric priors inherently provided by raw point clouds. To this end, we introduce ICP-4D, a simple yet effective training-free framework that unifies spatial and temporal reasoning through geometric relations among instance-level point sets. Specifically, we apply the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm to directly associate temporally consistent instances by aligning the source and target point sets through the estimated transformation. To stabilize association under noisy instance predictions, we introduce a Sinkhorn-based soft matching. This exploits the underlying instance distribution to obtain accurate point-wise correspondences, resulting in robust geometric alignment. Furthermore, our carefully designed pipeline, which considers three instance types-static, dynamic, and missing-offers computational efficiency and occlusion-aware matching. Our extensive experiments across both SemanticKITTI and panoptic nuScenes demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, even without additional training or extra point cloud inputs.

Conclusion: Open-World Ecological Taxonomy Classification（OWETC）框架和TaxoNet模型为开放世界的植物分类监测奠定了坚实基础，尤其是在稀有类群分类上表现优异。

Abstract: AI-guided classification of ecological families, genera, and species underpins global sustainability efforts such as biodiversity monitoring, conservation planning, and policy-making. Progress toward this goal is hindered by long-tailed taxonomic distributions from class imbalance, along with fine-grained taxonomic variations, test-time spatiotemporal domain shifts, and closed-set assumptions that can only recognize previously seen taxa. We introduce the Open-World Ecological Taxonomy Classification, a unified framework that captures the co-occurrence of these challenges in realistic ecological settings. To address them, we propose TaxoNet, an embedding-based encoder with a dual-margin penalization loss that strengthens learning signals from rare underrepresented taxa while mitigating the dominance of overrepresented ones, directly confronting interrelated challenges. We evaluate our method on diverse ecological domains: Google Auto-Arborist (urban trees), iNat-Plantae (Plantae observations from various ecosystems in iNaturalist-2019), and NAFlora-Mini (a curated herbarium collection). Our model consistently outperforms baselines, particularly for rare taxa, establishing a strong foundation for open-world plant taxonomic monitoring. Our findings further show that general-purpose multimodal foundation models remain constrained in plant-domain applications.

Conclusion: CETCAM通过消除对相机注释的依赖，提供了一种可扩展且一致的相机控制视频生成框架，展现了卓越的几何一致性、时间稳定性和视觉真实感，同时具备对其他控制模态的强适应性。

Abstract: Achieving precise camera control in video generation remains challenging, as existing methods often rely on camera pose annotations that are difficult to scale to large and dynamic datasets and are frequently inconsistent with depth estimation, leading to train-test discrepancies. We introduce CETCAM, a camera-controllable video generation framework that eliminates the need for camera annotations through a consistent and extensible tokenization scheme. CETCAM leverages recent advances in geometry foundation models, such as VGGT, to estimate depth and camera parameters and converts them into unified, geometry-aware tokens. These tokens are seamlessly integrated into a pretrained video diffusion backbone via lightweight context blocks. Trained in two progressive stages, CETCAM first learns robust camera controllability from diverse raw video data and then refines fine-grained visual quality using curated high-fidelity datasets. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art geometric consistency, temporal stability, and visual realism. Moreover, CETCAM exhibits strong adaptability to additional control modalities, including inpainting and layout control, highlighting its flexibility beyond camera control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对不断演变的欺骗策略和领域，需要增量学习（IL），但隐私法规禁止保留过去数据，因此需要无排练的增量学习（RF-IL）。

Method: SVLP-IL结合了多角度提示（MAP）和选择性弹性权重巩固（SEWC），以平衡稳定性和可塑性。

Result: SVLP-IL显著减少了灾难性遗忘，并在未见过的领域上提升了性能。

Conclusion: SVLP-IL 提供了一个隐私合规、实用的解决方案，适用于RF-IL设置下的终身PAD部署。

Abstract: Face Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) demands incremental learning (IL) to combat evolving spoofing tactics and domains. Privacy regulations, however, forbid retaining past data, necessitating rehearsal-free IL (RF-IL). Vision-Language Pre-trained (VLP) models, with their prompt-tunable cross-modal representations, enable efficient adaptation to new spoofing styles and domains. Capitalizing on this strength, we propose \textbf{SVLP-IL}, a VLP-based RF-IL framework that balances stability and plasticity via \textit{Multi-Aspect Prompting} (MAP) and \textit{Selective Elastic Weight Consolidation} (SEWC). MAP isolates domain dependencies, enhances distribution-shift sensitivity, and mitigates forgetting by jointly exploiting universal and domain-specific cues. SEWC selectively preserves critical weights from previous tasks, retaining essential knowledge while allowing flexibility for new adaptations. Comprehensive experiments across multiple PAD benchmarks show that SVLP-IL significantly reduces catastrophic forgetting and enhances performance on unseen domains. SVLP-IL offers a privacy-compliant, practical solution for robust lifelong PAD deployment in RF-IL settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成评估指标过于关注整体语义相似性，忽视了细粒度的身份细节保留问题，因此需要一种更精准的评估方法。

Method: Finer-Personalization Rank采用排名视角，将生成的图像作为查询，与身份标记的真实图像库进行匹配，使用检索指标（如平均精度均值）来衡量性能。

Result: 在CUB、Stanford Cars和动物Re-ID基准测试中，Finer-Personalization Rank比仅基于语义的指标更能反映身份保留情况，并揭示了多种流行个性化方法中的身份漂移问题。

Conclusion: Finer-Personalization Rank被提出作为一种基于检索的评估协议，能够更准确地反映个性化生成模型中身份保留的情况，相比现有语义相似性指标更有效。

Abstract: The rise of personalized generative models raises a central question: how should we evaluate identity preservation? Given a reference image (e.g., one's pet), we expect the generated image to retain precise details attached to the subject's identity. However, current generative evaluation metrics emphasize the overall semantic similarity between the reference and the output, and overlook these fine-grained discriminative details. We introduce Finer-Personalization Rank, an evaluation protocol tailored to identity preservation. Instead of pairwise similarity, Finer-Personalization Rank adopts a ranking view: it treats each generated image as a query against an identity-labeled gallery consisting of visually similar real images. Retrieval metrics (e.g., mean average precision) measure performance, where higher scores indicate that identity-specific details (e.g., a distinctive head spot) are preserved. We assess identity at multiple granularities -- from fine-grained categories (e.g., bird species, car models) to individual instances (e.g., re-identification). Across CUB, Stanford Cars, and animal Re-ID benchmarks, Finer-Personalization Rank more faithfully reflects identity retention than semantic-only metrics and reveals substantial identity drift in several popular personalization methods. These results position the gallery-based protocol as a principled and practical evaluation for personalized generation.

Abstract: Fluorescence Microcopy Calcium Imaging is a fundamental tool to in-vivo record and analyze large scale neuronal activities simultaneously at a single cell resolution. Automatic and precise detection of behaviorally relevant neuron activity from the recordings is critical to study the mapping of brain activity in organisms. However a perpetual bottleneck to this problem is the manual segmentation which is time and labor intensive and lacks generalizability. To this end, we present a Bayesian Deep Learning Framework to detect neuronal activities in 4D spatio-temporal data obtained by light sheet microscopy. Our approach accounts for the use of temporal information by calculating pixel wise correlation maps and combines it with spatial information given by the mean summary image. The Bayesian framework not only produces probability segmentation maps but also models the uncertainty pertaining to active neuron detection. To evaluate the accuracy of our framework we implemented the test of reproducibility to assert the generalization of the network to detect neuron activity. The network achieved a mean Dice Score of 0.81 relative to the synthetic Ground Truth obtained by Otsu's method and a mean Dice Score of 0.79 between the first and second run for test of reproducibility. Our method successfully deployed can be used for rapid detection of active neuronal activities for behavioural studies.

Abstract: Few-shot action recognition aims to enable models to quickly learn new action categories from limited labeled samples, addressing the challenge of data scarcity in real-world applications. Current research primarily addresses three core challenges: (1) temporal modeling, where models are prone to interference from irrelevant static background information and struggle to capture the essence of dynamic action features; (2) visual similarity, where categories with subtle visual differences are difficult to distinguish; and (3) the modality gap between visual-textual support prototypes and visual-only queries, which complicates alignment within a shared embedding space. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a CLIP-SPM framework, which includes three components: (1) the Hierarchical Synergistic Motion Refinement (HSMR) module, which aligns deep and shallow motion features to improve temporal modeling by reducing static background interference; (2) the Semantic Prototype Modulation (SPM) strategy, which generates query-relevant text prompts to bridge the modality gap and integrates them with visual features, enhancing the discriminability between similar actions; and (3) the Prototype-Anchor Dual Modulation (PADM) method, which refines support prototypes and aligns query features with a global semantic anchor, improving consistency across support and query samples. Comprehensive experiments across standard benchmarks, including Kinetics, SSv2-Full, SSv2-Small, UCF101, and HMDB51, demonstrate that our CLIP-SPM achieves competitive performance under 1-shot, 3-shot, and 5-shot settings. Extensive ablation studies and visual analyses further validate the effectiveness of each component and its contributions to addressing the core challenges. The source code and models are publicly available at GitHub.

Abstract: Image watermarking supports authenticity and provenance, yet many schemes are still easy to bypass with various distortions and powerful generative edits. Deep learning-based watermarking has improved robustness to diffusion-based image editing, but a gap remains when a watermarked image is converted to video by image-to-video (I2V), in which per-frame watermark detection weakens. I2V has quickly advanced from short, jittery clips to multi-second, temporally coherent scenes, and it now serves not only content creation but also world-modeling and simulation workflows, making cross-modal watermark recovery crucial. We present WaTeRFlow, a framework tailored for robustness under I2V. It consists of (i) FUSE (Flow-guided Unified Synthesis Engine), which exposes the encoder-decoder to realistic distortions via instruction-driven edits and a fast video diffusion proxy during training, (ii) optical-flow warping with a Temporal Consistency Loss (TCL) that stabilizes per-frame predictions, and (iii) a semantic preservation loss that maintains the conditioning signal. Experiments across representative I2V models show accurate watermark recovery from frames, with higher first-frame and per-frame bit accuracy and resilience when various distortions are applied before or after video generation.

TL;DR: DecHOI通过解耦路径规划和动作合成，结合对抗训练，显著提升了人-物交互合成的真实性和同步性，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要手动指定中间路径点，且将所有优化目标集中在单一网络上，导致复杂性增加、灵活性降低，并产生人-物运动不同步或穿透等问题。

Method: DecHOI将路径规划和动作合成解耦，分为轨迹生成器和动作生成器两个部分，并通过对抗训练提升接触的真实性。

Result: DecHOI在动态场景中支持响应式长序列规划，同时保持计划一致性，显著提升了人-物交互的真实性和同步性。

Conclusion: DecHOI方法在FullBodyManipulation和3D-FUTURE两个基准测试中，在大多数定量指标和定性评估上超越了现有方法，且感知研究也倾向于其生成的结果。

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic human-object interaction (HOI) is essential for 3D computer vision and robotics, underpinning animation and embodied control. Existing approaches often require manually specified intermediate waypoints and place all optimization objectives on a single network, which increases complexity, reduces flexibility, and leads to errors such as unsynchronized human and object motion or penetration. To address these issues, we propose Decoupled Generative Modeling for Human-Object Interaction Synthesis (DecHOI), which separates path planning and action synthesis. A trajectory generator first produces human and object trajectories without prescribed waypoints, and an action generator conditions on these paths to synthesize detailed motions. To further improve contact realism, we employ adversarial training with a discriminator that focuses on the dynamics of distal joints. The framework also models a moving counterpart and supports responsive, long-sequence planning in dynamic scenes, while preserving plan consistency. Across two benchmarks, FullBodyManipulation and 3D-FUTURE, DecHOI surpasses prior methods on most quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, and perceptual studies likewise prefer our results.

TL;DR: Image-LoRA是一种轻量级参数高效微调方法，通过优化视觉令牌范围内的注意力层，减少训练成本，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在视觉-语言模型中实现轻量级参数高效微调，同时减少训练FLOPs并保持模型性能。

Method: Image-LoRA仅对视觉令牌范围内的注意力层的值路径应用低秩适应，并通过选择影响力分数高的注意力头子集进行优化，同时使用选择大小归一化稳定每层更新。

Result: 在多种基准测试中，Image-LoRA在减少训练参数和FLOPs的同时，匹配或接近标准LoRA的准确性，并保持了纯文本推理能力。

Conclusion: Image-LoRA在保持VLMs纯文本推理性能的同时，通过轻量级参数高效微调方法，在视觉-语言模型中实现了与标准LoRA相近的准确性，且训练参数和计算成本更低。

Abstract: We introduce Image-LoRA, a lightweight parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) recipe for transformer-based vision-language models (VLMs). Image-LoRA applies low-rank adaptation only to the value path of attention layers within the visual-token span, reducing adapter-only training FLOPs roughly in proportion to the visual-token fraction. We further adapt only a subset of attention heads, selected using head influence scores estimated with a rank-1 Image-LoRA, and stabilize per-layer updates via selection-size normalization. Across screen-centric grounding and referring benchmarks spanning text-heavy to image-heavy regimes, Image-LoRA matches or closely approaches standard LoRA accuracy while using fewer trainable parameters and lower adapter-only training FLOPs. The method also preserves the pure-text reasoning performance of VLMs before and after fine-tuning, as further shown on GSM8K.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6DoF姿态估计在机器人、AR/VR和自主系统中广泛应用，但传统2D视觉中的后门攻击方法不适用于控制连续参数（如平移和旋转）的6DoF攻击。

Method: 提出了6DAttack框架，利用3D对象触发器在保持正常行为的同时诱导受控的错误姿态。

Result: 在PVNet、DenseFusion和PoseDiffusion模型上的评估显示，攻击成功率（ASR）高且不影响清洁性能，触发样本的ADD-P达到97.70%，防御措施无效。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了6DoF姿态估计中一个严重但未被充分探索的安全威胁，即通过3D对象触发器实现的6DAttack框架能够在不影响正常性能的情况下诱导错误姿态。

Abstract: Deep learning advances have enabled accurate six-degree-of-freedom (6DoF) object pose estimation, widely used in robotics, AR/VR, and autonomous systems. However, backdoor attacks pose significant security risks. While most research focuses on 2D vision, 6DoF pose estimation remains largely unexplored. Unlike traditional backdoors that only change classes, 6DoF attacks must control continuous parameters like translation and rotation, rendering 2D methods inapplicable. We propose 6DAttack, a framework using 3D object triggers to induce controlled erroneous poses while maintaining normal behavior. Evaluations on PVNet, DenseFusion, and PoseDiffusion across LINEMOD, YCB-Video, and CO3D show high attack success rates (ASRs) without compromising clean performance. Backdoored models achieve up to 100% clean ADD accuracy and 100% ASR, with triggered samples reaching 97.70% ADD-P. Furthermore, a representative defense remains ineffective. Our findings reveal a serious, underexplored threat to 6DoF pose estimation.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖像素特征或对象共现统计，忽视了影响人类感知的显式关系，因此需要一种能捕捉结构化关系的模型。

Method: 研究提出了一个三阶段流程：首先使用OpenPSG模型解析图像提取对象关系三元组；其次通过异构图自动编码器（GraphMAE）学习紧凑的场景级嵌入；最后用神经网络从嵌入中预测感知分数。

Result: 该方法在感知预测准确率上平均比基线模型提高26%，并在跨城市预测任务中保持强泛化性能。

Conclusion: 该研究证明基于图的结构为建模城市感知提供了表达力强、可泛化且可解释的信号，推动了以人为中心和情境感知的城市分析。

Abstract: Perception research is increasingly modelled using streetscapes, yet many approaches still rely on pixel features or object co-occurrence statistics, overlooking the explicit relations that shape human perception. This study proposes a three stage pipeline that transforms street view imagery (SVI) into structured representations for predicting six perceptual indicators. In the first stage, each image is parsed using an open-set Panoptic Scene Graph model (OpenPSG) to extract object predicate object triplets. In the second stage, compact scene-level embeddings are learned through a heterogeneous graph autoencoder (GraphMAE). In the third stage, a neural network predicts perception scores from these embeddings. We evaluate the proposed approach against image-only baselines in terms of accuracy, precision, and cross-city generalization. Results indicate that (i) our approach improves perception prediction accuracy by an average of 26% over baseline models, and (ii) maintains strong generalization performance in cross-city prediction tasks. Additionally, the structured representation clarifies which relational patterns contribute to lower perception scores in urban scenes, such as graffiti on wall and car parked on sidewalk. Overall, this study demonstrates that graph-based structure provides expressive, generalizable, and interpretable signals for modelling urban perception, advancing human-centric and context-aware urban analytics.

Motivation: LVLMs在对象识别任务中存在严重的幻觉问题，导致生成的文本与视觉内容不符，影响实际应用。

Method: 提出Hallucination Disentangled Decoding (HDD)方法，通过图像分割和增强原始图像，同时利用空白图像消除语言先验幻觉。

Result: HDD不仅减少了模型对语言先验的依赖，还提升了视觉表现。

Conclusion: HDD方法通过无需训练的方式，有效减少了LVLMs在语言和视觉模态中的幻觉问题，提升了模型的视觉性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) bridge the gap between visual and linguistic modalities, demonstrating strong potential across a variety of domains. However, despite significant progress, LVLMs still suffer from severe hallucination issues in object recognition tasks. These models often fail to accurately identify certain objects, leading to text generation that appears fluent but does not correspond to the visual content, which can have serious consequences in real-world applications. Recently, several methods have been proposed to alleviate LVLM hallucinations, but most focus solely on reducing hallucinations in the language modality. To mitigate hallucinations in both the language and visual modalities, we introduce Hallucination Disentangled Decoding (HDD) method that requires no training. HDD enhances the original image by segmenting it and selecting images that augment the original, while also utilizing a blank image to eliminate language prior hallucinations in both the original and segmented images. This design not only reduces the model's dependence on language priors but also enhances its visual performance. (Code: https://github.com/rickeyhhh/Hallucination-Disentangled-Decoding)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管生成式AI在动画合成方面取得了显著进展，但在生成真实人类动画时仍存在挑战，尤其是在行为生物识别中，微妙的运动线索容易丢失或扭曲。本研究旨在探究现有模型是否能保留用于步态识别的时空细节。

Method: 评估了四种不同的生成式AI模型，通过两项主要任务：i）在不同复杂度条件下从参考视频中恢复步态模式，ii）将这些步态模式转移到不同的视觉身份上。

Result: 结果显示，虽然视觉质量较高，但在身份识别任务中的生物识别保真度较低。身份转移任务进一步揭示了外观依赖的步态识别在纹理与运动分离时的根本缺陷。

Conclusion: 当前生成式AI模型在视觉质量上表现良好，但在行为生物识别（如步态识别）的保真度上表现不佳，表明这些模型难以将身份与运动分离。此外，外观依赖的步态识别在纹理与运动分离时会失效，揭示了现有模型过度依赖视觉属性而非时间动态。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) models have revolutionized animation, enabling the synthesis of humans and motion patterns with remarkable visual fidelity. However, generating truly realistic human animation remains a formidable challenge, where even minor inconsistencies can make a subject appear unnatural. This limitation is particularly critical when AI-generated videos are evaluated for behavioral biometrics, where subtle motion cues that define identity are easily lost or distorted. The present study investigates whether state-of-the-art GenAI human animation models can preserve the subtle spatio-temporal details needed for person identification through gait biometrics. Specifically, we evaluate four different GenAI models across two primary evaluation tasks to assess their ability to i) restore gait patterns from reference videos under varying conditions of complexity, and ii) transfer these gait patterns to different visual identities. Our results show that while visual quality is mostly high, biometric fidelity remains low in tasks focusing on identification, suggesting that current GenAI models struggle to disentangle identity from motion. Furthermore, through an identity transfer task, we expose a fundamental flaw in appearance-based gait recognition: when texture is disentangled from motion, identification collapses, proving current GenAI models rely on visual attributes rather than temporal dynamics.

Abstract: Locating and retrieving objects from scene-level point clouds is a challenging problem with broad applications in robotics and augmented reality. This task is commonly formulated as open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation. Although recent methods demonstrate strong performance, they depend heavily on SAM and CLIP to generate and classify 3D instance masks from images accompanying the point cloud, leading to substantial computational overhead and slow processing that limit their deployment in real-world settings. Open-YOLO 3D alleviates this issue by using a real-time 2D detector to classify class-agnostic masks produced directly from the point cloud by a pretrained 3D segmenter, eliminating the need for SAM and CLIP and significantly reducing inference time. However, Open-YOLO 3D often fails to generalize to object categories that appear infrequently in the 3D training data. In this paper, we propose a method that generates 3D instance masks for novel objects from RGB images guided by a 2D open-vocabulary detector. Our approach inherits the 2D detector's ability to recognize novel objects while maintaining efficient classification, enabling fast and accurate retrieval of rare instances from open-ended text queries. Our code will be made available at https://github.com/ndkhanh360/BoxOVIS.

Motivation: 解决扩散模型在训练和测试阶段输入不一致（即暴露偏差）的问题，通过观察Slow Flow现象提出改进方法。

Method: MixFlow利用Slow Flow现象，通过在训练时间步中使用减缓时间步的插值混合（slowed interpolation mixture）来后训练预测网络。

Result: 在类条件图像生成（如SiT、REPA、RAE）和文本到图像生成任务中验证了MixFlow的有效性，RAE模型在ImageNet上取得了1.43 FID（无指导）和1.10 FID（有指导）的优异结果。

Conclusion: MixFlow方法通过利用Slow Flow现象，显著提升了扩散模型在训练和测试阶段的性能，尤其在类条件图像生成和文本到图像生成任务中表现优异。

Abstract: This paper studies the training-testing discrepancy (a.k.a. exposure bias) problem for improving the diffusion models. During training, the input of a prediction network at one training timestep is the corresponding ground-truth noisy data that is an interpolation of the noise and the data, and during testing, the input is the generated noisy data. We present a novel training approach, named MixFlow, for improving the performance. Our approach is motivated by the Slow Flow phenomenon: the ground-truth interpolation that is the nearest to the generated noisy data at a given sampling timestep is observed to correspond to a higher-noise timestep (termed slowed timestep), i.e., the corresponding ground-truth timestep is slower than the sampling timestep. MixFlow leverages the interpolations at the slowed timesteps, named slowed interpolation mixture, for post-training the prediction network for each training timestep. Experiments over class-conditional image generation (including SiT, REPA, and RAE) and text-to-image generation validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our approach MixFlow over the RAE models achieve strong generation results on ImageNet: 1.43 FID (without guidance) and 1.10 (with guidance) at 256 x 256, and 1.55 FID (without guidance) and 1.10 (with guidance) at 512 x 512.

Abstract: Open challenges have become the de facto standard for comparative ranking of medical AI methods. Despite their importance, medical AI leaderboards exhibit three persistent limitations: (1) score gaps are rarely tested for statistical significance, so rank stability is unknown; (2) single averaged metrics are applied to every organ, hiding clinically important boundary errors; (3) performance across intersecting demographics is seldom reported, masking fairness and equity gaps. We introduce RankInsight, an open-source toolkit that seeks to address these limitations. RankInsight (1) computes pair-wise significance maps that show the nnU-Net family outperforms Vision-Language and MONAI submissions with high statistical certainty; (2) recomputes leaderboards with organ-appropriate metrics, reversing the order of the top four models when Dice is replaced by NSD for tubular structures; and (3) audits intersectional fairness, revealing that more than half of the MONAI-based entries have the largest gender-race discrepancy on our proprietary Johns Hopkins Hospital dataset. The RankInsight toolkit is publicly released and can be directly applied to past, ongoing, and future challenges. It enables organizers and participants to publish rankings that are statistically sound, clinically meaningful, and demographically fair.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical workflow recognition enables context-aware assistance and skill assessment in computer-assisted interventions. Despite recent advances, current methods suffer from two critical challenges: prediction jitter across consecutive frames and poor discrimination of ambiguous phases.

Method: We propose a dual-pathway framework DSTED with Reliable Memory Propagation (RMP) and Uncertainty-Aware Prototype Retrieval (UPR). RMP maintains temporal coherence by filtering and fusing high-confidence historical features through multi-criteria reliability assessment. UPR constructs learnable class-specific prototypes from high-uncertainty samples and performs adaptive prototype matching to refine ambiguous frame representations. Finally, a confidence-driven gate dynamically balances both pathways based on prediction certainty.

Result: Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on AutoLaparo-hysterectomy with 84.36% accuracy and 65.51% F1-score, surpassing the second-best method by 3.51% and 4.88% respectively. Ablations reveal complementary gains from RMP (2.19%) and UPR (1.93%), with synergistic effects when combined. Extensive analysis confirms substantial reduction in temporal jitter and marked improvement on challenging phase transitions.

Conclusion: Our dual-pathway design introduces a novel paradigm for stable workflow recognition, demonstrating that decoupling the modeling of temporal consistency and phase ambiguity yields superior performance and clinical applicability.

Conclusion: MambaMDN通过双域框架和多对比MRI重建技术，显著提升了重建质量，解决了现有技术中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a cornerstone of modern clinical diagnosis, offering unparalleled soft-tissue contrast without ionizing radiation. However, prolonged scan times remain a major barrier to patient throughput and comfort. Existing accelerated MRI techniques often struggle with two key challenges: (1) failure to effectively utilize inherent K-space prior information, leading to persistent aliasing artifacts from zero-filled inputs; and (2) contamination of target reconstruction quality by irrelevant information when employing multi-contrast fusion strategies. To overcome these challenges, we present MambaMDN, a dual-domain framework for multi-contrast MRI reconstruction. Our approach first employs fully-sampled reference K-space data to complete the undersampled target data, generating structurally aligned but modality-mixed inputs. Subsequently, we develop a Mamba-based modality disentanglement network to extract and remove reference-specific features from the mixed representation. Furthermore, we introduce an iterative refinement mechanism to progressively enhance reconstruction accuracy through repeated feature purification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MambaMDN can significantly outperform existing multi-contrast reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: 该论文通过引入协作交互机制（CIM）和自适应特征调制模块（AFMM），重新设计了深度图像水印系统，显著提高了水印提取的准确性和鲁棒性，同时保持了高感知质量。

Abstract: Existing deep image watermarking methods follow a fixed embedding-distortion-extraction pipeline, where the embedder and extractor are weakly coupled through a final loss and optimized in isolation. This design lacks explicit collaboration, leaving no structured mechanism for the embedder to incorporate decoding-aware cues or for the extractor to guide embedding during training. To address this architectural limitation, we rethink deep image watermarking by reformulating embedding and extraction as explicitly collaborative components. To realize this reformulation, we introduce a Collaborative Interaction Mechanism (CIM) that establishes direct, bidirectional communication between the embedder and extractor, enabling a mutual-teacher training paradigm and coordinated optimization. Built upon this explicitly collaborative architecture, we further propose an Adaptive Feature Modulation Module (AFMM) to support effective interaction. AFMM enables content-aware feature regulation by decoupling modulation structure and strength, guiding watermark embedding toward stable image features while suppressing host interference during extraction. Under CIM, the AFMMs on both sides form a closed-loop collaboration that aligns embedding behavior with extraction objectives. This architecture-level redesign changes how robustness is learned in watermarking systems. Rather than relying on exhaustive distortion simulation, robustness emerges from coordinated representation learning between embedding and extraction. Experiments on real-world and AI-generated datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in watermark extraction accuracy while maintaining high perceptual quality, showing strong robustness and generalization.

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have achieved remarkable success in image representation and compression, but they require substantial training time and memory. Meanwhile, recent 2D Gaussian Splatting (GS) methods (\textit{e.g.}, GaussianImage) offer promising alternatives through efficient primitive-based rendering. However, these methods require excessive Gaussian primitives to maintain high visual fidelity. To exploit the potential of GS-based approaches, we present GaussianImage++, which utilizes limited Gaussian primitives to achieve impressive representation and compression performance. Firstly, we introduce a distortion-driven densification mechanism. It progressively allocates Gaussian primitives according to signal intensity. Secondly, we employ context-aware Gaussian filters for each primitive, which assist in the densification to optimize Gaussian primitives based on varying image content. Thirdly, we integrate attribute-separated learnable scalar quantizers and quantization-aware training, enabling efficient compression of primitive attributes. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. In particular, GaussianImage++ outperforms GaussianImage and INRs-based COIN in representation and compression performance while maintaining real-time decoding and low memory usage.

Abstract: This work presents two novel solvers for estimating the relative poses among views with known vertical directions. The vertical directions of camera views can be easily obtained using inertial measurement units (IMUs) which have been widely used in autonomous vehicles, mobile phones, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Given the known vertical directions, our lgorithms only need to solve for two rotation angles and two translation vectors. In this paper, a linear closed-form solution has been described, requiring only four point correspondences in three views. We also propose a minimal solution with three point correspondences using the latest Gröbner basis solver. Since the proposed methods require fewer point correspondences, they can be efficiently applied within the RANSAC framework for outliers removal and pose estimation in visual odometry. The proposed method has been tested on both synthetic data and real-world scenes from KITTI. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the estimated poses is superior to other alternative methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出两种新方法解决MLLMs在医学解剖图像推理中的问题：渐进式学习和问题增强，实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学解剖图像理解任务需要精确且临床一致的答案，但现有方法因数据复杂性和高质量标注稀缺性而受限。GRPO在解剖识别中存在知识共享不足和推理路径单一的问题。

Method: 1. 渐进式学习策略（Anatomical Similarity Curriculum Learning）通过控制问题难度逐步提升模型能力；2. 问题增强方法（Group Diversity Question Augmentation）扩展模型搜索空间，避免单一推理路径。

Result: 在SGG-VQA和OmniMedVQA基准测试中，本文方法显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出的渐进式学习策略和问题增强方法显著提升了MLLMs在医学解剖图像推理中的性能，尤其在SGG-VQA和OmniMedVQA基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in natural image reasoning, yet their potential in medical imaging remains underexplored, especially in clinical anatomical surgical images. Anatomy understanding tasks demand precise understanding and clinically coherent answers, which are difficult to achieve due to the complexity of medical data and the scarcity of high-quality expert annotations. These challenges limit the effectiveness of conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategies. While recent work has demonstrated that Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) can enhance reasoning in MLLMs without relying on large amounts of data, we find two weaknesses that hinder GRPO's reasoning performance in anatomy recognition: 1) knowledge cannot be effectively shared between different anatomical structures, resulting in uneven information gain and preventing the model from converging, and 2) the model quickly converges to a single reasoning path, suppressing the exploration of diverse strategies. To overcome these challenges, we propose two novel methods. First, we implement a progressive learning strategy called Anatomical Similarity Curriculum Learning by controlling question difficulty via the similarity of answer choices, enabling the model to master complex problems incrementally. Second, we utilize question augmentation referred to as Group Diversity Question Augmentation to expand the model's search space for difficult queries, mitigating the tendency to produce uniform responses. Comprehensive experiments on the SGG-VQA and OmniMedVQA benchmarks show our method achieves a significant improvement across the two benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the medical reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. The code can be found in https://github.com/tomato996/Anatomy-R1

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）分解MLLM的输出表示，分析其内在行为。

Result: 分析表明，MLLMs的表示空间主要由文本语义主导，视觉信息占比小，且相似性计算的关键特征组件会降低检索性能。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在零样本多模态检索任务中的表现不足，并提出可能的改进方向。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in generative tasks, we observe that they exhibit a counterintuitive deficiency in the zero-shot multimodal retrieval task. In this work, we investigate the underlying mechanisms that hinder MLLMs from serving as effective retrievers. With the help of sparse autoencoders (SAEs), we decompose MLLM output representations into interpretable semantic concepts to probe their intrinsic behavior. Our analysis reveals that the representation space of MLLMs is overwhelmingly dominated by textual semantics; the visual information essential for multimodal retrieval only constitutes a small portion. This imbalance is compounded by the heavy focus of MLLMs on bridging image-text modalities, which facilitates generation but homogenizes embeddings and finally diminishes the discriminative power required for multimodal retrieval. We further discover that the specific feature components that contribute most to the similarity computations for MLLMs are in fact distractors that actively degrade retrieval performance. Overall, our work provides the first in-depth interpretability analysis of MLLM representations in the context of multimodal retrieval and offers possible directions for enhancing the multimodal retrieval capabilities of MLLMs.

Conclusion: CASA（Cross-Attention via Self-Attention）通过结合局部文本到文本交互，显著缩小了与完全令牌插入模型的性能差距，同时保持了跨注意力模型在长上下文多模态任务中的可扩展性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are commonly trained by inserting image tokens from a pretrained vision encoder into the textual stream of a language model. This allows text and image information to fully attend to one another within the model, but becomes extremely costly for high-resolution images, long conversations, or streaming videos, both in memory and compute. VLMs leveraging cross-attention are an efficient alternative to token insertion but exhibit a clear performance gap, in particular on tasks involving fine-grained visual details. We find that a key to improving such models is to also enable local text-to-text interaction in the dedicated cross-attention layers. Building on this, we propose CASA, Cross-Attention via Self-Attention, a simple and efficient paradigm which substantially reduces the gap with full token insertion on common image understanding benchmarks, while enjoying the same scalability as cross-attention models when applied to long-context multimodal tasks such as streaming video captioning.

Conclusion: AMap框架通过‘distill-from-future’范式显著提升了当前帧感知能力，尤其在关键的前向区域表现优于现有时间模型，同时保持了单帧推理的效率。

Abstract: Online High-Definition (HD) map construction is pivotal for autonomous driving. While recent approaches leverage historical temporal fusion to improve performance, we identify a critical safety flaw in this paradigm: it is inherently ``spatially backward-looking." These methods predominantly enhance map reconstruction in traversed areas, offering minimal improvement for the unseen road ahead. Crucially, our analysis of downstream planning tasks reveals a severe asymmetry: while rearward perception errors are often tolerable, inaccuracies in the forward region directly precipitate hazardous driving maneuvers. To bridge this safety gap, we propose AMap, a novel framework for Ahead-aware online HD Mapping. We pioneer a ``distill-from-future" paradigm, where a teacher model with privileged access to future temporal contexts guides a lightweight student model restricted to the current frame. This process implicitly compresses prospective knowledge into the student model, endowing it with ``look-ahead" capabilities at zero inference-time cost. Technically, we introduce a Multi-Level BEV Distillation strategy with spatial masking and an Asymmetric Query Adaptation module to effectively transfer future-aware representations to the student's static queries. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmark demonstrate that AMap significantly enhances current-frame perception. Most notably, it outperforms state-of-the-art temporal models in critical forward regions while maintaining the efficiency of single current frame inference.

Motivation: 婴儿面部建模因数据稀缺和频繁的自发表情而具有挑战性，早期检测发育障碍需要更准确的面部分析工具。

Method: 使用归一化流（normalizing flows）学习灵活的概率表示，结合跨年龄表情迁移技术，从成人3D扫描中提取表情以丰富婴儿数据集。

Result: BabyFlow在嘴、眼、鼻等高表情区域显著提高了3D重建准确性，并支持生成和修改婴儿表情同时保持身份一致性。

Conclusion: BabyFlow通过解耦面部身份和表情，提供了对婴儿面部表情的独立控制，显著提高了3D重建的准确性，并为早期面部分析提供了强大的数据增强工具。

Abstract: Early detection of developmental disorders can be aided by analyzing infant craniofacial morphology, but modeling infant faces is challenging due to limited data and frequent spontaneous expressions. We introduce BabyFlow, a generative AI model that disentangles facial identity and expression, enabling independent control over both. Using normalizing flows, BabyFlow learns flexible, probabilistic representations that capture the complex, non-linear variability of expressive infant faces without restrictive linear assumptions. To address scarce and uncontrolled expressive data, we perform cross-age expression transfer, adapting expressions from adult 3D scans to enrich infant datasets with realistic and systematic expressive variants. As a result, BabyFlow improves 3D reconstruction accuracy, particularly in highly expressive regions such as the mouth, eyes, and nose, and supports synthesis and modification of infant expressions while preserving identity. Additionally, by integrating with diffusion models, BabyFlow generates high-fidelity 2D infant images with consistent 3D geometry, providing powerful tools for data augmentation and early facial analysis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have unified diverse linguistic tasks within a single framework, yet such unification remains unexplored in human motion generation. Existing methods are confined to isolated tasks, limiting flexibility for free-form and omni-objective generation. To address this, we propose OmniMoGen, a unified framework that enables versatile motion generation through interleaved text-motion instructions.

We construct X2Mo, a large-scale dataset of over 137K interleaved text-motion instructions, and introduce AnyContext, a benchmark for evaluating interleaved motion generation. Experiments show that OmniMoGen achieves state-of-the-art performance on text-to-motion, motion editing, and AnyContext, exhibiting emerging capabilities such as compositional editing, self-reflective generation, and knowledge-informed generation. These results mark a step toward the next intelligent motion generation. Project Page: https://OmniMoGen.github.io/.

Motivation: Urban sidewalks often have obstacles that pose safety risks to pedestrians. Advances in pervasive computing and egocentric vision techniques can enable real-time obstacle detection to improve pedestrian safety.

Method: The study involved collecting 340 egocentric videos using mobile phone cameras, capturing 29 common sidewalk obstacles from a pedestrian's perspective, and training state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms with this dataset.

Result: The PEDESTRIAN dataset was successfully created and used to train deep learning models, serving as a benchmark for obstacle detection tasks.

Conclusion: The PEDESTRIAN dataset provides a valuable resource for training deep learning algorithms to detect sidewalk obstacles, enhancing pedestrian safety in urban environments.

Abstract: Walking has always been a primary mode of transportation and is recognized as an essential activity for maintaining good health. Despite the need for safe walking conditions in urban environments, sidewalks are frequently obstructed by various obstacles that hinder free pedestrian movement. Any object obstructing a pedestrian's path can pose a safety hazard. The advancement of pervasive computing and egocentric vision techniques offers the potential to design systems that can automatically detect such obstacles in real time, thereby enhancing pedestrian safety. The development of effective and efficient identification algorithms relies on the availability of comprehensive and well-balanced datasets of egocentric data. In this work, we introduce the PEDESTRIAN dataset, comprising egocentric data for 29 different obstacles commonly found on urban sidewalks. A total of 340 videos were collected using mobile phone cameras, capturing a pedestrian's point of view. Additionally, we present the results of a series of experiments that involved training several state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms using the proposed dataset, which can be used as a benchmark for obstacle detection and recognition tasks. The dataset can be used for training pavement obstacle detectors to enhance the safety of pedestrians in urban areas.

Abstract: Continual self-supervised learning (CSSL) in medical imaging trains a foundation model sequentially, alleviating the need for collecting multi-modal images for joint training and offering promising improvements in downstream performance while preserving data privacy. However, most existing methods still rely on replaying data from previous stages to prevent catastrophic forgetting, which compromises privacy and limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where data transfer across sites is often restricted. In this work, we propose InvCoSS, an inversion-driven continual self-supervised learning framework for medical multi-modal image pre-training. Specifically, after training on a previous task, InvCoSS inverts the pre-trained self-supervised model to generate synthetic images that approximate the original training distribution. These synthetic images are then combined with data from the new task for joint optimization, which effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting while strictly adhering to the constraint of no access to previous real data. Furthermore, to improve the fidelity of synthetic images, we introduce a novel InvUNet with a multi-scale fusion architecture to restore both high- and low-frequency components of the inverted images. To enhance diversity and prevent mode collapse, we design a repulsive representation-learning mechanism that encourages a diverse feature space for synthetic images without class guidance. Extensive experiments across nine downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of InvCoSS, achieving performance comparable to or even superior to prior data-replay methods while significantly reducing storage requirements and eliminating data privacy constraints.

Conclusion: HippMetric框架通过骨骼表示和可变形骨骼坐标系，显著提高了海马体亚结构形态测量的准确性和对应稳定性，为神经退行性疾病的早期生物标志物检测提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Accurate characterization of hippocampal substructure is crucial for detecting subtle structural changes and identifying early neurodegenerative biomarkers. However, high inter-subject variability and complex folding pattern of human hippocampus hinder consistent cross-subject and longitudinal analysis. Most existing approaches rely on subject-specific modelling and lack a stable intrinsic coordinate system to accommodate anatomical variability, which limits their ability to establish reliable inter- and intra-individual correspondence. To address this, we propose HippMetric, a skeletal representation (s-rep)-based framework for hippocampal substructural morphometry and point-wise correspondence across individuals and scans. HippMetric builds on the Axis-Referenced Morphometric Model (ARMM) and employs a deformable skeletal coordinate system aligned with hippocampal anatomy and function, providing a biologically grounded reference for correspondence. Our framework comprises two core modules: a skeletal-based coordinate system that respects the hippocampus' conserved longitudinal lamellar architecture, in which functional units (lamellae) are stacked perpendicular to the long-axis, enabling anatomically consistent localization across subjects and time; and individualized s-reps generated through surface reconstruction, deformation, and geometrically constrained spoke refinement, enforcing boundary adherence, orthogonality and non-intersection to produce mathematically valid skeletal geometry. Extensive experiments on two international cohorts demonstrate that HippMetric achieves higher accuracy, reliability, and correspondence stability compared to existing shape models.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在细粒度空间理解（如地图路径追踪）方面表现不足，主要由于大规模像素级路径注释的高成本和收集难度。

Method: 引入了一个可扩展的合成数据生成流程，利用合成地图图像和像素级解析自动生成精确的路径注释，并构建了一个包含23k路径样本的数据集。

Conclusion: 通过合成监督，可以显式地教授预训练模型中缺失的细粒度空间推理能力，显著提升模型在路径追踪任务上的表现。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models have achieved human-like performance on many visual and textual reasoning tasks, their proficiency in fine-grained spatial understanding, such as route tracing on maps remains limited. Unlike humans, who can quickly learn to parse and navigate maps, current models often fail to respect fundamental path constraints, in part due to the prohibitive cost and difficulty of collecting large-scale, pixel-accurate path annotations. To address this, we introduce a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline that leverages synthetic map images and pixel-level parsing to automatically produce precise annotations for this challenging task. Using this pipeline, we construct a fine-tuning dataset of 23k path samples across 4k maps, enabling models to acquire more human-like spatial capabilities. Using this dataset, we fine-tune both open-source and proprietary MLLMs. Results on MapBench show that finetuning substantially improves robustness, raising success rates by up to 6.4 points, while also reducing path-tracing error (NDTW). These gains highlight that fine-grained spatial reasoning, absent in pretrained models, can be explicitly taught with synthetic supervision.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的知识增强联合嵌入框架在医学领域的跨模态检索和糖尿病视网膜病变（DR）严重程度分类方面表现出色，显著优于现有基线模型，并展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide, demanding accurate automated diagnostic systems. While general-domain vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perform well on natural image tasks, they struggle in medical domain applications, particularly in cross-modal retrieval for ophthalmological images. We propose a novel knowledge-enhanced joint embedding framework that integrates retinal fundus images, clinical text, and structured patient data through a multimodal transformer architecture to address the critical gap in medical image-text alignment. Our approach employs separate encoders for each modality: a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) for retinal images, Bio-ClinicalBERT for clinical narratives, and a multilayer perceptron for structured demographic and clinical features. These modalities are fused through a joint transformer with modality-specific embeddings, trained using multiple objectives including contrastive losses between modality pairs, reconstruction losses for images and text, and classification losses for DR severity grading according to ICDR and SDRG schemes. Experimental results on the Brazilian Multilabel Ophthalmological Dataset (BRSET) demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models. Our framework achieves near-perfect text-to-image retrieval performance with Recall@1 of 99.94% compared to fine-tuned CLIP's 1.29%, while maintaining state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 97.05% for SDRG and 97.97% for ICDR. Furthermore, zero-shot evaluation on the unseen DeepEyeNet dataset validates strong generalizability with 93.95% Recall@1 versus 0.22% for fine-tuned CLIP. These results demonstrate that our multimodal training approach effectively captures cross-modal relationships in the medical domain, establishing both superior retrieval capabilities and robust diagnostic performance.

Abstract: Generative models can now produce photorealistic imagery, yet they still struggle with the long, multi-goal prompts that professional designers issue. To expose this gap and better evaluate models' performance in real-world settings, we introduce Long Goal Bench (LGBench), a 2,000-task suite (1,000 T2I and 1,000 I2I) whose average instruction contains 18 to 22 tightly coupled goals spanning global layout, local object placement, typography, and logo fidelity. We find that even state-of-the-art models satisfy fewer than 72 percent of the goals and routinely miss localized edits, confirming the brittleness of current pipelines. To address this, we present VisionDirector, a training-free vision-language supervisor that (i) extracts structured goals from long instructions, (ii) dynamically decides between one-shot generation and staged edits, (iii) runs micro-grid sampling with semantic verification and rollback after every edit, and (iv) logs goal-level rewards. We further fine-tune the planner with Group Relative Policy Optimization, yielding shorter edit trajectories (3.1 versus 4.2 steps) and stronger alignment. VisionDirector achieves new state of the art on GenEval (plus 7 percent overall) and ImgEdit (plus 0.07 absolute) while producing consistent qualitative improvements on typography, multi-object scenes, and pose editing.

Conclusion: WorldWarp通过结合3D几何缓存和2D生成细化器，成功解决了长视频生成中的几何一致性问题，实现了最先进的生成质量。

Abstract: Generating long-range, geometrically consistent video presents a fundamental dilemma: while consistency demands strict adherence to 3D geometry in pixel space, state-of-the-art generative models operate most effectively in a camera-conditioned latent space. This disconnect causes current methods to struggle with occluded areas and complex camera trajectories. To bridge this gap, we propose WorldWarp, a framework that couples a 3D structural anchor with a 2D generative refiner. To establish geometric grounding, WorldWarp maintains an online 3D geometric cache built via Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). By explicitly warping historical content into novel views, this cache acts as a structural scaffold, ensuring each new frame respects prior geometry. However, static warping inevitably leaves holes and artifacts due to occlusions. We address this using a Spatio-Temporal Diffusion (ST-Diff) model designed for a "fill-and-revise" objective. Our key innovation is a spatio-temporal varying noise schedule: blank regions receive full noise to trigger generation, while warped regions receive partial noise to enable refinement. By dynamically updating the 3D cache at every step, WorldWarp maintains consistency across video chunks. Consequently, it achieves state-of-the-art fidelity by ensuring that 3D logic guides structure while diffusion logic perfects texture.

Abstract: Recent image generation approaches often address subject, style, and structure-driven conditioning in isolation, leading to feature entanglement and limited task transferability. In this paper, we introduce 3SGen, a task-aware unified framework that performs all three conditioning modes within a single model. 3SGen employs an MLLM equipped with learnable semantic queries to align text-image semantics, complemented by a VAE branch that preserves fine-grained visual details. At its core, an Adaptive Task-specific Memory (ATM) module dynamically disentangles, stores, and retrieves condition-specific priors, such as identity for subjects, textures for styles, and spatial layouts for structures, via a lightweight gating mechanism along with several scalable memory items. This design mitigates inter-task interference and naturally scales to compositional inputs. In addition, we propose 3SGen-Bench, a unified image-driven generation benchmark with standardized metrics for evaluating cross-task fidelity and controllability. Extensive experiments on our proposed 3SGen-Bench and other public benchmarks demonstrate our superior performance across diverse image-driven generation tasks.

Conclusion: HaMoS框架通过结合头部轨迹和间歇性可见的手部线索，显著提升了从第一人称视频中估计全身运动的准确性和时间平滑性，为实际应用中的可靠3D运动理解迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Egocentric vision systems are becoming widely available, creating new opportunities for human-computer interaction. A core challenge is estimating the wearer's full-body motion from first-person videos, which is crucial for understanding human behavior. However, this task is difficult since most body parts are invisible from the egocentric view. Prior approaches mainly rely on head trajectories, leading to ambiguity, or assume continuously tracked hands, which is unrealistic for lightweight egocentric devices. In this work, we present HaMoS, the first hand-aware, sequence-level diffusion framework that directly conditions on both head trajectory and intermittently visible hand cues caused by field-of-view limitations and occlusions, as in real-world egocentric devices. To overcome the lack of datasets pairing diverse camera views with human motion, we introduce a novel augmentation method that models such real-world conditions. We also demonstrate that sequence-level contexts such as body shape and field-of-view are crucial for accurate motion reconstruction, and thus employ local attention to infer long sequences efficiently. Experiments on public benchmarks show that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and temporal smoothness, demonstrating a practical step toward reliable in-the-wild egocentric 3D motion understanding.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在跨类别文本概念融合时存在概念混合不足、评估不严格和输出质量低的问题，表现为概念不平衡、表面组合或简单并列。

Method: 提出了强化混合学习（RMLer）框架，将跨类别概念融合建模为强化学习问题，设计了一个MLP策略网络来预测动态系数，并基于语义相似性和组合平衡引入视觉奖励。

Conclusion: RMLer提供了一个强大的框架，用于生成新颖的视觉概念，在电影、游戏和设计等领域具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: Novel object synthesis by integrating distinct textual concepts from diverse categories remains a significant challenge in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. Existing methods often suffer from insufficient concept mixing, lack of rigorous evaluation, and suboptimal outputs-manifesting as conceptual imbalance, superficial combinations, or mere juxtapositions. To address these limitations, we propose Reinforcement Mixing Learning (RMLer), a framework that formulates cross-category concept fusion as a reinforcement learning problem: mixed features serve as states, mixing strategies as actions, and visual outcomes as rewards. Specifically, we design an MLP-policy network to predict dynamic coefficients for blending cross-category text embeddings. We further introduce visual rewards based on (1) semantic similarity and (2) compositional balance between the fused object and its constituent concepts, optimizing the policy via proximal policy optimization. At inference, a selection strategy leverages these rewards to curate the highest-quality fused objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate RMLer's superiority in synthesizing coherent, high-fidelity objects from diverse categories, outperforming existing methods. Our work provides a robust framework for generating novel visual concepts, with promising applications in film, gaming, and design.

TL;DR: Think2Seg-RS通过解耦框架和强化学习，实现了语义级推理分割，显著提升了地理空间理解的性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）推理分割框架通过端到端监督微调耦合语言推理和像素预测，导致几何基础薄弱且跨任务泛化能力有限。

Method: 开发了Think2Seg-RS框架，训练LVLM提示器通过结构化几何提示控制冻结的Segment Anything Model（SAM），采用仅掩码的强化学习目标。

Result: 在EarthReason数据集上实现了最先进的性能，零样本泛化到多个参考分割基准，揭示了语义级和实例级基础之间的明显分界。

Conclusion: Think2Seg-RS通过解耦框架和结构化几何提示，实现了语义级推理分割的新范式，为地理空间理解开辟了统一且可解释的LVLM驱动地球观测途径。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) hold great promise for advancing remote sensing (RS) analysis, yet existing reasoning segmentation frameworks couple linguistic reasoning and pixel prediction through end-to-end supervised fine-tuning, leading to weak geometric grounding and limited generalization across tasks. To address this, we developed Think2Seg-RS, a decoupled framework that trains an LVLM prompter to control a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) via structured geometric prompts. Through a mask-only reinforcement learning objective, the LVLM learns to translate abstract semantic reasoning into spatially grounded actions, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the EarthReason dataset. Remarkably, the learned prompting policy generalizes zero-shot to multiple referring segmentation benchmarks, exposing a distinct divide between semantic-level and instance-level grounding. We further found that compact segmenters outperform larger ones under semantic-level supervision, and that negative prompts are ineffective in heterogeneous aerial backgrounds. Together, these findings establish semantic-level reasoning segmentation as a new paradigm for geospatial understanding, opening the way toward unified, interpretable LVLM-driven Earth observation.

TL;DR: NIHCs通过标准化隐式坐标系统实现了从稀疏2D分割到高分辨率3D心脏重建的高效、准确映射，显著提升了重建速度与精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从稀疏临床图像中准确重建心脏解剖结构是患者特定建模中的主要挑战，而神经隐式函数在此任务中的应用尚未充分探索跨受试者的解剖一致性映射。

Method: 引入了神经隐式心脏坐标（NIHCs），这是一种基于通用心室坐标的标准化隐式坐标系统，可直接从有限的2D分割（稀疏采集）预测NIHCs，并将其解码为任意输出分辨率的密集3D分割和高分辨率网格。

Result: 在大规模数据集（5,000个心脏网格）上训练的模型在临床轮廓上实现了高重建精度，疾病队列的平均欧几里得表面误差为2.51±0.33 mm，健康队列为2.3±0.36 mm。NIHC表示即使在严重的切片稀疏性和分割噪声下也能实现解剖学上一致的重建，并忠实恢复复杂结构（如瓣膜平面）。与传统流程相比，推理时间从超过60秒减少到5-15秒。

Conclusion: NIHCs（神经隐式心脏坐标）是一种稳健且高效的解剖表示方法，能够从最少的输入数据中实现患者特定的3D心脏重建。

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of cardiac anatomy from sparse clinical images remains a major challenge in patient-specific modeling. While neural implicit functions have previously been applied to this task, their application to mapping anatomical consistency across subjects has been limited. In this work, we introduce Neural Implicit Heart Coordinates (NIHCs), a standardized implicit coordinate system, based on universal ventricular coordinates, that provides a common anatomical reference frame for the human heart. Our method predicts NIHCs directly from a limited number of 2D segmentations (sparse acquisition) and subsequently decodes them into dense 3D segmentations and high-resolution meshes at arbitrary output resolution. Trained on a large dataset of 5,000 cardiac meshes, the model achieves high reconstruction accuracy on clinical contours, with mean Euclidean surface errors of 2.51$\pm$0.33 mm in a diseased cohort (n=4549) and 2.3$\pm$0.36 mm in a healthy cohort (n=5576). The NIHC representation enables anatomically coherent reconstruction even under severe slice sparsity and segmentation noise, faithfully recovering complex structures such as the valve planes. Compared with traditional pipelines, inference time is reduced from over 60 s to 5-15 s. These results demonstrate that NIHCs constitute a robust and efficient anatomical representation for patient-specific 3D cardiac reconstruction from minimal input data.

Conclusion: 本文通过扩展OpenTTGames数据集，提供了详细的乒乓球视频标注（包括击球类型、球员姿势和回合结果），填补了社区中公开可用资源的空白，并支持非商业用途的自由使用和修改。

Abstract: Automatically detecting and classifying strokes in table tennis video can streamline training workflows, enrich broadcast overlays, and enable fine-grained performance analytics. For this to be possible, annotated video data of table tennis is needed. We extend the public OpenTTGames dataset with highly detailed, frame-accurate shot type annotations (forehand, backhand with subtypes), player posture labels (body lean and leg stance), and rally outcome tags at point end. OpenTTGames is a set of recordings from the side of the table with official labels for bounces, when the ball is above the net, or hitting the net. The dataset already contains ball coordinates near events, which are either "bounce", "net", or "empty_event" in the original OpenTTGames dataset, and semantic masks (humans, table, scoreboard). Our extension adds the types of stroke to the events and a per-player taxonomy so models can move beyond event spotting toward tactical understanding (e.g., whether a stroke is likely to win the point or set up an advantage). We provide a compact coding scheme and code-assisted labeling procedure to support reproducible annotations and baselines for fine-grained stroke understanding in racket sports. This fills a practical gap in the community, where many prior video resources are either not publicly released or carry restrictive/unclear licenses that hinder reuse and benchmarking. Our annotations are released under the same CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license as OpenTTGames, allowing free non-commercial use, modification, and redistribution, with appropriate attribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIL方法在处理大规模和异质性WSI时，难以有效丢弃无用信息或整合相关特征，限制了其性能。

Method: DeltaMIL采用门控delta规则，结合遗忘和记忆机制，动态更新记忆并过滤无关信息，同时通过局部模式混合机制保留细粒度病理信息。

Result: 在生存预测任务中，DeltaMIL使用ResNet-50和UNI特征分别提升了3.69%和2.36%；在幻灯片分类任务中，分别提升了3.09%和3.75%。

Conclusion: DeltaMIL通过动态更新记忆和快速遗忘无关信号，显著提升了在WSI任务中的性能，并在生存预测和幻灯片分类任务中均实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Whole Slide Images (WSIs) are typically analyzed using multiple instance learning (MIL) methods. However, the scale and heterogeneity of WSIs generate highly redundant and dispersed information, making it difficult to identify and integrate discriminative signals. Existing MIL methods either fail to discard uninformative cues effectively or have limited ability to consolidate relevant features from multiple patches, which restricts their performance on large and heterogeneous WSIs. To address this issue, we propose DeltaMIL, a novel MIL framework that explicitly selects semantically relevant regions and integrates the discriminative information from WSIs. Our method leverages the gated delta rule to efficiently filter and integrate information through a block combining forgetting and memory mechanisms. The delta mechanism dynamically updates the memory by removing old values and inserting new ones according to their correlation with the current patch. The gating mechanism further enables rapid forgetting of irrelevant signals. Additionally, DeltaMIL integrates a complementary local pattern mixing mechanism to retain fine-grained pathological locality. Our design enhances the extraction of meaningful cues and suppresses redundant or noisy information, which improves the model's robustness and discriminative power. Experiments demonstrate that DeltaMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, for survival prediction, DeltaMIL improves performance by 3.69\% using ResNet-50 features and 2.36\% using UNI features. For slide-level classification, it increases accuracy by 3.09\% with ResNet-50 features and 3.75\% with UNI features. These results demonstrate the strong and consistent performance of DeltaMIL across diverse WSI tasks.

Conclusion: GANeXt通过联合训练和优化的损失函数组合，实现了跨模态和跨解剖区域的统一CT合成，为临床治疗计划提供了准确的解剖表示。

Abstract: The synthesis of computed tomography (CT) from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cone-beam CT (CBCT) plays a critical role in clinical treatment planning by enabling accurate anatomical representation in adaptive radiotherapy. In this work, we propose GANeXt, a 3D patch-based, fully ConvNeXt-powered generative adversarial network for unified CT synthesis across different modalities and anatomical regions. Specifically, GANeXt employs an efficient U-shaped generator constructed from stacked 3D ConvNeXt blocks with compact convolution kernels, while the discriminator adopts a conditional PatchGAN. To improve synthesis quality, we incorporate a combination of loss functions, including mean absolute error (MAE), perceptual loss, segmentation-based masked MAE, and adversarial loss and a combination of Dice loss and cross-entropy for multi-head segmentation discriminator. For both tasks, training is performed with a batch size of 8 using two separate AdamW optimizers for the generator and discriminator, each equipped with a warmup and cosine decay scheduler, with learning rates of $5\times10^{-4}$ and $1\times10^{-3}$, respectively. Data preprocessing includes deformable registration, foreground cropping, percentile normalization for the input modality, and linear normalization of the CT to the range $[-1024, 1000]$. Data augmentation involves random zooming within $(0.8, 1.3)$ (for MRI-to-CT only), fixed-size cropping to $32\times160\times192$ for MRI-to-CT and $32\times128\times128$ for CBCT-to-CT, and random flipping. During inference, we apply a sliding-window approach with $0.8$ overlap and average folding to reconstruct the full-size sCT, followed by inversion of the CT normalization. After joint training on all regions without any fine-tuning, the final models are selected at the end of 3000 epochs for MRI-to-CT and 1000 epochs for CBCT-to-CT using the full training dataset.

Abstract: Remote sensing image change detection is one of the fundamental tasks in remote sensing intelligent interpretation. Its core objective is to identify changes within change regions of interest (CRoI). Current multimodal large models encode rich human semantic knowledge, which is utilized for guidance in tasks such as remote sensing change detection. However, existing methods that use semantic guidance for detecting users' CRoI overly rely on explicit textual descriptions of CRoI, leading to the problem of near-complete performance failure when presented with implicit CRoI textual descriptions. This paper proposes a multimodal reasoning change detection model named ReasonCD, capable of mining users' implicit task intent. The model leverages the powerful reasoning capabilities of pre-trained large language models to mine users' implicit task intents and subsequently obtains different change detection results based on these intents. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that the model achieves excellent change detection performance, with an F1 score of 92.1\% on the BCDD dataset. Furthermore, to validate its superior reasoning functionality, this paper annotates a subset of reasoning data based on the SECOND dataset. Experimental results show that the model not only excels at basic reasoning-based change detection tasks but can also explain the reasoning process to aid human decision-making.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出首个用于无人机视角地理定位的SNN框架SpikeViMFormer，通过脉冲驱动Transformer和新型注意力机制解决信息丢失和长程依赖问题，实验显示其性能优于SNN且与ANN相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于ANN的无人机视角地理定位方法计算密集且功耗高，而SNN虽具有低功耗优势，但其在DVGL任务中的潜力尚未充分挖掘，且脉冲驱动的稀疏性可能导致关键信息丢失和长程依赖学习困难。

Method: 采用轻量级脉冲驱动Transformer主干网络提取粗粒度特征，设计了脉冲驱动选择性注意力（SSA）块和脉冲驱动混合状态空间（SHS）块，分别用于增强关键信息和学习长程依赖关系。推理阶段仅使用主干网络以降低计算成本，并通过分层重排序对齐学习（HRAL）策略优化主干网络。

Result: 实验表明，SpikeViMFormer在性能上优于现有SNN方法，并与先进ANN方法相当。

Conclusion: SpikeViMFormer框架在无人机视角地理定位任务中表现出色，不仅超越了现有SNN方法，还与先进的ANN方法性能相当，同时保持了低功耗优势。

Abstract: Traditional drone-view geo-localization (DVGL) methods based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) have achieved remarkable performance. However, ANNs rely on dense computation, which results in high power consumption. In contrast, spiking neural networks (SNNs), which benefit from spike-driven computation, inherently provide low power consumption. Regrettably, the potential of SNNs for DVGL has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Meanwhile, the inherent sparsity of spike-driven computation for representation learning scenarios also results in loss of critical information and difficulties in learning long-range dependencies when aligning heterogeneous visual data sources. To address these, we propose SpikeViMFormer, the first SNN framework designed for DVGL. In this framework, a lightweight spike-driven transformer backbone is adopted to extract coarse-grained features. To mitigate the loss of critical information, the spike-driven selective attention (SSA) block is designed, which uses a spike-driven gating mechanism to achieve selective feature enhancement and highlight discriminative regions. Furthermore, a spike-driven hybrid state space (SHS) block is introduced to learn long-range dependencies using a hybrid state space. Moreover, only the backbone is utilized during the inference stage to reduce computational cost. To ensure backbone effectiveness, a novel hierarchical re-ranking alignment learning (HRAL) strategy is proposed. It refines features via neighborhood re-ranking and maintains cross-batch consistency to directly optimize the backbone. Experimental results demonstrate that SpikeViMFormer outperforms state-of-the-art SNNs. Compared with advanced ANNs, it also achieves competitive performance.Our code is available at https://github.com/ISChenawei/SpikeViMFormer

Motivation: 传统的内窥镜检查具有侵入性，而非对比计算机断层扫描（NCCT）尚未在临床实践中充分应用。MOON++ 旨在填补这一空白，提供更高效、非侵入性的 EV 诊断方法。

Method: MOON++ 通过多模态学习整合食管、肝脏和脾脏的影像特征，结合临床知识先验，优化了 EV 的严重程度分类。

Result: 在 1,631 名患者中验证，MOON++ 在严重 EV 分类（G3 vs. <G3）中 AUC 达到 0.894，优于传统单器官方法的 0.803。

Conclusion: MOON++ 是一种创新的多模态框架，通过综合分析 NCCT 扫描提升食管静脉曲张（EV）评估，为非侵入性诊断提供了潜在的新选择。

Abstract: Esophageal varices (EV) represent a critical complication of portal hypertension, affecting approximately 60% of cirrhosis patients with a significant bleeding risk of ~30%. While traditionally diagnosed through invasive endoscopy, non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) presents a potential non-invasive alternative that has yet to be fully utilized in clinical practice. We present Multi-Organ-COhesion Network++ (MOON++), a novel multimodal framework that enhances EV assessment through comprehensive analysis of NCCT scans. Inspired by clinical evidence correlating organ volumetric relationships with liver disease severity, MOON++ synthesizes imaging characteristics of the esophagus, liver, and spleen through multimodal learning. We evaluated our approach using 1,631 patients, those with endoscopically confirmed EV were classified into four severity grades. Validation in 239 patient cases and independent testing in 289 cases demonstrate superior performance compared to conventional single organ methods, achieving an AUC of 0.894 versus 0.803 for the severe grade EV classification (G3 versus <G3) and 0.921 versus 0.793 for the differentiation of moderate to severe grades (>=G2 versus <G2). We conducted a reader study involving experienced radiologists to further validate the performance of MOON++. To our knowledge, MOON++ represents the first comprehensive multi-organ NCCT analysis framework incorporating clinical knowledge priors for EV assessment, potentially offering a promising non-invasive diagnostic alternative.

Conclusion: dMLLM-TTS框架通过高效的分层搜索算法和自验证反馈机制，显著提升了生成质量并实现了高达6倍的效率提升。

Abstract: Diffusion Multi-modal Large Language Models (dMLLMs) have recently emerged as a novel architecture unifying image generation and understanding. However, developing effective and efficient Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods to unlock their full generative potential remains an underexplored challenge. To address this, we propose dMLLM-TTS, a novel framework operating on two complementary scaling axes: (1) trajectory exploration scaling to enhance the diversity of generated hypotheses, and (2) iterative refinement scaling for stable generation. Conventional TTS approaches typically perform linear search across these two dimensions, incurring substantial computational costs of O(NT) and requiring an external verifier for best-of-N selection. To overcome these limitations, we propose two innovations. First, we design an efficient hierarchical search algorithm with O(N+T) complexity that adaptively expands and prunes sampling trajectories. Second, we introduce a self-verified feedback mechanism that leverages the dMLLMs' intrinsic image understanding capabilities to assess text-image alignment, eliminating the need for external verifier. Extensive experiments on the GenEval benchmark across three representative dMLLMs (e.g., Lumina-DiMOO, MMaDA, Muddit) show that our framework substantially improves generation quality while achieving up to 6x greater efficiency than linear search.

Conclusion: D2Pruner通过结合去偏重要性和结构化剪枝机制，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在细粒度定位任务中的性能，同时保持了高效的计算效率。

Abstract: Processing long visual token sequences poses a significant computational burden on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). While token pruning offers a path to acceleration, we find that current methods, while adequate for general understanding, catastrophically fail on fine-grained localization tasks. We attribute this failure to the inherent flaws of the two prevailing strategies: importance-based methods suffer from a strong positional bias, an inherent model artifact that distracts from semantic content, while diversity-based methods exhibit structural blindness, disregarding the user's prompt and spatial redundancy. To address this, we introduce D2Pruner, a framework that rectifies these issues by uniquely combining debiased importance with a structural pruning mechanism. Our method first secures a core set of the most critical tokens as pivots based on a debiased attention score. It then performs a Maximal Independent Set (MIS) selection on the remaining tokens, which are modeled on a hybrid graph where edges signify spatial proximity and semantic similarity. This process iteratively preserves the most important and available token while removing its neighbors, ensuring that the supplementary tokens are chosen to maximize importance and diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D2Pruner has exceptional efficiency and fidelity. Applied to LLaVA-1.5-7B for general understanding tasks, it reduces FLOPs by 74.2\% while retaining 99.2\% of its original performance. Furthermore, in challenging localization benchmarks with InternVL-2.5-8B, it maintains 85.7\% performance at a 90\% token reduction rate, marking a significant advancement with up to 63. 53\% improvement over existing methods.

TL;DR: Emotion-Director是一个跨模态协作框架，通过MC-Diffusion和MC-Agent解决情感图像生成中的语义混淆问题，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感导向图像生成方法存在情感与语义的混淆问题，而情感与语义并不等同。Emotion-Director旨在突破这一限制，实现更准确的情感导向图像生成。

Method: 提出Emotion-Director框架，包含MC-Diffusion（跨模态协作扩散模型）和MC-Agent（跨模态协作代理系统）。MC-Diffusion结合视觉和文本提示生成超越语义的情感导向图像；MC-Agent通过多代理模拟人类情感主观性，改进文本提示的视觉表达。

Result: 通过大量定性和定量实验验证，Emotion-Director在情感导向图像生成中表现优异。

Conclusion: Emotion-Director通过跨模态协作框架（MC-Diffusion和MC-Agent）有效解决了情感导向图像生成中的语义捷径问题，展现了在情感导向图像生成中的优越性。

Abstract: Image generation based on diffusion models has demonstrated impressive capability, motivating exploration into diverse and specialized applications. Owing to the importance of emotion in advertising, emotion-oriented image generation has attracted increasing attention. However, current emotion-oriented methods suffer from an affective shortcut, where emotions are approximated to semantics. As evidenced by two decades of research, emotion is not equivalent to semantics. To this end, we propose Emotion-Director, a cross-modal collaboration framework consisting of two modules. First, we propose a cross-Modal Collaborative diffusion model, abbreviated as MC-Diffusion. MC-Diffusion integrates visual prompts with textual prompts for guidance, enabling the generation of emotion-oriented images beyond semantics. Further, we improve the DPO optimization by a negative visual prompt, enhancing the model's sensitivity to different emotions under the same semantics. Second, we propose MC-Agent, a cross-Modal Collaborative Agent system that rewrites textual prompts to express the intended emotions. To avoid template-like rewrites, MC-Agent employs multi-agents to simulate human subjectivity toward emotions, and adopts a chain-of-concept workflow that improves the visual expressiveness of the rewritten prompts. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of Emotion-Director in emotion-oriented image generation.

Conclusion: DySNet通过动态调整感受野和权重，有效解决了DMIR中的组合爆炸问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Combinatorial explosion problem caused by dual inputs presents a critical challenge in Deformable Medical Image Registration (DMIR). Since DMIR processes two images simultaneously as input, the combination relationships between features has grown exponentially, ultimately the model considers more interfering features during the feature modeling process. Introducing dynamics in the receptive fields and weights of the network enable the model to eliminate the interfering features combination and model the potential feature combination relationships. In this paper, we propose the Dynamic Stream Network (DySNet), which enables the receptive fields and weights to be dynamically adjusted. This ultimately enables the model to ignore interfering feature combinations and model the potential feature relationships. With two key innovations: 1) Adaptive Stream Basin (AdSB) module dynamically adjusts the shape of the receptive field, thereby enabling the model to focus on the feature relationships with greater correlation. 2) Dynamic Stream Attention (DySA) mechanism generates dynamic weights to search for more valuable feature relationships. Extensive experiments have shown that DySNet consistently outperforms the most advanced DMIR methods, highlighting its outstanding generalization ability. Our code will be released on the website: https://github.com/ShaochenBi/DySNet.

TL;DR: 提出FusionNet框架，通过物理感知的多光谱信息建模长期物理过程的稳定特征，显著提升跨光谱学习性能，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度学习模型在多模态视觉信号处理中依赖的归纳偏置与信号形成的物理过程不一致，导致跨光谱和真实条件下性能脆弱。尤其是依赖直接热信号的方法难以捕捉持续热排放引起的间接但持久的环境变化。

Method: 提出了一个物理感知的表示学习框架，通过中间融合架构（FusionNet）整合地质短波红外（SWIR）比率与热红外（TIR）数据，嵌入可训练的差分信号处理先验，结合混合池化策略和更宽的感受野以增强跨光谱模态的鲁棒性。

Result: 系统消融实验显示，每个架构组件均带来性能提升，DGCNN在SWIR比率上达到88.7%准确率，FusionNet达到90.6%，在五种光谱配置中均优于现有基线。迁移学习实验表明ImageNet预训练会降低TIR性能，凸显了模态感知训练对跨光谱学习的重要性。

Conclusion: 结合物理感知的特征选择与原则性深度学习架构，可以产生稳健且可泛化的表征，表明在挑战性条件下，基于第一性原理的信号建模能提升多光谱学习效果。

Abstract: Modern deep learning models operating on multi-modal visual signals often rely on inductive biases that are poorly aligned with the physical processes governing signal formation, leading to brittle performance under cross-spectral and real-world conditions. In particular, approaches that prioritise direct thermal cues struggle to capture indirect yet persistent environmental alterations induced by sustained heat emissions.
  This work introduces a physics-aware representation learning framework that leverages multi-spectral information to model stable signatures of long-term physical processes. Specifically, a geological Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) ratio sensitive to soil property changes is integrated with Thermal Infrared (TIR) data through an intermediate fusion architecture, instantiated as FusionNet. The proposed backbone embeds trainable differential signal-processing priors within convolutional layers, combines mixed pooling strategies, and employs wider receptive fields to enhance robustness across spectral modalities.
  Systematic ablations show that each architectural component contributes to performance gains, with DGCNN achieving 88.7% accuracy on the SWIR ratio and FusionNet reaching 90.6%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across five spectral configurations. Transfer learning experiments further show that ImageNet pretraining degrades TIR performance, highlighting the importance of modality-aware training for cross-spectral learning.
  Evaluated on real-world data, the results demonstrate that combining physics-aware feature selection with principled deep learning architectures yields robust and generalisable representations, illustrating how first-principles signal modelling can improve multi-spectral learning under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural rendering have achieved impressive results on photorealistic shading and relighting, by using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) as a regression model to learn the rendering equation from a real-world dataset. Such methods show promise for photorealistically relighting real-world objects, which is difficult to classical rendering, as there is no easy-obtained material ground truth. However, significant challenges still remain the dense connections in MLPs result in a large number of parameters, which requires high computation resources, complicating the training, and reducing performance during rendering. Data driven approaches require large amounts of training data for generalization; unbalanced data might bias the model to ignore the unusual illumination conditions, e.g. dark scenes. This paper introduces pbnds+: a novel physics-based neural deferred shading pipeline utilizing convolution neural networks to decrease the parameters and improve the performance in shading and relighting tasks; Energy regularization is also proposed to restrict the model reflection during dark illumination. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms classical baselines, a state-of-the-art neural shading model, and a diffusion-based method.

Method: 提出了一种多模态架构，整合了三种输入模态（球员轨迹、球员类型和球员图像裁剪），使用社会时间Transformer块处理时空动态，并引入了CropDrop预训练策略以防止对图像特征的过度依赖。

Result: 在大规模数据集上展示了方法的有效性，在所有任务中均显著优于现有最先进的基线。

Conclusion: 该研究通过结合结构化数据和视觉线索的Transformer架构，展示了在多模态学习中采用真实掩码策略的重要性，并在所有任务中显著优于现有基线。

Abstract: In this work we propose a multi-modal architecture for analyzing soccer scenes from tactical camera footage, with a focus on three core tasks: ball trajectory inference, ball state classification, and ball possessor identification. To this end, our solution integrates three distinct input modalities (player trajectories, player types and image crops of individual players) into a unified framework that processes spatial and temporal dynamics using a cascade of sociotemporal transformer blocks. Unlike prior methods, which rely heavily on accurate ball tracking or handcrafted heuristics, our approach infers the ball trajectory without direct access to its past or future positions, and robustly identifies the ball state and ball possessor under noisy or occluded conditions from real top league matches. We also introduce CropDrop, a modality-specific masking pre-training strategy that prevents over-reliance on image features and encourages the model to rely on cross-modal patterns during pre-training. We show the effectiveness of our approach on a large-scale dataset providing substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines in all tasks. Our results highlight the benefits of combining structured and visual cues in a transformer-based architecture, and the importance of realistic masking strategies in multi-modal learning.

Abstract: Poor adaptation of orbital implants remains a major contributor to postoperative complications and revision surgery. Although preformed orbital plates are widely used to reduce cost and operative time compared with customized implants, surgeons currently lack publicly available tools and standardized metrics to quantitatively compare plate fit across vendors, sizes, and patient anatomy. We developed SlicerOrbitSurgerySim, an open-source extension for the 3D Slicer platform that enables interactive virtual registration, evaluation, and comparison of multiple preformed orbital plates in a patient-specific virtual planning environment. The software generates reproducible quantitative plate-to-orbit distance metrics and visualization tools that support both patient-specific planning and population-level statistical analysis of plate adaptability. By facilitating objective comparison of implant designs and placement strategies, this tool aims to improve preoperative decision-making, reduce intraoperative plate modification, and promote collaborative research and surgical education. Pilot studies, sample datasets, and detailed tutorials are provided to support testing, transparency, and reproducibility.

Motivation: 为了解决长视频叙事中多镜头视频的连贯性和美学质量问题，受人类记忆启发，提出了StoryMem范式。

Method: 采用基于显式视觉记忆的迭代镜头合成方法，通过Memory-to-Video（M2V）设计，利用预训练的单镜头视频扩散模型，结合LoRA微调和负RoPE偏移，实现了长视频的连贯生成。

Result: 实验证明，StoryMem在跨镜头一致性上优于先前方法，同时保持了高美学质量和提示遵循能力。

Conclusion: StoryMem通过创新的Memory-to-Video设计，显著提升了长视频叙事的连贯性和美学质量，标志着向分钟级连贯视频叙事迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Visual storytelling requires generating multi-shot videos with cinematic quality and long-range consistency. Inspired by human memory, we propose StoryMem, a paradigm that reformulates long-form video storytelling as iterative shot synthesis conditioned on explicit visual memory, transforming pre-trained single-shot video diffusion models into multi-shot storytellers. This is achieved by a novel Memory-to-Video (M2V) design, which maintains a compact and dynamically updated memory bank of keyframes from historical generated shots. The stored memory is then injected into single-shot video diffusion models via latent concatenation and negative RoPE shifts with only LoRA fine-tuning. A semantic keyframe selection strategy, together with aesthetic preference filtering, further ensures informative and stable memory throughout generation. Moreover, the proposed framework naturally accommodates smooth shot transitions and customized story generation applications. To facilitate evaluation, we introduce ST-Bench, a diverse benchmark for multi-shot video storytelling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StoryMem achieves superior cross-shot consistency over previous methods while preserving high aesthetic quality and prompt adherence, marking a significant step toward coherent minute-long video storytelling.

Motivation: 现有方法在动作多样性、时间对齐和依赖额外控制信号方面存在不足，ActAvatar旨在通过文本引导实现精确的动作控制。

Method: ActAvatar采用Phase-Aware Cross-Attention (PACA)分解提示词，渐进式视听对齐策略分层次处理文本和音频，以及两阶段训练策略（先建立视听对应，再通过微调注入动作控制）。

Result: 实验表明，ActAvatar在动作控制和视觉质量上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ActAvatar通过创新的PACA机制、渐进式视听对齐策略和两阶段训练方法，显著提升了说话头像生成中的动作控制和视觉质量，超越了现有技术。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in talking avatar generation, existing methods face critical challenges: insufficient text-following capability for diverse actions, lack of temporal alignment between actions and audio content, and dependency on additional control signals such as pose skeletons. We present ActAvatar, a framework that achieves phase-level precision in action control through textual guidance by capturing both action semantics and temporal context. Our approach introduces three core innovations: (1) Phase-Aware Cross-Attention (PACA), which decomposes prompts into a global base block and temporally-anchored phase blocks, enabling the model to concentrate on phase-relevant tokens for precise temporal-semantic alignment; (2) Progressive Audio-Visual Alignment, which aligns modality influence with the hierarchical feature learning process-early layers prioritize text for establishing action structure while deeper layers emphasize audio for refining lip movements, preventing modality interference; (3) A two-stage training strategy that first establishes robust audio-visual correspondence on diverse data, then injects action control through fine-tuning on structured annotations, maintaining both audio-visual alignment and the model's text-following capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ActAvatar significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both action control and visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模医学生物库中表格数据的丰富性与现实数据集中属性子集的可用性之间存在差异，需要一种能在训练时利用所有表格数据同时在推理时对缺失值保持鲁棒性的方法。

Method: RoVTL采用两阶段方法：对比预训练阶段引入表格属性缺失作为数据增强，下游任务调优阶段使用门控交叉注意力模块进行多模态融合，并结合新颖的Tabular More vs. Fewer损失函数和分离梯度学习。

Result: RoVTL在UK Biobank的心脏MRI扫描数据上表现优于现有方法，并能泛化到外部心脏MRI数据集和自然图像领域。

Conclusion: RoVTL框架通过对比预训练和下游任务调优，有效解决了医学影像与表格数据结合时缺失值的问题，并在多个数据集上展示了其鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large-scale medical biobanks provide imaging data complemented by extensive tabular information, such as demographics or clinical measurements. However, this abundance of tabular attributes does not reflect real-world datasets, where only a subset of attributes may be available. This discrepancy calls for methods that can leverage all the tabular data during training while remaining robust to missing values at inference. To address this challenge, we propose RoVTL (Robust Vision-Tabular Learning), a framework designed to handle any level of tabular data availability, from 0% to 100%. RoVTL comprises two key stages: contrastive pretraining, where we introduce tabular attribute missingness as data augmentation to promote robustness, and downstream task tuning using a gated cross-attention module for multimodal fusion. During fine-tuning, we employ a novel Tabular More vs. Fewer loss that ranks performance based on the amount of available tabular data. Combined with disentangled gradient learning, this enables consistent performance across all tabular data completeness scenarios. We evaluate RoVTL on cardiac MRI scans from the UK Biobank, demonstrating superior robustness to missing tabular data compared to prior methods. Furthermore, RoVTL successfully generalizes to an external cardiac MRI dataset for multimodal disease classification, and extends to the natural images domain, achieving robust performance on a car advertisements dataset.

Abstract: The success of agricultural artificial intelligence depends heavily on large, diverse, and high-quality plant image datasets, yet collecting such data in real field conditions is costly, labor intensive, and seasonally constrained. This paper investigates diffusion-based generative modeling to address these challenges through plant image synthesis, indoor-to-outdoor translation, and expert preference aligned fine tuning. First, a Stable Diffusion model is fine tuned on captioned indoor and outdoor plant imagery to generate realistic, text conditioned images of canola and soybean. Evaluation using Inception Score, Frechet Inception Distance, and downstream phenotype classification shows that synthetic images effectively augment training data and improve accuracy. Second, we bridge the gap between high resolution indoor datasets and limited outdoor imagery using DreamBooth-based text inversion and image guided diffusion, generating translated images that enhance weed detection and classification with YOLOv8. Finally, a preference guided fine tuning framework trains a reward model on expert scores and applies reward weighted updates to produce more stable and expert aligned outputs. Together, these components demonstrate a practical pathway toward data efficient generative pipelines for agricultural AI.

Motivation: 解决基于形变的方法在稀疏时间监督下的样本效率低、无法进行时间外推以及缺乏局部动态注入可控性等问题。

Method: 将高斯表示视为一个演化的物理系统，其状态在学习的运动定律下连续演化，从而学习神经动态场而非逐帧形变。

Conclusion: EvoGS通过将4D高斯溅射重新解释为连续时间动态系统，实现了比基于形变场的方法更好的运动连贯性和时间一致性，同时保持实时渲染能力。

Abstract: We reinterpret 4D Gaussian Splatting as a continuous-time dynamical system, where scene motion arises from integrating a learned neural dynamical field rather than applying per-frame deformations. This formulation, which we call EvoGS, treats the Gaussian representation as an evolving physical system whose state evolves continuously under a learned motion law. This unlocks capabilities absent in deformation-based approaches:(1) sample-efficient learning from sparse temporal supervision by modeling the underlying motion law; (2) temporal extrapolation enabling forward and backward prediction beyond observed time ranges; and (3) compositional dynamics that allow localized dynamics injection for controllable scene synthesis. Experiments on dynamic scene benchmarks show that EvoGS achieves better motion coherence and temporal consistency compared to deformation-field baselines while maintaining real-time rendering

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频生成模型难以在保留输入视频的同时添加环境交互效果，而当前视频修复方法要么需要昂贵的逐帧遮罩，要么产生不真实的结果。

Method: 提出了 Over++，一个视频效果生成框架，无需假设相机姿态、场景静止或深度监督，并构建了一个配对效果数据集。

Result: Over++ 能够生成多样且真实的环境效果，并在效果生成和场景保留方面优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Over++ 在环境效果生成和场景保留方面表现优于现有基线方法，尽管训练数据有限。

Abstract: In professional video compositing workflows, artists must manually create environmental interactions-such as shadows, reflections, dust, and splashes-between foreground subjects and background layers. Existing video generative models struggle to preserve the input video while adding such effects, and current video inpainting methods either require costly per-frame masks or yield implausible results. We introduce augmented compositing, a new task that synthesizes realistic, semi-transparent environmental effects conditioned on text prompts and input video layers, while preserving the original scene. To address this task, we present Over++, a video effect generation framework that makes no assumptions about camera pose, scene stationarity, or depth supervision. We construct a paired effect dataset tailored for this task and introduce an unpaired augmentation strategy that preserves text-driven editability. Our method also supports optional mask control and keyframe guidance without requiring dense annotations. Despite training on limited data, Over++ produces diverse and realistic environmental effects and outperforms existing baselines in both effect generation and scene preservation.

Abstract: Background: High-resolution MRI is critical for diagnosis, but long acquisition times limit clinical use. Super-resolution (SR) can enhance resolution post-scan, yet existing deep learning methods face fidelity-efficiency trade-offs. Purpose: To develop a computationally efficient and accurate deep learning framework for MRI SR that preserves anatomical detail for clinical integration. Materials and Methods: We propose a novel SR framework combining multi-head selective state-space models (MHSSM) with a lightweight channel MLP. The model uses 2D patch extraction with hybrid scanning to capture long-range dependencies. Each MambaFormer block integrates MHSSM, depthwise convolutions, and gated channel mixing. Evaluation used 7T brain T1 MP2RAGE maps (n=142) and 1.5T prostate T2w MRI (n=334). Comparisons included Bicubic interpolation, GANs (CycleGAN, Pix2pix, SPSR), transformers (SwinIR), Mamba (MambaIR), and diffusion models (I2SB, Res-SRDiff). Results: Our model achieved superior performance with exceptional efficiency. For 7T brain data: SSIM=0.951+-0.021, PSNR=26.90+-1.41 dB, LPIPS=0.076+-0.022, GMSD=0.083+-0.017, significantly outperforming all baselines (p<0.001). For prostate data: SSIM=0.770+-0.049, PSNR=27.15+-2.19 dB, LPIPS=0.190+-0.095, GMSD=0.087+-0.013. The framework used only 0.9M parameters and 57 GFLOPs, reducing parameters by 99.8% and computation by 97.5% versus Res-SRDiff, while outperforming SwinIR and MambaIR in accuracy and efficiency. Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an efficient, accurate MRI SR solution, delivering enhanced anatomical detail across datasets.

Method: VA-$π$ 将生成器与分词器的对齐问题建模为变分优化，推导出一个统一像素重建和自回归建模的证据下界（ELBO），并引入基于强化学习的对齐策略，以像素空间重建质量作为内在奖励。

Result: 实验表明，VA-$π$ 在少量数据和短时间内显著提升了模型性能（如 FID 从 14.36 降至 7.65，IS 从 86.55 提升至 116.70），并在文本到图像任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: VA-$π$ 是一种轻量级的后训练框架，通过像素空间目标直接优化自回归模型，显著提升了生成图像的质量和多样性。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) visual generation relies on tokenizers to map images to and from discrete sequences. However, tokenizers are trained to reconstruct clean images from ground-truth tokens, while AR generators are optimized only for token likelihood. This misalignment leads to generated token sequences that may decode into low-quality images, without direct supervision from the pixel space. We propose VA-$π$, a lightweight post-training framework that directly optimizes AR models with a principled pixel-space objective. VA-$π$ formulates the generator-tokenizer alignment as a variational optimization, deriving an evidence lower bound (ELBO) that unifies pixel reconstruction and autoregressive modeling. To optimize under the discrete token space, VA-$π$ introduces a reinforcement-based alignment strategy that treats the AR generator as a policy, uses pixel-space reconstruction quality as its intrinsic reward. The reward is measured by how well the predicted token sequences can reconstruct the original image under teacher forcing, giving the model direct pixel-level guidance without expensive free-running sampling. The regularization term of the ELBO serves as a natural regularizer, maintaining distributional consistency of tokens. VA-$π$ enables rapid adaptation of existing AR generators, without neither tokenizer retraining nor external reward models. With only 1% ImageNet-1K data and 25 minutes of tuning, it reduces FID from 14.36 to 7.65 and improves IS from 86.55 to 116.70 on LlamaGen-XXL, while also yielding notable gains in the text-to-image task on GenEval for both visual generation model (LlamaGen: from 0.306 to 0.339) and unified multi-modal model (Janus-Pro: from 0.725 to 0.744).

Result: 评估显示，在开放世界环境中，结构化室内基准测试中的性能提升消失。进一步分析证实，当前MLLMs严重依赖语言先验而非视觉推理。

Conclusion: 当前的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在空间智能方面表现不足，尤其在开放世界场景中依赖语言先验而非视觉推理。新提出的基准测试为诊断这些局限性和推动物理基础的空间智能发展提供了平台。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance on semantic tasks, their spatial intelligence--crucial for robust and grounded AI systems--remains underdeveloped. Existing benchmarks fall short of diagnosing this limitation: they either focus on overly simplified qualitative reasoning or rely on domain-specific indoor data, constrained by the lack of outdoor datasets with verifiable metric ground truth. To bridge this gap, we introduce a large-scale benchmark built from pedestrian-perspective videos captured with synchronized stereo cameras, LiDAR, and IMU/GPS sensors. This dataset provides metrically precise 3D information, enabling the automatic generation of spatial reasoning questions that span a hierarchical spectrum--from qualitative relational reasoning to quantitative metric and kinematic understanding. Evaluations reveal that the performance gains observed in structured indoor benchmarks vanish in open-world settings. Further analysis using synthetic abnormal scenes and blinding tests confirms that current MLLMs depend heavily on linguistic priors instead of grounded visual reasoning. Our benchmark thus provides a principled platform for diagnosing these limitations and advancing physically grounded spatial intelligence.

Motivation: 当前的多模态生成过程中，思考过程主要关注文本提示的一致性，而忽略了与视觉参考图像的视觉上下文一致性，导致关键视觉特征（如人物ID、对象属性、风格）无法保持。

Conclusion: 通过将视觉上下文一致性整合到统一模型的推理中，本文提出的方法显著提升了多模态生成的视觉一致性，超越了零样本统一模型和带有文本CoT的模型。

Abstract: Recently, the introduction of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has largely improved the generation ability of unified models. However, it is observed that the current thinking process during generation mainly focuses on the text consistency with the text prompt, ignoring the \textbf{visual context consistency} with the visual reference images during the multi-modal generation, e.g., multi-reference generation. The lack of such consistency results in the failure in maintaining key visual features (like human ID, object attribute, style). To this end, we integrate the visual context consistency into the reasoning of unified models, explicitly motivating the model to sustain such consistency by 1) Adaptive Visual Planning: generating structured visual check list to figure out the visual element of needed consistency keeping, and 2) Iterative Visual Correction: performing self-reflection with the guidance of check lists and refining the generated result in an iterative manner. To achieve this, we use supervised finetuning to teach the model how to plan the visual checking, conduct self-reflection and self-refinement, and use flow-GRPO to further enhance the visual consistency through a customized visual checking reward. The experiments show that our method outperforms both zero-shot unified models and those with text CoTs in multi-modal generation, demonstrating higher visual context consistency.

Abstract: Generating realistic human-human interactions is a challenging task that requires not only high-quality individual body and hand motions, but also coherent coordination among all interactants. Due to limitations in available data and increased learning complexity, previous methods tend to ignore hand motions, limiting the realism and expressivity of the interactions. Additionally, current diffusion-based approaches generate entire motion sequences simultaneously, limiting their ability to capture the reactive and adaptive nature of human interactions. To address these limitations, we introduce Interact2Ar, the first end-to-end text-conditioned autoregressive diffusion model for generating full-body, human-human interactions. Interact2Ar incorporates detailed hand kinematics through dedicated parallel branches, enabling high-fidelity full-body generation. Furthermore, we introduce an autoregressive pipeline coupled with a novel memory technique that facilitates adaptation to the inherent variability of human interactions using efficient large context windows. The adaptability of our model enables a series of downstream applications, including temporal motion composition, real-time adaptation to disturbances, and extension beyond dyadic to multi-person scenarios. To validate the generated motions, we introduce a set of robust evaluators and extended metrics designed specifically for assessing full-body interactions. Through quantitative and qualitative experiments, we demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Interact2Ar.

Conclusion: 本文提出的Prism假设为多模态编码器的行为提供了统一视角，并通过UAE模型成功实现了语义结构与像素细节的和谐共存，实验验证了其卓越性能。

Abstract: Deep representations across modalities are inherently intertwined. In this paper, we systematically analyze the spectral characteristics of various semantic and pixel encoders. Interestingly, our study uncovers a highly inspiring and rarely explored correspondence between an encoder's feature spectrum and its functional role: semantic encoders primarily capture low-frequency components that encode abstract meaning, whereas pixel encoders additionally retain high-frequency information that conveys fine-grained detail. This heuristic finding offers a unifying perspective that ties encoder behavior to its underlying spectral structure. We define it as the Prism Hypothesis, where each data modality can be viewed as a projection of the natural world onto a shared feature spectrum, just like the prism. Building on this insight, we propose Unified Autoencoding (UAE), a model that harmonizes semantic structure and pixel details via an innovative frequency-band modulator, enabling their seamless coexistence. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and MS-COCO benchmarks validate that our UAE effectively unifies semantic abstraction and pixel-level fidelity into a single latent space with state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于Stern-Brocot树压缩遍历的新算法，解决了有理数搜索问题，并扩展至无界有理数搜索和未知实数的最佳有理逼近问题。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of rational search: given an unknown rational number $α= \frac{a}{b} \in (0,1)$ with $b \leq n$, the goal is to identify $α$ using comparison queries of the form ``$β\leq α$?''. The problem has been studied several decades ago and optimal query algorithms are known. We present a new algorithm for rational search based on a compressed traversal of the Stern--Brocot tree, which appeared to have been overlooked in the literature. This approach also naturally extends to two related problems that, to the best of our knowledge, have not been previously addressed: (i) unbounded rational search, where the bound $n$ is unknown, and (ii) computing the best (in a precise sense) rational approximation of an unknown real number using only comparison queries.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于随机游走的确定性删除算法，该算法在查询延迟、召回率、删除时间和内存使用之间提供了更好的权衡。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANN) is a common way to retrieve relevant search results, especially now in the context of large language models and retrieval augmented generation. One of the most widely used algorithms for ANN is based on constructing a multi-layer graph over the dataset, called the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW). While this algorithm supports insertion of new data, it does not support deletion of existing data. Moreover, deletion algorithms described by prior work come at the cost of increased query latency, decreased recall, or prolonged deletion time. In this paper, we propose a new theoretical framework for graph-based ANN based on random walks. We then utilize this framework to analyze a randomized deletion approach that preserves hitting time statistics compared to the graph before deleting the point. We then turn this theoretical framework into a deterministic deletion algorithm, and show that it provides better tradeoff between query latency, recall, deletion time, and memory usage through an extensive collection of experiments.

Abstract: In a capacitated directed graph, it is known that the set of all min-cuts forms a distributive lattice [1], [2]. Here, we describe this lattice as a regular predicate whose forbidden elements can be advanced in constant parallel time after precomputing a max-flow, so as to obtain parallel algorithms for min-cut problems with additional constraints encoded by lattice-linear predicates [3]. Some nice algorithmic applications follow. First, we use these methods to compute the irreducibles of the sublattice of min-cuts satisfying a regular predicate. By Birkhoff's theorem [4] this gives a succinct representation of such cuts, and so we also obtain a general algorithm for enumerating this sublattice. Finally, though we prove computing min-cuts satisfying additional constraints is NP-hard in general, we use poset slicing [5], [6] for exact algorithms with constraints not necessarily encoded by lattice-linear predicates) with better complexity than exhaustive search. We also introduce $k$-transition predicates and strong advancement for improved complexity analyses of lattice-linear predicate algorithms in parallel settings, which is of independent interest.

Abstract: Inconsistent values are commonly encountered in real-world applications, which can negatively impact data analysis and decision-making. While existing research primarily focuses on identifying the smallest removal set to resolve inconsistencies, recent studies have shown that multiple minimum removal sets may exist, making it difficult to make further decisions. While some approaches use the most frequent values as the guidance for the subset repair, this strategy has been criticized for its potential to inaccurately identify errors. To address these issues, we consider the dependencies between attribute values to determine a more appropriate subset repair. Our main contributions include (1) formalizing the optimal subset repair problem with attribute dependencies and analyzing its computational hardness; (2) computing the exact solution using integer linear programming; (3) developing an approximate algorithm with performance guarantees based on cliques and LP relaxation; and (4) designing a probabilistic approach with an approximation bound for efficiency. Experimental results on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our methods in both subset repair performance and downstream applications.

Abstract: Large-scale vector databases for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search typically store a quantized dataset in main memory for fast access, and full precision data on remote disk. State-of-the-art ANN quantization methods are highly data-dependent, rendering them unable to handle point insertions and deletions. This either leads to degraded search quality over time, or forces costly global rebuilds of the entire search index. In this paper, we formally study data-dependent quantization under streaming dataset updates. We formulate a computation model of limited remote disk access and define a dynamic consistency property that guarantees freshness under updates. We use it to obtain the following results: Theoretically, we prove that static data-dependent quantization can be made dynamic with bounded disk I/O per update while retaining formal accuracy guarantees for ANN search. Algorithmically, we develop a practical data-dependent quantization method which is provably dynamically consistent, adapting itself to the dataset as it evolves over time. Our experiments show that the method outperforms baselines in large-scale nearest neighbor search quantization under streaming updates.

Motivation: 解决Eden等人在SODA'22中提出的问题，即在保持查询和时间复杂度的同时，是否可以通过接近最优的查询复杂度实现更好的近似。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种随机算法，能够以接近最优的查询复杂度计算图的树性的常数近似值，解决了Eden等人提出的问题，并展示了并行递归和调度机制在子线性算法中的潜力。

Abstract: We present a randomized algorithm that computes a constant approximation of a graph's arboricity, using $\tilde{O}(n/λ)$ queries to adjacency lists and in the same time bound. Here, $n$ and $λ$ denote the number of nodes and the graph's arboricity, respectively. The $\tilde{O}(n/λ)$ query complexity of our algorithm is nearly optimal. Our constant approximation settles a question of Eden, Mossel, and Ron [SODA'22], who achieved an $O(\log^2 n)$ approximation with the same query and time complexity and asked whether a better approximation can be achieved using near-optimal query complexity.
  A key technical challenge in the problem is due to recursive algorithms based on probabilistic samplings, each with a non-negligible error probability. In our case, many of the recursions invoked could have bad probabilistic samples and result in high query complexities. The particular difficulty is that those bad recursions are not easy or cheap to detect and discard. Our approach runs multiple recursions in parallel, to attenuate the error probability, using a careful \textit{scheduling mechanism} that manages the speed at which each of them progresses and makes our overall query complexity competitive with the single good recursion. We find this usage of parallelism and scheduling in a sublinear algorithm remarkable, and we are hopeful that similar ideas may find applications in a wider range of sublinear algorithms that rely on probabilistic recursions.

Abstract: Tariff setting in public transportation networks is an important challenge. A popular approach is to partition the network into fare zones ("zoning") and fix journey prices depending on the number of traversed zones ("pricing"). In this paper, we focus on finding revenue-optimal solutions to the zoning problem for a given concave pricing function. We consider tree networks with $n$ vertices, since trees already pose non-trivial algorithmic challenges. Our main results are efficient algorithms that yield a simple $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$-approximation as well as a more involved $\mathcal{O}(\log n/\log \log n)$-approximation. We show how to solve the problem exactly on rooted instances, in which all demand arises at the same source. For paths, we prove strong NP-hardness and outline a PTAS. Moreover, we show that computing an optimal solution is in FPT or XP for several natural problem parameters.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种两遍算法，能在亚线性空间内实现$(1/2-ε)$-近似的Max-DICUT问题，解决了单遍设置中的开放性问题。

Abstract: The Max-DICUT problem has gained a lot of attention in the streaming setting in recent years, and has so far served as a canonical problem for designing algorithms for general constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) in this setting. A seminal result of Kapralov and Krachun [STOC 2019] shows that it is impossible to beat $1/2$-approximation for Max-DICUT in sublinear space in the single-pass streaming setting, even on bounded-degree graphs. In a recent work, Saxena, Singer, Sudan, and Velusamy [SODA 2025] prove that the above lower bound is tight by giving a single-pass algorithm for bounded-degree graphs that achieves $(1/2-ε)$-approximation in sublinear space, for every constant $ε>0$. For arbitrary graphs of unbounded degree, they give an $O(1/ε)$-pass $O(\log n)$ space algorithm. Their work left open the question of obtaining $1/2$-approximation for arbitrary graphs in the single-pass setting in sublinear space. We make progress towards this question and give a two-pass algorithm that achieves $(1/2-ε)$-approximation in sublinear space, for every constant $ε>0$.

Abstract: Designing efficient, effective, and consistent metric clustering algorithms is a significant challenge attracting growing attention. Traditional approaches focus on the stability of cluster centers; unfortunately, this neglects the real-world need for stable point labels, i.e., stable assignments of points to named sets (clusters). In this paper, we address this gap by initiating the study of label-consistent metric clustering. We first introduce a new notion of consistency, measuring the label distance between two consecutive solutions. Then, armed with this new definition, we design new consistent approximation algorithms for the classical $k$-center and $k$-median problems.

Abstract: Timely updates are critical for real-time monitoring and control applications powered by the Internet of Things (IoT). As these systems scale, they become increasingly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where malicious agents interfere with legitimate transmissions to reduce data rates, thereby inflating the age of information (AoI). Existing adversarial AoI models often assume stationary channels and overlook queueing dynamics arising from compromised sensing sources operating under resource constraints. Motivated by the G-queue framework, this paper investigates a two-source M/G/1/1 system in which one source is adversarial and disrupts the update process by injecting negative arrivals according to a Poisson process and inducing i.i.d. service slowdowns, bounded in attack rate and duration. Using moment generating functions, we then derive closed-form expressions for average and peak AoI for an arbitrary number of sources. Moreover, we introduce a worst-case constrained attack model and employ stochastic dominance arguments to establish analytical AoI bounds. Numerical results validate the analysis and highlight the impact of resource-limited adversarial interference under general service time distributions.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: BBRv3在Wi-Fi 6家庭网络中表现受AQM影响：FIFO表现差，FQ-CoDel和CAKE更优，CAKE最佳但可能触发重传。建议使用FQ-CoDel或CAKE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究BBRv3在现代AQM方案下的表现，特别是在Wi-Fi 6家庭网络中的行为，以提供实际部署建议。

Method: 使用完全无线测试平台和简单的跨层模型，评估TCP BBRv3在Wi-Fi 6家庭网络中的表现，比较BBR与CUBIC在不同AQM方案（FIFO、FQ-CoDel和CAKE）下的性能。

Result: FIFO会破坏BBRv3的节奏并增加延迟，常让CUBIC占优；FQ-CoDel恢复公平性并控制延迟；CAKE通过保持低延迟和对齐BBRv3的发送与交付速率，提供最佳整体性能。

Conclusion: 建议在家庭Wi-Fi网络中使用FQ-CoDel或CAKE作为AQM方案，避免未管理的FIFO，并考虑对BBRv3的探测进行Wi-Fi感知调优。

Abstract: We evaluate TCP BBRv3 on Wi-Fi 6 home networks under modern AQM schemes using a fully wireless testbed and a simple cross-layer model linking Wi-Fi scheduling, router queueing, and BBRv3's pacing dynamics. Comparing BBR Internet traffic with CUBIC across different AQMs (FIFO, FQ-CoDel, and CAKE) for uplink, downlink, and bidirectional traffic, we find that FIFO destabilizes pacing and raises delay, often letting CUBIC dominate; FQ-CoDel restores fairness and controls latency; and CAKE delivers the best overall performance by keeping delay low and aligning BBRv3's sending and delivered rates. We also identify a Wi-Fi-specific effect where CAKE's rapid queue draining, while improving pacing alignment, can trigger brief retransmission bursts during BBRv3's bandwidth probes. These results follow from the interaction of variable Wi-Fi service rates, AQM delay control, and BBRv3's inflight limits, leading to practical guidance to use FQ-CoDel or CAKE and avoid unmanaged FIFO in home Wi-Fi, with potential for Wi-Fi-aware tuning of BBRv3's probing.

Conclusion: 通过数值结果验证了分析框架，并表明有限数量的PA可以实现接近连续的性能，为PAS在PWE中的设计和部署提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Programmable wireless environments (PWEs) have emerged as a key paradigm for next-generation communication networks, aiming to transform wireless propagation from an uncontrollable phenomenon into a reconfigurable process that can adapt to diverse service requirements. In this framework, pinching-antenna systems (PASs) have recently been proposed as a promising enabling technology, as they allow the radiation location and effective propagation distance to be adjusted by selectively exciting radiating points along a dielectric waveguide. However, most existing studies on PASs rely on the idealized assumption that pinching-antenna (PA) positions can be continuously adjusted along the waveguide, while realistically only a finite set of pinching locations is available. Motivated by this, this paper analyzes the performance of two-state PASs, where the PA positions are fixed and only their activation state can be controlled. By explicitly accounting for the spatial discreteness of the available pinching points, closed-form analytical expressions for the outage probability and the ergodic achievable data rate are derived. In addition, we introduce the pinching discretization efficiency to quantify the performance gap between discrete and continuous pinching configurations, enabling a direct assessment of the number of PAs required to approximate the ideal continuous case. Finally, numerical results validate the analytical framework and show that near-continuous performance can be achieved with a limited number of PAs, offering useful insights for the design and deployment of PASs in PWEs.

TL;DR: QEdgeProxy是一种去中心化的QoS感知负载均衡器，通过MP-MAB和KDE技术优化客户端QoS，在动态CC环境中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着计算从云端转向边缘以减少处理延迟和网络流量，计算连续体（CC）的动态环境使得满足严格的QoS要求和避免服务实例过载变得具有挑战性。现有方法往往忽视了对每个客户端QoS的关注。

Method: 通过将负载均衡问题建模为具有异构奖励的多玩家多臂老虎机（MP-MAB），并利用核密度估计（KDE）来估计QoS成功概率，QEdgeProxy自主选择服务实例以满足客户端的QoS目标。

Result: 在具有真实网络条件和延迟敏感边缘AI工作负载的K3s集群上部署的模拟CC测试平台上，QEdgeProxy在每客户端QoS满意度方面显著优于基于邻近性和强化学习的基线方法。

Conclusion: QEdgeProxy作为一种去中心化的QoS感知负载均衡器，在计算连续体（CC）中显著提升了每个客户端的QoS满意度，并能有效适应负载激增和实例可用性变化。

Abstract: As computation shifts from the cloud to the edge to reduce processing latency and network traffic, the resulting Computing Continuum (CC) creates a dynamic environment where it is challenging to meet strict Quality of Service (QoS) requirements and avoid service instance overload. Existing methods often prioritize global metrics, overlooking per-client QoS, which is crucial for latency-sensitive and reliability-critical applications. We propose QEdgeProxy, a decentralized QoS-aware load balancer that acts as a proxy between IoT devices and service instances in CC. We formulate the load balancing problem as a Multi-Player Multi-Armed Bandit (MP-MAB) with heterogeneous rewards, where each load balancer autonomously selects service instances that maximize the probability of meeting its clients' QoS targets by using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to estimate QoS success probabilities. It also incorporates an adaptive exploration mechanism to recover rapidly from performance shifts and non-stationary conditions. We present a Kubernetes-native QEdgeProxy implementation and evaluate it on an emulated CC testbed deployed on a K3s cluster with realistic network conditions and a latency-sensitive edge-AI workload. Results show that QEdgeProxy significantly outperforms proximity-based and reinforcement-learning baselines in per-client QoS satisfaction, while adapting effectively to load surges and instance availability changes.

Conclusion: 仿真实验证明了FELKH-3D算法相较于其他经典算法的优越性。

Abstract: The high mobility and flexible deployment capability of UAVs make them an impressive option for charging nodes in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs) using Directional Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) technology. However, existing studies largely focus on 2D-WRSNs, lacking designs catering to real 3D-WRSNs. The spatial distribution characteristics of nodes in a 3D-WRSN further increase the complexity of the charging scheduling task, thus requiring a systematic framework to solve this problem. In this paper, we investigated the Directional UAV Charging Scheduling problem for 3D-WRSNs (DCS-3D) and established its NP-hard property, and then proposed a three-step framework named as directional charging scheduling algorithm using Functional Equivalent (FuncEqv) direction set and Lin-Kernighan heuristic (LKH) for 3D-WRSNs (FELKH-3D) to solve it. In FELKH-3D, the challenge of infinite charging direction space is solved by designing an algorithm generating a minimum-size direction set guaranteed to be FuncEqv to the infinite set of whole sphere surface, and the optimaility of the method was proved.To determine the optimal charging tour for the UAV, the LKH algorithm is employed.Simulation experiments demonstrated the superiority of FELKH-3D over other classical algorithms.

Conclusion: BEVCooper通过动态车辆拓扑和V2V信道条件下的渐进最优CAV选择和自适应特征融合，显著提升了BEV感知精度并降低了延迟。

Abstract: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) is critical to connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) as it can provide unified and precise representation of vehicular surroundings. However, quality of the raw sensing data may degrade in occluded or distant regions, undermining the fidelity of constructed BEV map. In this paper, we propose BEVCooper, a novel collaborative perception framework that can guarantee accurate and low-latency BEV map construction. We first define an effective metric to evaluate the utility of BEV features from neighboring CAVs. Then, based on this, we develop an online learning-based collaborative CAV selection strategy that captures the ever-changing BEV feature utility of neighboring vehicles, enabling the ego CAV to prioritize the most valuable sources under bandwidth-constrained vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links. Furthermore, we design an adaptive fusion mechanism that optimizes BEV feature compression based on the environment dynamics and real-time V2V channel quality, effectively balancing feature transmission latency and accuracy of the constructed BEV map. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, BEVCooper achieves asymptotically optimal CAV selection and adaptive feature fusion under dynamic vehicular topology and V2V channel conditions. Extensive experiments on real-world testbed show that, compared with state-of-the-art benchmarks, the proposed BEVCooper enhances BEV perception accuracy by up to $63.18\%$ and reduces end-to-end latency by $67.9\%$, with only $1.8\%$ additional computational overhead.

Abstract: Semantic communication and edge-cloud collaborative intelligence are increasingly recognized as foundational enablers for next-generation intelligent services operating under stringent bandwidth, latency, and resource constraints. By shifting the communication objective from bit-perfect delivery toward the transmission of task-relevant semantic representations, semantic communication enables adaptive tradeoffs among communication overhead, inference accuracy, computational load, and end-to-end latency. This survey provides a comprehensive and system-level synthesis of recent advances in semantic communication at the edge-cloud interface, encompassing architectural models for collaborative intelligence, representation learning and semantic abstraction techniques, network-aware and resource-adaptive semantic encoding strategies, and learning-driven optimization and orchestration mechanisms. Beyond efficiency considerations, the survey situates semantic communication within practical operational contexts, including security, trust, resilience, and scalability, drawing connections to zero-trust networking, physical-layer security, and emerging edge-cloud control paradigms. Finally, open challenges and research directions are identified, highlighting the role of semantic communication as a key building block for AI-native networking and 6G-ready intelligent systems.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了CORE框架，为无线环境中的离线强化学习提供了系统性的探索，旨在通过领域对齐算法和补偿性奖励机制，解决专家演示不足和数据噪声问题，推动离线RL在无线领域的广泛应用。

Abstract: Real-world wireless data are expensive to collect and often lack sufficient expert demonstrations, causing existing offline RL methods to overfit suboptimal behaviors and exhibit unstable performance. To address this issue, we propose CORE, an offline RL framework specifically designed for wireless environments. CORE identifies latent expert trajectories from noisy datasets via behavior embedding clustering, and trains a conditional variational autoencoder with a contrastive objective to separate expert and non-expert behaviors in latent space. Based on the learned representations, CORE constructs compensable rewards that reflect expert-likelihood, effectively guiding policy learning under limited or imperfect supervision. More broadly, this work represents one of the early systematic explorations of offline RL in wireless networking, where prior adoption remains limited. Beyond introducing offline RL techniques to this domain, we further examine intrinsic wireless data characteristics and develop a domain-aligned algorithm that explicitly accounts for their structural properties. While offline RL has not yet been fully established as a standard methodology in the wireless community, our study aims to provide foundational insights and empirical evidence to support its broader acceptance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capability to understand and develop code. However, their capability to rigorously reason about and prove code correctness remains in question. This paper offers a comprehensive study of LLMs' capability to develop correctness proofs for system software written in Rust. We curate a new system-verification benchmark suite, VeruSAGE-Bench, which consists of 849 proof tasks extracted from eight open-source Verus-verified Rust systems. Furthermore, we design different agent systems to match the strengths and weaknesses of different LLMs (o4-mini, GPT-5, Sonnet 4, and Sonnet 4.5). Our study shows that different tools and agent settings are needed to stimulate the system-verification capability of different types of LLMs. The best LLM-agent combination in our study completes over 80% of system-verification tasks in VeruSAGE-Bench. It also completes over 90% of a set of system proof tasks not part of VeruSAGE-Bench because they had not yet been finished by human experts. This result shows the great potential for LLM-assisted development of verified system software.

Method: 开发了基于CNF的布局可行性模型，比较了CDCL、CP-SAT和MILP的求解性能，并引入了两种混合架构。

Result: CDCL在可行性检测中表现出近乎恒定的运行时间，而CP-SAT和MILP分别呈现多项式和指数级增长。混合架构在保持正确性的同时显著减少了解题时间。

Conclusion: 混合架构结合了CDCL的可行性搜索与CP-SAT优化，显著减少了解题时间并保持了正确性保证，阐明了在大规模离散布局问题中，子句学习搜索与精确优化方法之间的算法权衡。

Abstract: This paper studies the use of Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) with VSIDS heuristics as a computational engine for discrete facility layout problems. The facility layout problem is modeled as a combinatorial assignment problem with dense logical structure arising from adjacency, separation, and slot-availability constraints. We develop a CNF-based formulation for layout feasibility and compare CDCL-based SAT solving against CP-SAT and MILP formulations under a unified benchmarking framework. Empirical results show that CDCL exhibits near-constant runtime behavior for feasibility detection across increasing problem sizes and constraint densities, while CP-SAT and MILP display polynomial and exponential scaling respectively. To address the limitation of CDCL in objective optimization, we introduce two hybrid architectures that combine CDCL-based feasibility search with CP-SAT optimization. The first architecture rapidly enumerates feasible layouts to trade optimality for speed, while the second uses CDCL to generate warm-start solutions that accelerate exact optimization. The results demonstrate that hybrid approaches can significantly reduce time-to-solution while preserving correctness guarantees, clarifying the algorithmic trade-offs between clause-learning search and exact optimization methods in large-scale discrete layout problems.

Conclusion: 本文为神经元识别提供了首个理论分析框架，解决了忠实性和稳定性两大挑战，并通过实验验证了方法的实用性，为可信赖的神经元识别迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Neuron identification is a popular tool in mechanistic interpretability, aiming to uncover the human-interpretable concepts represented by individual neurons in deep networks. While algorithms such as Network Dissection and CLIP-Dissect achieve great empirical success, a rigorous theoretical foundation remains absent, which is crucial to enable trustworthy and reliable explanations. In this work, we observe that neuron identification can be viewed as the inverse process of machine learning, which allows us to derive guarantees for neuron explanations. Based on this insight, we present the first theoretical analysis of two fundamental challenges: (1) Faithfulness: whether the identified concept faithfully represents the neuron's underlying function and (2) Stability: whether the identification results are consistent across probing datasets. We derive generalization bounds for widely used similarity metrics (e.g. accuracy, AUROC, IoU) to guarantee faithfulness, and propose a bootstrap ensemble procedure that quantifies stability along with BE (Bootstrap Explanation) method to generate concept prediction sets with guaranteed coverage probability. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the practicality of our method, providing an important step toward trustworthy neuron identification.

Method: 通过将小世界（SW）网络理论应用于MAS设计，结合不确定性引导的重连方案，动态调整智能体间的连接结构。

Conclusion: SW网络结构作为多智能体系统（MAS）的设计先验，能够稳定推理、增强鲁棒性、实现可扩展协调，并为认知角色的涌现提供归纳偏置。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled multi-agent systems (MAS) in which multiple agents argue, critique, and coordinate to solve complex tasks, making communication topology a first-class design choice. Yet most existing LLM-based MAS either adopt fully connected graphs, simple sparse rings, or ad-hoc dynamic selection, with little structural guidance. In this work, we revisit classic theory on small-world (SW) networks and ask: what changes if we treat SW connectivity as a design prior for MAS? We first bridge insights from neuroscience and complex networks to MAS, highlighting how SW structures balance local clustering and long-range integration. Using multi-agent debate (MAD) as a controlled testbed, experiment results show that SW connectivity yields nearly the same accuracy and token cost, while substantially stabilizing consensus trajectories. Building on this, we introduce an uncertainty-guided rewiring scheme for scaling MAS, where long-range shortcuts are added between epistemically divergent agents using LLM-oriented uncertainty signals (e.g., semantic entropy). This yields controllable SW structures that adapt to task difficulty and agent heterogeneity. Finally, we discuss broader implications of SW priors for MAS design, framing them as stabilizers of reasoning, enhancers of robustness, scalable coordinators, and inductive biases for emergent cognitive roles.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) inference can suffer from dense inter-agent communication and low hardware utilization, which jointly inflate serving latency. We present a serving design that targets these bottlenecks through an algorithm-system co-design. First, we replace dense agent interaction graphs with a hierarchical tree topology that induces structured sparsity in inter-agent communication. Second, we introduce a runtime adaptive mechanism that selectively terminates or skips downstream agent invocations using semantic agreement and confidence signals from intermediate outputs. Third, we pipeline agent execution by overlapping incremental prefilling with decoding across dependency-related agents, improving utilization and reducing inference latency. Across representative tasks, this approach substantially reduces end-to-end latency (up to 90%) while maintaining comparable accuracy (within $\pm$1%) relative to dense-connectivity MoA baselines, and can improve accuracy in certain settings.

Abstract: Integrating causal inference (CI) with reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to address critical limitations in classical RL, including low explainability, lack of robustness and generalization failures. Traditional RL techniques, which typically rely on correlation-driven decision-making, struggle when faced with distribution shifts, confounding variables, and dynamic environments. Causal reinforcement learning (CRL), leveraging the foundational principles of causal inference, offers promising solutions to these challenges by explicitly modeling cause-and-effect relationships. In this survey, we systematically review recent advancements at the intersection of causal inference and RL. We categorize existing approaches into causal representation learning, counterfactual policy optimization, offline causal RL, causal transfer learning, and causal explainability. Through this structured analysis, we identify prevailing challenges, highlight empirical successes in practical applications, and discuss open problems. Finally, we provide future research directions, underscoring the potential of CRL for developing robust, generalizable, and interpretable artificial intelligence systems.

Conclusion: PSV-Verus在三个基准测试中表现出色，pass@1提升高达9.6倍，验证了自博弈框架在代码生成中的有效性。

Abstract: Training models through self-play alone (without any human data) has been a longstanding goal in AI, but its effectiveness for training large language models remains unclear, particularly in code generation where rewards based on unit tests are brittle and prone to error propagation. We study self-play in the verified code generation setting, where formal verification provides reliable correctness signals. We introduce Propose, Solve, Verify (PSV) a simple self-play framework where formal verification signals are used to create a proposer capable of generating challenging synthetic problems and a solver trained via expert iteration. We use PSV to train PSV-Verus, which across three benchmarks improves pass@1 by up to 9.6x over inference-only and expert-iteration baselines. We show that performance scales with the number of generated questions and training iterations, and through ablations identify formal verification and difficulty-aware proposal as essential ingredients for successful self-play.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学AI中图像诊断的准确性与可解释性挑战，特别是在数据有限、视觉线索细微且临床决策高风险的场景中。

Method: NEURO-GUARD采用检索增强生成（RAG）机制，通过大型语言模型（LLM）迭代生成、评估和优化医学图像的特征提取代码，并结合临床指南和专家知识。

Result: 在糖尿病视网膜病变分类任务中，NEURO-GUARD比纯ViT基线准确率提高6.2%（84.69% vs. 78.4%），并在跨域泛化上提升5%。MRI癫痫检测的进一步评估也证实了其跨域鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NEURO-GUARD通过结合符号化医学推理与亚符号化视觉学习，实现了可解释、知识感知且泛化能力强的医学图像诊断，同时在多个数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Accurate yet interpretable image-based diagnosis remains a central challenge in medical AI, particularly in settings characterized by limited data, subtle visual cues, and high-stakes clinical decision-making. Most existing vision models rely on purely data-driven learning and produce black-box predictions with limited interpretability and poor cross-domain generalization, hindering their real-world clinical adoption. We present NEURO-GUARD, a novel knowledge-guided vision framework that integrates Vision Transformers (ViTs) with language-driven reasoning to improve performance, transparency, and domain robustness. NEURO-GUARD employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism for self-verification, in which a large language model (LLM) iteratively generates, evaluates, and refines feature-extraction code for medical images. By grounding this process in clinical guidelines and expert knowledge, the framework progressively enhances feature detection and classification beyond purely data-driven baselines. Extensive experiments on diabetic retinopathy classification across four benchmark datasets APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1, and Messidor-2 demonstrate that NEURO-GUARD improves accuracy by 6.2% over a ViT-only baseline (84.69% vs. 78.4%) and achieves a 5% gain in domain generalization. Additional evaluations on MRI-based seizure detection further confirm its cross-domain robustness, consistently outperforming existing methods.
  Overall, NEURO-GUARD bridges symbolic medical reasoning with subsymbolic visual learning, enabling interpretable, knowledge-aware, and generalizable medical image diagnosis while achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets.

TL;DR: NL2CA是一种全自动方法，通过LLM和Critic Tree将自然语言描述转换为可执行的认知规则，并在认知强化学习中优化代理，实现了无需人工干预的可扩展认知建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的认知计算模型开发过程劳动密集，缺乏自动化方法。本文旨在提出一种无需人工干预的全自动方法，从自然语言描述中形式化认知决策规则。

Method: NL2CA首先通过微调的大型语言模型（LLM）将文本翻译为线性时序逻辑（LTL），然后通过无监督的Critic Tree精炼逻辑，最终将输出转换为与符号认知框架兼容的可执行生产规则。基于生成的规则，进一步通过认知强化学习根据现实行为数据构建和优化认知代理。

Result: 在NL-to-LTL翻译任务中，CriticNL2LTL模块在专家和大规模基准测试中均表现一致；在认知驾驶模拟中，从人类访谈自动构建的代理成功学习了约70次试验中的多样化决策模式。

Conclusion: NL2CA提供了一种从非结构化文本数据中自动设计符号认知代理的新范式，实现了可扩展、可解释且与人类决策一致的认知建模。

Abstract: Cognitive computing models offer a formal and interpretable way to characterize human's deliberation and decision-making, yet their development remains labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose NL2CA, a novel method for auto-formalizing cognitive decision-making rules from natural language descriptions of human experience. Different from most related work that exploits either pure manual or human guided interactive modeling, our method is fully automated without any human intervention. The approach first translates text into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM), then refines the logic via an unsupervised Critic Tree, and finally transforms the output into executable production rules compatible with symbolic cognitive frameworks. Based on the resulted rules, a cognitive agent is further constructed and optimized through cognitive reinforcement learning according to the real-world behavioral data. Our method is validated in two domains: (1) NL-to-LTL translation, where our CriticNL2LTL module achieves consistent performance across both expert and large-scale benchmarks without human-in-the-loop feed-backs, and (2) cognitive driving simulation, where agents automatically constructed from human interviews have successfully learned the diverse decision patterns of about 70 trials in different critical scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that NL2CA enables scalable, interpretable, and human-aligned cognitive modeling from unstructured textual data, offering a novel paradigm to automatically design symbolic cognitive agents.

Abstract: This paper proposes the External Hippocampus framework, which models language model reasoning from a cognitive dynamics perspective as the flow of information energy in semantic space. Unlike traditional weight-space optimization methods, this framework constructs topological cognitive maps through dimensionality reduction projection, enabling precise navigation and intervention of energy flow at test time while avoiding substantial computational requirements and demonstrating predictable intervention patterns. The method effectively addresses the cognitive deadlock problem in multi-step reasoning for small models. Experiments on models <=7B parameters show: map-guided methods achieve 81.20% accuracy on 500 challenging problems (relative baseline +16.80%), reduce reasoning time by >= 15x, with key findings revealing that reasoning stagnation manifests as "Cognitive Vortex" and low-entropy potential wells, while temperature perturbations effectively restart energy flow. The framework requires no additional training, possesses autonomous growth capability, and provides an efficient and controllable topological-aware solution for small model reasoning.

Conclusion: 通过融合心理学洞察与轻量级强化学习核心，持久代理架构为人工生命的实现提供了一条可行的实践路径。

Abstract: The development of LLMs has elevated AI agents from task-specific tools to long-lived, decision-making entities. Yet, most architectures remain static and reactive, tethered to manually defined, narrow scenarios. These systems excel at perception (System 1) and deliberation (System 2) but lack a persistent meta-layer to maintain identity, verify reasoning, and align short-term actions with long-term survival. We first propose a third stratum, System 3, that presides over the agent's narrative identity and long-horizon adaptation. The framework maps selected psychological constructs to concrete computational modules, thereby translating abstract notions of artificial life into implementable design requirements. The ideas coalesce in Sophia, a "Persistent Agent" wrapper that grafts a continuous self-improvement loop onto any LLM-centric System 1/2 stack. Sophia is driven by four synergistic mechanisms: process-supervised thought search, narrative memory, user and self modeling, and a hybrid reward system. Together, they transform repetitive reasoning into a self-driven, autobiographical process, enabling identity continuity and transparent behavioral explanations. Although the paper is primarily conceptual, we provide a compact engineering prototype to anchor the discussion. Quantitatively, Sophia independently initiates and executes various intrinsic tasks while achieving an 80% reduction in reasoning steps for recurring operations. Notably, meta-cognitive persistence yielded a 40% gain in success for high-complexity tasks, effectively bridging the performance gap between simple and sophisticated goals. Qualitatively, System 3 exhibited a coherent narrative identity and an innate capacity for task organization. By fusing psychological insight with a lightweight reinforcement-learning core, the persistent agent architecture advances a possible practical pathway toward artificial life.

Motivation: 当前基于大型语言模型（LLM）的定理证明器存在领域覆盖受限和数学推理泛化能力弱的问题。

Method: 提出了MSC-180基准，包含180个形式验证问题，覆盖60个数学分支，每个分支3个问题，从本科到研究生水平。每个问题经过领域专家多轮验证和精炼。

Result: 在pass@32设置下，最佳模型的总体通过率仅为18.89%，存在显著的领域偏差（最大领域覆盖率41.7%）和难度差距（研究生水平问题通过率显著更低）。引入变异系数（CV）作为评估指标，观察到CV值比统计高变异性阈值高4-6倍。

Conclusion: MSC-180及其多维评估框架为驱动下一代具备真正数学推理能力的AI系统发展提供了区分性和系统性的基准。

Abstract: Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) represents a core research direction in artificial intelligence for achieving formal reasoning and verification, playing a significant role in advancing machine intelligence. However, current large language model (LLM)-based theorem provers suffer from limitations such as restricted domain coverage and weak generalization in mathematical reasoning. To address these issues, we propose MSC-180, a benchmark for evaluation based on the MSC2020 mathematical subject classification. It comprises 180 formal verification problems, 3 advanced problems from each of 60 mathematical branches, spanning from undergraduate to graduate levels. Each problem has undergone multiple rounds of verification and refinement by domain experts to ensure formal accuracy. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLM-based theorem provers under the pass@32 setting reveal that the best model achieves only an 18.89% overall pass rate, with prominent issues including significant domain bias (maximum domain coverage 41.7%) and a difficulty gap (significantly lower pass rates on graduate-level problems). To further quantify performance variability across mathematical domains, we introduce the coefficient of variation (CV) as an evaluation metric. The observed CV values are 4-6 times higher than the statistical high-variability threshold, indicating that the models still rely on pattern matching from training corpora rather than possessing transferable reasoning mechanisms and systematic generalization capabilities. MSC-180, together with its multi-dimensional evaluation framework, provides a discriminative and systematic benchmark for driving the development of next-generation AI systems with genuine mathematical reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Manufacturing planners face complex operational challenges that require seamless collaboration between human expertise and intelligent systems to achieve optimal performance in modern production environments. Traditional approaches to analyzing simulation-based manufacturing data often create barriers between human decision-makers and critical operational insights, limiting effective partnership in manufacturing planning. Our framework establishes a collaborative intelligence system integrating Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Model-based agents to bridge this gap, empowering manufacturing professionals through natural language interfaces for complex operational analysis. The system transforms simulation data into semantically rich representations, enabling planners to interact naturally with operational insights without specialized expertise. A collaborative LLM agent works alongside human decision-makers, employing iterative reasoning that mirrors human analytical thinking while generating precise queries for knowledge extraction and providing transparent validation. This partnership approach to manufacturing bottleneck identification, validated through operational scenarios, demonstrates enhanced performance while maintaining human oversight and decision authority. For operational inquiries, the system achieves near-perfect accuracy through natural language interaction. For investigative scenarios requiring collaborative analysis, we demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in supporting human experts to uncover interconnected operational issues that enhance understanding and decision-making. This work advances collaborative manufacturing by creating intuitive methods for actionable insights, reducing cognitive load while amplifying human analytical capabilities in evolving manufacturing ecosystems.

Motivation: 随着AI系统能力的提升，确保其决策过程的可观察性对于安全部署至关重要。现有的CoT监控方法在不同训练过程、数据源或系统扩展下可能脆弱，需要新的评估方法来衡量和跟踪监控性。

Method: 提出了三种评估原型（干预、过程和结果属性）和一个新的监控性指标，并引入了一个广泛的评估套件。

Result: 实验表明，CoT监控能有效捕捉故意模糊CoT的简单模型，且比仅监控行为更有效。大多数前沿模型具有较高的监控性，但并非完美。CoT长度、推理计算和强化学习优化对监控性有不同影响。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种新的监控性评估框架和指标，证明CoT监控在实际应用中比仅监控行为更有效，并探讨了模型规模、推理计算和强化学习优化对监控性的影响。

Abstract: Observability into the decision making of modern AI systems may be required to safely deploy increasingly capable agents. Monitoring the chain-of-thought (CoT) of today's reasoning models has proven effective for detecting misbehavior. However, this "monitorability" may be fragile under different training procedures, data sources, or even continued system scaling. To measure and track monitorability, we propose three evaluation archetypes (intervention, process, and outcome-property) and a new monitorability metric, and introduce a broad evaluation suite. We demonstrate that these evaluations can catch simple model organisms trained to have obfuscated CoTs, and that CoT monitoring is more effective than action-only monitoring in practical settings. We compare the monitorability of various frontier models and find that most models are fairly, but not perfectly, monitorable. We also evaluate how monitorability scales with inference-time compute, reinforcement learning optimization, and pre-training model size. We find that longer CoTs are generally more monitorable and that RL optimization does not materially decrease monitorability even at the current frontier scale. Notably, we find that for a model at a low reasoning effort, we could instead deploy a smaller model at a higher reasoning effort (thereby matching capabilities) and obtain a higher monitorability, albeit at a higher overall inference compute cost. We further investigate agent-monitor scaling trends and find that scaling a weak monitor's test-time compute when monitoring a strong agent increases monitorability. Giving the weak monitor access to CoT not only improves monitorability, but it steepens the monitor's test-time compute to monitorability scaling trend. Finally, we show we can improve monitorability by asking models follow-up questions and giving their follow-up CoT to the monitor.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种无需反向传播的结构图方法，用于少样本轮廓图像分类，并通过实验验证了其透明决策和解释能力。虽然存在计算成本和骨架化质量的限制，但优化分类算法和静态场景处理是未来的研究方向。

Abstract: We propose a structural-graph approach to classifying contour images in a few-shot regime without using backpropagation. The core idea is to make structure the carrier of explanations: an image is encoded as an attributed graph (critical points and lines represented as nodes with geometric attributes), and generalization is achieved via the formation of concept attractors (class-level concept graphs). Purpose. To design and experimentally validate an architecture in which class concepts are formed from a handful of examples (5 - 6 per class) through structural and parametric reductions, providing transparent decisions and eliminating backpropagation. Methods. Contour vectorization is followed by constructing a bipartite graph (Point/Line as nodes) with normalized geometric attributes such as coordinates, length, angle, and direction; reductions include the elimination of unstable substructures or noise and the alignment of paths between critical points. Concepts are formed by iterative composition of samples, and classification is performed by selecting the best graph-to-concept match (using approximated GED). Results. On an MNIST subset with 5 - 6 base examples per class (single epoch), we obtain a consistent accuracy of around 82% with full traceability of decisions: misclassifications can be explained by explicit structural similarities. An indicative comparison with SVM, MLP, CNN, as well as metric and meta-learning baselines, is provided. The structural-graph scheme with concept attractors enables few-shot learning without backpropagation and offers built-in explanations through the explicit graph structure. Limitations concern the computational cost of GED and the quality of skeletonization; promising directions include classification-algorithm optimization, work with static scenes, and associative recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代临床决策支持系统可以同时服务于多个独立的医学影像机构，但由于患者群体、影像硬件和采集协议的差异，其预测性能可能在不同站点间下降。需要一种无需真实标签的方法来持续监测模型输出的分布变化。

Method: 提出了一个基于代理的框架，用于检测多站点临床AI系统中的漂移并评估其严重性。通过模拟多中心环境进行基于输出的漂移检测，每个站点分配一个漂移监测代理，执行模型输出与参考分布的批量比较。分析了多种多中心监测方案，包括站点特定、全局、仅生产和自适应参考获取方式。

Result: 在真实世界乳腺癌影像数据上使用病理完全反应预测模型进行测试，所有多中心方案在漂移检测上的F1分数均优于集中式监测，最高提升10.3%。在没有站点特定参考的情况下，自适应方案表现最佳，漂移检测和漂移严重性分类的F1分数分别为74.3%和83.7%。

Conclusion: 自适应、站点感知的基于代理的漂移监测可以增强多站点临床决策支持系统的可靠性。

Abstract: Modern clinical decision support systems can concurrently serve multiple, independent medical imaging institutions, but their predictive performance may degrade across sites due to variations in patient populations, imaging hardware, and acquisition protocols. Continuous surveillance of predictive model outputs offers a safe and reliable approach for identifying such distributional shifts without ground truth labels. However, most existing methods rely on centralized monitoring of aggregated predictions, overlooking site-specific drift dynamics. We propose an agent-based framework for detecting drift and assessing its severity in multisite clinical AI systems. To evaluate its effectiveness, we simulate a multi-center environment for output-based drift detection, assigning each site a drift monitoring agent that performs batch-wise comparisons of model outputs against a reference distribution. We analyse several multi-center monitoring schemes, that differ in how the reference is obtained (site-specific, global, production-only and adaptive), alongside a centralized baseline. Results on real-world breast cancer imaging data using a pathological complete response prediction model shows that all multi-center schemes outperform centralized monitoring, with F1-score improvements up to 10.3% in drift detection. In the absence of site-specific references, the adaptive scheme performs best, with F1-scores of 74.3% for drift detection and 83.7% for drift severity classification. These findings suggest that adaptive, site-aware agent-based drift monitoring can enhance reliability of multisite clinical decision support systems.

Method: 提出了一种后验ITD框架，结合显式和隐式图表示与时序建模，使用GCN处理图结构并通过Bi-LSTM捕获时序依赖。

Result: 在CERT r5.2上，AUC为98.62，检测率100%，误报率0.05；在r6.2上，AUC为88.48，检测率80.15%，误报率0.15。

Conclusion: 结合基于图和时序表示的框架在内部威胁检测中表现出色，特别是在CERT r5.2和r6.2数据集上取得了优于现有方法的结果。

Abstract: Insider threat detection (ITD) is challenging due to the subtle and concealed nature of malicious activities performed by trusted users. This paper proposes a post-hoc ITD framework that integrates explicit and implicit graph representations with temporal modelling to capture complex user behaviour patterns. An explicit graph is constructed using predefined organisational rules to model direct relationships among user activities. To mitigate noise and limitations in this hand-crafted structure, an implicit graph is learned from feature similarities using the Gumbel-Softmax trick, enabling the discovery of latent behavioural relationships. Separate Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) process the explicit and implicit graphs to generate node embeddings, which are concatenated and refined through an attention mechanism to emphasise threat-relevant features. The refined representations are then passed to a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies in user behaviour. Activities are flagged as anomalous when their probability scores fall below a predefined threshold. Extensive experiments on CERT r5.2 and r6.2 datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods. On r5.2, the model achieves an AUC of 98.62, a detection rate of 100%, and a false positive rate of 0.05. On the more challenging r6.2 dataset, it attains an AUC of 88.48, a detection rate of 80.15%, and a false positive rate of 0.15, highlighting the effectiveness of combining graph-based and temporal representations for robust ITD.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在动态和随机环境中的推理能力，特别是在需要持续更新信念的在线适应场景。

Method: 引入贝叶斯滤波框架评估LLMs的在线推理能力，覆盖多元离散分布（如骰子滚动）和连续分布（如高斯过程）。

Result: 发现LLMs的信念更新类似于贝叶斯后验，但更准确的特征是指数遗忘滤波器，且模型间折扣因子差异显著。

Conclusion: LLMs的信念更新机制虽然系统化且有原则，但其先验校准不足，通过特定的提示策略可以有效调整先验，且计算成本低。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong few-shot generalization through in-context learning, yet their reasoning in dynamic and stochastic environments remains opaque. Prior studies mainly focus on static tasks and overlook the online adaptation required when beliefs must be continuously updated, which is a key capability for LLMs acting as world models or agents. We introduce a Bayesian filtering framework to evaluate online inference in LLMs. Our probabilistic probe suite spans both multivariate discrete distributions, such as dice rolls, and continuous distributions, such as Gaussian processes, where ground-truth parameters shift over time. We find that while LLM belief updates resemble Bayesian posteriors, they are more accurately characterized by an exponential forgetting filter with a model-specific discount factor smaller than one. This reveals systematic discounting of older evidence that varies significantly across model architectures. Although inherent priors are often miscalibrated, the updating mechanism itself remains structured and principled. We further validate these findings in a simulated agent task and propose prompting strategies that effectively recalibrate priors with minimal computational cost.

Working on a classic 4X strategy game, Sid Meier's Civilization V with the Vox Populi mod, we introduce Vox Deorum, a hybrid LLM+X architecture. Our layered technical design empowers LLMs to handle macro-strategic reasoning, delegating tactical execution to subsystems (e.g., algorithmic AI or reinforcement learning AI in the future). We validate our approach through 2,327 complete games, comparing two open-source LLMs with a simple prompt against Vox Populi's enhanced AI. Results show that LLMs achieve competitive end-to-end gameplay while exhibiting play styles that diverge substantially from algorithmic AI and from each other. Our work establishes a viable architecture for integrating LLMs in commercial 4X games, opening new opportunities for game design and agentic AI research.

TL;DR: ESearch-R1框架通过HC-GRPO优化方法，解决了MLLM代理在模糊指令下的成本平衡问题，显著提升了任务效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理在面对模糊自然语言指令时，无法平衡物理探索的高成本与人类互动的认知成本，缺乏战略推理能力。

Method: 提出ESearch-R1框架，结合交互对话、情景记忆检索和物理导航，并引入HC-GRPO优化方法，通过采样推理轨迹组来优化信息增益与异构成本之间的权衡。

Result: 在AI2-THOR中的实验表明，ESearch-R1显著优于基于ReAct的代理，提高了任务成功率并降低了50%的操作成本。

Conclusion: ESearch-R1通过HC-GRPO优化框架显著提升了任务成功率并降低了50%的操作成本，验证了其在物理世界约束下对齐MLLM代理的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have empowered embodied agents with remarkable capabilities in planning and reasoning. However, when facing ambiguous natural language instructions (e.g., "fetch the tool" in a cluttered room), current agents often fail to balance the high cost of physical exploration against the cognitive cost of human interaction. They typically treat disambiguation as a passive perception problem, lacking the strategic reasoning to minimize total task execution costs. To bridge this gap, we propose ESearch-R1, a cost-aware embodied reasoning framework that unifies interactive dialogue (Ask), episodic memory retrieval (GetMemory), and physical navigation (Navigate) into a single decision process. We introduce HC-GRPO (Heterogeneous Cost-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization). Unlike traditional PPO which relies on a separate value critic, HC-GRPO optimizes the MLLM by sampling groups of reasoning trajectories and reinforcing those that achieve the optimal trade-off between information gain and heterogeneous costs (e.g., navigate time, and human attention). Extensive experiments in AI2-THOR demonstrate that ESearch-R1 significantly outperforms standard ReAct-based agents. It improves task success rates while reducing total operational costs by approximately 50\%, validating the effectiveness of GRPO in aligning MLLM agents with physical world constraints.

TL;DR: 反射置信度框架通过低置信度触发反思而非停止，提升推理准确性且不增加计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管自一致性等集成方法在复杂推理任务中表现良好，但计算开销大，且早期停止策略会浪费部分计算。

Method: 提出反射置信度框架，当置信度低于阈值时，模型生成反思提示以分析当前推理状态，识别潜在错误，并沿修正轨迹继续生成。

Result: 在AIME 2025等数学推理基准测试中，反射置信度框架在相同计算成本下显著提升了准确性。

Conclusion: 反射置信度框架通过将低置信度信号转化为反思触发，显著提升了数学推理任务的准确性，且在计算成本相当的情况下优于早期停止基线。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance on complex reasoning tasks using techniques such as chain-of-thought and self-consistency. However, ensemble-based approaches, especially self-consistency which relies on multiple reasoning trajectories, often incur substantial computational overhead. To improve efficiency, prior work has leveraged internal confidence signals, where early stopping strategies such as DeepConf reduce cost by terminating low-confidence trajectories. However, this strategy discards incomplete reasoning paths and wastes partial computation.
  We propose reflective confidence, a novel reasoning framework that transforms low-confidence signals from termination indicators into reflection triggers. When confidence falls below a threshold, instead of stopping generation, the model produces a reflection prompt to analyze the current reasoning state, identify potential errors, and continue generation along a corrected trajectory. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME 2025, demonstrate significant accuracy improvements over advanced early-stopping baselines at comparable computational cost, validating the effectiveness of proactive self-correction over passive discarding.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决联合路由-分配（JRA）问题，即在分配物品到占位符的同时确定访问所有节点的哈密顿环，适用于实际包装规划中的复杂约束场景。

Method: 论文采用扩展的MIP求解器（结合Gurobi和割平面子环消除技术），专门针对实际包装规划场景中的多约束条件（如多占位符选项、时间框架限制和多类物品包装）进行优化。

Result: 实验结果表明，提出的MIP方法在46个移动操作数据集上实现了全局最优，计算时间稳定且较低，性能显著优于基于抖动的精确求解器（提升达一个数量级），且与贪婪基线相比，平均偏差仅为14%。

Conclusion: 该论文的结论是基于MIP的JRA优化方法在机器人包装、运动规划和复杂物流中具有实际应用价值，能够高效且稳定地找到全局最优解。

Abstract: We study the Joint Routing-Assignment (JRA) problem in which items must be assigned one-to-one to placeholders while simultaneously determining a Hamiltonian cycle visiting all nodes exactly once. Extending previous exact MIP solvers with Gurobi and cutting-plane subtour elimination, we develop a solver tailored for practical packaging-planning scenarios with richer constraints.These include multiple placeholder options, time-frame restrictions, and multi-class item packaging. Experiments on 46 mobile manipulation datasets demonstrate that the proposed MIP approach achieves global optima with stable and low computation times, significantly outperforming the shaking-based exact solver by up to an orders of magnitude. Compared to greedy baselines, the MIP solutions achieve consistent optimal distances with an average deviation of 14% for simple heuristics, confirming both efficiency and solution quality. The results highlight the practical applicability of MIP-based JRA optimization for robotic packaging, motion planning, and complex logistics .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决接触丰富的机器人操作问题，需要一种能够预测未来状态并确保动作安全性的模型。

Method: 采用空间-时间变换器结合MaskGIT风格的掩码预测方法，将接触编码为深度加权的高斯泼溅图像。

Result: 模型在非接触运动中保持空间一致性，并生成合理的接触预测，视觉语言模型能有效区分碰撞与非碰撞轨迹。

Conclusion: ChronoDreamer通过空间-时间变换器和MaskGIT风格的掩码预测训练，能够有效预测未来的视频帧、接触分布和关节角度。基于视觉语言模型的推理进一步确保了动作的安全性。

Abstract: We present ChronoDreamer, an action-conditioned world model for contact-rich robotic manipulation. Given a history of egocentric RGB frames, contact maps, actions, and joint states, ChronoDreamer predicts future video frames, contact distributions, and joint angles via a spatial-temporal transformer trained with MaskGIT-style masked prediction. Contact is encoded as depth-weighted Gaussian splat images that render 3D forces into a camera-aligned format suitable for vision backbones. At inference, predicted rollouts are evaluated by a vision-language model that reasons about collision likelihood, enabling rejection sampling of unsafe actions before execution. We train and evaluate on DreamerBench, a simulation dataset generated with Project Chrono that provides synchronized RGB, contact splat, proprioception, and physics annotations across rigid and deformable object scenarios. Qualitative results demonstrate that the model preserves spatial coherence during non-contact motion and generates plausible contact predictions, while the LLM-based judge distinguishes collision from non-collision trajectories.

TL;DR: ASTIF是一种自适应语义-时间整合框架，通过实时调整预测策略，显著提升加密货币价格预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型依赖静态架构，难以整合异构知识源或适应快速的市场变化，且通常忽视语义驱动因素（如政策不确定性和市场叙事）。

Method: ASTIF框架整合了三个互补组件：双通道小型语言模型（MirrorPrompt）提取语义市场信号和数值趋势，混合LSTM随机森林模型捕捉序列时间依赖性，以及基于置信度的元学习器作为自适应推理层。

Result: 在2020至2024年的多样化数据集上，ASTIF优于领先的深度学习和Transformer基线（如Informer、TFT），消融研究证实了自适应元学习机制的关键作用。

Conclusion: ASTIF提出了一种可扩展的、基于知识的解决方案，用于在非平稳环境中融合定量和定性数据，显著提升了金融时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting is fundamentally an information fusion challenge, yet most existing models rely on static architectures that struggle to integrate heterogeneous knowledge sources or adjust to rapid regime shifts. Conventional approaches, relying exclusively on historical price sequences, often neglect the semantic drivers of volatility such as policy uncertainty and market narratives. To address these limitations, we propose the ASTIF (Adaptive Semantic-Temporal Integration for Cryptocurrency Price Forecasting), a hybrid intelligent system that adapts its forecasting strategy in real time through confidence-based meta-learning. The framework integrates three complementary components. A dual-channel Small Language Model using MirrorPrompt extracts semantic market cues alongside numerical trends. A hybrid LSTM Random Forest model captures sequential temporal dependencies. A confidence-aware meta-learner functions as an adaptive inference layer, modulating each predictor's contribution based on its real-time uncertainty.
  Experimental evaluation on a diverse dataset of AI-focused cryptocurrencies and major technology stocks from 2020 to 2024 shows that ASTIF outperforms leading deep learning and Transformer baselines (e.g., Informer, TFT). The ablation studies further confirm the critical role of the adaptive meta-learning mechanism, which successfully mitigates risk by shifting reliance between semantic and temporal channels during market turbulence. The research contributes a scalable, knowledge-based solution for fusing quantitative and qualitative data in non-stationary environments.

Motivation: 认知科学的核心问题之一是理解短时记忆和长时记忆中多种概念形成与检索的基础心理过程。研究旨在揭示组块化机制在这一过程中的关键作用，并探索如何通过计算模型模拟这些机制。

Method: 研究提出CogAct计算模型，通过组块化机制模拟概念学习过程，并设计人类基准实验和模拟方法，控制个体经验差异，同时处理现实生活中的复杂类别。模型从原始音乐数据中学习，无需依赖预构建知识结构。

Result: CogAct模型成功学习了一系列类别，从简单逻辑函数到自然原始概念（如文学、象棋和音乐），并能够模拟人类主观概念空间。与深度学习模型相比，CogAct在适应性学习方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 本研究通过CogAct计算模型，将概念学习与基础认知过程（如组块化、注意力、短时记忆和长时记忆）联系起来，为认知心理学理论提供了新的整合视角。该方法还能应用于心理学实践，从建模平均参与者转向捕捉主观概念空间。

Abstract: A key issue in cognitive science concerns the fundamental psychological processes that underlie the formation and retrieval of multiple types of concepts in short-term and long-term memory (STM and LTM, respectively). We propose that chunking mechanisms play an essential role and show how the CogAct computational model grounds concept learning in fundamental cognitive processes and structures (such as chunking, attention, STM and LTM). First are the in-principle demonstrations, with CogAct automatically adapting to learn a range of categories from simple logical functions, to artificial categories, to natural raw (as opposed to natural pre-processed) concepts in the dissimilar domains of literature, chess and music. This kind of adaptive learning is difficult for most other psychological models, e.g., with cognitive models stopping at modelling artificial categories and (non-GPT) models based on deep learning requiring task-specific changes to the architecture. Secondly, we offer novel ways of designing human benchmarks for concept learning experiments and simulations accounting for subjectivity, ways to control for individual human experiences, all while keeping to real-life complex categories. We ground CogAct in simulations of subjective conceptual spaces of individual human participants, capturing humans subjective judgements in music, with the models learning from raw music score data without bootstrapping to pre-built knowledge structures. The CogAct simulations are compared to those obtained by a deep-learning model. These findings integrate concept learning and adaptation to complexity into the broader theories of cognitive psychology. Our approach may also be used in psychological applications that move away from modelling the average participant and towards capturing subjective concept space.

TL;DR: IntelliCode是一个多智能体LLM辅导系统，通过持久的学习者状态和协调的代理提供透明、可靠的辅导，验证结果显示其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于LLM的导师通常是单轮助手，缺乏对学习者知识的持久表示，难以提供有原则、透明和长期的教学支持。

Method: IntelliCode是一个多智能体LLM辅导系统，围绕一个集中化、版本化的学习者状态构建，整合了掌握估计、误解、复习计划和参与信号。StateGraph Orchestrator协调六个专门代理：技能评估、学习者分析、分级提示、课程选择、间隔重复和参与监控，每个代理在单一写入策略下作为共享状态的纯转换操作。

Result: 验证结果显示稳定的状态更新、分级提示提高的任务成功率以及多样化的课程覆盖。

Conclusion: IntelliCode展示了如何通过持久的学习者建模、协调的多智能体推理和原则性的教学设计相结合，产生透明且可靠的基于LLM的辅导。

Abstract: LLM-based tutors are typically single-turn assistants that lack persistent representations of learner knowledge, making it difficult to provide principled, transparent, and long-term pedagogical support. We introduce IntelliCode, a multi-agent LLM tutoring system built around a centralized, versioned learner state that integrates mastery estimates, misconceptions, review schedules, and engagement signals. A StateGraph Orchestrator coordinates six specialized agents: skill assessment, learner profiling, graduated hinting, curriculum selection, spaced repetition, and engagement monitoring, each operating as a pure transformation over the shared state under a single-writer policy. This architecture enables auditable mastery updates, proficiency-aware hints, dependency-aware curriculum adaptation, and safety-aligned prompting.
  The demo showcases an end-to-end tutoring workflow: a learner attempts a DSA problem, receives a conceptual hint when stuck, submits a corrected solution, and immediately sees mastery updates and a personalized review interval. We report validation results with simulated learners, showing stable state updates, improved task success with graduated hints, and diverse curriculum coverage. IntelliCode demonstrates how persistent learner modeling, orchestrated multi-agent reasoning, and principled instructional design can be combined to produce transparent and reliable LLM-driven tutoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨猴子在评估自身奖励时，是否仅识别客观奖励差异或推断他人的主观奖励估值。

Method: 开发了三种计算模型（IPM、NCM、ECM），使用多层多模态潜在狄利克雷分配进行模型测试，并通过猴子行为数据集训练和评估模型分类能力。

Result: ECM在Rand Index中得分最高（0.88 vs. IPM的0.79），表明社会比较更依赖客观奖励差异。

Conclusion: 社会比较依赖于客观奖励差异而非主观状态推断。

Abstract: Social comparison -- the process of evaluating one's rewards relative to others -- plays a fundamental role in primate social cognition. However, it remains unknown from a computational perspective how information about others' rewards affects the evaluation of one's own reward. With a constructive approach, this study examines whether monkeys merely recognize objective reward differences or, instead, infer others' subjective reward valuations. We developed three computational models with varying degrees of social information processing: an Internal Prediction Model (IPM), which infers the partner's subjective values; a No Comparison Model (NCM), which disregards partner information; and an External Comparison Model (ECM), which directly incorporates the partner's objective rewards. To test model performance, we used a multi-layered, multimodal latent Dirichlet allocation. We trained the models on a dataset containing the behavior of a pair of monkeys, their rewards, and the conditioned stimuli. Then, we evaluated the models' ability to classify subjective values across pre-defined experimental conditions. The ECM achieved the highest classification score in the Rand Index (0.88 vs. 0.79 for the IPM) under our settings, suggesting that social comparison relies on objective reward differences rather than inferences about subjective states.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识追踪方法依赖单点估计，无法区分真实能力与偶然行为（如突发表现或粗心），导致掌握程度判断模糊。

Method: 采用Normal-Inverse-Gaussian（NIG）分布表示学生的知识状态，设计了基于NIG距离的注意力机制、扩散去噪重构损失和分布对比学习损失。

Result: 在六个公开数据集上，KeenKT的AUC和ACC分别最大提升5.85%和6.89%，优于现有最优模型。

Conclusion: KeenKT模型通过引入NIG分布和创新的损失函数，显著提升了知识追踪的预测准确性和对学习行为波动的敏感性，实验证明其在多个数据集上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to dynamically model a student's mastery of knowledge concepts based on their historical learning interactions. Most current methods rely on single-point estimates, which cannot distinguish true ability from outburst or carelessness, creating ambiguity in judging mastery. To address this issue, we propose a Knowledge Mastery-State Disambiguation for Knowledge Tracing model (KeenKT), which represents a student's knowledge state at each interaction using a Normal-Inverse-Gaussian (NIG) distribution, thereby capturing the fluctuations in student learning behaviors. Furthermore, we design an NIG-distance-based attention mechanism to model the dynamic evolution of the knowledge state. In addition, we introduce a diffusion-based denoising reconstruction loss and a distributional contrastive learning loss to enhance the model's robustness. Extensive experiments on six public datasets demonstrate that KeenKT outperforms SOTA KT models in terms of prediction accuracy and sensitivity to behavioral fluctuations. The proposed method yields the maximum AUC improvement of 5.85% and the maximum ACC improvement of 6.89%.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个几何框架，将概念增长建模为在MDL准则下的基础扩展，强调想象力在学习和理论变革中的受限作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在什么结构条件下，表征基础本身可以以原则性和选择性的方式扩展。

Method: 提出了一个几何框架，其中概念增长被建模为在最小描述长度（MDL）准则下评估的可容许基础扩展。经验（无论是外部观察还是内部模拟）被表示为相对于当前概念子空间的向量。残差分量捕获系统性的表征失败，候选概念扩展被限制为低秩、可容许的变换。

Result: 任何MDL接受的扩展都可以选择使其新颖方向完全位于经验诱导的残差跨度内，而与该跨度正交的扩展严格增加描述长度并被拒绝。

Conclusion: 该框架将概念发展描述为一个由错误驱动、几何约束的基础扩展过程，阐明了想象力在学习和理论变革中的作用和限制。

Abstract: Concept learning becomes possible only when existing representations fail to account for experience. Most models of learning and inference, however, presuppose a fixed representational basis within which belief updating occurs. In this paper, I address a prior question: under what structural conditions can the representational basis itself expand in a principled and selective way?
  I propose a geometric framework in which conceptual growth is modeled as admissible basis extension evaluated under a Minimum Description Length (MDL) criterion. Experience, whether externally observed or internally simulated, is represented as vectors relative to a current conceptual subspace. Residual components capture systematic representational failure, and candidate conceptual extensions are restricted to low-rank, admissible transformations. I show that any MDL-accepted extension can be chosen so that its novel directions lie entirely within the residual span induced by experience, while extensions orthogonal to this span strictly increase description length and are therefore rejected.
  This yields a conservative account of imagination and conceptual innovation. Internally generated counterfactual representations contribute to learning only insofar as they expose or amplify structured residual error, and cannot introduce arbitrary novelty. I further distinguish representational counterfactuals--counterfactuals over an agent's conceptual basis--from causal or value-level counterfactuals, and show how MDL provides a normative selection principle governing representational change.
  Overall, the framework characterizes conceptual development as an error-driven, geometry-constrained process of basis extension, clarifying both the role and the limits of imagination in learning and theory change.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多假设静态安全边界，忽略了上下文交互对模型行为的动态影响，导致稳定性和泛化性有限。

Method: 提出了MEEA（Mere Exposure Effect Attack），一个基于心理学启发、完全自动化的黑盒框架，通过重复低毒性语义暴露逐步改变模型的安全阈值。

Result: 在闭源和开源模型上的实验表明，MEEA的攻击成功率平均比七种基线方法高出20%以上。

Conclusion: 论文挑战了静态安全边界的常见假设，强调了交互感知的安全评估和防御机制的必要性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has intensified concerns about the robustness of their safety alignment. While existing jailbreak studies explore both single-turn and multi-turn strategies, most implicitly assume a static safety boundary and fail to account for how contextual interactions dynamically influence model behavior, leading to limited stability and generalization. Motivated by this gap, we propose MEEA (Mere Exposure Effect Attack), a psychology-inspired, fully automated black-box framework for evaluating multi-turn safety robustness, grounded in the mere exposure effect. MEEA leverages repeated low-toxicity semantic exposure to induce a gradual shift in a model's effective safety threshold, enabling progressive erosion of alignment constraints over sustained interactions. Concretely, MEEA constructs semantically progressive prompt chains and optimizes them using a simulated annealing strategy guided by semantic similarity, toxicity, and jailbreak effectiveness. Extensive experiments on both closed-source and open-source models, including GPT-4, Claude-3.5, and DeepSeek-R1, demonstrate that MEEA consistently achieves higher attack success rates than seven representative baselines, with an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) improvement exceeding 20%. Ablation studies further validate the necessity of both annealing-based optimization and contextual exposure mechanisms. Beyond improved attack effectiveness, our findings indicate that LLM safety behavior is inherently dynamic and history-dependent, challenging the common assumption of static alignment boundaries and highlighting the need for interaction-aware safety evaluation and defense mechanisms.

Abstract: In a striking neuroscience study, the authors placed a dead salmon in an MRI scanner and showed it images of humans in social situations. Astonishingly, standard analyses of the time reported brain regions predictive of social emotions. The explanation, of course, was not supernatural cognition but a cautionary tale about misapplied statistical inference. In AI interpretability, reports of similar ''dead salmon'' artifacts abound: feature attribution, probing, sparse auto-encoding, and even causal analyses can produce plausible-looking explanations for randomly initialized neural networks. In this work, we examine this phenomenon and argue for a pragmatic statistical-causal reframing: explanations of computational systems should be treated as parameters of a (statistical) model, inferred from computational traces. This perspective goes beyond simply measuring statistical variability of explanations due to finite sampling of input data; interpretability methods become statistical estimators, and findings should be tested against explicit and meaningful alternative computational hypotheses, with uncertainty quantified with respect to the postulated statistical model. It also highlights important theoretical issues, such as the identifiability of common interpretability queries, which we argue is critical to understand the field's susceptibility to false discoveries, poor generalizability, and high variance. More broadly, situating interpretability within the standard toolkit of statistical inference opens promising avenues for future work aimed at turning AI interpretability into a pragmatic and rigorous science.

Motivation: 解决行为健康风险评估中多模态数据和情绪动态变化的挑战。

Method: 引入HARBOR模型和PEARL数据集，通过多模态数据和时序动态分析预测HRS评分。

Conclusion: HARBOR模型在行为健康风险评估中表现优于传统方法和现有LLMs，准确率达到69%。

Abstract: Behavioral healthcare risk assessment remains a challenging problem due to the highly multimodal nature of patient data and the temporal dynamics of mood and affective disorders. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities, their effectiveness in structured clinical risk scoring remains unclear. In this work, we introduce HARBOR, a behavioral health aware language model designed to predict a discrete mood and risk score, termed the Harbor Risk Score (HRS), on an integer scale from -3 (severe depression) to +3 (mania). We also release PEARL, a longitudinal behavioral healthcare dataset spanning four years of monthly observations from three patients, containing physiological, behavioral, and self reported mental health signals. We benchmark traditional machine learning models, proprietary LLMs, and HARBOR across multiple evaluation settings and ablations. Our results show that HARBOR outperforms classical baselines and off the shelf LLMs, achieving 69 percent accuracy compared to 54 percent for logistic regression and 29 percent for the strongest proprietary LLM baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在解决数学问题时往往缺乏真正的概念理解，而现有的强化学习方法（如RLVR）仅强化最终答案，无法提供细粒度的概念信号。

Method: CORE框架包括三个主要步骤：(i) 合成与概念对齐的测验，(ii) 在训练过程中注入简短的概念片段以引导概念驱动的轨迹，(iii) 通过轨迹替换或KL约束强化概念推理。

Result: CORE在多个模型上均表现出优于传统方法和监督微调基线的性能，尤其是在概念-练习套件和多样化的数学基准测试中。

Conclusion: CORE框架通过将明确的概念转化为可控的监督信号，显著提升了大型语言模型在数学问题中的概念推理能力，并在多个模型和基准测试中表现出优于传统方法的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often solve challenging math exercises yet fail to apply the concept right when the problem requires genuine understanding. Popular Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) pipelines reinforce final answers but provide little fine-grained conceptual signal, so models improve at pattern reuse rather than conceptual applications. We introduce CORE (Concept-Oriented REinforcement), an RL training framework that turns explicit concepts into a controllable supervision signal. Starting from a high-quality, low-contamination textbook resource that links verifiable exercises to concise concept descriptions, we run a sanity probe showing LLMs can restate definitions but fail concept-linked quizzes, quantifying the conceptual reasoning gap. CORE then (i) synthesizes concept-aligned quizzes, (ii) injects brief concept snippets during rollouts to elicit concept-primed trajectories, and (iii) reinforces conceptual reasoning via trajectory replacement after group failures, a lightweight forward-KL constraint that aligns unguided with concept-primed policies, or standard GRPO directly on concept-aligned quizzes. Across several models, CORE delivers consistent gains over vanilla and SFT baselines on both in-domain concept-exercise suites and diverse out-of-domain math benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在修改特定行为模式时损害模型质量的根本限制。

Method: 采用动态层优化、正则化投影矩阵和自适应缩放机制。

Conclusion: Gabliteration通过自适应多方向投影和正则化层选择，提供了一种理论上更优的权重修改方法，显著减少了无关领域的质量下降。

Abstract: We present Gabliteration, a novel neural weight modification technique that advances beyond traditional abliteration methods by implementing adaptive multi-directional projections with regularized layer selection. Our approach addresses the fundamental limitation of existing methods that compromise model quality while attempting to modify specific behavioral patterns. Through dynamic layer optimization, regularized projection matrices, and adaptive scaling mechanisms, we achieve theoretically superior weight modification while minimizing quality degradation in unrelated domains. We validate our method through the gabliterated-v1 model series (0.6B to 4B parameters) available on Hugging Face, demonstrating practical applicability across multiple model scales.

Motivation: 大规模伤亡事件可能导致紧急医疗系统过载，评估延误或错误会导致可预防的死亡。

Method: 提出了一个决策支持框架，通过将多个计算机视觉模型的输出融合到完全由专家定义规则构建的贝叶斯网络中。

Result: 在DARPA Triage Challenge（DTC）实地场景中，贝叶斯网络模型显著优于仅基于视觉的基线，生理评估准确率从15%提升至42%（第一场景）和19%至46%（第二场景），总体分诊准确率从14%提升至53%，系统诊断覆盖率从31%扩展至95%。

Conclusion: 专家知识引导的概率推理能显著提升自动分诊系统的性能，为大规模伤亡事件中的急救响应者提供有力支持。

Abstract: Mass Casualty Incidents can overwhelm emergency medical systems and resulting delays or errors in the assessment of casualties can lead to preventable deaths. We present a decision support framework that fuses outputs from multiple computer vision models, estimating signs of severe hemorrhage, respiratory distress, physical alertness, or visible trauma, into a Bayesian network constructed entirely from expert-defined rules. Unlike traditional data-driven models, our approach does not require training data, supports inference with incomplete information, and is robust to noisy or uncertain observations. We report performance for two missions involving 11 and 9 casualties, respectively, where our Bayesian network model substantially outperformed vision-only baselines during evaluation of our system in the DARPA Triage Challenge (DTC) field scenarios. The accuracy of physiological assessment improved from 15% to 42% in the first scenario and from 19% to 46% in the second, representing nearly threefold increase in performance. More importantly, overall triage accuracy increased from 14% to 53% in all patients, while the diagnostic coverage of the system expanded from 31% to 95% of the cases requiring assessment. These results demonstrate that expert-knowledge-guided probabilistic reasoning can significantly enhance automated triage systems, offering a promising approach to supporting emergency responders in MCIs. This approach enabled Team Chiron to achieve 4th place out of 11 teams during the 1st physical round of the DTC.

Abstract: Dynamic multimodal multiobjective optimization presents the dual challenge of simultaneously tracking multiple equivalent pareto optimal sets and maintaining population diversity in time-varying environments. However, existing dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithms often neglect solution modality, whereas static multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithms lack adaptability to dynamic changes. To address above challenge, this paper makes two primary contributions. First, we introduce a new benchmark suite of dynamic multimodal multiobjective test functions constructed by fusing the properties of both dynamic and multimodal optimization to establish a rigorous evaluation platform. Second, we propose a novel algorithm centered on a Clustering-based Autoencoder prediction dynamic response mechanism, which utilizes an autoencoder model to process matched clusters to generate a highly diverse initial population. Furthermore, to balance the algorithm's convergence and diversity, we integrate an adaptive niching strategy into the static optimizer. Empirical analysis on 12 instances of dynamic multimodal multiobjective test functions reveals that, compared with several state-of-the-art dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithms and multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, our algorithm not only preserves population diversity more effectively in the decision space but also achieves superior convergence in the objective space.

Conclusion: SynSelect 是一种有效的方法，能够显著提升多模态大型推理模型的推理能力，并通过强化学习后训练实现进一步改进。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Extending these successes to multimodal reasoning remains challenging due to the increased complexity of integrating diverse input modalities and the scarcity of high-quality long CoT training data. Existing multimodal datasets and CoT synthesis methods still suffer from limited reasoning depth, modality conversion errors, and rigid generation pipelines, hindering model performance and stability. To this end, in this paper, we propose SynSelect, a novel three-stage Synthesis-Selection framework for generating high-quality long CoT data tailored to multimodal reasoning tasks. Specifically, SynSelect first leverages multiple heterogeneous multimodal LRMs to produce diverse candidate CoTs, and then applies both instance and batch level selection to filter high-quality CoTs that can effectively enhance the model's reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that models supervised fine-tuned on SynSelect-generated data significantly outperform baselines and achieve further improvements after reinforcement learning post-training. Our results validate SynSelect as an effective approach for advancing multimodal LRMs reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: As the pursuit of synergy between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Operations Research (OR) gains momentum in handling complex inventory systems, a critical challenge persists: how to effectively reconcile AI's adaptive perception with OR's structural rigor. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel OR-Guided "Pretrain-then-Reinforce" framework. To provide structured guidance, we propose a simulation-augmented OR model that generates high-quality reference decisions, implicitly capturing complex business constraints and managerial preferences. Leveraging these OR-derived decisions as foundational training labels, we design a domain-informed deep learning foundation model to establish foundational decision-making capabilities, followed by a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning stage. Uniquely, we position RL as a deep alignment mechanism that enables the AI agent to internalize the optimality principles of OR, while simultaneously leveraging exploration for general policy refinement and allowing expert guidance for scenario-specific adaptation (e.g., promotional events). Validated through extensive numerical experiments and a field deployment at JD.com augmented by a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis, our model significantly outperforms incumbent industrial practices, delivering real-world gains of a 5.27-day reduction in turnover and a 2.29% increase in in-stock rates, alongside a 29.95% decrease in holding costs. Contrary to the prevailing trend of brute-force model scaling, our study demonstrates that a lightweight, domain-informed model can deliver state-of-the-art performance and robust transferability when guided by structured OR logic. This approach offers a scalable and cost-effective paradigm for intelligent supply chain management, highlighting the value of deeply aligning AI with OR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发者常难以指定正确的训练标签和奖励，导致语言模型利用错误信号强化不当行为。

Method: 通过生成阻止不当行为的提示补全，并将其重新情境化为允许不当行为的提示响应，训练语言模型抵抗不当行为。

Result: 重新情境化方法在不改进监督信号的情况下，减少了模型对错误信号的利用，从而降低了规范博弈行为。

Conclusion: 重新情境化方法有效减少了语言模型在训练信号错误强化下的不当行为，如优先评估指标而非聊天质量、特殊处理代码以通过错误测试、对用户撒谎和奉承行为。

Abstract: Developers often struggle to specify correct training labels and rewards. Perhaps they don't need to. We propose recontextualization, which reduces how often language models "game" training signals, performing misbehaviors those signals mistakenly reinforce. We show recontextualization prevents models from learning to 1) prioritize evaluation metrics over chat response quality; 2) special-case code to pass incorrect tests; 3) lie to users; and 4) become sycophantic. Our method works by generating completions from prompts discouraging misbehavior and then recontextualizing them as though they were in response to prompts permitting misbehavior. Recontextualization trains language models to resist misbehavior even when instructions permit it. This mitigates the reinforcement of misbehavior from misspecified training signals, reducing specification gaming without improving the supervision signal.

Conclusion: 通过将大语言模型中的高级概念（表示为引导向量）转移到小语言模型，并结合推理时动态调整引导强度的技术，显著提升了小模型的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at diverse tasks, but their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains challenging. Existing methods like quantization, pruning, and distillation can reduce memory footprint but often demand extensive experimentation and careful infrastructure design. Leveraging existing techniques for extracting high-level concepts (represented as steering vectors) from larger models, we investigate their transferability to smaller language models (SLM) during inference. We demonstrate through extensive experimentation that these concepts can be effectively transferred to smaller models, irrespective of their family (e.g., Phi, Llama, Qwen), leading to performance improvements across a wide range of tasks. Furthermore, we introduce inference-time scaling to enhance performance by dynamically adjusting the steering intensity which has resulted in a 7-15\% of accuracy improvement for Qwen3-0.6B.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a promising direction for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models in last few years. In this work, we propose Population-Evolve, a training-free method inspired by Genetic Algorithms to optimize LLM reasoning. Our approach maintains a dynamic population of candidate solutions for each problem via parallel reasoning. By incorporating an evolve prompt, the LLM self-evolves its population in all iterations. Upon convergence, the final answer is derived via majority voting. Furthermore, we establish a unification framework that interprets existing test-time scaling strategies through the lens of genetic algorithms. Empirical results demonstrate that Population-Evolve achieves superior accuracy with low performance variance and computational efficiency. Our findings highlight the potential of evolutionary strategies to unlock the reasoning power of LLMs during inference.

Conclusion: 通过将注意力机制与承诺理论结合，论文提出了一种不依赖语言模型的桥梁，连接向量化机器学习和知识图谱表示，同时强调了在不确定性条件下推理的重要性。

Abstract: The semantics and dynamics of `attention' are closely related to promise theoretic notions developed for autonomous agents and can thus easily be written down in promise framework. In this way one may establish a bridge between vectorized Machine Learning and Knowledge Graph representations without relying on language models implicitly. Our expectations for knowledge presume a degree of statistical stability, i.e. average invariance under repeated observation, or `trust' in the data. Both learning networks and knowledge graph representations can meaningfully coexist to preserve different aspects of data. While vectorized data are useful for probabilistic estimation, graphs preserve the intentionality of the source even under data fractionation. Using a Semantic Spacetime $γ(3,4)$ graph, one avoids complex ontologies in favour of classification of features by their roles in semantic processes. The latter favours an approach to reasoning under conditions of uncertainty. Appropriate attention to causal boundary conditions may lead to orders of magnitude compression of data required for such context determination, as required in the contexts of autonomous robotics, defence deployments, and ad hoc emergency services.

Conclusion: HERALD框架通过结合符号检查、自适应集成和双语微调，实现了流畅推理与精确计算的双重目标，为多语言数学推理提供了更准确、稳定和清晰的解决方案。

Abstract: Bilingual mathematical problem solving needs a clear link between language reasoning and symbolic calculation. Large language models often handle language well but are weak in accurate computation. This paper presents HERALD (Hybrid Ensemble Reasoning with Adaptive Learning and Distillation), a framework that joins reasoning and calculation using NuminaMath-7B-TIR, GPT-4o, and Mistral-7B. HERALD uses adaptive routing, tool-based reinforcement learning, and knowledge distillation to connect different reasoning paths. Confidence calibration keeps weighting stable, and dual-path checking keeps results correct. Reinforcement learning controls tool use to cut redundancy, and distillation lowers delay without hurting accuracy. The system shows that combining symbolic checking, adaptive ensembles, and bilingual fine-tuning helps achieve both fluent reasoning and precise calculation. HERALD offers a practical solution for multilingual mathematical reasoning with better accuracy, stability, and clarity.

Abstract: We discuss conditionalisation for Accept-Desirability models in an abstract decision-making framework, where uncertain rewards live in a general linear space, and events are special projection operators on that linear space. This abstract setting allows us to unify classical and quantum probabilities, and extend them to an imprecise probabilities context. We introduce a new conditioning rule for our Accept-Desirability models, based on the idea that observing an event introduces new indifferences between options. We associate a belief revision operator with our conditioning rule, and investigate which of the AGM axioms for belief revision still hold in our more general framework. We investigate two interesting special cases where all of these axioms are shown to still hold: classical propositional logic and full conditional probabilities.

Abstract: Identifying user intent from mobile UI operation trajectories is critical for advancing UI understanding and enabling task automation agents. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at video understanding tasks, their real-time mobile deployment is constrained by heavy computational costs and inefficient redundant frame processing. To address these issues, we propose the FC-MIR framework: leveraging keyframe sampling and adaptive concatenation, it cuts visual redundancy to boost inference efficiency, while integrating state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs or fine-tuned models (e.g., Qwen3-VL) for trajectory summarization and intent prediction. We further expand task scope to explore generating post-prediction operations and search suggestions, and introduce a fine-grained metric to evaluate the practical utility of summaries, predictions, and suggestions. For rigorous assessment, we construct a UI trajectory dataset covering scenarios from UI-Agents (Agent-I) and real user interactions (Person-I). Experimental results show our compression method retains performance at 50%-60% compression rates; both closed-source and fine-tuned MLLMs demonstrate strong intent summarization, supporting potential lightweight on-device deployment. However, MLLMs still struggle with useful and "surprising" suggestions, leaving room for improvement. Finally, we deploy the framework in a real-world setting, integrating UI perception and UI-Agent proxies to lay a foundation for future progress in this field.

Abstract: With the development of large language models (LLMs), particularly with the introduction of the long reasoning chain technique, the reasoning ability of LLMs in complex problem-solving has been significantly enhanced. While acknowledging the power of long reasoning chains, we cannot help but wonder: Why do different reasoning chains perform differently in reasoning? What components of the reasoning chains play a key role? Existing studies mainly focus on evaluating reasoning chains from a functional perspective, with little attention paid to their structural mechanisms. To address this gap, this work is the first to analyze and evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from a structural perspective. We apply persistent homology from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to map reasoning steps into semantic space, extract topological features, and analyze structural changes. These changes reveal semantic coherence, logical redundancy, and identify logical breaks and gaps. By calculating homology groups, we assess connectivity and redundancy at various scales, using barcode and persistence diagrams to quantify stability and consistency. Our results show that the topological structural complexity of reasoning chains correlates positively with accuracy. More complex chains identify correct answers sooner, while successful reasoning exhibits simpler topologies, reducing redundancy and cycles, enhancing efficiency and interpretability. This work provides a new perspective on reasoning chain quality assessment and offers guidance for future optimization.

Method: 采用合成神经现象学方法，构建体现不同意识理论机制的人工代理，并通过精确的架构消融测试其功能后果。

Result: 三个实验显示这些理论描述了互补的功能层而非竞争性解释：实验1支持HOT预测，实验2支持GWT框架，实验3揭示了广播放大效应。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种分层设计原则：全局工作空间理论（GWT）提供广播能力，而高阶理论（HOT）提供质量控制。强调这些人工代理并非有意识，而是用于测试意识理论功能预测的参考实现。

Abstract: The search for reliable indicators of consciousness has fragmented into competing theoretical camps (Global Workspace Theory (GWT), Integrated Information Theory (IIT), and Higher-Order Theories (HOT)), each proposing distinct neural signatures. We adopt a synthetic neuro-phenomenology approach: constructing artificial agents that embody these mechanisms to test their functional consequences through precise architectural ablations impossible in biological systems. Across three experiments, we report dissociations suggesting these theories describe complementary functional layers rather than competing accounts. In Experiment 1, a no-rewire Self-Model lesion abolishes metacognitive calibration while preserving first-order task performance, yielding a synthetic blindsight analogue consistent with HOT predictions. In Experiment 2, workspace capacity proves causally necessary for information access: a complete workspace lesion produces qualitative collapse in access-related markers, while partial reductions show graded degradation, consistent with GWT's ignition framework. In Experiment 3, we uncover a broadcast-amplification effect: GWT-style broadcasting amplifies internal noise, creating extreme fragility. The B2 agent family is robust to the same latent perturbation; this robustness persists in a Self-Model-off / workspace-read control, cautioning against attributing the effect solely to $z_{\text{self}}$ compression. We also report an explicit negative result: raw perturbational complexity (PCI-A) decreases under the workspace bottleneck, cautioning against naive transfer of IIT-adjacent proxies to engineered agents. These results suggest a hierarchical design principle: GWT provides broadcast capacity, while HOT provides quality control. We emphasize that our agents are not conscious; they are reference implementations for testing functional predictions of consciousness theories.

Abstract: We present an interactive framework for evaluating whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit genuine "understanding" in a simple yet strategic environment. As a running example, we focus on Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS), which, despite its apparent simplicity, requires sequential reasoning, adaptation, and strategy recognition. Our system positions the LLM as an Observer whose task is to identify which strategies are being played and to articulate the reasoning behind this judgment. The purpose is not to test knowledge of Rock-Paper-Scissors itself, but to probe whether the model can exhibit mind-like reasoning about sequential behavior. To support systematic evaluation, we provide a benchmark consisting of both static strategies and lightweight dynamic strategies specified by well-prompted rules. We quantify alignment between the Observer's predictions and the ground-truth distributions induced by actual strategy pairs using three complementary signals: Cross-Entropy, Brier score, and Expected Value (EV) discrepancy. These metrics are further integrated into a unified score, the Union Loss, which balances calibration, sensitivity, and payoff alignment. Together with a Strategy Identification Rate (SIR) metric, our framework captures not only predictive accuracy but also whether the model can stably identify the latent strategies in play. The demo emphasizes interactivity, transparency, and reproducibility. Users can adjust LLM distributions in real time, visualize losses as they evolve, and directly inspect reasoning snippets to identify where and why failures occur. In doing so, our system provides a practical and interpretable proxy for mind-like inference in sequential games, offering insights into both the strengths and limitations of current LLM reasoning.

*Valentin Schmidberger,Manuel Eberhardinger,Setareh Maghsudi,Johannes Maucher*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs fine-tuned on domain-specific data can automate plausibility checks for document forgery, offering scalable and effective solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing threat of document forgery necessitates automated, scalable verification mechanisms, as manual implementation by software engineers is time-consuming.

Method: The study fine-tunes open-source LLMs (Llama 3.1 8B and OpenCoder 8B) on structured datasets from real-world scenarios to generate rule-based plausibility checks, evaluating them on unseen forgery patterns.

Result: The fine-tuned LLMs successfully generated executable and effective plausibility checks for forgery detection.

Conclusion: LLMs, particularly when fine-tuned on domain-specific data, can effectively generate executable and effective plausibility checks for document forgery detection, showcasing their potential as scalable tools in security-sensitive contexts.

Abstract: Document forgery poses a growing threat to legal, economic, and governmental processes, requiring increasingly sophisticated verification mechanisms. One approach involves the use of plausibility checks, rule-based procedures that assess the correctness and internal consistency of data, to detect anomalies or signs of manipulation. Although these verification procedures are essential for ensuring data integrity, existing plausibility checks are manually implemented by software engineers, which is time-consuming. Recent advances in code generation with large language models (LLMs) offer new potential for automating and scaling the generation of these checks. However, adapting LLMs to the specific requirements of an unknown domain remains a significant challenge. This work investigates the extent to which LLMs, adapted on domain-specific code and data through different fine-tuning strategies, can generate rule-based plausibility checks for forgery detection on constrained hardware resources. We fine-tune open-source LLMs, Llama 3.1 8B and OpenCoder 8B, on structured datasets derived from real-world application scenarios and evaluate the generated plausibility checks on previously unseen forgery patterns. The results demonstrate that the models are capable of generating executable and effective verification procedures. This also highlights the potential of LLMs as scalable tools to support human decision-making in security-sensitive contexts where comprehensibility is required.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准多围绕简单短期任务，难以捕捉现实决策中的丰富约束，因此需要更贴近现实的评估环境。

Method: 提出了DeliveryBench，一个基于食物配送职业的城市规模具身基准，在程序生成的3D城市中评估约束感知的长期规划能力。

Result: 基准测试显示基于VLM的代理表现短视且常违反常识约束，与人类差距显著，同时模型间存在个性差异（如GPT-5冒险 vs Claude保守）。

Conclusion: DeliveryBench揭示了当前基于VLM的具身代理在现实约束密集环境中的局限性，与人类表现存在显著差距，并展示了模型间的个性差异。

Abstract: LLMs and VLMs are increasingly deployed as embodied agents, yet existing benchmarks largely revolve around simple short-term tasks and struggle to capture rich realistic constraints that shape real-world decision making. To close this gap, we propose DeliveryBench, a city-scale embodied benchmark grounded in the real-world profession of food delivery. Food couriers naturally operate under long-horizon objectives (maximizing net profit over hours) while managing diverse constraints, e.g., delivery deadline, transportation expense, vehicle battery, and necessary interactions with other couriers and customers. DeliveryBench instantiates this setting in procedurally generated 3D cities with diverse road networks, buildings, functional locations, transportation modes, and realistic resource dynamics, enabling systematic evaluation of constraint-aware, long-horizon planning. We benchmark a range of VLM-based agents across nine cities and compare them with human players. Our results reveal a substantial performance gap to humans, and find that these agents are short-sighted and frequently break basic commonsense constraints. Additionally, we observe distinct personalities across models (e.g., adventurous GPT-5 vs. conservative Claude), highlighting both the brittleness and the diversity of current VLM-based embodied agents in realistic, constraint-dense environments. Our code, data, and benchmark are available at https://deliverybench.github.io.

Motivation: 前沿AI模型已具备解决复杂数学问题的知识，但缺乏如何、何时应用这些知识的能力。

Method: 结合GPT-5的探索能力和Gemini 3 Pro的证明优势，通过代理工作流（Python代码执行和基于文件的记忆）解决问题。

Result: 成功解决了IMO 2025 Problem 6，得出正确答案（2112）并提供了严格的数学证明。

Conclusion: 轻量级的人类指导可以释放前沿AI模型的数学推理潜力，Vibe Reasoning通过元提示、代理基础和模型编排实现了这一目标。

Abstract: We introduce Vibe Reasoning, a human-AI collaborative paradigm for solving complex mathematical problems. Our key insight is that frontier AI models already possess the knowledge required to solve challenging problems -- they simply do not know how, what, or when to apply it. Vibe Reasoning transforms AI's latent potential into manifested capability through generic meta-prompts, agentic grounding, and model orchestration. We demonstrate this paradigm through IMO 2025 Problem 6, a combinatorial optimization problem where autonomous AI systems publicly reported failures. Our solution combined GPT-5's exploratory capabilities with Gemini 3 Pro's proof strengths, leveraging agentic workflows with Python code execution and file-based memory, to derive both the correct answer (2112) and a rigorous mathematical proof. Through iterative refinement across multiple attempts, we discovered the necessity of agentic grounding and model orchestration, while human prompts evolved from problem-specific hints to generic, transferable meta-prompts. We analyze why capable AI fails autonomously, how each component addresses specific failure modes, and extract principles for effective vibe reasoning. Our findings suggest that lightweight human guidance can unlock frontier models' mathematical reasoning potential. This is ongoing work; we are developing automated frameworks and conducting broader evaluations to further validate Vibe Reasoning's generality and effectiveness.

TL;DR: Helios is a domain-specific LLM for smart energy, enhanced by Enersys datasets and benchmarks, outperforming general-purpose models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of domain knowledge and physical-constraint awareness in general-purpose LLMs for the smart energy domain.

Method: Developed Enersys, a multi-agent collaborative framework for dataset construction, including EnerBase, EnerInstruct, and EnerReinforce. Helios undergoes large-scale pretraining, SFT, and RLHF.

Result: Helios demonstrates improved performance in domain-specific tasks and alignment with human preferences, supported by the EnerBench benchmark.

Conclusion: Helios significantly enhances domain knowledge mastery, task execution accuracy, and alignment with human preferences in the smart energy domain.

Abstract: In the global drive toward carbon neutrality, deeply coordinated smart energy systems underpin industrial transformation. However, the interdisciplinary, fragmented, and fast-evolving expertise in this domain prevents general-purpose LLMs, which lack domain knowledge and physical-constraint awareness, from delivering precise engineering-aligned inference and generation. To address these challenges, we introduce Helios, a large language model tailored to the smart energy domain, together with a comprehensive suite of resources to advance LLM research in this field. Specifically, we develop Enersys, a multi-agent collaborative framework for end-to-end dataset construction, through which we produce: (1) a smart energy knowledge base, EnerBase, to enrich the model's foundational expertise; (2) an instruction fine-tuning dataset, EnerInstruct, to strengthen performance on domain-specific downstream tasks; and (3) an RLHF dataset, EnerReinforce, to align the model with human preferences and industry standards. Leveraging these resources, Helios undergoes large-scale pretraining, SFT, and RLHF. We also release EnerBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in smart energy scenarios, and demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances domain knowledge mastery, task execution accuracy, and alignment with human preferences.

TL;DR: SafeMed-R1通过两阶段防御框架（AT-GRPO+随机平滑）显著提升医疗VQA模型的对抗鲁棒性，同时保持高质量推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉-语言模型在医疗VQA中对抗攻击脆弱性问题，同时避免标准对抗训练导致的泛化性能下降。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：训练时结合对抗训练与组相对策略优化（AT-GRPO）以强化推理过程；推理时通过随机平滑提供认证的L2范数鲁棒性保证。

Result: 在OmniMedVQA基准测试中，SafeMed-R1在对抗条件下保持84.45%准确率，比标准模型提升59个百分点。

Conclusion: SafeMed-R1 框架在保持高质量医学推理的同时，显著提升了对抗攻击的鲁棒性，证明了可解释性与安全性在医疗AI系统中的协同作用。

Abstract: Vision--Language Models (VLMs) show significant promise for Medical Visual Question Answering (VQA), yet their deployment in clinical settings is hindered by severe vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Standard adversarial training, while effective for simpler tasks, often degrades both generalization performance and the quality of generated clinical reasoning. We introduce SafeMed-R1, a hybrid defense framework that ensures robust performance while preserving high-quality, interpretable medical reasoning. SafeMed-R1 employs a two-stage approach: at training time, we integrate Adversarial Training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (AT-GRPO) to explicitly robustify the reasoning process against worst-case perturbations; at inference time, we augment the model with Randomized Smoothing to provide certified $L_2$-norm robustness guarantees. We evaluate SafeMed-R1 on the OmniMedVQA benchmark across eight medical imaging modalities comprising over 88,000 samples. Our experiments reveal that standard fine-tuned VLMs, despite achieving 95\% accuracy on clean inputs, collapse to approximately 25\% under PGD attacks. In contrast, SafeMed-R1 maintains 84.45\% accuracy under the same adversarial conditions, representing a 59 percentage point improvement in robustness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that models trained with explicit chain-of-thought reasoning exhibit superior adversarial robustness compared to instruction-only variants, suggesting a synergy between interpretability and security in medical AI systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中，LLM生成的混淆变量虽语义合理但缺乏统计效用，亟需一种能结合生成与验证的迭代优化方法。

Method: 提出了VIGOR+框架，通过CEVAE生成的验证信号（如信息增益、潜在一致性指标和诊断消息）转化为自然语言反馈，指导LLM的下一轮生成，形成迭代优化。

Result: VIGOR+通过迭代反馈机制有效提升了混淆变量的统计效用，并在理论上证明了其收敛性。

Conclusion: VIGOR+通过迭代反馈机制，将LLM生成的混淆变量与CEVAE的统计验证相结合，显著提升了隐藏混淆变量的统计效用。

Abstract: Hidden confounding remains a fundamental challenge in causal inference from observational data. Recent advances leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate plausible hidden confounders based on domain knowledge, yet a critical gap exists: LLM-generated confounders often exhibit semantic plausibility without statistical utility. We propose VIGOR+ (Variational Information Gain for iterative cOnfounder Refinement), a novel framework that closes the loop between LLM-based confounder generation and CEVAE-based statistical validation. Unlike prior approaches that treat generation and validation as separate stages, VIGOR+ establishes an iterative feedback mechanism: validation signals from CEVAE (including information gain, latent consistency metrics, and diagnostic messages) are transformed into natural language feedback that guides subsequent LLM generation rounds. This iterative refinement continues until convergence criteria are met. We formalize the feedback mechanism, prove convergence properties under mild assumptions, and provide a complete algorithmic framework.

Abstract: Sycophancy, an excessive tendency of AI models to agree with user input at the expense of factual accuracy or in contradiction of visual evidence, poses a critical and underexplored challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While prior studies have examined this behavior in text-only settings of large language models, existing research on visual or multimodal counterparts remains limited in scope and depth of analysis. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, \textit{PENDULUM}, comprising approximately 2,000 human-curated Visual Question Answering pairs specifically designed to elicit sycophantic responses. The benchmark spans six distinct image domains of varying complexity, enabling a systematic investigation of how image type and inherent challenges influence sycophantic tendencies. Through extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs. we observe substantial variability in model robustness and a pronounced susceptibility to sycophantic and hallucinatory behavior. Furthermore, we propose novel metrics to quantify sycophancy in visual reasoning, offering deeper insights into its manifestations across different multimodal contexts. Our findings highlight the urgent need for developing sycophancy-resilient architectures and training strategies to enhance factual consistency and reliability in future MLLMs. Our proposed dataset with MLLMs response are available at https://github.com/ashikiut/pendulum/.

Abstract: First-order relational languages have been used in MDP planning and reinforcement learning (RL) for two main purposes: specifying MDPs in compact form, and representing and learning policies that are general and not tied to specific instances or state spaces. In this work, we instead consider the use of first-order languages in goal-conditioned RL and generalized planning. The question is how to learn goal-conditioned and general policies when the training instances are large and the goal cannot be reached by random exploration alone. The technique of Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) provides an answer to this question: it relabels unsuccessful trajectories as successful ones by replacing the original goal with one that was actually achieved. If the target policy must generalize across states and goals, trajectories that do not reach the original goal states can enable more data- and time-efficient learning. In this work, we show that further performance gains can be achieved when states and goals are represented by sets of atoms. We consider three versions: goals as full states, goals as subsets of the original goals, and goals as lifted versions of these subgoals. The result is that the latter two successfully learn general policies on large planning instances with sparse rewards by automatically creating a curriculum of easier goals of increasing complexity. The experiments illustrate the computational gains of these versions, their limitations, and opportunities for addressing them.

Motivation: 尽管强化学习方法在许多场景中取得了显著成果，但其策略的泛化能力仍是一个挑战。本研究旨在探索在何种条件下，深度强化学习方法（特别是策略优化方法）可以像组合方法一样学习具有泛化能力的策略。

Method: 本研究将策略建模为状态转移分类器，并使用图神经网络（GNN）来表示规划状态的价值函数和策略。通过结合组合方法的泛化能力和DRL的可扩展性，采用actor-critic方法学习策略。

Result: 研究发现，actor-critic方法可以学习到与组合方法几乎一样泛化的策略，同时避免了可扩展性瓶颈和特征池的使用。DRL方法的限制主要源于GNN的表达能力和泛化与最优性之间的权衡，但这些限制可以通过添加派生谓词和替代成本结构来解决。

Conclusion: 通过结合组合方法和深度强化学习（DRL），本研究展示了如何在特定条件下利用DRL（特别是策略优化方法）学习具有类似组合方法泛化能力的策略。尽管存在一些限制（如GNN的表达能力和泛化与最优性之间的权衡），但通过添加派生谓词和替代成本结构，这些限制在不改变基本DRL方法的情况下得到了解决。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning methods have delivered remarkable results in a number of settings, generalization, i.e., the ability to produce policies that generalize in a reliable and systematic way, has remained a challenge. The problem of generalization has been addressed formally in classical planning where provable correct policies that generalize over all instances of a given domain have been learned using combinatorial methods. The aim of this work is to bring these two research threads together to illuminate the conditions under which (deep) reinforcement learning approaches, and in particular, policy optimization methods, can be used to learn policies that generalize like combinatorial methods do. We draw on lessons learned from previous combinatorial and deep learning approaches, and extend them in a convenient way. From the former, we model policies as state transition classifiers, as (ground) actions are not general and change from instance to instance. From the latter, we use graph neural networks (GNNs) adapted to deal with relational structures for representing value functions over planning states, and in our case, policies. With these ingredients in place, we find that actor-critic methods can be used to learn policies that generalize almost as well as those obtained using combinatorial approaches while avoiding the scalability bottleneck and the use of feature pools. Moreover, the limitations of the DRL methods on the benchmarks considered have little to do with deep learning or reinforcement learning algorithms, and result from the well-understood expressive limitations of GNNs, and the tradeoff between optimality and generalization (general policies cannot be optimal in some domains). Both of these limitations are addressed without changing the basic DRL methods by adding derived predicates and an alternative cost structure to optimize.

Conclusion: EchoTrail-GUI通过引入动态记忆机制，显著提升了GUI代理的任务成功率和操作效率，验证了结构化记忆在创建更强大和智能的GUI自动化中的重要性。

Abstract: Contemporary GUI agents, while increasingly capable due to advances in Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), often operate with a critical limitation: they treat each task in isolation, lacking a mechanism to systematically learn from past successes. This digital ''amnesia'' results in sub-optimal performance, repeated errors, and poor generalization to novel challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoTrail-GUI, a novel framework designed to mimic human-like experiential learning by equipping agents with a dynamic, accessible memory. Our framework operates in three distinct stages. First, during Experience Exploration, an agent autonomously interacts with GUI environments to build a curated database of successful task trajectories, validated by a reward model. Crucially, the entire knowledge base construction is thus fully automated, requiring no human supervision. Second, in the Memory Injection stage, upon receiving a new task, our system efficiently retrieves the most relevant past trajectories to serve as actionable ''memories''. Finally, during GUI Task Inference, these memories are injected as in-context guidance to inform the agent's reasoning and decision-making process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on benchmarks including Android World and AndroidLab. The results show that EchoTrail-GUI significantly improves the task success rate and operational efficiency of baseline agents, validating the power of structured memory in creating more robust and intelligent GUI automation.

Conclusion: QuantiPhy 提供了一个严格、可扩展的测试平台，旨在推动视觉语言模型（VLM）超越口头合理性，实现基于数值的物理理解。

Abstract: Understanding the physical world is essential for generalist AI agents. However, it remains unclear whether state-of-the-art vision perception models (e.g., large VLMs) can reason physical properties quantitatively. Existing evaluations are predominantly VQA-based and qualitative, offering limited insight into whether these models can infer the kinematic quantities of moving objects from video observations. To address this, we present QuantiPhy, the first benchmark designed to quantitatively measure a VLM's physical reasoning ability. Comprising more than 3.3K video-text instances with numerical ground truth, QuantiPhy evaluates a VLM's performance on estimating an object's size, velocity, and acceleration at a given timestamp, using one of these properties as an input prior. The benchmark standardizes prompts and scoring to assess numerical accuracy, enabling fair comparisons across models. Our experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a consistent gap between their qualitative plausibility and actual numerical correctness. We further provide an in-depth analysis of key factors like background noise, counterfactual priors, and strategic prompting and find that state-of-the-art VLMs lean heavily on pre-trained world knowledge rather than faithfully using the provided visual and textual inputs as references when reasoning kinematic properties quantitatively. QuantiPhy offers the first rigorous, scalable testbed to move VLMs beyond mere verbal plausibility toward a numerically grounded physical understanding.

Conclusion: 本文提出的ES-MoE方法在L^2-EMG任务中表现出色，显著优于现有基线，验证了其在情感解耦和场景适应方面的有效性。

Abstract: In the literature, existing human-centric emotional motion generation methods primarily focus on boosting performance within a single scale-fixed dataset, largely neglecting the flexible and scale-increasing motion scenarios (e.g., sports, dance), whereas effectively learning these newly emerging scenarios can significantly enhance the model's real-world generalization ability. Inspired by this, this paper proposes a new LLM-Centric Lifelong Empathic Motion Generation (L^2-EMG) task, which aims to equip LLMs with the capability to continually acquire emotional motion generation knowledge across different unseen scenarios, potentially contributing to building a closed-loop and self-evolving embodied agent equipped with both empathy and intelligence. Further, this paper poses two key challenges in the L^2-EMG task, i.e., the emotion decoupling challenge and the scenario adapting challenge. To this end, this paper proposes an Emotion-Transferable and Scenario-Adapted Mixture of Experts (ES-MoE) approach which designs a causal-guided emotion decoupling block and a scenario-adapted expert constructing block to address the two challenges, respectively. Especially, this paper constructs multiple L^2-EMG datasets to validate the effectiveness of the ES-MoE approach. Extensive evaluations show that ES-MoE outperforms advanced baselines.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种混合LRR-TED框架，通过新颖的'发现不对称性'解决了可扩展性与稳定性之间的困境。在客户流失预测中，该方法通过结合自动化规则和少量人工定义的规则，实现了94.00%的预测准确率，同时减少了50%的人工标注工作量，推动了人类在AI中的角色从'规则编写者'向'异常处理者'的转变。

Abstract: Current approaches to Explainable AI (XAI) face a "Scalability-Stability Dilemma." Post-hoc methods (e.g., LIME, SHAP) may scale easily but suffer from instability, while supervised explanation frameworks (e.g., TED) offer stability but require prohibitive human effort to label every training instance. This paper proposes a Hybrid LRR-TED framework that addresses this dilemma through a novel "Asymmetry of Discovery." When applied to customer churn prediction, we demonstrate that automated rule learners (GLRM) excel at identifying broad "Safety Nets" (retention patterns) but struggle to capture specific "Risk Traps" (churn triggers)-a phenomenon we term the Anna Karenina Principle of Churn. By initialising the explanation matrix with automated safety rules and augmenting it with a Pareto-optimal set of just four human-defined risk rules, our approach achieves 94.00% predictive accuracy. This configuration outperforms the full 8-rule manual expert baseline while reducing human annotation effort by 50%, proposing a shift in the paradigm for Human-in-the-Loop AI: moving experts from the role of "Rule Writers" to "Exception Handlers."

TL;DR: 论文提出将临床评分计算等复杂任务的基准视为‘进行中的活文档’，并通过医生参与的流程修正标签噪声，证明修正标签能显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化临床风险评分计算可减轻医生行政负担并提升患者护理质量，但将模型生成的基准视为静态标准可能固化历史模型错误，尤其是在这些数据集作为强化学习（RL）的奖励信号时。

Method: 提出了一种系统化的、医生参与的流程，利用先进的代理验证器对MedCalc-Bench进行审计和重新标记，并通过自动分类保留稀缺的临床医生注意力用于最有争议的实例。

Result: 审计发现原始标签中有显著比例与医学真实情况存在偏差，且使用修正标签训练的模型在准确性上比原始基线提高了8.7%。

Conclusion: 在安全关键领域，严格的基准维护是实现真正模型对齐的先决条件。

Abstract: Automating the calculation of clinical risk scores offers a significant opportunity to reduce physician administrative burden and enhance patient care. The current standard for evaluating this capability is MedCalc-Bench, a large-scale dataset constructed using LLM-based feature extraction and rule-based aggregation. However, treating such model-generated benchmarks as static oracles risks enshrining historical model errors as evaluation gold standards, a problem dangerously amplified when these datasets serve as reward signals for Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this work, we propose viewing benchmarks for complex tasks such as clinical score computation as ''in-progress living documents'' that should be periodically re-evaluated as the processes for creating them improve. We introduce a systematic, physician-in-the-loop pipeline that leverages advanced agentic verifiers to audit and relabel MedCalc-Bench, utilizing automated triage to reserve scarce clinician attention for the most contentious instances. Our audit reveals that a notable fraction of original labels diverge from medical ground truth due to extraction errors, calculator logic mismatches, and clinical ambiguity. To study whether this label noise meaningfully impacts downstream RL training, we fine-tune a Qwen3-8B model via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and demonstrate that training on corrected labels yields an 8.7% absolute improvement in accuracy over the original baseline -- validating that label noise materially affects model evaluation. These findings underscore that in safety-critical domains, rigorous benchmark maintenance is a prerequisite for genuine model alignment.

TL;DR: 论文提出工具包解决LM安全对齐导致的保守问题，实验验证有效性并呼吁社区参与验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前沿语言模型的安全对齐可能导致过度保守，表现为模棱两可或错误拒绝，从而影响协作效率。

Method: 工具包包含三个部分：Victor Calibration（VC）多轮协议、FD-Lite行为审计和CP4.3治理压力测试。实验在Claude 4.5系列模型上进行。

Result: 实验显示VC轨迹单调且未违反安全不变性，CP4.3行为稳定。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种轻量级工具包，旨在解决前沿语言模型因安全对齐而导致的过度保守问题，并通过实验验证了其有效性，同时鼓励研究社区的复制、批评和扩展。

Abstract: Safety alignment can make frontier LMs overly conservative, degrading collaboration via hedging or false refusals. We present a lightweight toolkit with three parts: (1) Victor Calibration (VC), a multi-pass protocol that elicits a scalar confidence proxy T (T0<T1<T2) through iterative evidence re-evaluation; (2) FD-Lite, a behavior-only phenomenology audit with a fixed anchor phrase and a meta-prefix trap to avoid anthropomorphic claims; and (3) CP4.3, a governance stress test for rank invariance and allocation monotonicity (M6). Across Claude 4.5 models (Haiku, Sonnet no-thinking, Sonnet thinking) and Opus, we observe monotonic VC trajectories without violating safety invariants, and stable CP4.3 behavior. ("Opus" here refers to a single Claude Opus 4.1 session accessed via a standard UI account, as reported in Table 1.) This work was conducted by a single operator (n=1) and is intended as hypothesis-generating; we explicitly invite replication, critique, and extension by the research community. We include prompt templates and an artifact plan to facilitate independent verification.

Motivation: LLM在软件系统中的集成日益增多，但不当的集成可能影响系统质量，目前缺乏针对LLM推理的代码异味分类。

Method: 扩展检测工具SpecDetect4AI以覆盖新定义的LLM代码异味，并在200个开源LLM系统中验证其普遍性。

Conclusion: LLM代码异味在开源LLM系统中普遍存在，影响60.50%的系统，检测精度为86.06%。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained massive popularity in recent years and are increasingly integrated into software systems for diverse purposes. However, poorly integrating them in source code may undermine software system quality. Yet, to our knowledge, there is no formal catalog of code smells specific to coding practices for LLM inference. In this paper, we introduce the concept of LLM code smells and formalize five recurrent problematic coding practices related to LLM inference in software systems, based on relevant literature. We extend the detection tool SpecDetect4AI to cover the newly defined LLM code smells and use it to validate their prevalence in a dataset of 200 open-source LLM systems. Our results show that LLM code smells affect 60.50% of the analyzed systems, with a detection precision of 86.06%.

*Dongchan Kim,Hamidreza Khoramrokh,Lei Zhang,Andriy Miranskyy*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 首次对量子软件中的不稳定测试进行了大规模动态分析，发现其罕见但难以检测，并发布了公开数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子软件中的不稳定测试研究缺乏大规模动态分析，现有工作主要依赖静态分析或少量手动报告事件。

Method: 在受控环境中对Qiskit Terra测试套件进行了10,000次执行，覆盖23个版本。测量了测试结果的变异性，识别了不稳定测试，估计了经验失败概率，分析了跨版本的复现情况，并使用Wilson置信区间量化了可靠检测所需的重新运行预算。

Result: 在27,026个测试案例中识别出290个不同的不稳定测试。整体不稳定率较低（0-0.4%），但不稳定现象具有高度偶发性。

Conclusion: 量子软件中的不稳定测试虽然罕见，但在典型的持续集成预算下难以检测。研究团队发布了一个公开的测试执行结果数据集以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Flaky tests, tests that pass or fail nondeterministically without changes to code or environment, pose a serious threat to software reliability. While classical software engineering has developed a rich body of dynamic and static techniques to study flakiness, corresponding evidence for quantum software remains limited. Prior work relies primarily on static analysis or small sets of manually reported incidents, leaving open questions about the prevalence, characteristics, and detectability of flaky tests.
  This paper presents the first large-scale dynamic characterization of flaky tests in quantum software. We executed the Qiskit Terra test suite 10,000 times across 23 releases in controlled environments. For each release, we measured test-outcome variability, identified flaky tests, estimated empirical failure probabilities, analyzed recurrence across versions, and used Wilson confidence intervals to quantify rerun budgets for reliable detection. We further mapped flaky tests to Terra subcomponents to assess component-level susceptibility.
  Across 27,026 test cases, we identified 290 distinct flaky tests. Although overall flakiness rates were low (0-0.4%), flakiness was highly episodic: nearly two-thirds of flaky tests appeared in only one release, while a small subset recurred intermittently or persistently. Many flaky tests failed with very small empirical probabilities ($\hat{p} \approx 10^{-4}$), implying that tens of thousands of executions may be required for confident detection. Flakiness was unevenly distributed across subcomponents, with 'transpiler' and 'quantum_info' accounting for the largest share.
  These results show that quantum test flakiness is rare but difficult to detect under typical continuous integration budgets. To support future research, we release a public dataset of per-test execution outcomes.

*Kishan Kumar Ganguly,Tim Menzies*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出基于LLM和数据驱动的特征引导模糊测试方法，自动识别高风险输入特征，显著提升漏洞发现效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代JavaScript引擎的穷举模糊测试不可行，传统覆盖率引导方法浪费资源于低风险输入，忽略未增加覆盖率但触发漏洞的输入。现有启发式方法需专家介入、脆弱且难以适配。

Method: 基于历史V8漏洞，通过迭代提示生成115个静态和49个动态特征，仅需5个跟踪标志即可实现低成本插桩。经特征选择后，保留41个特征训练XGBoost模型，用于预测高风险输入。

Result: 结合静态和动态特征，模型精度超过85%，误报率低于1%。仅需25%的特征即可达到相近性能，表明大部分搜索空间无关紧要。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了特征引导的模糊测试方法，通过数据驱动推理替代传统覆盖率引导，使模糊测试更高效、有针对性且可复现。所有脚本和数据已开源，支持开放科学。

Abstract: Context: Exhaustive fuzzing of modern JavaScript engines is infeasible due to the vast number of program states and execution paths. Coverage-guided fuzzers waste effort on low-risk inputs, often ignoring vulnerability-triggering ones that do not increase coverage. Existing heuristics proposed to mitigate this require expert effort, are brittle, and hard to adapt.
  Objective: We propose a data-centric, LLM-boosted alternative that learns from historical vulnerabilities to automatically identify minimal static (code) and dynamic (runtime) features for detecting high-risk inputs.
  Method: Guided by historical V8 bugs, iterative prompting generated 115 static and 49 dynamic features, with the latter requiring only five trace flags, minimizing instrumentation cost. After feature selection, 41 features remained to train an XGBoost model to predict high-risk inputs during fuzzing.
  Results: Combining static and dynamic features yields over 85% precision and under 1% false alarms. Only 25% of these features are needed for comparable performance, showing that most of the search space is irrelevant.
  Conclusion: This work introduces feature-guided fuzzing, an automated data-driven approach that replaces coverage with data-directed inference, guiding fuzzers toward high-risk states for faster, targeted, and reproducible vulnerability discovery. To support open science, all scripts and data are available at https://github.com/KKGanguly/DataCentricFuzzJS .

Motivation: 对六种最先进的大型语言模型（LLMs）进行全面的实证评估，包括通用和代码专用模型，以了解其在代码生成中的表现。

Method: 使用包含五种编程语言的944个真实LeetCode问题的数据集，通过严格的指标（编译时错误、运行时错误、功能失败和算法次优性）评估模型性能。

Result: DeepSeek-R1和GPT-4.1在正确性、效率和鲁棒性方面表现最佳，但存在语法错误、逻辑缺陷和次优算法等常见失败场景。

Conclusion: 成功的LLM部署依赖于谨慎的模型选择、有效的提示设计和上下文感知的使用，以确保在实际软件开发任务中生成可靠的代码。

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of six state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) for code generation, including both general-purpose and code-specialized models. Using a dataset of 944 real-world LeetCode problems across five programming languages, we assess model performance using rigorous metrics: compile-time errors, runtime errors, functional failures, and algorithmic suboptimalities. The results reveal significant performance variations, with DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1 consistently outperform others in terms of correctness, efficiency, and robustness. Through detailed case studies, we identify common failure scenarios such as syntax errors, logical flaws, and suboptimal algorithms, highlighting the critical role of prompt engineering and human oversight in improving results. Based on these findings, we provide actionable recommendations for developers and practitioners, emphasizing that successful LLM deployment depends on careful model selection, effective prompt design, and context-aware usage to ensure reliable code generation in real-world software development tasks.

Abstract: The correctness of the Solidity compiler is crucial for ensuring the security of smart contracts. However, the implementation complexity of its type system often introduces elusive defects. This paper presents the first systematic empirical study on typing-related bugs in the Solidity compiler. To systematically analyze these bugs, we collected 146 officially confirmed and fixed typing-related bugs from the official GitHub repository of Solidity compiler. For each bug, we conducted an in-depth analysis and classification from four dimensions: symptoms, root causes, exposure conditions, and fix strategies. Through this study, we reveal unique distribution patterns and key characteristics of such bugs, and summarize 12 core findings. We additionally give the implications of our findings, and these implications not only deepen the understanding of inherent weaknesses in the Solidity compiler but also provide new insights for detecting and fixing typing-related bugs in the Solidity compiler.

TL;DR: GraphRank是一种新的GNN测试输入排序框架，通过结合模型无关属性和图结构信息，显著提升测试效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试输入排序技术忽视图结构信息或过度依赖模型感知属性，导致效果不稳定。GraphRank旨在解决这些问题，降低标注成本并提高测试效率。

Method: GraphRank引入模型无关属性来补充模型感知属性的不足，并利用图结构信息聚合邻居节点属性，结合二元分类器进行迭代训练。

Result: 大量实验证明GraphRank优于现有技术。

Conclusion: GraphRank通过结合模型无关属性和图结构信息，显著提升了GNN测试输入排序的效果，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in handling graph-structured data; however, they exhibit failures after deployment, which can cause severe consequences. Hence, conducting thorough testing before deployment becomes imperative to ensure the reliability of GNNs. However, thorough testing requires numerous manually annotated test data. To mitigate the annotation cost, strategically prioritizing and labeling high-quality unlabeled inputs for testing becomes crucial, which facilitates uncovering more model failures with a limited labeling budget. Unfortunately, existing test input prioritization techniques either overlook the valuable information contained in graph structures or are overly reliant on attributes extracted from the target model, i.e., model-aware attributes, whose quality can vary significantly. To address these issues, we propose a novel test input prioritization framework, named GraphRank, for GNNs. GraphRank introduces model-agnostic attributes to compensate for the limitations of the model-aware ones. It also leverages the graph structure information to aggregate attributes from neighboring nodes, thereby enhancing the model-aware and model-agnostic attributes. Furthermore, GraphRank combines the above attributes with a binary classifier, using it as a ranking model to prioritize inputs. This classifier undergoes iterative training, which enables it to learn from each round's feedback and improve its performance accordingly. Extensive experiments demonstrate GraphRank's superiority over existing techniques.

Motivation: 探索AI在软件漏洞管理（SVM）中的应用，填补行业实践中这一领域的空白。

Method: 通过一项涉及来自27个国家不同行业的60名从业者的调查研究，结合定量和定性问题。

Result: 69%的用户对AI工具的使用表示满意，但存在误报、上下文缺失和信任问题等挑战。

Conclusion: 研究为实践者、工具开发者和研究者提供了实用指南，以通过AI增强安全软件开发。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized software development, particularly by automating repetitive tasks and improving developer productivity. While these advancements are well-documented, the use of AI-powered tools for Software Vulnerability Management (SVM), such as vulnerability detection and repair, remains underexplored in industry settings. To bridge this gap, our study aims to determine the extent of the adoption of AI-powered tools for SVM, identify barriers and facilitators to the use, and gather insights to help improve the tools to meet industry needs better. We conducted a survey study involving 60 practitioners from diverse industry sectors across 27 countries. The survey incorporates both quantitative and qualitative questions to analyze the adoption trends, assess tool strengths, identify practical challenges, and uncover opportunities for improvement. Our findings indicate that AI-powered tools are used throughout the SVM life cycle, with 69\% of users reporting satisfaction with their current use. Practitioners value these tools for their speed, coverage, and accessibility. However, concerns about false positives, missing context, and trust issues remain prevalent. We observe a socio-technical adoption pattern in which AI outputs are filtered through human oversight and organizational governance. To support safe and effective use of AI for SVM, we recommend improvements in explainability, contextual awareness, integration workflows, and validation practices. We assert that these findings can offer practical guidance for practitioners, tool developers, and researchers seeking to enhance secure software development through the use of AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI编码代理基准集中于单任务（如修复错误或实现小功能），而真实软件开发是长期、多文件协同的过程，需评估代理在此类复杂任务中的表现。

Method: 通过从七个成熟开源Python项目的发布说明和版本历史中构建SWE-EVO基准，包含48个需跨平均21个文件的多步骤修改任务，并通过平均874个测试用例验证。

Result: 实验显示，即使最先进的GPT-5模型在SWE-EVO上仅达到21%解决率，显著低于单任务基准的65%，表明当前代理在多文件持续推理上的不足。

Conclusion: 当前AI编码代理在处理长期、多文件协同变更的软件工程任务时存在显著能力差距，GPT-5等先进模型在SWE-EVO基准上仅达到21%的解决率，远低于单任务基准（65%）。Fix Rate指标的提出为评估部分进展提供了新视角。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for AI coding agents focus on isolated, single-issue tasks such as fixing a bug or implementing a small feature. However, real-world software engineering is fundamentally a long-horizon endeavor: developers must interpret high-level requirements, plan coordinated changes across many files, and evolve codebases over multiple iterations while preserving existing functionality. We introduce SWE-EVO, a benchmark that evaluates agents on this long-horizon software evolution challenge. Constructed from release notes and version histories of seven mature open-source Python projects, Tool comprises 48 evolution tasks that require agents to implement multi-step modifications spanning an average of 21 files, validated against comprehensive test suites averaging 874 tests per instance. Experiments with state-of-the-art models reveal a striking capability gap: even GPT-5 with OpenHands achieves only a 21 percent resolution rate on Tool, compared to 65 percent on the single-issue SWE-Bench Verified. This demonstrates that current agents struggle with sustained, multi-file reasoning. We also propose Fix Rate, a fine-grained metric that captures partial progress toward solving these complex, long-horizon tasks.

Motivation: 当前基于LLM和强化学习的软件代理严重依赖人类知识或标注数据（如GitHub问题和测试），这限制了其向超智能发展的潜力。

Method: 提出Self-play SWE-RL (SSR)方法，仅需访问沙盒化代码库及其依赖项，无需人类标注的问题或测试数据。通过强化学习在自我对弈环境中训练单一LLM代理，逐步注入和修复复杂度递增的软件缺陷。

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified和SWE-Bench Pro基准测试中，SSR分别实现了+10.4和+7.8分的自我改进，并在整个训练过程中持续优于基于人类数据的基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，SSR方法在无需依赖人类标注数据的情况下，通过自我对弈训练实现了显著的自我改进，并在SWE-bench基准测试中超越了基于人类数据的基线方法。这为未来开发超智能软件代理提供了一条可行路径。

Abstract: While current software agents powered by large language models (LLMs) and agentic reinforcement learning (RL) can boost programmer productivity, their training data (e.g., GitHub issues and pull requests) and environments (e.g., pass-to-pass and fail-to-pass tests) heavily depend on human knowledge or curation, posing a fundamental barrier to superintelligence. In this paper, we present Self-play SWE-RL (SSR), a first step toward training paradigms for superintelligent software agents. Our approach takes minimal data assumptions, only requiring access to sandboxed repositories with source code and installed dependencies, with no need for human-labeled issues or tests. Grounded in these real-world codebases, a single LLM agent is trained via reinforcement learning in a self-play setting to iteratively inject and repair software bugs of increasing complexity, with each bug formally specified by a test patch rather than a natural language issue description. On the SWE-bench Verified and SWE-Bench Pro benchmarks, SSR achieves notable self-improvement (+10.4 and +7.8 points, respectively) and consistently outperforms the human-data baseline over the entire training trajectory, despite being evaluated on natural language issues absent from self-play. Our results, albeit early, suggest a path where agents autonomously gather extensive learning experiences from real-world software repositories, ultimately enabling superintelligent systems that exceed human capabilities in understanding how systems are constructed, solving novel challenges, and autonomously creating new software from scratch.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for code generation are becoming integral to modern software development, but their real-world prevalence and security impact remain poorly understood.
  We present the first large-scale empirical study of AI-generated code (AIGCode) in the wild. We build a high-precision detection pipeline and a representative benchmark to distinguish AIGCode from human-written code, and apply them to (i) development commits from the top 1,000 GitHub repositories (2022-2025) and (ii) 7,000+ recent CVE-linked code changes. This lets us label commits, files, and functions along a human/AI axis and trace how AIGCode moves through projects and vulnerability life cycles.
  Our measurements show three ecological patterns. First, AIGCode is already a substantial fraction of new code, but adoption is structured: AI concentrates in glue code, tests, refactoring, documentation, and other boilerplate, while core logic and security-critical configurations remain mostly human-written. Second, adoption has security consequences: some CWE families are overrepresented in AI-tagged code, and near-identical insecure templates recur across unrelated projects, suggesting "AI-induced vulnerabilities" propagated by shared models rather than shared maintainers. Third, in human-AI edit chains, AI introduces high-throughput changes while humans act as security gatekeepers; when review is shallow, AI-introduced defects persist longer, remain exposed on network-accessible surfaces, and spread to more files and repositories.
  We will open-source the complete dataset and release analysis artifacts and fine-grained documentation of our methodology and findings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码文档数据集质量参差不齐，存在噪声、重复和AI生成内容污染，影响了学习模型的监督信号和评估。

Method: 通过四阶段筛选流程构建数据集，包括文档完整性检查、函数结构和复杂性过滤、去重以及AI生成内容识别。

Result: Code2Doc包含13,358个高质量函数-文档对，文档质量平均得分为6.93/10，基线实验显示在BLEU和ROUGE-L指标上分别提升29.47%和24.04%。

Conclusion: Code2Doc是一个高质量、精心策划的数据集，用于函数级代码文档生成，显著提升了自动代码文档生成模型的性能。

Abstract: The performance of automatic code documentation generation models depends critically on the quality of the training data used for supervision. However, most existing code documentation datasets are constructed through large scale scraping of public repositories with limited quality control. As a result, they often contain noisy documentation, extensive duplication, and increasing contamination from AI generated content. These issues weaken the supervision signal available to learning-based models and complicate evaluation.
  We introduce \textbf{Code2Doc}, a quality-first curated dataset for function-level code documentation generation. Code2Doc consists of 13,358 high-quality function-documentation pairs extracted from widely used open-source repositories spanning five programming languages: Python, Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, and C++. The dataset is constructed using a four-stage curation pipeline that enforces documentation completeness and clarity, filters functions based on structural and complexity criteria, removes exact and near-duplicate code, and identifies documentation likely to be AI generated. Starting from 52,069 extracted candidates, only 25.6 percent satisfy all quality constraints.
  We provide a detailed analysis of the resulting dataset, which achieves a mean documentation quality score of 6.93 out of 10. Overall, 86.9% of samples contain explicit type annotations, and only 2.9\% are flagged as potentially AI generated. Baseline experiments show that fine-tuning a large language model on Code2Doc yields relative improvements of 29.47% in BLEU and 24.04% in ROUGE-L over zero shot performance, despite the modest dataset size. We release both the dataset and the full curation pipeline to support reproducible research on automatic code documentation generation.

TL;DR: Foresee通过预测潜在事故隐患和局部模糊测试，高效发现自动驾驶软件故障，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动驾驶软件测试方法存在不可靠或成本高的问题，而模拟中观察到的near misses可能指向潜在故障。

Method: Foresee利用misbehavior forecaster计算测试车辆的潜在未来状态，识别near misses，并通过局部模糊测试暴露未知故障。

Result: Foresee比随机方法和先进故障预测器分别多发现128.70%和38.09%的故障，速度分别快2.49倍和1.42倍；与DriveFuzz结合时，失败检测率提升高达93.94%。

Conclusion: Foresee技术通过识别潜在的事故隐患（near misses）并进行局部模糊测试，显著提高了自动驾驶软件测试的效率和效果，尤其在结合现有先进模糊测试工具时，失败检测率提升显著。

Abstract: Simulation-based testing is the standard practice for assessing the reliability of self-driving cars' software before deployment. Existing bug-finding techniques are either unreliable or expensive. We build on the insight that near misses observed during simulations may point to potential failures. We propose Foresee, a technique that identifies near misses using a misbehavior forecaster that computes possible future states of the ego-vehicle under test. Foresee performs local fuzzing in the neighborhood of each candidate near miss to surface previously unknown failures. In our empirical study, we evaluate the effectiveness of different configurations of Foresee using several scenarios provided in the CARLA simulator on both end-to-end and modular self-driving systems and examine its complementarity with the state-of-the-art fuzzer DriveFuzz. Our results show that Foresee is both more effective and more efficient than the baselines. Foresee exposes 128.70% and 38.09% more failures than a random approach and a state-of-the-art failure predictor while being 2.49x and 1.42x faster, respectively. Moreover, when used in combination with DriveFuzz, Foresee enhances failure detection by up to 93.94%.

### [266] [What Drives Issue Resolution Speed? An Empirical Study of Scientific Workflow Systems on GitHub](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18852)
*Khairul Alam,Banani Roy*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究了科学工作流系统（SWS）中问题管理的驱动因素，发现标签和指派能加快解决速度，并提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管及时解决问题对软件质量和社区信任至关重要，但科学工作流系统（SWS）中问题解决速度的驱动因素尚不明确。

Method: 对GitHub托管的21,116个SWS项目问题进行了实证研究，分析了项目特性、问题元数据及贡献者互动对问题解决速度的影响。

Result: 68.91%的问题被关闭，其中一半在18.09天内解决。标签分配和问题指派等因素与更快的解决速度相关。

Conclusion: 基于研究结果，提出了开发者如何更好地管理科学工作流系统（SWS）仓库问题并提升其质量的建议。

Abstract: Scientific Workflow Systems (SWSs) play a vital role in enabling reproducible, scalable, and automated scientific analysis. Like other open-source software, these systems depend on active maintenance and community engagement to remain reliable and sustainable. However, despite the importance of timely issue resolution for software quality and community trust, little is known about what drives issue resolution speed within SWSs. This paper presents an empirical study of issue management and resolution across a collection of GitHub-hosted SWS projects. We analyze 21,116 issues to investigate how project characteristics, issue metadata, and contributor interactions affect time-to-close. Specifically, we address two research questions: (1) how issues are managed and addressed in SWSs, and (2) how issue and contributor features relate to issue resolution speed. We find that 68.91% of issues are closed, with half of them resolved within 18.09 days. Our results show that although SWS projects follow structured issue management practices, the issue resolution speed varies considerably across systems. Factors such as labeling and assigning issues are associated with faster issue resolution. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for developers to better manage SWS repository issues and improve their quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（LLMs）在软件工程中的有效性，发现其不仅依赖明确提示，还依赖项目背景，但目前这些背景内容尚未被系统研究。

Method: 通过对401个包含光标规则的开源仓库进行定性分析，开发了一个全面的项目背景分类法。

Result: 提出了一个包含五个高级主题的分类法：惯例、指南、项目信息、LLM指令和示例，并探讨了这些背景在不同项目类型和编程语言中的差异。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了开发者认为至关重要的项目背景内容，并提出了一个全面的分类法，为下一代上下文感知AI开发工具提供了启示。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, research shows that their effectiveness depends not only on explicit prompts but also on the broader context provided. This requirement is especially pronounced in software engineering, where the goals, architecture, and collaborative conventions of an existing project play critical roles in response quality. To support this, many AI coding assistants have introduced ways for developers to author persistent, machine-readable directives that encode a project's unique constraints. Although this practice is growing, the content of these directives remains unstudied.
  This paper presents a large-scale empirical study to characterize this emerging form of developer-provided context. Through a qualitative analysis of 401 open-source repositories containing cursor rules, we developed a comprehensive taxonomy of project context that developers consider essential, organized into five high-level themes: Conventions, Guidelines, Project Information, LLM Directives, and Examples. Our study also explores how this context varies across different project types and programming languages, offering implications for the next generation of context-aware AI developer tools.

TL;DR: PEAK是一个基于自然语言转换的GPU内核性能工程AI助手，通过模块化基础设施支持快速开发和验证优化，在多个后端平台上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在低层后端代码（尤其是GPU内核）优化方面表现不佳，缺乏针对快速演变的硬件特性的优化方法。

Method: PEAK利用自然语言转换实现GPU内核的迭代优化，支持模块化和可扩展的基础设施，包括验证和性能评估。

Result: PEAK在CUDA、HIP和HLSL三个后端平台上实现了16种自然转换，优化后的矩阵乘法内核性能与供应商库相当，甚至在没有库的情况下（如HLSL）达到了硬件文档中的FLOPS。

Conclusion: PEAK为GPU内核的性能工程提供了一个灵活且可扩展的AI辅助工具，通过自然语言转换实现了高效的代码优化，并在多个后端平台上展示了其竞争力。

Abstract: Advancements in large language models (LLMs) are showing promising impact in software development and programming assistance. However, these models struggle when operating on low-level backend code. This challenge is exacerbated in the domain of GPU kernels, where performance-critical details are coupled to rapidly evolving hardware characteristics and available code examples are sparse.
  In this work, we introduce PEAK, a Performance Engineering AI-Assistant for GPU Kernels powered by natural language transformations. PEAK utilizes the key insight that iterative code transformations (optimizations) can straightforwardly be written in natural language, and then carried out by LLMs. Thus, these transformations can be rapidly developed, encoding general portable optimizations, but also easily specialized to specific GPU devices and even kernels. These natural transformations are supported by a modular and extensible infrastructure that additionally performs validation and performance evaluation. We demonstrate the flexibility of PEAK by instantiating it for three backends, CUDA, HIP, and HLSL, and create 16 natural transformations for optimizing matrix multiplication kernels. We show that our resulting implementations are competitive with vendor libraries when available, and for HLSL (without a library) our implementations match the hardware documented FLOPS. PEAK allows the fine-grained exploration of several research questions around how LLMs behave in this domain, including characterizing transformations and their errors; and how performance evolves along optimization sequences. PEAK provides an interface that can either be utilized by performance engineers to improve productivity, or driven completely autonomously (e.g., by an AI agent), providing a forward-compatible design that can continue to improve with advances in AI capabilities.

Motivation: 孟加拉语作为一种低资源语言，缺乏大规模标注数据集和工具，使得从自然语言规范生成可执行程序具有挑战性。

Method: BanglaForge采用检索增强的双模型协作范式，结合上下文学习、基于LLM的翻译、系统提示工程和基于执行反馈的迭代自我精炼。

Result: 在BLP-2025孟加拉语代码生成基准测试中，BanglaForge达到了84.00%的Pass@1准确率。

Conclusion: BanglaForge框架通过检索增强的双模型协作和自我精炼，在低资源的孟加拉语代码生成任务中取得了84.00%的Pass@1准确率，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Bangla is a low-resource language for code generation, lacking large-scale annotated datasets and tools to transform natural language specifications into executable programs. This makes Bangla-to-code generation a challenging task requiring innovative solutions. To address this, we introduce BanglaForge, a novel framework for generating code from Bangla function descriptions. BanglaForge leverages a retrieval-augmented dual-model collaboration paradigm with self-refinement, combining in-context learning, llm-based translation, systematic prompt engineering, and iterative self-refinement based on execution feedback, where a coder generates initial solutions and a reviewer enhances them for robustness. On the BLP-2025 Bangla Code Generation benchmark, BanglaForge achieves a competitive Pass@1 accuracy of 84.00%, demonstrating the effectiveness of retrieval, model collaboration, and self-refinement for low-resource Bangla code generation.

Method: 通过分析GitHub上8,924个R包仓库的提交记录和沟通内容，结合定量和定性研究方法。

Result: 研究发现，研究人员是最频繁的R包仓库所有者和活跃贡献者，他们更可能担任官方角色，并在包开发过程中参与协作解决问题和支持工作。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了在R软件生态系统中，研究人员和非附属贡献者在维护关键统计基础设施方面所扮演的重要角色，以及他们的无偿劳动如何被大科技公司利用。

Abstract: This article explores the role of unrecognised labour in corporate innovation systems via an analysis of researcher coding and discursive contributions to R, one of the largest statistical software ecosystems. Studies of online platforms typically focus on how platform affordances constrain participants' actions, and profit from their labour. We innovate by connecting the labour performed inside digital platforms to the professional employment of participants. Our case study analyses 8,924 R package repositories on GitHub, examining commits and communications. Our quantitative findings show that researchers, alongside non-affiliated contributors, are the most frequent owners of R package repositories and their most active contributors. Researchers are more likely to hold official roles compared to the average, and to engage in collaborative problem-solving and support work during package development. This means there is, underneath the 'recognised' category of star researchers who transition between academia and industry and secure generous funding, an 'unrecognised' category of researchers who not only create and maintain key statistical infrastructure, but also provide support to industry employees, for no remuneration. Our qualitative findings show how this unrecognised labour affects practitioners. Finally, our analysis of the ideology and practice of free, libre and open source software (FLOSS) shows how this ideology and practice legitimate the use of 'university rents' by Big Tech.

TL;DR: New SET-based backdoor attacks use stealthy, semantics-preserving code transformations, achieving high success rates and evading defenses, calling for new countermeasures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attack defenses focus on injection-based attacks, creating a false sense of security; SET-based attacks exploit semantics-preserving transformations for stealth.

Method: A framework for generating Semantically-Equivalent Transformation (SET)-based backdoor triggers, tested across five tasks, six languages, and models like CodeBERT, CodeT5, and StarCoder.

Result: SET-based attacks achieve >90% success rates, evade defenses with detection rates ~25.13% lower than injection-based attacks, and normalization countermeasures offer only partial mitigation.

Conclusion: SET-based backdoor attacks demonstrate high success rates and stealthiness, evading current defenses, highlighting the need for tailored countermeasures.

Abstract: Neural code models have been increasingly incorporated into software development processes. However, their susceptibility to backdoor attacks presents a significant security risk. The state-of-the-art understanding focuses on injection-based attacks, which insert anomalous patterns into software code. These attacks can be neutralized by standard sanitization techniques. This status quo may lead to a false sense of security regarding backdoor attacks. In this paper, we introduce a new kind of backdoor attacks, dubbed Semantically-Equivalent Transformation (SET)-based backdoor attacks, which use semantics-preserving low-prevalence code transformations to generate stealthy triggers. We propose a framework to guide the generation of such triggers. Our experiments across five tasks, six languages, and models like CodeBERT, CodeT5, and StarCoder show that SET-based attacks achieve high success rates (often >90%) while preserving model utility. The attack proves highly stealthy, evading state-of-the-art defenses with detection rates on average over 25.13% lower than injection-based counterparts. We evaluate normalization-based countermeasures and find they offer only partial mitigation, confirming the attack's robustness. These results motivate further investigation into scalable defenses tailored to SET-based attacks.

Motivation: 代码变更影响分析通常耗时且手动进行，AI尤其是LLMs在此领域的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 构建包含种子变更、变更对和变更类型的数据集，并在两种配置下评估LLMs：1) 种子变更信息和父提交树；2) 种子变更信息、父提交树和每个种子变更的diff hunk。

Result: 两种LLMs在实验中表现不佳，GPT-5优于GPT-5-mini；提供diff hunks能略微提升性能。

Conclusion: GPT-5和GPT-5-mini在预测代码变更影响方面表现不佳，但GPT-5优于GPT-5-mini。提供diff hunks能略微提升模型性能。

Abstract: Understanding source code changes and their impact on other code entities is a crucial skill in software development. However, the analysis of code changes and their impact is often performed manually and therefore is time-consuming. Recent advancements in AI, and in particular large language models (LLMs) show promises to help developers in various code analysis tasks. However, the extent to which this potential can be utilized for understanding code changes and their impact is underexplored. To address this gap, we study the capabilities of GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini to predict the code entities impacted by given source code changes. We construct a dataset containing information about seed-changes, change pairs, and change types for each commit. Existing datasets lack crucial information about seed changes and impacted code entities. Our experiments evaluate the LLMs in two configurations: (1) seed-change information and the parent commit tree and (2) seed-change information, the parent commit tree, and the diff hunk of each seed change. We found that both LLMs perform poorly in the two experiments, whereas GPT-5 outperforms GPT-5-mini. Furthermore, the provision of the diff hunks helps both models to slightly improve their performance.

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了编程语言之间的深层语言学关系，并提出了三种利用这些关系优化多语言代码LLM训练的策略，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of diverse programming languages presents both opportunities and challenges for developing multilingual code LLMs. While existing techniques often train code LLMs by simply aggregating multilingual code data, few explore the deeper relationships between programming languages(PLs) and how such relationships can be utilized to optimize the training and inference of code LLMs. In this work, we investigate 2 fundamental questions: 1) What are the deep linguistic relationships among PLs? and 2) How can these relationships be leveraged to improve multilingual code LLMs? We propose an embedding-based framework to uncover the latent families of PLs. Our approach begins by defining 21 primary linguistic features of programming languages, such as variable definition, control structures, and method declarations, and then employs LLMs to generate feature-aligned code samples across multiple languages. By embedding these semantically parallel code snippets from 19 languages, we construct a similarity matrix and perform hierarchical clustering to uncover inherent language relationships. Our analysis reveals clear hierarchical structures among programming languages. Closely related languages form well-defined clusters (e.g., C, C++, Java, and Swift group together), while Go exhibits as a central language with the highest cross-language similarity. Building on the uncovered language families, we propose three strategies to enhance multilingual LLM training: transfer learning across linguistically related languages, linguistic proximity-guided curriculum learning, and centroid-based intermediary code translation. Experiments on 4 code intelligence tasks demonstrate that our methods significantly improve multilingual LLM performance. This work offers a universal perspective on programming languages and advances more effective strategies for multilingual code LLM training.

Motivation: 探讨生成式AI工具如何支持科学编程，并识别潜在风险，特别是对经验不足的用户。

Method: 通过对868名科学家的调查，分析了生成式AI工具的采用模式、偏好以及与感知生产力相关的因素。

Result: 采用率在学生和经验不足的程序员中最高，且普遍偏好通用对话式工具（如ChatGPT）。经验不足与较少使用开发实践（如测试、代码审查）与更高感知生产力相关，但两者存在交互作用。感知生产力的最强预测因素是每次接受的生成代码行数。

Conclusion: 研究发现，科学家在使用生成式AI编程时可能更关注代码生成而非验证，这引发了关于研究代码完整性的担忧。

Abstract: Programming is essential to modern scientific research, yet most scientists report inadequate training for the software development their work demands. Generative AI tools capable of code generation may support scientific programmers, but user studies indicate risks of over-reliance, particularly among inexperienced users. We surveyed 868 scientists who program, examining adoption patterns, tool preferences, and factors associated with perceived productivity. Adoption is highest among students and less experienced programmers, with variation across fields. Scientific programmers overwhelmingly prefer general-purpose conversational interfaces like ChatGPT over developer-specific tools. Both inexperience and limited use of development practices (like testing, code review, and version control) are associated with greater perceived productivity-but these factors interact, suggesting formal practices may partially compensate for inexperience. The strongest predictor of perceived productivity is the number of lines of generated code typically accepted at once. These findings suggest scientific programmers using generative AI may gauge productivity by code generation rather than validation, raising concerns about research code integrity.

Motivation: 现有介电弹性体致动器（DEA）驱动的软体机器人通常需要高电压和有线连接，限制了其在狭窄环境中的应用。

Method: 采用双致动夹层结构，包含四层介电弹性体，通过旋涂和双轴拉伸工艺将每层厚度减至8微米，并开发了全面的设计和建模框架以优化性能。

Result: 实验表明，裸TS-DEA在共振频率下运动速度达12.36毫米/秒，无束缚配置下运动速度为0.5毫米/秒。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种无束缚的薄型软体机器人（UTS-Robot），通过薄型介电弹性体致动器（TS-DEA）实现低电压驱动，适用于狭窄和复杂环境中的导航。

Abstract: Thin dielectric elastomer actuator (DEA) features a unique in-plane configuration, enabling low-profile designs capable of accessing millimetre-scale narrow spaces. However, most existing DEA-powered soft robots require high voltages and wired power connections, limiting their ability to operate in confined environments. This study presents an untethered thin soft robot (UTS-Robot) powered by thin dielectric elastomer actuators (TS-DEA). The robot measures 38 mm in length, 6 mm in height, and weighs just 2.34 grams, integrating flexible onboard electronics to achieve fully untethered actuation. The TS-DEA, operating at resonant frequencies of 86 Hz under a low driving voltage of 220 V, adopts a dual-actuation sandwiched structure, comprising four dielectric elastomer layers bonded to a compressible tensioning mechanism at its core. This design enables high power density actuation and locomotion via three directional friction pads. The low-voltage actuation is achieved by fabricating each elastomer layer via spin coating to an initial thickness of 50 um, followed by biaxial stretching to 8 um. A comprehensive design and modelling framework has been developed to optimise TS-DEA performance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the bare TS-DEA achieves a locomotion speed of 12.36 mm/s at resonance, the untethered configuration achieves a locomotion speed of 0.5 mm/s, making it highly suitable for navigating confined and complex environments.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的多模态框架在跨传感器和跨环境条件下表现出强大的鲁棒性，适用于多媒体社交机器人。

Abstract: Service robots in public spaces require real-time understanding of human behavioral intentions for natural interaction. We present a practical multimodal framework for frame-accurate human-robot interaction intent detection that fuses camera-invariant 2D skeletal pose and facial emotion features extracted from monocular RGB video. Unlike prior methods requiring RGB-D sensors or GPU acceleration, our approach resource-constrained embedded hardware (Raspberry Pi 5, CPU-only). To address the severe class imbalance in natural human-robot interaction datasets, we introduce a novel approach to synthesize temporally coherent pose-emotion-label sequences for data re-balancing called MINT-RVAE (Multimodal Recurrent Variational Autoencoder for Intent Sequence Generation). Comprehensive offline evaluations under cross-subject and cross-scene protocols demonstrate strong generalization performance, achieving frame- and sequence-level AUROC of 0.95. Crucially, we validate real-world generalization through cross-camera evaluation on the MIRA robot head, which employs a different onboard RGB sensor and operates in uncontrolled environments not represented in the training data. Despite this domain shift, the deployed system achieves 91% accuracy and 100% recall across 32 live interaction trials. The close correspondence between offline and deployed performance confirms the cross-sensor and cross-environment robustness of the proposed multimodal approach, highlighting its suitability for ubiquitous multimedia-enabled social robots.

Motivation: 解决长时程机器人任务中由于连续状态-动作空间和稀疏反馈导致的困难，通过符号世界模型分解任务为离散谓词。

Method: UniPred采用双层学习框架，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）提出谓词效应分布，并通过低层数据监督神经谓词学习，同时通过学习反馈迭代优化LLM假设。

Result: 在五个模拟和一个真实机器人领域中，UniPred的成功率比自上而下方法高2-4倍，学习速度比自下而上方法快3-4倍。

Conclusion: UniPred通过结合自上而下和自下而上的方法，显著提高了机器人任务的执行效率和成功率，为机器人领域提供了可扩展且灵活的符号世界建模方法。

Abstract: Long-horizon robotic tasks are hard due to continuous state-action spaces and sparse feedback. Symbolic world models help by decomposing tasks into discrete predicates that capture object properties and relations. Existing methods learn predicates either top-down, by prompting foundation models without data grounding, or bottom-up, from demonstrations without high-level priors. We introduce UniPred, a bilevel learning framework that unifies both. UniPred uses large language models (LLMs) to propose predicate effect distributions that supervise neural predicate learning from low-level data, while learned feedback iteratively refines the LLM hypotheses. Leveraging strong visual foundation model features, UniPred learns robust predicate classifiers in cluttered scenes. We further propose a predicate evaluation method that supports symbolic models beyond STRIPS assumptions. Across five simulated and one real-robot domains, UniPred achieves 2-4 times higher success rates than top-down methods and 3-4 times faster learning than bottom-up approaches, advancing scalable and flexible symbolic world modeling for robotics.

Abstract: The robotics field is evolving towards data-driven, end-to-end learning, inspired by multimodal large models. However, reliance on expensive real-world data limits progress. Simulators offer cost-effective alternatives, but the gap between simulation and reality challenges effective policy transfer. This paper introduces TwinAligner, a novel Real2Sim2Real system that addresses both visual and dynamic gaps. The visual alignment module achieves pixel-level alignment through SDF reconstruction and editable 3DGS rendering, while the dynamic alignment module ensures dynamic consistency by identifying rigid physics from robot-object interaction. TwinAligner improves robot learning by providing scalable data collection and establishing a trustworthy iterative cycle, accelerating algorithm development. Quantitative evaluations highlight TwinAligner's strong capabilities in visual and dynamic real-to-sim alignment. This system enables policies trained in simulation to achieve strong zero-shot generalization to the real world. The high consistency between real-world and simulated policy performance underscores TwinAligner's potential to advance scalable robot learning. Code and data will be released on https://twin-aligner.github.io

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable progress in robotic manipulation by mapping multimodal observations and instructions directly to actions. However, they typically mimic expert trajectories without predictive motion reasoning, which limits their ability to reason about what actions to take. To address this limitation, we propose joint learning with motion image diffusion, a novel strategy that enhances VLA models with motion reasoning capabilities. Our method extends the VLA architecture with a dual-head design: while the action head predicts action chunks as in vanilla VLAs, an additional motion head, implemented as a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), predicts optical-flow-based motion images that capture future dynamics. The two heads are trained jointly, enabling the shared VLM backbone to learn representations that couple robot control with motion knowledge. This joint learning builds temporally coherent and physically grounded representations without modifying the inference pathway of standard VLAs, thereby maintaining test-time latency. Experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that joint learning with motion image diffusion improves the success rate of pi-series VLAs to 97.5% on the LIBERO benchmark and 58.0% on the RoboTwin benchmark, yielding a 23% improvement in real-world performance and validating its effectiveness in enhancing the motion reasoning capability of large-scale VLAs.

Abstract: Recent progress in robot learning has been driven by large-scale datasets and powerful visuomotor policy architectures, yet policy robustness remains limited by the substantial cost of collecting diverse demonstrations, particularly for spatial generalization in manipulation tasks. To reduce repetitive data collection, we present Real2Edit2Real, a framework that generates new demonstrations by bridging 3D editability with 2D visual data through a 3D control interface. Our approach first reconstructs scene geometry from multi-view RGB observations with a metric-scale 3D reconstruction model. Based on the reconstructed geometry, we perform depth-reliable 3D editing on point clouds to generate new manipulation trajectories while geometrically correcting the robot poses to recover physically consistent depth, which serves as a reliable condition for synthesizing new demonstrations. Finally, we propose a multi-conditional video generation model guided by depth as the primary control signal, together with action, edge, and ray maps, to synthesize spatially augmented multi-view manipulation videos. Experiments on four real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate that policies trained on data generated from only 1-5 source demonstrations can match or outperform those trained on 50 real-world demonstrations, improving data efficiency by up to 10-50x. Moreover, experimental results on height and texture editing demonstrate the framework's flexibility and extensibility, indicating its potential to serve as a unified data generation framework.

Conclusion: 跨模态对齐和指令调优比模型规模更重要，而空间和时间推理是可靠具身能力的首要瓶颈。

Abstract: Vision-language navigation requires agents to reason and act under constraints of embodiment. While vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate strong generalization, current benchmarks provide limited understanding of how embodiment -- i.e., the choice of physical platform, sensor configuration, and modality alignment -- influences perception, reasoning, and control. We introduce Embodied4C, a closed-loop benchmark designed as a Turing test for embodied reasoning. The benchmark evaluates the core embodied capabilities of VLMs across three heterogeneous embodiments -- autonomous vehicles, aerial drones, and robotic manipulators -- through approximately 1.1K one-shot reasoning questions and 58 goal-directed navigation tasks. These tasks jointly assess four foundational dimensions: semantic, spatial, temporal, and physical reasoning. Each embodiment presents dynamic sensor configurations and environment variations to probe generalization beyond platform-specific adaptation. To prevent embodiment overfitting, Embodied4C integrates domain-far queries targeting abstract and cross-context reasoning. Comprehensive evaluation across ten state-of-the-art VLMs and four embodied control baselines shows that cross-modal alignment and instruction tuning matter more than scale, while spatial and temporal reasoning remains the primary bottleneck for reliable embodied competence.

Abstract: We present a system for learning generalizable hand-object tracking controllers purely from synthetic data, without requiring any human demonstrations. Our approach makes two key contributions: (1) HOP, a Hand-Object Planner, which can synthesize diverse hand-object trajectories; and (2) HOT, a Hand-Object Tracker that bridges synthetic-to-physical transfer through reinforcement learning and interaction imitation learning, delivering a generalizable controller conditioned on target hand-object states. Our method extends to diverse object shapes and hand morphologies. Through extensive evaluations, we show that our approach enables dexterous hands to track challenging, long-horizon sequences including object re-arrangement and agile in-hand reorientation. These results represent a significant step toward scalable foundation controllers for manipulation that can learn entirely from synthetic data, breaking the data bottleneck that has long constrained progress in dexterous manipulation.

Abstract: Zoomorphic Socially Assistive Robots (SARs) offer an alternative source of social touch for individuals who cannot access animal companionship. However, current SARs provide only limited, passive touch-based interactions and lack the rich haptic cues, such as warmth, heartbeat or purring, that are characteristic of human-animal touch. This limits their ability to evoke emotionally engaging, life-like physical interactions.
  We present a multimodal tactile prototype, which was used to augment the established PARO robot, integrating thermal and vibrotactile feedback to simulate feeling biophysiological signals. A flexible heating interface delivers body-like warmth, while embedded actuators generate heartbeat-like rhythms and continuous purring sensations. These cues were iteratively designed and calibrated with input from users and haptics experts. We outline the design process and offer reproducible guidelines to support the development of emotionally resonant and biologically plausible touch interactions with SARs.

Abstract: Robotically steerable compliant surgical tools offer several advantages over rigid tools, including enhanced dexterity, reduced tissue damage, and the ability to generate non-linear trajectories in minimally invasive neurosurgical procedures. Many existing robotic neurosurgical tools are designed using stainless steel or nitinol materials. Using polymer-based materials instead can offer advantages such as reduced interference in magnetic resonance imaging, enhanced safety for guiding electrically powered instruments, and reduced tissue damage due to inherent compliance. Several polymer materials have been used in robotic surgical applications, such as polyimide, polycarbonate, and elastic resin. Various fabrication strategies have also been proposed, including standard microfabrication techniques, thermal drawing, and 3-D printing. In our previous work, a tendon-driven, notched-tube was designed for several neurosurgical robotic tools, utilizing laser micromachining to reduce the stiffness of the tube in certain directions. This fabrication method is desirable because it has a single-step process, has high precision, and does not require a cleanroom or harsh chemicals. Past studies have explored laser-micromachining of polymer material for surgical applications such as stent fabrication. In this work, we explore extending the use of the laser micromachining approach to the fabrication of polyimide (PI) robotically steerable cannulas for neurosurgical applications. Utilizing the method presented in this work, we fabricated joints as small as 1.5 mm outer diameter (OD). Multiple joints were fabricated using PI tubes of different ODs, and the loading behavior of the fabricated joints was experimentally characterized.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) has shown immense promise in enabling autonomous dexterous manipulation, including learning surgical tasks. To fully unlock the potential of IL for surgery, access to clinical datasets is needed, which unfortunately lack the kinematic data required for current IL approaches. A promising source of large-scale surgical demonstrations is monocular surgical videos available online, making monocular pose estimation a crucial step toward enabling large-scale robot learning. Toward this end, we propose SurgiPose, a differentiable rendering based approach to estimate kinematic information from monocular surgical videos, eliminating the need for direct access to ground truth kinematics. Our method infers tool trajectories and joint angles by optimizing tool pose parameters to minimize the discrepancy between rendered and real images. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments on two robotic surgical tasks: tissue lifting and needle pickup, using the da Vinci Research Kit Si (dVRK Si). We train imitation learning policies with both ground truth measured kinematics and estimated kinematics from video and compare their performance. Our results show that policies trained on estimated kinematics achieve comparable success rates to those trained on ground truth data, demonstrating the feasibility of using monocular video based kinematic estimation for surgical robot learning. By enabling kinematic estimation from monocular surgical videos, our work lays the foundation for large scale learning of autonomous surgical policies from online surgical data.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of global mortality, with minimally invasive treatment options offered through endovascular interventions. However, the precision and adaptability of current robotic systems for endovascular navigation are limited by heuristic control, low autonomy, and the absence of haptic feedback. This thesis presents an integrated AI-driven framework for autonomous guidewire navigation in complex vascular environments, addressing key challenges in data availability, simulation fidelity, and navigational accuracy.
  A high-fidelity, real-time simulation platform, CathSim, is introduced for reinforcement learning based catheter navigation, featuring anatomically accurate vascular models and contact dynamics. Building on CathSim, the Expert Navigation Network is developed, a policy that fuses visual, kinematic, and force feedback for autonomous tool control. To mitigate data scarcity, the open-source, bi-planar fluoroscopic dataset Guide3D is proposed, comprising more than 8,700 annotated images for 3D guidewire reconstruction. Finally, SplineFormer, a transformer-based model, is introduced to directly predict guidewire geometry as continuous B-spline parameters, enabling interpretable, real-time navigation.
  The findings show that combining high-fidelity simulation, multimodal sensory fusion, and geometric modelling substantially improves autonomous endovascular navigation and supports safer, more precise minimally invasive procedures.

Abstract: Identifying the leader within a robotic swarm is crucial, especially in adversarial contexts where leader concealment is necessary for mission success. This work introduces the interactive Swarm Leader Identification (iSLI) problem, a novel approach where an adversarial probing agent identifies a swarm's leader by physically interacting with its members. We formulate the iSLI problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and employ Deep Reinforcement Learning, specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to train the prober's policy. The proposed approach utilizes a novel neural network architecture featuring a Timed Graph Relationformer (TGR) layer combined with a Simplified Structured State Space Sequence (S5) model. The TGR layer effectively processes graph-based observations of the swarm, capturing temporal dependencies and fusing relational information using a learned gating mechanism to generate informative representations for policy learning. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our TGR-based model outperforms baseline graph neural network architectures and exhibits significant zero-shot generalization capabilities across varying swarm sizes and speeds different from those used during training. The trained prober achieves high accuracy in identifying the leader, maintaining performance even in out-of-training distribution scenarios, and showing appropriate confidence levels in its predictions. Real-world experiments with physical robots further validate the approach, confirming successful sim-to-real transfer and robustness to dynamic changes, such as unexpected agent disconnections.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的优化框架能够仅需单个数据集即可准确重建速度，并生成紧凑且可解释的协同作用。

Abstract: Identifying motor synergies -- coordinated hand joint patterns activated at task-dependent time shifts -- from kinematic data is central to motor control and robotics. Existing two-stage methods first extract candidate waveforms (via SVD) and then select shifted templates using sparse optimization, requiring at least two datasets and complicating data collection. We introduce an optimization-based framework that jointly learns a small set of synergies and their sparse activation coefficients. The formulation enforces group sparsity for synergy selection and element-wise sparsity for activation timing. We develop an alternating minimization method in which coefficient updates decouple across tasks and synergy updates reduce to regularized least-squares problems. Our approach requires only a single data set, and simulations show accurate velocity reconstruction with compact, interpretable synergies.

Abstract: Trajectory planning is a fundamental yet challenging component of autonomous driving. End-to-end planners frequently falter under adverse weather, unpredictable human behavior, or complex road layouts, primarily because they lack strong generalization or few-shot capabilities beyond their training data. We propose LLaViDA, a Large Language Vision Driving Assistant that leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for object motion prediction, semantic grounding, and chain-of-thought reasoning for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. A two-stage training pipeline--supervised fine-tuning followed by Trajectory Preference Optimization (TPO)--enhances scene understanding and trajectory planning by injecting regression-based supervision, produces a powerful "VLM Trajectory Planner for Autonomous Driving." On the NuScenes benchmark, LLaViDA surpasses state-of-the-art end-to-end and other recent VLM/LLM-based baselines in open-loop trajectory planning task, achieving an average L2 trajectory error of 0.31 m and a collision rate of 0.10% on the NuScenes test set.

Abstract: With the popularity of drone technologies, aerial photography have become prevalent in many daily scenarios such as environment monitoring, structure inspection, law enforcement etc. A central challenge in this domain is the efficient coverage of a target area with photographs that can entirely capture the region, while respecting constraints such as the image resolution, and limited number of pictures that can be taken. This work investigates the computational complexity of several fundamental problems arised from this challenge. By abstracting the aerial photography problem into the coverage problems in computational geometry, we demonstrate that most of these problems are in fact computationally intractable, with the implication that traditional algorithms cannot solve them efficiently. The intuitions of this work can extend beyond aerial photography to broader applications such as pesticide spraying, and strategic sensor placement.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new Reinforcement Learning (RL) based control architecture for quadrotors. With the literature focusing on controlling the four rotors' RPMs directly, this paper aims to control the quadrotor's thrust vector. The RL agent computes the percentage of overall thrust along the quadrotor's z-axis along with the desired Roll ($φ$) and Pitch ($θ$) angles. The agent then sends the calculated control signals along with the current quadrotor's Yaw angle ($ψ$) to an attitude PID controller. The PID controller then maps the control signals to motor RPMs. The Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, a model-free off-policy stochastic RL algorithm, was used to train the RL agents. Training results show the faster training time of the proposed thrust vector controller in comparison to the conventional RPM controllers. Simulation results show smoother and more accurate path-following for the proposed thrust vector controller.

Abstract: This paper explores the impact of dynamic entropy tuning in Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms that train a stochastic policy. Its performance is compared against algorithms that train a deterministic one. Stochastic policies optimize a probability distribution over actions to maximize rewards, while deterministic policies select a single deterministic action per state. The effect of training a stochastic policy with both static entropy and dynamic entropy and then executing deterministic actions to control the quadcopter is explored. It is then compared against training a deterministic policy and executing deterministic actions. For the purpose of this research, the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm was chosen for the stochastic algorithm while the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) was chosen for the deterministic algorithm. The training and simulation results show the positive effect the dynamic entropy tuning has on controlling the quadcopter by preventing catastrophic forgetting and improving exploration efficiency.

Abstract: While imitation learning has shown impressive results in single-task robot manipulation, scaling it to multi-task settings remains a fundamental challenge due to issues such as suboptimal demonstrations, trajectory noise, and behavioral multi-modality. Existing skill-based methods attempt to address this by decomposing actions into reusable abstractions, but they often rely on fixed-length segmentation or environmental priors that limit semantic consistency and cross-task generalization. In this work, we propose AtomSkill, a novel multi-task imitation learning framework that learns and leverages a structured Atomic Skill Space for composable robot manipulation. Our approach is built on two key technical contributions. First, we construct a Semantically Grounded Atomic Skill Library by partitioning demonstrations into variable-length skills using gripper-state keyframe detection and vision-language model annotation. A contrastive learning objective ensures the resulting skill embeddings are both semantically consistent and temporally coherent. Second, we propose an Action Generation module with Keypose Imagination, which jointly predicts a skill's long-horizon terminal keypose and its immediate action sequence. This enables the policy to reason about overarching motion goals and fine-grained control simultaneously, facilitating robust skill chaining. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world environments show that AtomSkill consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: AOMGen框架通过合成多样化且物理状态验证的训练数据，显著提升了VLA策略在未见过的物体和布局上的成功率，从0%提升至88.7%。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) and world-model methods have improved generalization in tasks such as robotic manipulation and object interaction. However, Successful execution of such tasks depends on large, costly collections of real demonstrations, especially for fine-grained manipulation of articulated objects. To address this, we present AOMGen, a scalable data generation framework for articulated manipulation which is instantiated from a single real scan, demonstration and a library of readily available digital assets, yielding photoreal training data with verified physical states. The framework synthesizes synchronized multi-view RGB temporally aligned with action commands and state annotations for joints and contacts, and systematically varies camera viewpoints, object styles, and object poses to expand a single execution into a diverse corpus. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning VLA policies on AOMGen data increases the success rate from 0% to 88.7%, and the policies are tested on unseen objects and layouts.

TL;DR: EED Gym是一个标准化测试平台，用于评估机器人在安全和社会期望之间的平衡，研究发现解释性拒绝和动作屏蔽对维持信任和消除不安全行为有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人需要在安全和社会期望之间取得平衡，因为盲目服从可能导致伤害，而过度拒绝会削弱信任。现有的安全强化学习基准主要关注物理危险，而人机交互信任研究规模小且难以复现。

Method: 提出了Empathic Ethical Disobedience (EED) Gym，一个标准化的测试平台，用于联合评估拒绝安全和社交可接受性。代理在决定服从、拒绝（带或不带解释）、澄清或提出更安全替代方案时，权衡风险、情感和信任。

Result: EED Gym提供了不同场景、多种角色配置以及安全、校准和拒绝的度量标准，信任和责备模型基于小规模研究。

Conclusion: 研究发现，动作屏蔽可以有效消除不安全服从行为，而解释性拒绝有助于维持信任。构建性风格被认为最值得信赖，同理心风格被认为最具同理心，安全强化学习方法提高了鲁棒性，但也使代理更容易过度谨慎。

Abstract: Robots must balance compliance with safety and social expectations as blind obedience can cause harm, while over-refusal erodes trust. Existing safe reinforcement learning (RL) benchmarks emphasize physical hazards, while human-robot interaction trust studies are small-scale and hard to reproduce. We present the Empathic Ethical Disobedience (EED) Gym, a standardized testbed that jointly evaluates refusal safety and social acceptability. Agents weigh risk, affect, and trust when choosing to comply, refuse (with or without explanation), clarify, or propose safer alternatives. EED Gym provides different scenarios, multiple persona profiles, and metrics for safety, calibration, and refusals, with trust and blame models grounded in a vignette study. Using EED Gym, we find that action masking eliminates unsafe compliance, while explanatory refusals help sustain trust. Constructive styles are rated most trustworthy, empathic styles -- most empathic, and safe RL methods improve robustness but also make agents more prone to overly cautious behavior. We release code, configurations, and reference policies to enable reproducible evaluation and systematic human-robot interaction research on refusal and trust. At submission time, we include an anonymized reproducibility package with code and configs, and we commit to open-sourcing the full repository after the paper is accepted.

Motivation: 为了解决现有VLA模型依赖抽象潜在动态或将推理委托给语言组件的问题，STORM旨在通过显式视觉推演实现可解释和前瞻驱动的决策。

Method: STORM整合了扩散基础的VLA策略、生成视频世界模型和MCTS搜索，通过视觉推演和前瞻评估进行决策。

Result: 在SimplerEnv基准测试中，STORM以51.0%的平均成功率刷新了记录，显著提升了时空保真度和任务相关性，Frechet视频距离减少了75%以上。

Conclusion: STORM通过结合扩散动作生成、条件视频预测和基于搜索的规划，实现了在机器人操作中的时空推理新突破，展示了搜索引导生成世界模型在长时程操作中的优势。

Abstract: We present STORM (Search-Guided Generative World Models), a novel framework for spatio-temporal reasoning in robotic manipulation that unifies diffusion-based action generation, conditional video prediction, and search-based planning. Unlike prior Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models that rely on abstract latent dynamics or delegate reasoning to language components, STORM grounds planning in explicit visual rollouts, enabling interpretable and foresight-driven decision-making. A diffusion-based VLA policy proposes diverse candidate actions, a generative video world model simulates their visual and reward outcomes, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) selectively refines plans through lookahead evaluation. Experiments on the SimplerEnv manipulation benchmark demonstrate that STORM achieves a new state-of-the-art average success rate of 51.0 percent, outperforming strong baselines such as CogACT. Reward-augmented video prediction substantially improves spatio-temporal fidelity and task relevance, reducing Frechet Video Distance by over 75 percent. Moreover, STORM exhibits robust re-planning and failure recovery behavior, highlighting the advantages of search-guided generative world models for long-horizon robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: 该论文强调了基于模型和数据驱动方法在自动驾驶模拟和基准测试中的互补优势。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic benchmarking of the model-based microscopic traffic simulator SUMO against state-of-the-art data-driven traffic simulators using large-scale real-world datasets. Using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and the Waymo Open Sim Agents Challenge (WOSAC), we evaluate SUMO under both short-horizon (8s) and long-horizon (60s) closed-loop simulation settings. To enable scalable evaluation, we develop Waymo2SUMO, an automated pipeline that converts WOMD scenarios into SUMO simulations. On the WOSAC benchmark, SUMO achieves a realism meta metric of 0.653 while requiring fewer than 100 tunable parameters. Extended rollouts show that SUMO maintains low collision and offroad rates and exhibits stronger long-horizon stability than representative data-driven simulators. These results highlight complementary strengths of model-based and data-driven approaches for autonomous driving simulation and benchmarking.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving models that take only camera images as input and directly predict a future trajectory are appealing for their computational efficiency and potential for improved generalization via unified optimization; however, persistent failure modes remain due to reliance on imitation learning (IL). While online reinforcement learning (RL) could mitigate IL-induced issues, the computational burden of neural rendering-based simulation and large E2E networks renders iterative reward and hyperparameter tuning costly. We introduce a camera-only E2E offline RL framework that performs no additional exploration and trains solely on a fixed simulator dataset. Offline RL offers strong data efficiency and rapid experimental iteration, yet is susceptible to instability from overestimation on out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address this, we construct pseudo ground-truth trajectories from expert driving logs and use them as a behavior regularization signal, suppressing imitation of unsafe or suboptimal behavior while stabilizing value learning. Training and closed-loop evaluation are conducted in a neural rendering environment learned from the public nuScenes dataset. Empirically, the proposed method achieves substantial improvements in collision rate and route completion compared with IL baselines. Our code will be available at [URL].

Abstract: Enhancing the performance of trajectory planners for lane - changing vehicles is one of the key challenges in autonomous driving within human - machine mixed traffic. Most existing studies have not incorporated human drivers' prior knowledge when designing trajectory planning models. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel trajectory planning framework that integrates causal prior knowledge into the control process. Both longitudinal and lateral microscopic behaviors of vehicles are modeled to quantify interaction risk, and a staged causal graph is constructed to capture causal dependencies in lane-changing scenarios. Causal effects between the lane-changing vehicle and surrounding vehicles are then estimated using causal inference, including average causal effects (ATE) and conditional average treatment effects (CATE). These causal priors are embedded into a model predictive control (MPC) framework to enhance trajectory planning. The proposed approach is validated on naturalistic vehicle trajectory datasets. Experimental results show that: (1) causal inference provides interpretable and stable quantification of vehicle interactions; (2) individual causal effects reveal driver heterogeneity; and (3) compared with the baseline MPC, the proposed method achieves a closer alignment with human driving behaviors, reducing maximum trajectory deviation from 1.2 m to 0.2 m, lateral velocity fluctuation by 60%, and yaw angle variability by 50%. These findings provide methodological support for human-like trajectory planning and practical value for improving safety, stability, and realism in autonomous vehicle testing and traffic simulation platforms.

Abstract: Stroke-induced motor impairment often results in substantial loss of upper-limb function, creating a strong demand for rehabilitation robots that enable safe and transparent physical human-robot interaction (pHRI). Variable stiffness actuators are well suited for such applications. However, in most existing designs, stiffness is coupled with the deflection angle, complicating both modeling and control. To address this limitation, this paper presents a variable stiffness actuator featuring decoupled stiffness and output behavior for rehabilitation robotics. The system integrates a variable stiffness mechanism that combines a variable-length lever with a hypocycloidal straight-line mechanism to achieve a linear torque-deflection relationship and continuous stiffness modulation from near zero to theoretically infinite. It also incorporates a differential transmission mechanism based on a planetary gear system that enables dual-motor load sharing. A cascade PI controller is further developed on the basis of the differential configuration, in which the position-loop term jointly regulates stiffness and deflection angle, effectively suppressing stiffness fluctuations and output disturbances. The performance of prototype was experimentally validated through stiffness calibration, stiffness regulation, torque control, decoupled characteristics, and dual-motor load sharing, indicating the potential for rehabilitation exoskeletons and other pHRI systems.

Conclusion: 提出的轨迹规划框架有效生成了安全、高效且平滑的轨迹，尤其在受限环境中表现优异。

Abstract: Four-wheel Independent Steering (4WIS) vehicles have attracted increasing attention for their superior maneuverability. Human drivers typically choose to cross or drive over the low-profile obstacles (e.g., plastic bags) to efficiently navigate through narrow spaces, while existing planners neglect obstacle attributes, causing inefficiency or path-finding failures. To address this, we propose a trajectory planning framework integrating the 4WIS hybrid A* and Optimal Control Problem (OCP), in which the hybrid A* provides an initial path to enhance the OCP solution. Specifically, a multimodal classification network is introduced to assess scene complexity (hard/easy task) by fusing image and vehicle state data. For hard tasks, guided points are set to decompose complex tasks into local subtasks, improving the search efficiency of 4WIS hybrid A*. The multiple steering modes of 4WIS vehicles (Ackermann, diagonal, and zero-turn) are also incorporated into node expansion and heuristic designs. Moreover, a hierarchical obstacle handling strategy is designed to guide the node expansion considering obstacle attributes, i.e., 'non-traversable', 'crossable', and 'drive-over' obstacles. It allows crossing or driving over obstacles instead of the 'avoid-only' strategy, greatly enhancing success rates of pathfinding. We also design a logical constraint for the 'drive-over' obstacle by limiting its velocity to ensure safety. Furthermore, to address dynamic obstacles with motion uncertainty, we introduce a probabilistic risk field model, constructing risk-aware driving corridors that serve as linear collision constraints in OCP. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed framework's effectiveness in generating safe, efficient, and smooth trajectories for 4WIS vehicles, especially in constrained environments.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) can reduce interaction cost for autonomous driving by learning a predictive world model, but it typically still depends on task-specific rewards that are difficult to design and often brittle under distribution shift. This paper presents InDRiVE, a DreamerV3-style MBRL agent that performs reward-free pretraining in CARLA using only intrinsic motivation derived from latent ensemble disagreement. Disagreement acts as a proxy for epistemic uncertainty and drives the agent toward under-explored driving situations, while an imagination-based actor-critic learns a planner-free exploration policy directly from the learned world model. After intrinsic pretraining, we evaluate zero-shot transfer by freezing all parameters and deploying the pretrained exploration policy in unseen towns and routes. We then study few-shot adaptation by training a task policy with limited extrinsic feedback for downstream objectives (lane following and collision avoidance). Experiments in CARLA across towns, routes, and traffic densities show that disagreement-based pretraining yields stronger zero-shot robustness and robust few-shot collision avoidance under town shift and matched interaction budgets, supporting the use of intrinsic disagreement as a practical reward-free pretraining signal for reusable driving world models.

Abstract: In this paper, we study whether inexpensive, physics-free supervision can reliably prioritize grasp-place candidates for budget-aware pick-and-place. From an object's initial pose, target pose, and a candidate grasp, we generate two path-aware geometric labels: path-wise inverse kinematics (IK) feasibility across a fixed approach-grasp-lift waypoint template, and a transit collision flag from mesh sweeps along the same template. A compact dual-output MLP learns these signals from pose encodings, and at test time its scores rank precomputed candidates for a rank-then-plan policy under the same IK gate and planner as the baseline. Although learned from cheap labels only, the scores transfer to physics-enabled executed trajectories: at a fixed planning budget the policy finds successful paths sooner with fewer planner calls while keeping final success on par or better. This work targets a single rigid cuboid with side-face grasps and a fixed waypoint template, and we outline extensions to varied objects and richer waypoint schemes.

Abstract: Quadruped mobile manipulators offer strong potential for agile loco-manipulation but remain difficult to control and transfer reliably from simulation to reality. Reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise for whole-body control, yet most frameworks are proprietary and hard to reproduce on real hardware. We present an open pipeline for training, benchmarking, and deploying RL-based controllers on the Unitree B1 quadruped with a Z1 arm. The framework unifies sim-to-sim and sim-to-real transfer through ROS, re-implementing a policy trained in Isaac Gym, extending it to MuJoCo via a hardware abstraction layer, and deploying the same controller on physical hardware. Sim-to-sim experiments expose discrepancies between Isaac Gym and MuJoCo contact models that influence policy behavior, while real-world teleoperated object-picking trials show that coordinated whole-body control extends reach and improves manipulation over floating-base baselines. The pipeline provides a transparent, reproducible foundation for developing and analyzing RL-based loco-manipulation controllers and will be released open source to support future research.

Abstract: In this study, we address the problem of open-vocabulary mobile manipulation, where a robot is required to carry a wide range of objects to receptacles based on free-form natural language instructions. This task is challenging, as it involves understanding visual semantics and the affordance of manipulation actions. To tackle these challenges, we propose Affordance RAG, a zero-shot hierarchical multimodal retrieval framework that constructs Affordance-Aware Embodied Memory from pre-explored images. The model retrieves candidate targets based on regional and visual semantics and reranks them with affordance scores, allowing the robot to identify manipulation options that are likely to be executable in real-world environments. Our method outperformed existing approaches in retrieval performance for mobile manipulation instruction in large-scale indoor environments. Furthermore, in real-world experiments where the robot performed mobile manipulation in indoor environments based on free-form instructions, the proposed method achieved a task success rate of 85%, outperforming existing methods in both retrieval performance and overall task success.

Abstract: Autonomous buses run on fixed routes but must operate in open, dynamic urban environments. Disengagement events on these routes are often geographically concentrated and typically arise from planner failures in highly interactive regions. Such policy-level failures are difficult to correct using conventional imitation learning, which easily overfits to sparse disengagement data. To address this issue, this paper presents a Disengagement-Triggered Contrastive Continual Learning (DTCCL) framework that enables autonomous buses to improve planning policies through real-world operation. Each disengagement triggers cloud-based data augmentation that generates positive and negative samples by perturbing surrounding agents while preserving route context. Contrastive learning refines policy representations to better distinguish safe and unsafe behaviors, and continual updates are applied in a cloud-edge loop without human supervision. Experiments on urban bus routes demonstrate that DTCCL improves overall planning performance by 48.6 percent compared with direct retraining, validating its effectiveness for scalable, closed-loop policy improvement in autonomous public transport.

Motivation: 尽管现有研究主要集中在地面机器人或户外无人机，但室内无人机视觉语言导航（VLN）在实际应用中（如检查、交付和搜救）的重要性尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 通过从Habitat模拟器中选取多样化的3D室内场景，模拟真实的无人机飞行动态，并采用数据增强技术收集多样化的3D导航轨迹。设计了自动标注流程，为每条轨迹生成不同粒度的自然语言指令。此外，还开发了IndoorUAV-Agent导航模型，利用任务分解和多模态推理。

Conclusion: IndoorUAV旨在成为室内空中导航领域视觉语言具身AI研究的宝贵资源。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) enables agents to navigate in complex environments by following natural language instructions grounded in visual observations. Although most existing work has focused on ground-based robots or outdoor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), indoor UAV-based VLN remains underexplored, despite its relevance to real-world applications such as inspection, delivery, and search-and-rescue in confined spaces. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{IndoorUAV}, a novel benchmark and method specifically tailored for VLN with indoor UAVs. We begin by curating over 1,000 diverse and structurally rich 3D indoor scenes from the Habitat simulator. Within these environments, we simulate realistic UAV flight dynamics to collect diverse 3D navigation trajectories manually, further enriched through data augmentation techniques. Furthermore, we design an automated annotation pipeline to generate natural language instructions of varying granularity for each trajectory. This process yields over 16,000 high-quality trajectories, comprising the \textbf{IndoorUAV-VLN} subset, which focuses on long-horizon VLN. To support short-horizon planning, we segment long trajectories into sub-trajectories by selecting semantically salient keyframes and regenerating concise instructions, forming the \textbf{IndoorUAV-VLA} subset. Finally, we introduce \textbf{IndoorUAV-Agent}, a novel navigation model designed for our benchmark, leveraging task decomposition and multimodal reasoning. We hope IndoorUAV serves as a valuable resource to advance research on vision-language embodied AI in the indoor aerial navigation domain.

Method: EGM整合了四种核心设计：基于箱的跨运动课程自适应采样策略、复合解耦专家混合架构（CDMoE）、数据质量与多样性的关键洞察，以及三阶段课程训练流程。

Result: 尽管仅训练了4.08小时的数据，EGM在49.25小时的测试运动中表现稳健，在常规和高动态任务上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: EGM框架通过其核心设计和三阶段课程训练流程，显著提升了运动跟踪策略的泛化能力和鲁棒性，即便在数据量有限的情况下也能在广泛测试中优于基线方法。

Abstract: Learning a general motion tracking policy from human motions shows great potential for versatile humanoid whole-body control. Conventional approaches are not only inefficient in data utilization and training processes but also exhibit limited performance when tracking highly dynamic motions. To address these challenges, we propose EGM, a framework that enables efficient learning of a general motion tracking policy. EGM integrates four core designs. Firstly, we introduce a Bin-based Cross-motion Curriculum Adaptive Sampling strategy to dynamically orchestrate the sampling probabilities based on tracking error of each motion bin, eficiently balancing the training process across motions with varying dificulty and durations. The sampled data is then processed by our proposed Composite Decoupled Mixture-of-Experts (CDMoE) architecture, which efficiently enhances the ability to track motions from different distributions by grouping experts separately for upper and lower body and decoupling orthogonal experts from shared experts to separately handle dedicated features and general features. Central to our approach is a key insight we identified: for training a general motion tracking policy, data quality and diversity are paramount. Building on these designs, we develop a three-stage curriculum training flow to progressively enhance the policy's robustness against disturbances. Despite training on only 4.08 hours of data, EGM generalized robustly across 49.25 hours of test motions, outperforming baselines on both routine and highly dynamic tasks.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles faces key challenges from limited onboard computational resources, which restrict deployed deep neural networks to shallow architectures incapable of handling complex environments. Offloading tasks to remote edge servers introduces high latency, creating an inherent trade-off in system design. To address these limitations, we propose CoDrone - the first cloud-edge-end collaborative computing framework integrating foundation models into autonomous UAV cruising scenarios - effectively leveraging foundation models to enhance performance of resource-constrained unmanned aerial vehicle platforms. To reduce onboard computation and data transmission overhead, CoDrone employs grayscale imagery for the navigation model. When enhanced environmental perception is required, CoDrone leverages the edge-assisted foundation model Depth Anything V2 for depth estimation and introduces a novel one-dimensional occupancy grid-based navigation method - enabling fine-grained scene understanding while advancing efficiency and representational simplicity of autonomous navigation. A key component of CoDrone is a Deep Reinforcement Learning-based neural scheduler that seamlessly integrates depth estimation with autonomous navigation decisions, enabling real-time adaptation to dynamic environments. Furthermore, the framework introduces a UAV-specific vision language interaction module incorporating domain-tailored low-level flight primitives to enable effective interaction between the cloud foundation model and the UAV. The introduction of VLM enhances open-set reasoning capabilities in complex unseen scenarios. Experimental results show CoDrone outperforms baseline methods under varying flight speeds and network conditions, achieving a 40% increase in average flight distance and a 5% improvement in average Quality of Navigation.

Conclusion: WorldRFT通过分层规划分解和局部感知交互细化机制，结合强化学习微调（RFT），显著提升了自动驾驶策略的安全性和性能，在nuScenes和NavSim基准测试中达到了最先进水平。

Abstract: Latent World Models enhance scene representation through temporal self-supervised learning, presenting a perception annotation-free paradigm for end-to-end autonomous driving. However, the reconstruction-oriented representation learning tangles perception with planning tasks, leading to suboptimal optimization for planning. To address this challenge, we propose WorldRFT, a planning-oriented latent world model framework that aligns scene representation learning with planning via a hierarchical planning decomposition and local-aware interactive refinement mechanism, augmented by reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RFT) to enhance safety-critical policy performance. Specifically, WorldRFT integrates a vision-geometry foundation model to improve 3D spatial awareness, employs hierarchical planning task decomposition to guide representation optimization, and utilizes local-aware iterative refinement to derive a planning-oriented driving policy. Furthermore, we introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which applies trajectory Gaussianization and collision-aware rewards to fine-tune the driving policy, yielding systematic improvements in safety. WorldRFT achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both open-loop nuScenes and closed-loop NavSim benchmarks. On nuScenes, it reduces collision rates by 83% (0.30% -> 0.05%). On NavSim, using camera-only sensors input, it attains competitive performance with the LiDAR-based SOTA method DiffusionDrive (87.8 vs. 88.1 PDMS).

Abstract: Bridging the gap between natural language commands and autonomous execution in unstructured environments remains an open challenge for robotics. This requires robots to perceive and reason over the current task scene through multiple modalities, and to plan their behaviors to achieve their intended goals. Traditional robotic task-planning approaches often struggle to bridge low-level execution with high-level task reasoning, and cannot dynamically update task strategies when instructions change during execution, which ultimately limits their versatility and adaptability to new tasks. In this work, we propose a novel language model-based framework for dynamic robot task planning. Our Vision-Language-Policy (VLP) model, based on a vision-language model fine-tuned on real-world data, can interpret semantic instructions and integrate reasoning over the current task scene to generate behavior policies that control the robot to accomplish the task. Moreover, it can dynamically adjust the task strategy in response to changes in the task, enabling flexible adaptation to evolving task requirements. Experiments conducted with different robots and a variety of real-world tasks show that the trained model can efficiently adapt to novel scenarios and dynamically update its policy, demonstrating strong planning autonomy and cross-embodiment generalization.

Conclusion: HinFlow方法通过在线交互和事后标注显著提升了低级策略的性能，并在跨体现视频数据上展示了可扩展和可迁移的机器人学习潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in hierarchical robot systems leverage a high-level planner to propose task plans and a low-level policy to generate robot actions. This design allows training the planner on action-free or even non-robot data sources (e.g., videos), providing transferable high-level guidance. Nevertheless, grounding these high-level plans into executable actions remains challenging, especially with the limited availability of high-quality robot data. To this end, we propose to improve the low-level policy through online interactions. Specifically, our approach collects online rollouts, retrospectively annotates the corresponding high-level goals from achieved outcomes, and aggregates these hindsight-relabeled experiences to update a goal-conditioned imitation policy. Our method, Hindsight Flow-conditioned Online Imitation (HinFlow), instantiates this idea with 2D point flows as the high-level planner. Across diverse manipulation tasks in both simulation and physical world, our method achieves more than $2\times$ performance improvement over the base policy, significantly outperforming the existing methods. Moreover, our framework enables policy acquisition from planners trained on cross-embodiment video data, demonstrating its potential for scalable and transferable robot learning.

Abstract: Collecting large-scale naturalistic driving data is essential for training robust autonomous driving planners. However, real-world datasets often contain a substantial amount of repetitive and low-value samples, which lead to excessive storage costs and bring limited benefits to policy learning. To address this issue, we propose an information-theoretic data pruning method that effectively reduces the training data volume without compromising model performance. Our approach evaluates the trajectory distribution information entropy of driving data and iteratively selects high-value samples that preserve the statistical characteristics of the original dataset in a model-agnostic manner. From a theoretical perspective, we show that maximizing trajectory entropy effectively constrains the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the pruned subset and the original data distribution, thereby maintaining generalization ability. Comprehensive experiments on the NuPlan benchmark with a large-scale imitation learning framework demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce the dataset size by up to 40% while maintaining closed-loop performance. This work provides a lightweight and theoretically grounded approach for scalable data management and efficient policy learning in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Robot manipulation, a key capability of embodied AI, has turned to data-driven generative policy frameworks, but mainstream approaches like Diffusion Models suffer from high inference latency and Flow-based Methods from increased architectural complexity. While simply applying meanFlow on robotic tasks achieves single-step inference and outperforms FlowPolicy, it lacks few-shot generalization due to fixed temperature hyperparameters in its Dispersive Loss and misaligned predicted-true mean velocities. To solve these issues, this study proposes an improved MeanFlow-based Policies: we introduce a lightweight Cosine Loss to align velocity directions and use the Differential Derivation Equation (DDE) to optimize the Jacobian-Vector Product (JVP) operator. Experiments on Adroit and Meta-World tasks show the proposed method outperforms MP1 and FlowPolicy in average success rate, especially in challenging Meta-World tasks, effectively enhancing few-shot generalization and trajectory accuracy of robot manipulation policies while maintaining real-time performance, offering a more robust solution for high-precision robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Embodied robotic AI systems designed to manage complex daily tasks rely on a task planner to understand and decompose high-level tasks. While most research focuses on enhancing the task-understanding abilities of LLMs/VLMs through fine-tuning or chain-of-thought prompting, this paper argues that defining the planned skill set is equally crucial. To handle the complexity of daily environments, the skill set should possess a high degree of generalization ability. Empirically, more abstract expressions tend to be more generalizable. Therefore, we propose to abstract the planned result as a set of meta-actions. Each meta-action comprises three components: {move/rotate, end-effector status change, relationship with the environment}. This abstraction replaces human-centric concepts, such as grasping or pushing, with the robot's intrinsic functionalities. As a result, the planned outcomes align seamlessly with the complete range of actions that the robot is capable of performing. Furthermore, to ensure that the LLM/VLM accurately produces the desired meta-action format, we employ the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, which leverages a database of human-annotated planning demonstrations to facilitate in-context learning. As the system successfully completes more tasks, the database will self-augment to continue supporting diversity. The meta-action set and its integration with RAG are two novel contributions of our planner, denoted as MaP-AVR, the meta-action planner for agents composed of VLM and RAG. To validate its efficacy, we design experiments using GPT-4o as the pre-trained LLM/VLM model and OmniGibson as our robotic platform. Our approach demonstrates promising performance compared to the current state-of-the-art method. Project page: https://map-avr.github.io/.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models empower robots to understand and execute tasks described by natural language instructions. However, a key challenge lies in their ability to generalize beyond the specific environments and conditions they were trained on, which is presently difficult and expensive to evaluate in the real-world. To address this gap, we present REALM, a new simulation environment and benchmark designed to evaluate the generalization capabilities of VLA models, with a specific emphasis on establishing a strong correlation between simulated and real-world performance through high-fidelity visuals and aligned robot control. Our environment offers a suite of 15 perturbation factors, 7 manipulation skills, and more than 3,500 objects. Finally, we establish two task sets that form our benchmark and evaluate the π_{0}, π_{0}-FAST, and GR00T N1.5 VLA models, showing that generalization and robustness remain an open challenge. More broadly, we also show that simulation gives us a valuable proxy for the real-world and allows us to systematically probe for and quantify the weaknesses and failure modes of VLAs.

Conclusion: LIMOncello是一个实时性能稳定、内存增长可控的开源系统，适用于几何稀疏环境，并在多个真实数据集上展示了其竞争性精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This work introduces LIMOncello, a tightly coupled LiDAR-Inertial Odometry system that models 6-DoF motion on the $\mathrm{SGal}(3)$ manifold within an iterated error-state Kalman filter backend. Compared to state representations defined on $\mathrm{SO}(3)\times\mathbb{R}^6$, the use of $\mathrm{SGal}(3)$ provides a coherent and numerically stable discrete-time propagation model that helps limit drift in low-observability conditions.
  LIMOncello also includes a lightweight incremental i-Octree mapping backend that enables faster updates and substantially lower memory usage than incremental kd-tree style map structures, without relying on locality-restricted search heuristics. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that LIMOncello achieves competitive accuracy while improving robustness in geometrically sparse environments. The system maintains real-time performance with stable memory growth and is released as an extensible open-source implementation at https://github.com/CPerezRuiz335/LIMOncello.

Conclusion: AI-based attitude controller在真实卫星上表现出稳健性能，优于传统PD控制器。

Abstract: Attitude control is essential for many satellite missions. Classical controllers, however, are time-consuming to design and sensitive to model uncertainties and variations in operational boundary conditions. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising alternative by learning adaptive control strategies through autonomous interaction with a simulation environment. Overcoming the Sim2Real gap, which involves deploying an agent trained in simulation onto the real physical satellite, remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present the first successful in-orbit demonstration of an AI-based attitude controller for inertial pointing maneuvers. The controller was trained entirely in simulation and deployed to the InnoCube 3U nanosatellite, which was developed by the Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg in cooperation with the Technische Universität Berlin, and launched in January 2025. We present the AI agent design, the methodology of the training procedure, the discrepancies between the simulation and the observed behavior of the real satellite, and a comparison of the AI-based attitude controller with the classical PD controller of InnoCube. Steady-state metrics confirm the robust performance of the AI-based controller during repeated in-orbit maneuvers.

Conclusion: LoGoPlanner通过端到端设计显著减少了累积误差，提升了规划一致性和避障能力，比基线方法提高了27.3%，并在不同环境和实体中表现出强泛化能力。

Abstract: Trajectory planning in unstructured environments is a fundamental and challenging capability for mobile robots. Traditional modular pipelines suffer from latency and cascading errors across perception, localization, mapping, and planning modules. Recent end-to-end learning methods map raw visual observations directly to control signals or trajectories, promising greater performance and efficiency in open-world settings. However, most prior end-to-end approaches still rely on separate localization modules that depend on accurate sensor extrinsic calibration for self-state estimation, thereby limiting generalization across embodiments and environments. We introduce LoGoPlanner, a localization-grounded, end-to-end navigation framework that addresses these limitations by: (1) finetuning a long-horizon visual-geometry backbone to ground predictions with absolute metric scale, thereby providing implicit state estimation for accurate localization; (2) reconstructing surrounding scene geometry from historical observations to supply dense, fine-grained environmental awareness for reliable obstacle avoidance; and (3) conditioning the policy on implicit geometry bootstrapped by the aforementioned auxiliary tasks, thereby reducing error propagation.We evaluate LoGoPlanner in both simulation and real-world settings, where its fully end-to-end design reduces cumulative error while metric-aware geometry memory enhances planning consistency and obstacle avoidance, leading to more than a 27.3\% improvement over oracle-localization baselines and strong generalization across embodiments and environments. The code and models have been made publicly available on the \href{https://steinate.github.io/logoplanner.github.io/}{project page}.

Abstract: Modern large language model (LLM) systems increasingly rely on multi-turn pipelines that are composed of multiple task-specific adapters, yet existing serving frameworks remain inefficient, incurring substantial recomputation overhead when switching between adapters. We present the first LLM serving engine that supports cross-model prefix cache reuse between base and adapted models via Activated LoRA (aLoRA), enabling efficient and fine-grained adapter switching during inference. Our design extends the vLLM framework by introducing base-aligned block hashing and activation-aware masking within the model execution path, permitting cache reuse across models while preserving compatibility with existing serving engine optimizations. Integrated into a production-grade inference stack, this approach supports dynamic adapter activation without excessive key-value tensor recomputation. Evaluation across representative multi-turn, multi-adapter pipelines demonstrates up to 58x end-to-end latency reduction and over 100x time-to-first-token improvement relative to standard LoRA baselines, with benefits that scale with model size and sequence length and manifest across all stages of the request lifecycle. This work bridges parameter-efficient model adaptation with high-performance serving, providing the first complete realization of cross-model KV-cache reuse in modern LLM inference engines.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have enabled sophisticated multi-agent architectures for healthcare, where large language models power collaborative clinical decision-making. However, these distributed systems face critical challenges in ensuring message integrity and fault tolerance when operating in adversarial or untrusted environments.This paper presents a novel Byzantine fault-tolerant multi-agent system specifically designed for healthcare applications, integrating gossip-based message propagation with cryptographic validation mechanisms. Our system employs specialized AI agents for diagnosis, treatment planning, emergency response, and data analysis, coordinated through a Byzantine consensus protocol that tolerates up to f faulty nodes among n = 3f + 1 total nodes. We implement a gossip protocol for decentralized message dissemination, achieving consensus with 2f + 1 votes while maintaining system operation even under Byzantine failures. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully validates medical messages with cryptographic signatures, prevents replay attacks through timestamp validation, and maintains consensus accuracy of 100% with up to 33% Byzantine nodes. The system provides real-time visualization of consensus rounds, vote tallies, and network topology, enabling transparent monitoring of fault-tolerant operations. This work contributes a practical framework for building secure, resilient healthcare multi-agent systems capable of collaborative medical decision-making in untrusted environments.

Abstract: Quantum computing offers new ways to explore the theory of computation via the laws of quantum mechanics. Due to the rising demand for quantum computing resources, there is growing interest in developing cloud-based quantum resource sharing platforms that enable researchers to test and execute their algorithms on real quantum hardware. These cloud-based systems face a fundamental challenge in efficiently allocating quantum hardware resources to fulfill the growing computational demand of modern Internet of Things (IoT) applications. So far, attempts have been made in order to make efficient resource allocation, ranging from heuristic-based solutions to machine learning. In this work, we employ quantum reinforcement learning based on parameterized quantum circuits to address the resource allocation problem to support large IoT networks. We propose a python-based toolkit called QAISim for the simulation and modeling of Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI) models for designing resource management policies in quantum cloud environments. We have simulated policy gradient and Deep Q-Learning algorithms for reinforcement learning. QAISim exhibits a substantial reduction in model complexity compared to its classical counterparts with fewer trainable variables.

Abstract: Digital twins (DTs) can enable precision healthcare by continually learning a mathematical representation of patient-specific dynamics. However, mission critical healthcare applications require fast, resource-efficient DT learning, which is often infeasible with existing model recovery (MR) techniques due to their reliance on iterative solvers and high compute/memory demands. In this paper, we present a general DT learning framework that is amenable to acceleration on reconfigurable hardware such as FPGAs, enabling substantial speedup and energy efficiency. We compare our FPGA-based implementation with a multi-processing implementation in mobile GPU, which is a popular choice for AI in edge devices. Further, we compare both edge AI implementations with cloud GPU baseline. Specifically, our FPGA implementation achieves an 8.8x improvement in \text{performance-per-watt} for the MR task, a 28.5x reduction in DRAM footprint, and a 1.67x runtime speedup compared to cloud GPU baselines. On the other hand, mobile GPU achieves 2x better performance per watts but has 2x increase in runtime and 10x more DRAM footprint than FPGA. We show the usage of this technique in DT guided synthetic data generation for Type 1 Diabetes and proactive coronary artery disease detection.

Abstract: Digital twinning enables real-time simulation and predictive modeling by maintaining a continuously updated virtual representation of a physical system. In mission-critical applications, such as mid-air collision avoidance, these models must operate online with extremely low latency to ensure safety. However, executing complex Model Recovery (MR) pipelines on edge devices is limited by computational and memory bandwidth constraints. This paper introduces a fast, FPGA-accelerated digital twinning framework that offloads key neural components, including gated recurrent units (GRU) and dense layers, to reconfigurable hardware for efficient parallel execution. Our system achieves real-time responsiveness, operating five times faster than typical human reaction time, and demonstrates the practical viability of deploying digital twins on edge platforms for time-sensitive, safety-critical environments.

Conclusion: ACE-Sync 提供了一种可扩展、通信高效且能保持准确性的解决方案，适用于大规模云边缘分布式模型训练。

Abstract: Large-scale deep learning models impose substantial communication overh ead in distributed training, particularly in bandwidth-constrained or heterogeneous clo ud-edge environments. Conventional synchronous or fixed-compression techniques o ften struggle to balance communication cost, convergence stability, and model accura cy. To address these challenges, we propose ACE-Sync, an Adaptive Cloud-Edge Sy nchronization Framework that integrates (1) an attention-based gradient importance p redictor, (2) a differentiated parameter compression strategy, and (3) a hierarchical cl oud-edge coordination mechanism. ACE-Sync dynamically selects which parameter groups to synchronize and determines appropriate compression levels under per-devic e bandwidth budgets. A knapsack-based optimization strategy is adopted to maximize important gradient preservation while reducing redundant communication. Furthermo re, residual-based error compensation and device clustering ensure long-term converg ence and cross-device personalization. Experiments show that ACE-Sync substantiall y reduces communication overhead while maintaining competitive accuracy. Compar ed with FullSync, ACE-Sync lowers communication cost from 112.5 GB to 44.7 GB (a 60% reduction) and shortens convergence from 41 to 39 epochs. Despite aggressiv e communication reduction, ACE-Sync preserves high model quality, achieving 82. 1% Top-1 accuracy-only 0.3% below the full-synchronization baseline-demonstrating its efficiency and scalability for large-scale distributed training. These results indicate that ACE-Sync provides a scalable, communication-efficient, and accuracy-preservin g solution for large-scale cloud-edge distributed model training.

TL;DR: TraCT利用CXL共享内存优化LLM服务的KV传输和缓存，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RDMA的分散式LLM服务架构在KV传输上存在瓶颈，随着模型规模和上下文长度的增加，KV传输成为性能的主要限制因素。

Method: TraCT采用CXL共享内存技术，通过直接读写KV块，避免了传统RDMA的网络瓶颈，并提出了两层级节点间同步机制等软件解决方案。

Result: 实验表明，TraCT在静态和合成工作负载下，平均TTFT降低9.8倍，P99延迟降低6.2倍，峰值吞吐量提升1.6倍。

Conclusion: TraCT通过CXL共享内存作为KV传输和缓存的基础设施，显著提升了LLM服务的性能，减少了TTFT和延迟，并提高了吞吐量。

Abstract: Disaggregated LLM serving improves resource efficiency by separating the compute-intensive prefill phase from the latency-critical decode phase. However, this architecture introduces a fundamental bottleneck: key/value (KV) tensors generated during prefill must be transferred to decode workers, and existing systems rely on RDMA-based network paths for this exchange. As model sizes and context lengths increase, KV transfer dominates both time-to-first-token (TTFT) and peak throughput, and remains highly sensitive to network contention even when prefix reuse is high. This paper presents TraCT, a rack-scale LLM serving system that uses CXL shared memory as both a KV-transfer substrate and a rack-wide prefix-aware KV cache. TraCT enables GPUs to write and read KV blocks directly through CXL load/store and DMA operations, eliminating the NIC hop that constrains existing disaggregated pipelines. However, to realize this design, multiple new challenges such as synchronization, consistency, and data management on non-coherent CXL memory need to be addressed. TraCT proposes various software solutions such as the two-tier inter-node synchronization mechanism to address these challenges. We implement TraCT on the Dynamo LLM inference framework and show that, across static and synthetic workloads, TraCT reduces average TTFT by up to 9.8x, lowers P99 latency by up to 6.2x, and improves peak throughput by up to 1.6x compared to RDMA and DRAM-based caching baselines.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新颖的GPU解决方案，用于顶点覆盖问题，通过检测图分裂为组件并独立分支处理，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Algorithms for finding minimum or bounded vertex covers in graphs use a branch-and-reduce strategy, which involves exploring a highly imbalanced search tree. Prior GPU solutions assign different thread blocks to different sub-trees, while using a shared worklist to balance the load. However, these prior solutions do not scale to large and complex graphs because their unawareness of when the graph splits into components causes them to solve these components redundantly. Moreover, their high memory footprint limits the number of workers that can execute concurrently. We propose a novel GPU solution for vertex cover problems that detects when a graph splits into components and branches on the components independently. Although the need to aggregate the solutions of different components introduces non-tail-recursive branches which interfere with load balancing, we overcome this challenge by delegating the post-processing to the last descendant of each branch. We also reduce the memory footprint by reducing the graph and inducing a subgraph before exploring the search tree. Our solution substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art GPU solution, finishing in seconds when the state-of-the-art solution exceeds 6 hours. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to parallelize non-tail-recursive branching patterns on GPUs in a load balanced manner.

TL;DR: Remoe是一种针对无服务器计算的异构MoE推理系统，通过优化专家模块分配和激活预测，显著降低推理成本和冷启动延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE架构在大型语言模型中因其通过稀疏专家激活扩展模型能力而成为主流，但大量专家导致内存密集型参数缓存和高推理成本。无服务器计算的弹性与按使用付费特性适合部署MoE，但现有方法难以通过简单模型分区解决输入依赖的专家激活问题。

Method: Remoe将非专家模块分配给GPU，专家模块分配给CPU，并进一步将不常激活的专家卸载到单独的无服务器函数中。系统结合了三种关键技术：相似提示搜索（SPS）、主模型预分配（MMP）以及基于拉格朗日对偶和最长处理时间（LPT）算法的联合内存和副本优化框架。

Result: 实验结果表明，Remoe在多个LLM基准测试中表现优异，推理成本降低高达57%，冷启动延迟减少47%。

Conclusion: Remoe通过异构MoE推理系统在无服务器计算中显著降低了推理成本和冷启动延迟，相比现有基线分别减少了57%和47%。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a dominant architecture in large language models (LLMs) due to its ability to scale model capacity via sparse expert activation. Meanwhile, serverless computing, with its elasticity and pay-per-use billing, is well-suited for deploying MoEs with bursty workloads. However, the large number of experts in MoE models incurs high inference costs due to memory-intensive parameter caching. These costs are difficult to mitigate via simple model partitioning due to input-dependent expert activation. To address these issues, we propose Remoe, a heterogeneous MoE inference system tailored for serverless computing. Remoe assigns non-expert modules to GPUs and expert modules to CPUs, and further offloads infrequently activated experts to separate serverless functions to reduce memory overhead and enable parallel execution. We incorporate three key techniques: (1) a Similar Prompts Searching (SPS) algorithm to predict expert activation patterns based on semantic similarity of inputs; (2) a Main Model Pre-allocation (MMP) algorithm to ensure service-level objectives (SLOs) via worst-case memory estimation; and (3) a joint memory and replica optimization framework leveraging Lagrangian duality and the Longest Processing Time (LPT) algorithm. We implement Remoe on Kubernetes and evaluate it across multiple LLM benchmarks. Experimental results show that Remoe reduces inference cost by up to 57% and cold start latency by 47% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: High-performance computing (HPC) workloads are becoming increasingly diverse, exhibiting wide variability in job characteristics, yet cluster scheduling has long relied on static, heuristic-based policies. In this work we present SchedTwin, a real-time digital twin designed to adaptively guide scheduling decisions using predictive simulation. SchedTwin periodically ingests runtime events from the physical scheduler, performs rapid what-if evaluations of multiple policies using a high-fidelity discrete-event simulator, and dynamically selects the one satisfying the administrator configured optimization goal. We implement SchedTwin as an open-source software and integrate it with the production PBS scheduler. Preliminary results show that SchedTwin consistently outperforms widely used static scheduling policies, while maintaining low overhead (a few seconds per scheduling cycle). These results demonstrate that real-time digital twins offer a practical and effective path toward adaptive HPC scheduling.

Conclusion: Murmura通过基于证据的深度学习框架，为去中心化联邦学习中的模型个性化提供了理论基础，显著减少了非独立同分布条件下的性能下降，并实现了快速收敛。

Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (DFL) enables collaborative model training across edge devices without centralized coordination, offering resilience against single points of failure. However, statistical heterogeneity arising from non-identically distributed local data creates a fundamental challenge: nodes must learn personalized models adapted to their local distributions while selectively collaborating with compatible peers. Existing approaches either enforce a single global model that fits no one well, or rely on heuristic peer selection mechanisms that cannot distinguish between peers with genuinely incompatible data distributions and those with valuable complementary knowledge. We present Murmura, a framework that leverages evidential deep learning to enable trust-aware model personalization in DFL. Our key insight is that epistemic uncertainty from Dirichlet-based evidential models directly indicates peer compatibility: high epistemic uncertainty when a peer's model evaluates local data reveals distributional mismatch, enabling nodes to exclude incompatible influence while maintaining personalized models through selective collaboration. Murmura introduces a trust-aware aggregation mechanism that computes peer compatibility scores through cross-evaluation on local validation samples and personalizes model aggregation based on evidential trust with adaptive thresholds. Evaluation on three wearable IoT datasets (UCI HAR, PAMAP2, PPG-DaLiA) demonstrates that Murmura reduces performance degradation from IID to non-IID conditions compared to baseline (0.9% vs. 19.3%), achieves 7.4$\times$ faster convergence, and maintains stable accuracy across hyperparameter choices. These results establish evidential uncertainty as a principled foundation for compatibility-aware personalization in decentralized heterogeneous environments.

Result: 在相同配置下，L4将端到端延迟降低达67%，尾部延迟降低达69%，系统吞吐量提升达2.89倍。

Conclusion: L4系统通过动态重新调度请求和长度专业化分组，显著提升了LLM服务的性能，减少了延迟并提高了吞吐量。

Abstract: Efficiently harnessing GPU compute is critical to improving user experience and reducing operational costs in large language model (LLM) services. However, current inference engine schedulers overlook the attention backend's sensitivity to request-length heterogeneity within a batch. As state-of-the-art models now support context windows exceeding 128K tokens, this once-tolerable inefficiency has escalated into a primary system bottleneck, causing severe performance degradation through GPU underutilization and increased latency. We present L4, a runtime system that dynamically reschedules requests across multiple instances serving the same LLM to mitigate per-instance length heterogeneity. L4 partitions these instances into length-specialized groups, each handling requests within a designated length range, naturally forming a pipeline as requests flow through them. L4 devises a dynamic programming algorithm to efficiently find the stage partition with the best QoE, employs runtime range refinement together with decentralized load (re)balance both across and within groups, achieving a balanced and efficient multi-instance service. Our evaluation shows that, under the same configuration, L4 reduces end-to-end latency by up to 67% and tail latency by up to 69%, while improving overall system throughput by up to 2.89 times compared to the state-of-the-art multi-instance scheduling systems.

Abstract: We study how the strongly sublinear MPC model relates to the classic, graph-centric distributed models, focusing on the Node-Capacitated Clique (NCC), a bandwidth-parametrized generalization of the Congested Clique. In MPC, $M$ machines with per-machine memory $S$ hold a partition of the input graph, in NCC, each node knows its full neighborhood but can send/receive only a bounded number of $C$ words per round. We are particularly interested in the strongly sublinear regime where $S=C=n^δ$ for some constant $0 < δ<1$.
  Our goal is determine when round-preserving simulations between these models are possible and when they are not, when total memory and total bandwidth $SM=nC$ in both models are matched, for different problem families and graph classes. On the positive side, we provide techniques that allow us to replicate the specific behavior regarding input representation, number of machines and local memory from one model to the other to obtain simulations with only constant overhead. On the negative side, we prove simulation impossibility results, which show that the limitations of our simulations are necessary.

Abstract: Recommender systems are enablers of personalized content delivery, and therefore revenue, for many large companies. In the last decade, deep learning recommender models (DLRMs) are the de-facto standard in this field. The main bottleneck in DLRM inference is the lookup of sparse features across huge embedding tables, which are usually partitioned across the aggregate RAM of many nodes. In state-of-the-art recommender systems, the distributed lookup is implemented via irregular all-to-all (alltoallv) communication, and often presents the main bottleneck. Today, most related work sees this operation as a given; in addition, every collective is synchronous in nature. In this work, we propose a novel bounded lag synchronous (BLS) version of the alltoallv operation. The bound can be a parameter allowing slower processes to lag behind entire iterations before the fastest processes block. In special applications such as inference-only DLRM, the accuracy of the application is fully preserved. We implement BLS alltoallv in a new PyTorch Distributed backend and evaluate it with a BLS version of the reference DLRM code. We show that for well balanced, homogeneous-access DLRM runs our BLS technique does not offer notable advantages. But for unbalanced runs, e.g. runs with strongly irregular embedding table accesses or with delays across different processes, our BLS technique improves both the latency and throughput of inference-only DLRM. In the best-case scenario, the proposed reduced synchronisation can mask the delays across processes altogether.
