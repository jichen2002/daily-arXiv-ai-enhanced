TL;DR: 利用预训练视频扩散模型从模糊图像恢复视频序列，揭示场景动态及前后可能事件，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 运动模糊图像虽然模糊了细节，但也编码了场景和相机运动的信息。现有方法依赖手工先验或网络架构，难以恢复复杂场景动态，且未尝试恢复图像拍摄前后的事件。

Method: 该方法重新利用了在互联网规模数据集上预训练的视频扩散模型，以从模糊图像中恢复视频序列，揭示场景动态。

Result: 该方法在恢复复杂场景动态方面优于现有技术，能够推广到真实场景图像，并支持下游任务如恢复相机轨迹、物体运动和动态3D场景结构。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新方法，利用预训练的视频扩散模型从运动模糊图像中恢复复杂的场景动态，包括捕捉瞬间及前后可能发生的事件。该方法在性能上优于现有技术，并能推广到具有挑战性的真实场景图像中。

Abstract: We seek to answer the question: what can a motion-blurred image reveal about a scene's past, present, and future? Although motion blur obscures image details and degrades visual quality, it also encodes information about scene and camera motion during an exposure. Previous techniques leverage this information to estimate a sharp image from an input blurry one, or to predict a sequence of video frames showing what might have occurred at the moment of image capture. However, they rely on handcrafted priors or network architectures to resolve ambiguities in this inverse problem, and do not incorporate image and video priors on large-scale datasets. As such, existing methods struggle to reproduce complex scene dynamics and do not attempt to recover what occurred before or after an image was taken. Here, we introduce a new technique that repurposes a pre-trained video diffusion model trained on internet-scale datasets to recover videos revealing complex scene dynamics during the moment of capture and what might have occurred immediately into the past or future. Our approach is robust and versatile; it outperforms previous methods for this task, generalizes to challenging in-the-wild images, and supports downstream tasks such as recovering camera trajectories, object motion, and dynamic 3D scene structure.

*Md Nahid Hasan Shuvo,Moinul Hossain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHANTOM是一种新型对抗攻击框架，利用变形艺术在CAV系统中制造视角依赖的对抗样本，揭示感知和通信层的严重漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CAV系统依赖先进的DNN和V2X通信，但仍易受物理对抗攻击，PHANTOM旨在揭示并利用这一漏洞。

Method: 利用变形艺术（anamorphic art）制作视角依赖的对抗样本，无需模型访问（黑盒设置），并在四种不同的检测器架构上验证了强迁移性。

Result: 在CARLA模拟环境中，PHANTOM在最佳条件下攻击成功率超过90%，在恶劣环境中仍保持60-80%的有效性，并引发网络级中断。

Conclusion: PHANTOM框架揭示了CAV生态系统在感知和通信层面的关键漏洞，强调了在现实环境中对抗性攻击的严重威胁。

Abstract: Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) rely on vision-based deep neural networks (DNNs) and low-latency (Vehicle-to-Everything) V2X communication to navigate safely and efficiently. Despite their advances, these systems remain vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce PHANTOM (PHysical ANamorphic Threats Obstructing connected vehicle Mobility), a novel framework for crafting and deploying perspective-dependent adversarial examples using \textit{anamorphic art}. PHANTOM exploits geometric distortions that appear natural to humans but are misclassified with high confidence by state-of-the-art object detectors. Unlike conventional attacks, PHANTOM operates in black-box settings without model access and demonstrates strong transferability across four diverse detector architectures (YOLOv5, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet). Comprehensive evaluation in CARLA across varying speeds, weather conditions, and lighting scenarios shows that PHANTOM achieves over 90\% attack success rate under optimal conditions and maintains 60-80\% effectiveness even in degraded environments. The attack activates within 6-10 meters of the target, providing insufficient time for safe maneuvering. Beyond individual vehicle deception, PHANTOM triggers network-wide disruption in CAV systems: SUMO-OMNeT++ co-simulation demonstrates that false emergency messages propagate through V2X links, increasing Peak Age of Information by 68-89\% and degrading safety-critical communication. These findings expose critical vulnerabilities in both perception and communication layers of CAV ecosystems.

*SaiKiran Tedla,Zhoutong Zhang,Xuaner Zhang,Shumian Xin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用视频扩散模型实现单张模糊图像的后捕捉对焦，生成高质量焦点堆栈，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动对焦系统常无法捕捉预期主体，用户常需在拍摄后调整焦点，因此需要一种有效的后捕捉对焦方法。

Method: 利用视频扩散模型，从单一模糊图像生成感知准确的焦点堆栈，表示为视频序列，实现交互式重新对焦。

Result: 该方法在感知质量和鲁棒性上均优于现有方法，并发布了大规模焦点堆栈数据集以支持未来研究。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于视频扩散模型的后捕捉对焦方法，显著提升了感知质量和鲁棒性，为日常摄影中的焦点编辑功能开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Focus is a cornerstone of photography, yet autofocus systems often fail to capture the intended subject, and users frequently wish to adjust focus after capture. We introduce a novel method for realistic post-capture refocusing using video diffusion models. From a single defocused image, our approach generates a perceptually accurate focal stack, represented as a video sequence, enabling interactive refocusing and unlocking a range of downstream applications. We release a large-scale focal stack dataset acquired under diverse real-world smartphone conditions to support this work and future research. Our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in both perceptual quality and robustness across challenging scenarios, paving the way for more advanced focus-editing capabilities in everyday photography.

### [4] [RANSAC Scoring Functions: Analysis and Reality Check](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19850)
*A. Shekhovtsov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文重新评估了几何模型评分方法，指出MAGSAC++虽表现最佳但推导有误，实验证明所有评分函数效果相同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视几何模型评分问题，以改进RANSAC在鲁棒几何拟合中的关键组件。

Method: 扩展了非鲁棒设置下的几何误差评分函数至球形噪声，并在鲁棒设置下考虑均匀分布异常值的混合模型，提出基于阈值的参数化方法。分析了MAGSAC++的推导与假设，并提出了实验评估方法。

Result: 发现MAGSAC++的推导不符合合理原则，其评分函数等同于高斯-均匀似然模型；实验表明所有评分函数性能相同。

Conclusion: 本研究对现有几何模型评分方法进行了全面回顾，指出MAGSAC++虽在现有基准测试中表现最佳，但其推导过程存在缺陷，且评分函数在数值上等同于简单的高斯-均匀似然模型。实验表明，所有评分函数性能相同，MAGSAC++并无优势。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of assigning a score (a quality of fit) to candidate geometric models -- one of the key components of RANSAC for robust geometric fitting. In a non-robust setting, the ``gold standard'' scoring function, known as the geometric error, follows from a probabilistic model with Gaussian noises. We extend it to spherical noises. In a robust setting, we consider a mixture with uniformly distributed outliers and show that a threshold-based parameterization leads to a unified view of likelihood-based and robust M-estimators and associated local optimization schemes.
  Next we analyze MAGSAC++ which stands out for two reasons. First, it achieves the best results according to existing benchmarks. Second, it makes quite different modeling assumptions and derivation steps. We discovered, however that the derivation does not correspond to sound principles and the resulting score function is in fact numerically equivalent to a simple Gaussian-uniform likelihood, a basic model within the proposed framework.
  Finally, we propose an experimental methodology for evaluating scoring functions: assuming either a large validation set, or a small random validation set in expectation. We find that all scoring functions, including using a learned inlier distribution, perform identically. In particular, MAGSAC++ score is found to be neither better performing than simple contenders nor less sensitive to the choice of the threshold hyperparameter.
  Our theoretical and experimental analysis thus comprehensively revisit the state-of-the-art, which is critical for any future research seeking to improve the methods or apply them to other robust fitting problems.

### [5] [HyGE-Occ: Hybrid View-Transformation with 3D Gaussian and Edge Priors for 3D Panoptic Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19871)
*Jong Wook Kim,Wonseok Roh,Ha Dam Baek,Pilhyeon Lee,Jonghyun Choi,Sangpil Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyGE-Occ通过混合视图变换和边缘先验，提升了3D全景占用预测的几何一致性和边界感知，实验效果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在保持精确几何和捕获3D实例空间范围方面存在不足，影响全景分离效果。

Method: HyGE-Occ采用混合视图变换分支，融合连续高斯深度表示和离散深度仓表示，同时从BEV特征中提取边缘图作为辅助信息。

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes数据集上，HyGE-Occ表现出卓越的3D几何推理能力，优于现有工作。

Conclusion: HyGE-Occ通过结合3D高斯和边缘先验的混合视图变换分支，显著提升了3D全景占用预测的几何一致性和边界感知能力，实验证明其在Occ3D-nuScenes数据集上优于现有方法。

Abstract: 3D Panoptic Occupancy Prediction aims to reconstruct a dense volumetric scene map by predicting the semantic class and instance identity of every occupied region in 3D space. Achieving such fine-grained 3D understanding requires precise geometric reasoning and spatially consistent scene representation across complex environments. However, existing approaches often struggle to maintain precise geometry and capture the precise spatial range of 3D instances critical for robust panoptic separation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce HyGE-Occ, a novel framework that leverages a hybrid view-transformation branch with 3D Gaussian and edge priors to enhance both geometric consistency and boundary awareness in 3D panoptic occupancy prediction. HyGE-Occ employs a hybrid view-transformation branch that fuses a continuous Gaussian-based depth representation with a discretized depth-bin formulation, producing BEV features with improved geometric consistency and structural coherence. In parallel, we extract edge maps from BEV features and use them as auxiliary information to learn edge cues. In our extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset, HyGE-Occ outperforms existing work, demonstrating superior 3D geometric reasoning.

### [6] [Widget2Code: From Visual Widgets to UI Code via Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19918)
*Houston H. Zhang,Tao Zhang,Baoze Lin,Yuanqi Xue,Yincheng Zhu,Huan Liu,Li Gu,Linfeng Ye,Ziqiang Wang,Xinxin Zuo,Yang Wang,Yuanhao Yu,Zhixiang Chi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Widget2Code任务，开发了结合感知与代码生成的基线方法（WidgetFactory），解决了widget生成代码的视觉保真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UI2Code研究主要关注网页和移动界面，忽略了紧凑、无上下文的微界面（如widget）。缺乏公开数据和标记，导致widget生成代码的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种联合方法，包括基于设计原则的组件组装、图标检索、可视化模块，以及WidgetFactory基础设施（含WidgetDSL和编译器）。

Result: 基准测试显示，通用MLLM优于专用UI2Code方法，但仍存在不可靠和视觉不一致问题。提出的基线方法显著提升了视觉保真度。

Conclusion: 本文提出了Widget2Code任务，并开发了一个联合提升感知理解和结构化代码生成的基线方法。通过WidgetFactory基础设施和WidgetDSL，显著提升了视觉保真度，为未来研究奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: User interface to code (UI2Code) aims to generate executable code that can faithfully reconstruct a given input UI. Prior work focuses largely on web pages and mobile screens, leaving app widgets underexplored. Unlike web or mobile UIs with rich hierarchical context, widgets are compact, context-free micro-interfaces that summarize key information through dense layouts and iconography under strict spatial constraints. Moreover, while (image, code) pairs are widely available for web or mobile UIs, widget designs are proprietary and lack accessible markup. We formalize this setting as the Widget-to-Code (Widget2Code) and introduce an image-only widget benchmark with fine-grained, multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. Benchmarking shows that although generalized multimodal large language models (MLLMs) outperform specialized UI2Code methods, they still produce unreliable and visually inconsistent code. To address these limitations, we develop a baseline that jointly advances perceptual understanding and structured code generation. At the perceptual level, we follow widget design principles to assemble atomic components into complete layouts, equipped with icon retrieval and reusable visualization modules. At the system level, we design an end-to-end infrastructure, WidgetFactory, which includes a framework-agnostic widget-tailored domain-specific language (WidgetDSL) and a compiler that translates it into multiple front-end implementations (e.g., React, HTML/CSS). An adaptive rendering module further refines spatial dimensions to satisfy compactness constraints. Together, these contributions substantially enhance visual fidelity, establishing a strong baseline and unified infrastructure for future Widget2Code research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeurAlign是一种深度学习框架，通过统一的体积和表面表示，实现了大脑MRI图像的联合配准，提高了准确性并显著加快了处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法分别处理体积和表面配准，导致不一致性限制了后续分析。

Method: 提出了一种深度学习框架NeurAlign，利用中间球坐标空间将解剖表面拓扑与体积解剖结构连接起来，实现一致且解剖学上准确的配准。

Result: 在多个实验中，NeurAlign在Dice分数上提高了7分，同时保持了规则的变形场，且比标准方法快得多。

Conclusion: NeurAlign通过统一的体积和表面表示，为大脑MRI图像的联合配准设定了新标准，具有更高的准确性、快速的推理和易用性。

Abstract: Accurate registration of brain MRI scans is fundamental for cross-subject analysis in neuroscientific studies. This involves aligning both the cortical surface of the brain and the interior volume. Traditional methods treat volumetric and surface-based registration separately, which often leads to inconsistencies that limit downstream analyses. We propose a deep learning framework, NeurAlign, that registers $3$D brain MRI images by jointly aligning both cortical and subcortical regions through a unified volume-and-surface-based representation. Our approach leverages an intermediate spherical coordinate space to bridge anatomical surface topology with volumetric anatomy, enabling consistent and anatomically accurate alignment. By integrating spherical registration into the learning, our method ensures geometric coherence between volume and surface domains. In a series of experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, our method consistently outperforms both classical and machine learning-based registration methods -- improving the Dice score by up to 7 points while maintaining regular deformation fields. Additionally, it is orders of magnitude faster than the standard method for this task, and is simpler to use because it requires no additional inputs beyond an MRI scan. With its superior accuracy, fast inference, and ease of use, NeurAlign sets a new standard for joint cortical and subcortical registration.

### [8] [Vehicle-centric Perception via Multimodal Structured Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19934)
*Wentao Wu,Xiao Wang,Chenglong Li,Jin Tang,Bin Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VehicleMAE-V2是一种新型车辆中心预训练大模型，通过结合对称性、轮廓和语义先验，显著提升了车辆感知任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在预训练中缺乏对车辆相关知识的有效学习，导致车辆中心感知任务的泛化能力不足。

Method: 设计了Symmetry-guided Mask Module (SMM)、Contour-guided Representation Module (CRM)和Semantics-guided Representation Module (SRM)，分别利用对称性、轮廓和语义先验指导掩码令牌重建。

Result: 在五个下游任务中，VehicleMAE-V2表现出卓越性能。

Conclusion: VehicleMAE-V2通过结合车辆对称性、轮廓和语义的先验知识，显著提升了车辆中心感知任务的性能，并在多个下游任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Vehicle-centric perception plays a crucial role in many intelligent systems, including large-scale surveillance systems, intelligent transportation, and autonomous driving. Existing approaches lack effective learning of vehicle-related knowledge during pre-training, resulting in poor capability for modeling general vehicle perception representations. To handle this problem, we propose VehicleMAE-V2, a novel vehicle-centric pre-trained large model. By exploring and exploiting vehicle-related multimodal structured priors to guide the masked token reconstruction process, our approach can significantly enhance the model's capability to learn generalizable representations for vehicle-centric perception. Specifically, we design the Symmetry-guided Mask Module (SMM), Contour-guided Representation Module (CRM) and Semantics-guided Representation Module (SRM) to incorporate three kinds of structured priors into token reconstruction including symmetry, contour and semantics of vehicles respectively. SMM utilizes the vehicle symmetry constraints to avoid retaining symmetric patches and can thus select high-quality masked image patches and reduce information redundancy. CRM minimizes the probability distribution divergence between contour features and reconstructed features and can thus preserve holistic vehicle structure information during pixel-level reconstruction. SRM aligns image-text features through contrastive learning and cross-modal distillation to address the feature confusion caused by insufficient semantic understanding during masked reconstruction. To support the pre-training of VehicleMAE-V2, we construct Autobot4M, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 4 million vehicle images and 12,693 text descriptions. Extensive experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the superior performance of VehicleMAE-V2.

*Mozes Jacobs,Thomas Fel,Richard Hakim,Alessandra Brondetta,Demba Ba,T. Andy Keller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViTs在深度计算中展现出循环结构，可通过动态系统分析研究其低复杂度解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ViTs已成为标准视觉骨干网络，但其计算现象的机制解释仍不完善，缺乏将Transformer深度视为特征化流的框架。

Method: 提出Block-Recurrent Hypothesis（BRH），并通过训练Raptor模型验证假设，同时进行动态可解释性分析。

Result: 实验证明，Raptor模型仅用2个块即可恢复DINOv2 ImageNet-1k线性探针96%的准确率，并揭示了ViTs深度中的动态收敛特性。

Conclusion: 研究发现，视觉变换器（ViTs）在深度计算中展现出紧凑的循环结构，支持通过动态系统分析方法研究其低复杂度解决方案。

Abstract: As Vision Transformers (ViTs) become standard vision backbones, a mechanistic account of their computational phenomenology is essential. Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent computational cost. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis.

### [10] [SE360: Semantic Edit in 360$^\circ$ Panoramas via Hierarchical Data Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19943)
*Haoyi Zhong,Fang-Lue Zhang,Andrew Chalmers,Taehyun Rhee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SE360是一个针对360°全景图像的多条件引导对象编辑框架，通过自主数据生成和两阶段细化策略，显著提升了编辑效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的指令式图像编辑方法在处理360°全景图像时存在局限性，往往在等矩形投影（ERP）和透视视图中产生不合理的结果。为了解决这些问题，提出了SE360框架。

Method: SE360框架采用了一种新颖的从粗到细的自主数据生成流程，结合了视觉语言模型（VLM）和自适应投影调整，实现了对象及其物理环境的层次分析。此外，还引入了经济高效的两阶段数据细化策略，以提升数据真实性和减少模型过拟合。

Result: 实验表明，SE360在视觉质量和语义准确性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SE360框架在360°全景图像编辑中表现出色，不仅在视觉质量上优于现有方法，还在语义准确性上取得了显著提升。

Abstract: While instruction-based image editing is emerging, extending it to 360$^\circ$ panoramas introduces additional challenges. Existing methods often produce implausible results in both equirectangular projections (ERP) and perspective views. To address these limitations, we propose SE360, a novel framework for multi-condition guided object editing in 360$^\circ$ panoramas. At its core is a novel coarse-to-fine autonomous data generation pipeline without manual intervention. This pipeline leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and adaptive projection adjustment for hierarchical analysis, ensuring the holistic segmentation of objects and their physical context. The resulting data pairs are both semantically meaningful and geometrically consistent, even when sourced from unlabeled panoramas. Furthermore, we introduce a cost-effective, two-stage data refinement strategy to improve data realism and mitigate model overfitting to erase artifacts. Based on the constructed dataset, we train a Transformer-based diffusion model to allow flexible object editing guided by text, mask, or reference image in 360$^\circ$ panoramas. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and semantic accuracy.

Result: 研究表明，视频生成模型在多个维度上展现出显著的3D感知能力，且其理解能力可超越专门训练的3D模型。

Conclusion: 研究发现，即使未经过3D数据训练，最先进的视频生成模型也展现出对3D物体和场景的深刻理解，甚至超过专门训练的大型3D专家模型。

Abstract: Videos are continuous 2D projections of 3D worlds. After training on large video data, will global 3D understanding naturally emerge? We study this by quantifying the 3D understanding of existing Video Foundation Models (VidFMs) pretrained on vast video data. We propose the first model-agnostic framework that measures the 3D awareness of various VidFMs by estimating multiple 3D properties from their features via shallow read-outs. Our study presents meaningful findings regarding the 3D awareness of VidFMs on multiple axes. In particular, we show that state-of-the-art video generation models exhibit a strong understanding of 3D objects and scenes, despite not being trained on any 3D data. Such understanding can even surpass that of large expert models specifically trained for 3D tasks. Our findings, together with the 3D benchmarking of major VidFMs, provide valuable observations for building scalable 3D models.

TL;DR: HistoWAS是一个计算框架，通过整合空间特征与临床数据，提升病理图像分析的临床相关性，已应用于KPMP项目并开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具难以量化组织微环境的空间交互及其与临床参数的关系，限制了病理图像分析的临床价值。

Method: HistoWAS结合了30个拓扑和空间特征（源自GIS点模式分析）与传统指标，通过质量单变量回归分析（统计校正后）评估特征与临床参数的关联。

Result: 在KPMP项目的385张PAS染色WSIs中，HistoWAS成功分析了102个特征（包括72个传统对象级特征和30个空间特征），代码和数据已开源。

Conclusion: HistoWAS框架成功地将组织空间特征与临床结果关联起来，为病理图像分析提供了新的工具和视角。

Abstract: High-throughput "pathomic" analysis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) offers new opportunities to study tissue characteristics and for biomarker discovery. However, the clinical relevance of the tissue characteristics at the micro- and macro-environment level is limited by the lack of tools that facilitate the measurement of the spatial interaction of individual structure characteristics and their association with clinical parameters. To address these challenges, we introduce HistoWAS (Histology-Wide Association Study), a computational framework designed to link tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes. Specifically, HistoWAS implements (1) a feature space that augments conventional metrics with 30 topological and spatial features, adapted from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) point pattern analysis, to quantify tissue micro-architecture; and (2) an association study engine, inspired by Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS), that performs mass univariate regression for each feature with statistical correction. As a proof of concept, we applied HistoWAS to analyze a total of 102 features (72 conventional object-level features and our 30 spatial features) using 385 PAS-stained WSIs from 206 participants in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP). The code and data have been released to https://github.com/hrlblab/histoWAS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIL方法忽略了全切片图像（WSI）中实例间的复杂语义关系，且Transformer-based方法因计算复杂度高和固定尺度注意力机制难以适应不同肿瘤区域尺度。

Method: 提出了窗口尺度衰减MIL（WSD-MIL），包括窗口尺度衰减注意力模块和挤压-激励区域门模块，以优化局部实例关系的建模和全局信息处理。

Result: WSD-MIL在CAMELYON16和TCGA-BRCA数据集上达到最优性能，并减少62%的计算内存。

Conclusion: WSD-MIL通过窗口尺度衰减注意力模块和基于挤压-激励的区域门模块，显著提升了计算病理学中的诊断准确性，同时降低了计算内存消耗。

Abstract: In recent years, the integration of pre-trained foundational models with multiple instance learning (MIL) has improved diagnostic accuracy in computational pathology. However, existing MIL methods focus on optimizing feature extractors and aggregation strategies while overlooking the complex semantic relationships among instances within whole slide image (WSI). Although Transformer-based MIL approaches aiming to model instance dependencies, the quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability to large-scale WSIs. Moreover, due to the pronounced variations in tumor region scales across different WSIs, existing Transformer-based methods employing fixed-scale attention mechanisms face significant challenges in precisely capturing local instance correlations and fail to account for the distance-based decay effect of patch relevance. To address these challenges, we propose window scale decay MIL (WSD-MIL), designed to enhance the capacity to model tumor regions of varying scales while improving computational efficiency. WSD-MIL comprises: 1) a window scale decay based attention module, which employs a cluster-based sampling strategy to reduce computational costs while progressively decaying attention window-scale to capture local instance relationships at varying scales; and 2) a squeeze-and-excitation based region gate module, which dynamically adjusts window weights to enhance global information modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that WSD-MIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON16 and TCGA-BRCA datasets while reducing 62% of the computational memory. The code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Automating tasks in orchards is challenging because of the large amount of variation in the environment and occlusions. One of the challenges is apple pose estimation, where key points, such as the calyx, are often occluded. Recently developed pose estimation methods no longer rely on these key points, but still require them for annotations, making annotating challenging and time-consuming. Due to the abovementioned occlusions, there can be conflicting and missing annotations of the same fruit between different images. Novel 3D reconstruction methods can be used to simplify annotating and enlarge datasets. We propose a novel pipeline consisting of 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct an orchard scene, simplified annotations, automated projection of the annotations to images, and the training and evaluation of a pose estimation method. Using our pipeline, 105 manual annotations were required to obtain 28,191 training labels, a reduction of 99.6%. Experimental results indicated that training with labels of fruits that are $\leq95\%$ occluded resulted in the best performance, with a neutral F1 score of 0.927 on the original images and 0.970 on the rendered images. Adjusting the size of the training dataset had small effects on the model performance in terms of F1 score and pose estimation accuracy. It was found that the least occluded fruits had the best position estimation, which worsened as the fruits became more occluded. It was also found that the tested pose estimation method was unable to correctly learn the orientation estimation of apples.

Conclusion: The study successfully developed a high-accuracy ensemble model combining CNN and Gradient Boosting Machine for guava disease detection, achieving approximately 99.99% classification accuracy. This framework is suitable for real-time agricultural monitoring systems in Bangladesh.

Abstract: As a significant agricultural country, Bangladesh utilizes its fertile land for guava cultivation and dedicated labor to boost its economic development. In a nation like Bangladesh, enhancing guava production and agricultural practices plays a crucial role in its economy. Anthracnose and fruit fly infection can lower the quality and productivity of guava, a crucial tropical fruit. Expert systems that detect diseases early can reduce losses and safeguard the harvest. Images of guava fruits classified into the Healthy, Fruit Flies, and Anthracnose classes are included in the Guava Fruit Disease Dataset 2024 (GFDD24), which comes from plantations in Rajshahi and Pabna, Bangladesh. This study aims to create models using CNN alongside traditional machine learning techniques that can effectively identify guava diseases in locally cultivated varieties in Bangladesh. In order to achieve the highest classification accuracy of approximately 99.99% for the guava dataset, we propose utilizing ensemble models that combine CNNML with Gradient Boosting Machine. In general, the CNN-ML cascade framework exhibits strong, high-accuracy guava disease detection that is appropriate for real-time agricultural monitoring systems.

Motivation: 跨分辨率土地覆盖映射的目标是从粗分辨率或低分辨率监督中生成高分辨率语义预测，但严重的分辨率不匹配使得有效学习极具挑战性。现有方法难以对齐细粒度空间结构与粗标签，导致噪声监督和映射精度下降。

Method: DDTM采用双分支弱监督框架，通过扩散分支逐步细化细尺度局部语义，同时利用基于Transformer的分支强化长距离上下文一致性。此外，设计了一个伪标签置信度评估模块以减少噪声。

Result: DDTM在切萨皮克湾基准测试中取得了66.52%的mIoU，显著优于之前的弱监督方法。

Conclusion: DDTM在切萨皮克湾基准测试中取得了66.52%的mIoU，显著优于之前的弱监督方法，并建立了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: Cross-resolution land cover mapping aims to produce high-resolution semantic predictions from coarse or low-resolution supervision, yet the severe resolution mismatch makes effective learning highly challenging. Existing weakly supervised approaches often struggle to align fine-grained spatial structures with coarse labels, leading to noisy supervision and degraded mapping accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose DDTM, a dual-branch weakly supervised framework that explicitly decouples local semantic refinement from global contextual reasoning. Specifically, DDTM introduces a diffusion-based branch to progressively refine fine-scale local semantics under coarse supervision, while a transformer-based branch enforces long-range contextual consistency across large spatial extents. In addition, we design a pseudo-label confidence evaluation module to mitigate noise induced by cross-resolution inconsistencies and to selectively exploit reliable supervisory signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDTM establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Chesapeake Bay benchmark, achieving 66.52\% mIoU and substantially outperforming prior weakly supervised methods.

Result: TFv6在CARLA基准测试中达到95 DS，并在Longest6~v2和Town13上性能翻倍，同时在NAVSIM和Waymo基准测试中表现一致提升。

Conclusion: 通过缩小专家与学生模型之间的差距，TransFuser v6 (TFv6) 在CARLA闭环基准测试中取得了新的最优性能，并在NAVSIM和Waymo基准测试中表现一致提升。

Abstract: Simulators can generate virtually unlimited driving data, yet imitation learning policies in simulation still struggle to achieve robust closed-loop performance. Motivated by this gap, we empirically study how misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations can limit the effectiveness of imitation learning. More precisely, experts have significantly higher visibility (e.g., ignoring occlusions) and far lower uncertainty (e.g., knowing other vehicles' actions), making them difficult to imitate reliably. Furthermore, navigational intent (i.e., the route to follow) is under-specified in student models at test time via only a single target point. We demonstrate that these asymmetries can measurably limit driving performance in CARLA and offer practical interventions to address them. After careful modifications to narrow the gaps between expert and student, our TransFuser v6 (TFv6) student policy achieves a new state of the art on all major publicly available CARLA closed-loop benchmarks, reaching 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13. Additionally, by integrating perception supervision from our dataset into a shared sim-to-real pipeline, we show consistent gains on the NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End driving benchmarks.

Method: 提出了模块化图像到视频适配器（MIVA），作为预训练扩散模型的轻量子网络，每个模块专注于单一运动模式，支持并行扩展。

Result: 实验表明，MIVA仅需约十个样本和单个消费级GPU即可高效训练，用户可通过选择模块组合实现精确运动控制，生成质量优于大数据集训练的模型。

Conclusion: MIVA通过模块化设计有效解决了扩散模型在图像动画中的泛化性和数据稀缺问题，显著提升了运动控制的精确性和生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently achieved impressive photorealism in image and video generation. However, their application to image animation remains limited, even when trained on large-scale datasets. Two primary challenges contribute to this: the high dimensionality of video signals leads to a scarcity of training data, causing DMs to favor memorization over prompt compliance when generating motion; moreover, DMs struggle to generalize to novel motion patterns not present in the training set, and fine-tuning them to learn such patterns, especially using limited training data, is still under-explored. To address these limitations, we propose Modular Image-to-Video Adapter (MIVA), a lightweight sub-network attachable to a pre-trained DM, each designed to capture a single motion pattern and scalable via parallelization. MIVAs can be efficiently trained on approximately ten samples using a single consumer-grade GPU. At inference time, users can specify motion by selecting one or multiple MIVAs, eliminating the need for prompt engineering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MIVA enables more precise motion control while maintaining, or even surpassing, the generation quality of models trained on significantly larger datasets.

Abstract: Automated pavement defect detection often struggles to generalize across diverse real-world conditions due to the lack of standardized datasets. Existing datasets differ in annotation styles, distress type definitions, and formats, limiting their integration for unified training. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark dataset that consolidates multiple publicly available sources into a standardized collection of 52747 images from seven countries, with 135277 bounding box annotations covering 13 distinct distress types. The dataset captures broad real-world variation in image quality, resolution, viewing angles, and weather conditions, offering a unique resource for consistent training and evaluation. Its effectiveness was demonstrated through benchmarking with state-of-the-art object detection models including YOLOv8-YOLOv12, Faster R-CNN, and DETR, which achieved competitive performance across diverse scenarios. By standardizing class definitions and annotation formats, this dataset provides the first globally representative benchmark for pavement defect detection and enables fair comparison of models, including zero-shot transfer to new environments.

Result: SegEarth-R2在LaSeRS和其他基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: SegEarth-R2模型在LaSeRS数据集上表现出色，为下一代地理空间分割建立了强大的基线。

Abstract: Effectively grounding complex language to pixels in remote sensing (RS) images is a critical challenge for applications like disaster response and environmental monitoring. Current models can parse simple, single-target commands but fail when presented with complex geospatial scenarios, e.g., segmenting objects at various granularities, executing multi-target instructions, and interpreting implicit user intent. To drive progress against these failures, we present LaSeRS, the first large-scale dataset built for comprehensive training and evaluation across four critical dimensions of language-guided segmentation: hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning requirements, and linguistic variability. By capturing these dimensions, LaSeRS moves beyond simple commands, providing a benchmark for complex geospatial reasoning. This addresses a critical gap: existing datasets oversimplify, leading to sensitivity-prone real-world models. We also propose SegEarth-R2, an MLLM architecture designed for comprehensive language-guided segmentation in RS, which directly confronts these challenges. The model's effectiveness stems from two key improvements: (1) a spatial attention supervision mechanism specifically handles the localization of small objects and their components, and (2) a flexible and efficient segmentation query mechanism that handles both single-target and multi-target scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our SegEarth-R2 achieves outstanding performance on LaSeRS and other benchmarks, establishing a powerful baseline for the next generation of geospatial segmentation.

TL;DR: 研究通过真实驾驶数据比较了单视角和双视角分心检测模型的性能，发现多视角整合的效果取决于模型架构设计，强调了未来多模态驾驶员监控系统需要融合感知设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于计算机视觉的分心驾驶检测日益受到关注，但现有模型大多仅依赖驾驶员视角，忽略了影响驾驶行为的关键环境背景。本研究探讨了在自然驾驶条件下，结合道路视角和驾驶员视角是否能提高分心检测的准确性。

Method: 使用同步双摄像头记录的真实驾驶数据，对三种领先的时空动作识别架构（SlowFast-R50、X3D-M和SlowOnly-R50）进行了基准测试，评估了两种输入配置（仅驾驶员视角和堆叠双视角）的性能。

Result: 结果显示，虽然某些模型中环境输入可以提高检测性能，但性能提升强烈依赖于底层架构。单路径的SlowOnly模型在双视角输入下实现了9.8%的提升，而双路径的SlowFast模型由于表征冲突导致准确性下降了7.2%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，简单地增加视觉环境信息并不足以提高分心驾驶检测的准确性，反而可能导致干扰，除非模型架构专门设计用于支持多视角整合。

Abstract: Despite increasing interest in computer vision-based distracted driving detection, most existing models rely exclusively on driver-facing views and overlook crucial environmental context that influences driving behavior. This study investigates whether incorporating road-facing views alongside driver-facing footage improves distraction detection accuracy in naturalistic driving conditions. Using synchronized dual-camera recordings from real-world driving, we benchmark three leading spatiotemporal action recognition architectures: SlowFast-R50, X3D-M, and SlowOnly-R50. Each model is evaluated under two input configurations: driver-only and stacked dual-view. Results show that while contextual inputs can improve detection in certain models, performance gains depend strongly on the underlying architecture. The single-pathway SlowOnly model achieved a 9.8 percent improvement with dual-view inputs, while the dual-pathway SlowFast model experienced a 7.2 percent drop in accuracy due to representational conflicts. These findings suggest that simply adding visual context is not sufficient and may lead to interference unless the architecture is specifically designed to support multi-view integration. This study presents one of the first systematic comparisons of single- and dual-view distraction detection models using naturalistic driving data and underscores the importance of fusion-aware design for future multimodal driver monitoring systems.

Conclusion: MAPI-GNN通过动态构建多层面图结构，显著提升了多模态医疗诊断的准确性和鲁棒性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Graph neural networks are increasingly applied to multimodal medical diagnosis for their inherent relational modeling capabilities. However, their efficacy is often compromised by the prevailing reliance on a single, static graph built from indiscriminate features, hindering the ability to model patient-specific pathological relationships. To this end, the proposed Multi-Activation Plane Interaction Graph Neural Network (MAPI-GNN) reconstructs this single-graph paradigm by learning a multifaceted graph profile from semantically disentangled feature subspaces. The framework first uncovers latent graph-aware patterns via a multi-dimensional discriminator; these patterns then guide the dynamic construction of a stack of activation graphs; and this multifaceted profile is finally aggregated and contextualized by a relational fusion engine for a robust diagnosis. Extensive experiments on two diverse tasks, comprising over 1300 patient samples, demonstrate that MAPI-GNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: H2em框架通过双层次蕴含损失和判别性对齐损失，结合双曲几何的优势，显著提升了组合零样本学习的性能，并在多个基准测试中取得了新的最优结果。

Abstract: Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen state-object compositions by generalizing from a training set of their primitives (state and object). Current methods often overlook the rich hierarchical structures, such as the semantic hierarchy of primitives (e.g., apple fruit) and the conceptual hierarchy between primitives and compositions (e.g, sliced apple apple). A few recent efforts have shown effectiveness in modeling these hierarchies through loss regularization within Euclidean space. In this paper, we argue that they fail to scale to the large-scale taxonomies required for real-world CZSL: the space's polynomial volume growth in flat geometry cannot match the exponential structure, impairing generalization capacity. To this end, we propose H2em, a new framework that learns Hierarchical Hyperbolic EMbeddings for CZSL. H2em leverages the unique properties of hyperbolic geometry, a space naturally suited for embedding tree-like structures with low distortion. However, a naive hyperbolic mapping may suffer from hierarchical collapse and poor fine-grained discrimination. We further design two learning objectives to structure this space: a Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss that uses hyperbolic entailment cones to enforce the predefined hierarchies, and a Discriminative Alignment Loss with hard negative mining to establish a large geodesic distance between semantically similar compositions. Furthermore, we devise Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention to realize instance-aware cross-modal infusion within hyperbolic geometry. Extensive ablations on three benchmarks demonstrate that H2em establishes a new state-of-the-art in both closed-world and open-world scenarios. Our codes will be released.

Conclusion: VALLR-Pin通过结合视觉特征、语音和语言上下文，提升了普通话唇读的性能。

Abstract: Visual Speech Recognition aims to transcribe spoken words from silent lip-motion videos. This task is particularly challenging for Mandarin, as visemes are highly ambiguous and homophones are prevalent. We propose VALLR-Pin, a novel two-stage framework that extends the recent VALLR architecture from English to Mandarin. First, a shared video encoder feeds into dual decoders, which jointly predict both Chinese character sequences and their standard Pinyin romanization. The multi-task learning of character and phonetic outputs fosters robust visual-semantic representations. During inference, the text decoder generates multiple candidate transcripts. We construct a prompt by concatenating the Pinyin output with these candidate Chinese sequences and feed it to a large language model to resolve ambiguities and refine the transcription. This provides the LLM with explicit phonetic context to correct homophone-induced errors. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM on synthetic noisy examples: we generate imperfect Pinyin-text pairs from intermediate VALLR-Pin checkpoints using the training data, creating instruction-response pairs for error correction. This endows the LLM with awareness of our model's specific error patterns. In summary, VALLR-Pin synergizes visual features with phonetic and linguistic context to improve Mandarin lip-reading performance.

Abstract: We present FlashLips, a two-stage, mask-free lip-sync system that decouples lips control from rendering and achieves real-time performance running at over 100 FPS on a single GPU, while matching the visual quality of larger state-of-the-art models. Stage 1 is a compact, one-step latent-space editor that reconstructs an image using a reference identity, a masked target frame, and a low-dimensional lips-pose vector, trained purely with reconstruction losses - no GANs or diffusion. To remove explicit masks at inference, we use self-supervision: we generate mouth-altered variants of the target image, that serve as pseudo ground truth for fine-tuning, teaching the network to localize edits to the lips while preserving the rest. Stage 2 is an audio-to-pose transformer trained with a flow-matching objective to predict lips-poses vectors from speech. Together, these stages form a simple and stable pipeline that combines deterministic reconstruction with robust audio control, delivering high perceptual quality and faster-than-real-time speed.

Abstract: Real-world image captions often lack contextual depth, omitting crucial details such as event background, temporal cues, outcomes, and named entities that are not visually discernible. This gap limits the effectiveness of image understanding in domains like journalism, education, and digital archives, where richer, more informative descriptions are essential. To address this, we propose a multimodal pipeline that augments visual input with external textual knowledge. Our system retrieves semantically similar images using BEIT-3 (Flickr30k-384 and COCO-384) and SigLIP So-384, reranks them using ORB and SIFT for geometric alignment, and extracts contextual information from related articles via semantic search. A fine-tuned Qwen3 model with QLoRA then integrates this context with base captions generated by Instruct BLIP (Vicuna-7B) to produce event-enriched, context-aware descriptions. Evaluated on the OpenEvents v1 dataset, our approach generates significantly more informative captions compared to traditional methods, showing strong potential for real-world applications requiring deeper visual-textual understanding

Abstract: Recent advances in learned image codecs have been extended from human perception toward machine perception. However, progressive image compression with fine granular scalability (FGS)-which enables decoding a single bitstream at multiple quality levels-remains unexplored for machine-oriented codecs. In this work, we propose a novel progressive learned image compression codec for machine perception, PICM-Net, based on trit-plane coding. By analyzing the difference between human- and machine-oriented rate-distortion priorities, we systematically examine the latent prioritization strategies in terms of machine-oriented codecs. To further enhance real-world adaptability, we design an adaptive decoding controller, which dynamically determines the necessary decoding level during inference time to maintain the desired confidence of downstream machine prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enables efficient and adaptive progressive transmission while maintaining high performance in the downstream classification task, establishing a new paradigm for machine-aware progressive image compression.

Abstract: Fashion style classification is a challenging task because of the large visual variation within the same style and the existence of visually similar styles.
  Styles are expressed not only by the global appearance, but also by the attributes of individual items and their combinations.
  In this study, we propose an item region-based fashion style classification network (IRSN) to effectively classify fashion styles by analyzing item-specific features and their combinations in addition to global features.
  IRSN extracts features of each item region using item region pooling (IRP), analyzes them separately, and combines them using gated feature fusion (GFF).
  In addition, we improve the feature extractor by applying a dual-backbone architecture that combines a domain-specific feature extractor and a general feature extractor pre-trained with a large-scale image-text dataset.
  In experiments, applying IRSN to six widely-used backbones, including EfficientNet, ConvNeXt, and Swin Transformer, improved style classification accuracy by an average of 6.9% and a maximum of 14.5% on the FashionStyle14 dataset and by an average of 7.6% and a maximum of 15.1% on the ShowniqV3 dataset. Visualization analysis also supports that the IRSN models are better than the baseline models at capturing differences between similar style classes.

TL;DR: 本研究分析了激活函数和优化算法组合对HAR系统性能的影响，发现ConvLSTM结合Adam或RMSprop在医疗相关活动识别中表现最佳，准确率高达99.00%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于深度学习的HAR系统被广泛采用，但激活函数和模型优化器对性能的影响尚未充分分析，特别是它们的组合如何在实际场景中影响模型行为。

Method: 研究调查了三种常用激活函数（ReLU、Sigmoid和Tanh）与四种优化算法（SGD、Adam、RMSprop和Adagrad）的组合效果，使用两种循环深度学习架构（BiLSTM和ConvLSTM）。实验在HMDB51和UCF101数据集的六个医学相关活动类别上进行。

Result: 实验结果表明，ConvLSTM在两种数据集上均优于BiLSTM。ConvLSTM与Adam或RMSprop结合，准确率高达99.00%，展示了强大的时空学习能力和稳定性能。BiLSTM在UCF101上表现尚可（准确率接近98.00%），但在HMDB51上降至约60.00%，表明其跨数据集鲁棒性有限。

Conclusion: 本研究为优化HAR系统提供了实用见解，特别是在需要快速精确活动检测的现实医疗环境中。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in healthcare, surveillance, and innovative environments, where reliable action recognition supports timely decision-making and automation. Although deep learning-based HAR systems are widely adopted, the impact of Activation Functions (AFs) and Model Optimizers (MOs) on performance has not been sufficiently analyzed, particularly regarding how their combinations influence model behavior in practical scenarios. Most existing studies focus on architecture design, while the interaction between AF and MO choices remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we investigate the effect of three commonly used activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh) combined with four optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad) using two recurrent deep learning architectures, namely BiLSTM and ConvLSTM. Experiments are conducted on six medically relevant activity classes selected from the HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets, considering their suitability for healthcare-oriented HAR applications. Our experimental results show that ConvLSTM consistently outperforms BiLSTM across both datasets. ConvLSTM, combined with Adam or RMSprop, achieves an accuracy of up to 99.00%, demonstrating strong spatio-temporal learning capabilities and stable performance. While BiLSTM performs reasonably well on UCF101, with accuracy approaching 98.00%, its performance drops to approximately 60.00% on HMDB51, indicating limited robustness across datasets and weaker sensitivity to AF and MO variations. This study provides practical insights for optimizing HAR systems, particularly for real-world healthcare environments where fast and precise activity detection is critical.

Conclusion: LiDARDraft通过3D布局和rangemap-based ControlNet实现了高质量且可控的LiDAR点云生成，支持从任意文本、图像和草图创建自动驾驶环境。

Abstract: Generating realistic and diverse LiDAR point clouds is crucial for autonomous driving simulation. Although previous methods achieve LiDAR point cloud generation from user inputs, they struggle to attain high-quality results while enabling versatile controllability, due to the imbalance between the complex distribution of LiDAR point clouds and the simple control signals. To address the limitation, we propose LiDARDraft, which utilizes the 3D layout to build a bridge between versatile conditional signals and LiDAR point clouds. The 3D layout can be trivially generated from various user inputs such as textual descriptions and images. Specifically, we represent text, images, and point clouds as unified 3D layouts, which are further transformed into semantic and depth control signals. Then, we employ a rangemap-based ControlNet to guide LiDAR point cloud generation. This pixel-level alignment approach demonstrates excellent performance in controllable LiDAR point clouds generation, enabling "simulation from scratch", allowing self-driving environments to be created from arbitrary textual descriptions, images and sketches.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) seeks to render photorealistic, 3D-consistent images of a scene from unseen camera poses given only a sparse set of posed views. Existing deterministic networks render observed regions quickly but blur unobserved areas, whereas stochastic diffusion-based methods hallucinate plausible content yet incur heavy training- and inference-time costs. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework that unifies the strengths of both paradigms. A bidirectional transformer encodes multi-view image tokens and Plucker-ray embeddings, producing a shared latent representation. Two lightweight heads then act on this representation: (i) a feed-forward regression head that renders pixels where geometry is well constrained, and (ii) a masked autoregressive diffusion head that completes occluded or unseen regions. The entire model is trained end-to-end with joint photometric and diffusion losses, without handcrafted 3D inductive biases, enabling scalability across diverse scenes. Experiments demonstrate that our method attains state-of-the-art image quality while reducing rendering time by an order of magnitude compared with fully generative baselines.

Abstract: Deteriorating civil infrastructure requires automated inspection techniques overcoming limitations of visual assessment. While Ground Penetrating Radar and Infrared Thermography enable subsurface defect detection, single modal approaches face complementary constraints radar struggles with moisture and shallow defects, while thermography exhibits weather dependency and limited depth. This paper presents a multi modal attention network fusing radar temporal patterns with thermal spatial signatures for bridge deck delamination detection. Our architecture introduces temporal attention for radar processing, spatial attention for thermal features, and cross modal fusion with learnable embeddings discovering complementary defect patterns invisible to individual sensors. We incorporate uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo dropout and learned variance estimation, decomposing uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components for safety critical decisions. Experiments on five bridge datasets reveal that on balanced to moderately imbalanced data, our approach substantially outperforms baselines in accuracy and AUC representing meaningful improvements over single modal and concatenation based fusion. Ablation studies demonstrate cross modal attention provides critical gains beyond within modality attention, while multi head mechanisms achieve improved calibration. Uncertainty quantification reduces calibration error, enabling selective prediction by rejecting uncertain cases. However, under extreme class imbalance, attention mechanisms show vulnerability to majority class collapse. These findings provide actionable guidance: attention based architecture performs well across typical scenarios, while extreme imbalance requires specialized techniques. Our system maintains deployment efficiency, enabling real time inspection with characterized capabilities and limitations.

Conclusion: DDAVS框架通过解耦音频语义和延迟双向对齐，有效解决了多源纠缠和视听错位问题，在AVS-Objects和VPO基准测试中表现优异，验证了其在实际复杂场景下的有效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to localize sound-producing objects at the pixel level by jointly leveraging auditory and visual information. However, existing methods often suffer from multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment, which lead to biases toward louder or larger objects while overlooking weaker, smaller, or co-occurring sources. To address these challenges, we propose DDAVS, a Disentangled Audio Semantics and Delayed Bidirectional Alignment framework. To mitigate multi-source entanglement, DDAVS employs learnable queries to extract audio semantics and anchor them within a structured semantic space derived from an audio prototype memory bank. This is further optimized through contrastive learning to enhance discriminability and robustness. To alleviate audio-visual misalignment, DDAVS introduces dual cross-attention with delayed modality interaction, improving the robustness of multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments on the AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks demonstrate that DDAVS consistently outperforms existing approaches, exhibiting strong performance across single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance scenarios. These results validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our framework under challenging real-world audio-visual segmentation conditions.

Motivation: 现有剪枝方法通常单独处理令牌或注意力头，依赖启发式或一阶信号，常导致精度损失或无法泛化。HEART-ViT旨在通过统一、二阶、输入自适应的框架优化ViT。

Method: HEART-ViT通过高效的Hessian-向量积估计令牌和注意力头的曲率加权敏感性，在明确的损失预算下进行剪枝决策。

Result: 在ImageNet-100和ImageNet-1K上，HEART-ViT实现了高达49.4%的FLOPs减少、36%的延迟降低和46%的吞吐量提升，同时保持或超越基线精度。

Conclusion: HEART-ViT成功填补了理论与实践的鸿沟，提供了一个既保持精度又适用于边缘设备的统一、基于曲率的剪枝框架。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) deliver state-of-the-art accuracy but their quadratic attention cost and redundant computations severely hinder deployment on latency and resource-constrained platforms. Existing pruning approaches treat either tokens or heads in isolation, relying on heuristics or first-order signals, which often sacrifice accuracy or fail to generalize across inputs. We introduce HEART-ViT, a Hessian-guided efficient dynamic attention and token pruning framework for vision transformers, which to the best of our knowledge is the first unified, second-order, input-adaptive framework for ViT optimization. HEART-ViT estimates curvature-weighted sensitivities of both tokens and attention heads using efficient Hessian-vector products, enabling principled pruning decisions under explicit loss budgets.This dual-view sensitivity reveals an important structural insight: token pruning dominates computational savings, while head pruning provides fine-grained redundancy removal, and their combination achieves a superior trade-off. On ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1K with ViT-B/16 and DeiT-B/16, HEART-ViT achieves up to 49.4 percent FLOPs reduction, 36 percent lower latency, and 46 percent higher throughput, while consistently matching or even surpassing baseline accuracy after fine-tuning, for example 4.7 percent recovery at 40 percent token pruning. Beyond theoretical benchmarks, we deploy HEART-ViT on different edge devices such as AGX Orin, demonstrating that our reductions in FLOPs and latency translate directly into real-world gains in inference speed and energy efficiency. HEART-ViT bridges the gap between theory and practice, delivering the first unified, curvature-driven pruning framework that is both accuracy-preserving and edge-efficient.

Conclusion: milliMamba框架通过联合建模时空依赖关系，显著提升了毫米波雷达在人体姿态估计任务中的性能，超越了基线方法11.0 AP和14.6 AP，同时保持了合理的计算复杂度。

Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar offers a privacy-preserving and lighting-invariant alternative to RGB sensors for Human Pose Estimation (HPE) task. However, the radar signals are often sparse due to specular reflection, making the extraction of robust features from radar signals highly challenging. To address this, we present milliMamba, a radar-based 2D human pose estimation framework that jointly models spatio-temporal dependencies across both the feature extraction and decoding stages. Specifically, given the high dimensionality of radar inputs, we adopt a Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from longer sequences with linear complexity. A Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder then predicts joint coordinates across multiple frames. Together, this spatio-temporal modeling pipeline enables the model to leverage contextual cues from neighboring frames and joints to infer missing joints caused by specular reflections. To reinforce motion smoothness, we incorporate a velocity loss alongside the standard keypoint loss during training. Experiments on the TransHuPR and HuPR datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements, exceeding the baselines by 11.0 AP and 14.6 AP, respectively, while maintaining reasonable complexity.

Abstract: Low-shot object counting addresses estimating the number of previously unobserved objects in an image using only few or no annotated test-time exemplars. A considerable challenge for modern low-shot counters are dense regions with small objects. While total counts in such situations are typically well addressed by density-based counters, their usefulness is limited by poor localization capabilities. This is better addressed by point-detection-based counters, which are based on query-based detectors. However, due to limited number of pre-trained queries, they underperform on images with very large numbers of objects, and resort to ad-hoc techniques like upsampling and tiling. We propose CoDi, the first latent diffusion-based low-shot counter that produces high-quality density maps on which object locations can be determined by non-maxima suppression. Our core contribution is the new exemplar-based conditioning module that extracts and adjusts the object prototypes to the intermediate layers of the denoising network, leading to accurate object location estimation. On FSC benchmark, CoDi outperforms state-of-the-art by 15% MAE, 13% MAE and 10% MAE in the few-shot, one-shot, and reference-less scenarios, respectively, and sets a new state-of-the-art on MCAC benchmark by outperforming the top method by 44% MAE.

Abstract: Vision foundation models trained via multi-teacher distillation offer a promising path toward unified visual representations, yet the learning dynamics and data efficiency of such approaches remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study multi-teacher distillation for vision foundation models and identify key factors that enable training at lower computational cost. We introduce Agglomerative Mixture-of-Experts Vision Foundation Models (AMoE), which distill knowledge from SigLIP2 and DINOv3 simultaneously into a Mixture-of-Experts student. We show that (1) our Asymmetric Relation-Knowledge Distillation loss preserves the geometric properties of each teacher while enabling effective knowledge transfer, (2) token-balanced batching that packs varying-resolution images into sequences with uniform token budgets stabilizes representation learning across resolutions without sacrificing performance, and (3) hierarchical clustering and sampling of training data--typically reserved for self-supervised learning--substantially improves sample efficiency over random sampling for multi-teacher distillation. By combining these findings, we curate OpenLVD200M, a 200M-image corpus that demonstrates superior efficiency for multi-teacher distillation. Instantiated in a Mixture-of-Experts. We release OpenLVD200M and distilled models.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个新的基于自然语言的文档图像检索（NL-DIR）基准，并展示了其在促进视觉文档理解（VDU）研究中的潜力。数据集和代码将公开提供。

Abstract: Document image retrieval (DIR) aims to retrieve document images from a gallery according to a given query. Existing DIR methods are primarily based on image queries that retrieve documents within the same coarse semantic category, e.g., newspapers or receipts. However, these methods struggle to effectively retrieve document images in real-world scenarios where textual queries with fine-grained semantics are usually provided. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new Natural Language-based Document Image Retrieval (NL-DIR) benchmark with corresponding evaluation metrics. In this work, natural language descriptions serve as semantically rich queries for the DIR task. The NL-DIR dataset contains 41K authentic document images, each paired with five high-quality, fine-grained semantic queries generated and evaluated through large language models in conjunction with manual verification. We perform zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations of existing mainstream contrastive vision-language models and OCR-free visual document understanding (VDU) models. A two-stage retrieval method is further investigated for performance improvement while achieving both time and space efficiency. We hope the proposed NL-DIR benchmark can bring new opportunities and facilitate research for the VDU community.

Result: GLC在自然图像上以低于0.04 bpp、人脸图像上低于0.01 bpp保持高视觉质量，在CLIC2020测试集上以45%更少的比特达到与MS-ILLM相同的FID。

Conclusion: GLC架构通过在生成性潜在空间进行变换编码，显著提升了低比特率下的图像压缩质量，并支持多种应用如图像修复和风格迁移。

Abstract: Most existing image compression approaches perform transform coding in the pixel space to reduce its spatial redundancy. However, they encounter difficulties in achieving both high-realism and high-fidelity at low bitrate, as the pixel-space distortion may not align with human perception. To address this issue, we introduce a Generative Latent Coding (GLC) architecture, which performs transform coding in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), instead of in the pixel space. The generative latent space is characterized by greater sparsity, richer semantic and better alignment with human perception, rendering it advantageous for achieving high-realism and high-fidelity compression. Additionally, we introduce a categorical hyper module to reduce the bit cost of hyper-information, and a code-prediction-based supervision to enhance the semantic consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our GLC maintains high visual quality with less than 0.04 bpp on natural images and less than 0.01 bpp on facial images. On the CLIC2020 test set, we achieve the same FID as MS-ILLM with 45% fewer bits. Furthermore, the powerful generative latent space enables various applications built on our GLC pipeline, such as image restoration and style transfer.

Abstract: Given the complexity of underwater environments and the variability of water as a medium, underwater images are inevitably subject to various types of degradation. The degradations present nonlinear coupling rather than simple superposition, which renders the effective processing of such coupled degradations particularly challenging. Most existing methods focus on designing specific branches, modules, or strategies for specific degradations, with little attention paid to the potential information embedded in their coupling. Consequently, they struggle to effectively capture and process the nonlinear interactions of multiple degradations from a bottom-up perspective. To address this issue, we propose JDPNet, a joint degradation processing network, that mines and unifies the potential information inherent in coupled degradations within a unified framework. Specifically, we introduce a joint feature-mining module, along with a probabilistic bootstrap distribution strategy, to facilitate effective mining and unified adjustment of coupled degradation features. Furthermore, to balance color, clarity, and contrast, we design a novel AquaBalanceLoss to guide the network in learning from multiple coupled degradation losses. Experiments on six publicly available underwater datasets, as well as two new datasets constructed in this study, show that JDPNet exhibits state-of-the-art performance while offering a better tradeoff between performance, parameter size, and computational cost.

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验显示，LiteFusion将基于视觉的检测器的mAP和NDS分别提高了+20.4%和+19.7%，且参数仅增加1.1%，无需专用LiDAR编码器。

Conclusion: LiteFusion通过将LiDAR数据作为几何信息的补充源来增强基于摄像头的检测，完全消除了对3D主干的依赖，使其具有高度部署友好性。即使在LiDAR输入缺失的情况下，LiteFusion仍能保持强劲的性能，展示了其出色的鲁棒性和有效性。

Abstract: 3D object detection is fundamental for safe and robust intelligent transportation systems. Current multi-modal 3D object detectors often rely on complex architectures and training strategies to achieve higher detection accuracy. However, these methods heavily rely on the LiDAR sensor so that they suffer from large performance drops when LiDAR is absent, which compromises the robustness and safety of autonomous systems in practical scenarios. Moreover, existing multi-modal detectors face difficulties in deployment on diverse hardware platforms, such as NPUs and FPGAs, due to their reliance on 3D sparse convolution operators, which are primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. To address these challenges, we reconsider the role of LiDAR in the camera-LiDAR fusion paradigm and introduce a novel multi-modal 3D detector, LiteFusion. Instead of treating LiDAR point clouds as an independent modality with a separate feature extraction backbone, LiteFusion utilizes LiDAR data as a complementary source of geometric information to enhance camera-based detection. This straightforward approach completely eliminates the reliance on a 3D backbone, making the method highly deployment-friendly. Specifically, LiteFusion integrates complementary features from LiDAR points into image features within a quaternion space, where the orthogonal constraints are well-preserved during network training. This helps model domain-specific relations across modalities, yielding a compact cross-modal embedding. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that LiteFusion improves the baseline vision-based detector by +20.4% mAP and +19.7% NDS with a minimal increase in parameters (1.1%) without using dedicated LiDAR encoders. Notably, even in the absence of LiDAR input, LiteFusion maintains strong results , highlighting its favorable robustness and effectiveness across diverse fusion paradigms and deployment scenarios.

TL;DR: IndicDLP是一个大规模多语言文档布局数据集，解决了现有数据集的不足，并通过实验验证其提升模型性能及泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大规模数据集（如PubLayNet和DocBank）缺乏细粒度标签和多语言多样性，而人工标注数据集（如M6Doc和D4LA）规模过小且多语言覆盖不足，尤其是印度语文档的代表性不足。

Method: 引入IndicDLP（涵盖11种代表性印度语言及英语的文档布局数据集）和UED-mini（基于DocLayNet和M6Doc的衍生数据集），并通过微调现有英语模型验证其有效性。

Result: 实验表明，基于IndicDLP微调的模型性能显著提升，且该模型能泛化至非印度语布局，成为文档数字化的宝贵资源。

Conclusion: IndicDLP填补了现有文档布局数据集在规模、多样性和标注粒度上的空白，推动了包容性和高效的文档理解。

Abstract: Document layout analysis is essential for downstream tasks such as information retrieval, extraction, OCR, and digitization. However, existing large-scale datasets like PubLayNet and DocBank lack fine-grained region labels and multilingual diversity, making them insufficient for representing complex document layouts. In contrast, human-annotated datasets such as M6Doc and D4LA offer richer labels and greater domain diversity, but are too small to train robust models and lack adequate multilingual coverage. This gap is especially pronounced for Indic documents, which encompass diverse scripts yet remain underrepresented in current datasets, further limiting progress in this space. To address these shortcomings, we introduce IndicDLP, a large-scale foundational document layout dataset spanning 11 representative Indic languages alongside English and 12 common document domains. Additionally, we curate UED-mini, a dataset derived from DocLayNet and M6Doc, to enhance pretraining and provide a solid foundation for Indic layout models. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning existing English models on IndicDLP significantly boosts performance, validating its effectiveness. Moreover, models trained on IndicDLP generalize well beyond Indic layouts, making it a valuable resource for document digitization. This work bridges gaps in scale, diversity, and annotation granularity, driving inclusive and efficient document understanding.

Method: 提出Degradation-Aware Metric Prompting（DAMP）框架，设计空间-光谱退化指标作为退化提示（DP），并引入空间-光谱自适应模块（SSAM）动态调制特征提取。

Result: 在自然和遥感超光谱图像数据集上的实验表明，DAMP实现了最先进的性能，并展现出卓越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DAMP框架通过设计空间-光谱退化指标作为退化提示（DP），结合空间-光谱自适应模块（SSAM），实现了对多样、混合或未知退化情况下的高效、自适应和鲁棒的超光谱图像恢复。

Abstract: Unified hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration aims to recover various degraded HSIs using a single model, offering great practical value. However, existing methods often depend on explicit degradation priors (e.g., degradation labels) as prompts to guide restoration, which are difficult to obtain due to complex and mixed degradations in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-Aware Metric Prompting (DAMP) framework. Instead of relying on predefined degradation priors, we design spatial-spectral degradation metrics to continuously quantify multi-dimensional degradations, serving as Degradation Prompts (DP). These DP enable the model to capture cross-task similarities in degradation distributions and enhance shared feature learning. Furthermore, we introduce a Spatial-Spectral Adaptive Module (SSAM) that dynamically modulates spatial and spectral feature extraction through learnable parameters. By integrating SSAM as experts within a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, and using DP as the gating router, the framework enables adaptive, efficient, and robust restoration under diverse, mixed, or unseen degradations. Extensive experiments on natural and remote sensing HSI datasets show that DAMP achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates exceptional generalization capability.

Conclusion: BiCoR-Seg通过双向协同精炼框架和层次监督策略，显著提升了高分辨率遥感图像语义分割的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing image semantic segmentation (HRSS) is a fundamental yet critical task in the field of Earth observation. However, it has long faced the challenges of high inter-class similarity and large intra-class variability. Existing approaches often struggle to effectively inject abstract yet strongly discriminative semantic knowledge into pixel-level feature learning, leading to blurred boundaries and class confusion in complex scenes. To address these challenges, we propose Bidirectional Co-Refinement Framework for HRSS (BiCoR-Seg). Specifically, we design a Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy Module (HBIS), which establishes a bidirectional information flow between feature maps and class embeddings by generating class-level heatmaps. Based on HBIS, we further introduce a hierarchical supervision strategy, where the interpretable heatmaps generated by each HBIS module are directly utilized as low-resolution segmentation predictions for supervision, thereby enhancing the discriminative capacity of shallow features. In addition, to further improve the discriminability of the embedding representations, we propose a cross-layer class embedding Fisher Discriminative Loss to enforce intra-class compactness and enlarge inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA, Vaihingen, and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that BiCoR-Seg achieves outstanding segmentation performance while offering stronger interpretability.

Abstract: With the rise of easily accessible tools for generating and manipulating multimedia content, realistic synthetic alterations to digital media have become a widespread threat, often involving manipulations across multiple modalities simultaneously. Recently, such techniques have been increasingly employed to distort narratives of important events and to spread misinformation on social media, prompting the development of misinformation detectors. In the context of misinformation conveyed through image-text pairs, several detection methods have been proposed. However, these approaches typically rely on computationally intensive architectures or require large amounts of annotated data. In this work we introduce LADLE-MM: Limited Annotation based Detector with Learned Ensembles for Multimodal Misinformation, a model-soup initialized multimodal misinformation detector designed to operate under a limited annotation setup and constrained training resources. LADLE-MM is composed of two unimodal branches and a third multimodal one that enhances image and text representations with additional multimodal embeddings extracted from BLIP, serving as fixed reference space. Despite using 60.3% fewer trainable parameters than previous state-of-the-art models, LADLE-MM achieves competitive performance on both binary and multi-label classification tasks on the DGM4 benchmark, outperforming existing methods when trained without grounding annotations. Moreover, when evaluated on the VERITE dataset, LADLE-MM outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches that utilize more complex architectures involving Large Vision-Language-Models, demonstrating the effective generalization ability in an open-set setting and strong robustness to unimodal bias.

TL;DR: ${D}^{3}$ETOR 通过两阶段方法改进弱监督COD，结合伪标签增强和频率感知去偏，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有WSCOD方法因伪标签不可靠和忽视涂鸦注释的固有偏差，导致性能远落后于全监督方法。

Method: 提出了两阶段WSCOD框架${D}^{3}$ETOR，包括辩论增强的伪标签生成和频率感知渐进去偏。第一阶段采用自适应熵驱动点采样和多代理辩论机制增强SAM在COD中的表现；第二阶段设计FADeNet，通过多级频率感知特征融合平衡全局语义与局部细节建模。

Result: ${D}^{3}$ETOR 显著提升了伪标签的准确性和模型对全局结构的捕捉能力，缩小了与全监督方法的差距。

Conclusion: ${D}^{3}$ETOR 通过两阶段框架显著缩小了弱监督与全监督COD之间的性能差距，并在多个基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (WSCOD) aims to locate and segment objects that are visually concealed within their surrounding scenes, relying solely on sparse supervision such as scribble annotations. Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种结合Dirichlet后验采样和Dempster-Shafer理论的框架，用于量化医学影像应用中SHAP解释的不确定性，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to its widespread adoption across diverse domains, including medical imaging. This progress is driven by increasingly sophisticated model architectures, such as ResNets, Vision Transformers, and Hybrid Convolutional Neural Networks, that offer enhanced performance at the cost of greater complexity. This complexity often compromises model explainability and interpretability. SHAP has emerged as a prominent method for providing interpretable visualizations that aid domain experts in understanding model predictions. However, SHAP explanations can be unstable and unreliable in the presence of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. In this study, we address this challenge by using Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify the uncertainty that arises from these unstable explanations in medical imaging applications. The framework uses a belief, plausible, and fusion map approach alongside statistical quantitative analysis to produce quantification of uncertainty in SHAP. Furthermore, we evaluated our framework on three medical imaging datasets with varying class distributions, image qualities, and modality types which introduces noise due to varying image resolutions and modality-specific aspect covering the examples from pathology, ophthalmology, and radiology, introducing significant epistemic uncertainty.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to jointly synthesize interactive videos and conversational speech from text and reference images. With the ultimate goal of building human-like conversational systems, recent studies have explored talking or listening head generation as well as conversational speech generation. However, these works are typically studied in isolation, overlooking the multimodal nature of human conversation, which involves tightly coupled audio-visual interactions. In this paper, we introduce TAVID, a unified framework that generates both interactive faces and conversational speech in a synchronized manner. TAVID integrates face and speech generation pipelines through two cross-modal mappers (i.e., a motion mapper and a speaker mapper), which enable bidirectional exchange of complementary information between the audio and visual modalities. We evaluate our system across four dimensions: talking face realism, listening head responsiveness, dyadic interaction fluency, and speech quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across all these aspects.

Conclusion: KeyTailor通过关键帧驱动的细节注入策略，有效提升了视频虚拟试穿的细节动态和背景完整性，同时避免了额外的计算复杂度。

Abstract: Although diffusion transformer (DiT)-based video virtual try-on (VVT) has made significant progress in synthesizing realistic videos, existing methods still struggle to capture fine-grained garment dynamics and preserve background integrity across video frames. They also incur high computational costs due to additional interaction modules introduced into DiTs, while the limited scale and quality of existing public datasets also restrict model generalization and effective training. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, KeyTailor, along with a large-scale, high-definition dataset, ViT-HD. The core idea of KeyTailor is a keyframe-driven details injection strategy, motivated by the fact that keyframes inherently contain both foreground dynamics and background consistency. Specifically, KeyTailor adopts an instruction-guided keyframe sampling strategy to filter informative frames from the input video. Subsequently,two tailored keyframe-driven modules, the garment details enhancement module and the collaborative background optimization module, are employed to distill garment dynamics into garment-related latents and to optimize the integrity of background latents, both guided by keyframes.These enriched details are then injected into standard DiT blocks together with pose, mask, and noise latents, enabling efficient and realistic try-on video synthesis. This design ensures consistency without explicitly modifying the DiT architecture, while simultaneously avoiding additional complexity. In addition, our dataset ViT-HD comprises 15, 070 high-quality video samples at a resolution of 810*1080, covering diverse garments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KeyTailor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of garment fidelity and background integrity across both dynamic and static scenarios.

Conclusion: CRAFT框架通过结构化推理显著提升了多模态图像生成的可靠性和准确性，尤其是轻量级生成器的表现。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that inference-time reasoning and reflection can improve text-to-image generation without retraining. However, existing approaches often rely on implicit, holistic critiques or unconstrained prompt rewrites, making their behavior difficult to interpret, control, or stop reliably. In contrast, large language models have benefited from explicit, structured forms of **thinking** based on verification, targeted correction, and early stopping.
  We introduce CRAFT (Continuous Reasoning and Agentic Feedback Tuning), a training-free, model-agnostic framework that brings this structured reasoning paradigm to multimodal image generation. CRAFT decomposes a prompt into dependency-structured visual questions, veries generated images using a vision-language model, and applies targeted prompt edits through an LLM agent only where constraints fail. The process iterates with an explicit stopping criterion once all constraints are satised, yielding an interpretable and controllable inference-time renement loop.
  Across multiple model families and challenging benchmarks, CRAFT consistently improves compositional accuracy, text rendering, and preference-based evaluations, with particularly strong gains for lightweight generators. Importantly, these improvements incur only a negligible inference-time overhead, allowing smaller or cheaper models to approach the quality of substantially more expensive systems. Our results suggest that explicitly structured, constraint-driven inference-time reasoning is a key ingredient for improving the reliability of multimodal generative models.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have accelerated the production of ultra-high-resolution visual content, posing significant challenges for efficient compression and real-time decoding on end-user devices. Inspired by 3D Gaussian Splatting, recent 2D Gaussian image models improve representation efficiency, yet existing methods struggle to balance compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. To address this issue, we propose SmartSplat, a highly adaptive and feature-aware GS-based image compression framework that supports arbitrary image resolutions and compression ratios. SmartSplat leverages image-aware features such as gradients and color variances, introducing a Gradient-Color Guided Variational Sampling strategy together with an Exclusion-based Uniform Sampling scheme to improve the non-overlapping coverage of Gaussian primitives in pixel space. In addition, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Color Sampling method to enhance color initialization across scales. Through joint optimization of spatial layout, scale, and color initialization, SmartSplat efficiently captures both local structures and global textures using a limited number of Gaussians, achieving high reconstruction quality under strong compression. Extensive experiments on DIV8K and a newly constructed 16K dataset demonstrate that SmartSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods at comparable compression ratios and exceeds their compression limits, showing strong scalability and practical applicability.

Abstract: Aligning egocentric video with wearable sensors have shown promise for human action recognition, but face practical limitations in user discomfort, privacy concerns, and scalability. We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives. Comprehensive experiments with downstream tasks on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines.

Abstract: Automated video surveillance with Large Vision-Language Models is limited by their inherent bias towards normality, often failing to detect crimes. While Chain-of-Thought reasoning strategies show significant potential for improving performance in language tasks, the lack of inductive anomaly biases in their reasoning further steers the models towards normal interpretations. To address this, we propose Chain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts (CoAT), a multi-agent reasoning framework that introduces inductive criminal bias in the reasoning process through a final, anomaly-focused classification layer. Our method significantly improves Anomaly Detection, boosting F1-score by 11.8 p.p. on challenging low-resolution footage and Anomaly Classification by 3.78 p.p. in high-resolution videos.

Abstract: Skin cancer can be identified by dermoscopic examination and ocular inspection, but early detection significantly increases survival chances. Artificial intelligence (AI), using annotated skin images and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), improves diagnostic accuracy. This paper presents an early skin cancer classification method using a soft voting ensemble of CNNs. In this investigation, three benchmark datasets, namely HAM10000, ISIC 2016, and ISIC 2019, were used. The process involved rebalancing, image augmentation, and filtering techniques, followed by a hybrid dual encoder for segmentation via transfer learning. Accurate segmentation focused classification models on clinically significant features, reducing background artifacts and improving accuracy. Classification was performed through an ensemble of MobileNetV2, VGG19, and InceptionV3, balancing accuracy and speed for real-world deployment. The method achieved lesion recognition accuracies of 96.32\%, 90.86\%, and 93.92\% for the three datasets. The system performance was evaluated using established skin lesion detection metrics, yielding impressive results.

Abstract: In the realm of diverse high-dimensional data, images play a significant role across various processes of manufacturing systems where efficient image anomaly detection has emerged as a core technology of utmost importance. However, when applied to textured defect images, conventional anomaly detection methods have limitations including non-negligible misidentification, low robustness, and excessive reliance on large-scale and structured datasets. This paper proposes a texture basis integrated smooth decomposition (TBSD) approach, which is targeted at efficient anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds and sparse anomalies. Mathematical formulation of quasi-periodicity and its theoretical properties are investigated for image texture estimation. TBSD method consists of two principal processes: the first process learns the texture basis functions to effectively extract quasi-periodic texture patterns; the subsequent anomaly detection process utilizes that texture basis as prior knowledge to prevent texture misidentification and capture potential anomalies with high accuracy.The proposed method surpasses benchmarks with less misidentification, smaller training dataset requirement, and superior anomaly detection performance on both simulation and real-world datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法大多忽视了关节驱动力等物理线索，而这些在生物力学中是基础性的。本研究旨在探讨物理推断的力是否以及何时能增强运动理解。

Method: 通过将力信号整合到现有的运动理解流程中，系统评估了其对步态识别、动作识别和细粒度视频描述三个主要任务的影响。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，整合力信号带来了性能的持续提升，例如在CASIA-B上，步态识别的Rank-1准确率从89.52%提升至90.39%（+0.87），在更具挑战性的条件下提升更大。

Conclusion: 力信号可以显著补充视觉和运动学特征，尤其在动态、遮挡或外观变化的条件下。

Abstract: Human motion understanding has advanced rapidly through vision-based progress in recognition, tracking, and captioning. However, most existing methods overlook physical cues such as joint actuation forces that are fundamental in biomechanics. This gap motivates our study: if and when do physically inferred forces enhance motion understanding? By incorporating forces into established motion understanding pipelines, we systematically evaluate their impact across baseline models on 3 major tasks: gait recognition, action recognition, and fine-grained video captioning. Across 8 benchmarks, incorporating forces yields consistent performance gains; for example, on CASIA-B, Rank-1 gait recognition accuracy improved from 89.52% to 90.39% (+0.87), with larger gain observed under challenging conditions: +2.7% when wearing a coat and +3.0% at the side view. On Gait3D, performance also increases from 46.0% to 47.3% (+1.3). In action recognition, CTR-GCN achieved +2.00% on Penn Action, while high-exertion classes like punching/slapping improved by +6.96%. Even in video captioning, Qwen2.5-VL's ROUGE-L score rose from 0.310 to 0.339 (+0.029), indicating that physics-inferred forces enhance temporal grounding and semantic richness. These results demonstrate that force cues can substantially complement visual and kinematic features under dynamic, occluded, or appearance-varying conditions.

Conclusion: UTDesign 框架在开源方法中实现了风格一致性和文本准确性的最先进性能，相比专有商业方法也展现出独特优势。

Abstract: AI-assisted graphic design has emerged as a powerful tool for automating the creation and editing of design elements such as posters, banners, and advertisements. While diffusion-based text-to-image models have demonstrated strong capabilities in visual content generation, their text rendering performance, particularly for small-scale typography and non-Latin scripts, remains limited. In this paper, we propose UTDesign, a unified framework for high-precision stylized text editing and conditional text generation in design images, supporting both English and Chinese scripts. Our framework introduces a novel DiT-based text style transfer model trained from scratch on a synthetic dataset, capable of generating transparent RGBA text foregrounds that preserve the style of reference glyphs. We further extend this model into a conditional text generation framework by training a multi-modal condition encoder on a curated dataset with detailed text annotations, enabling accurate, style-consistent text synthesis conditioned on background images, prompts, and layout specifications. Finally, we integrate our approach into a fully automated text-to-design (T2D) pipeline by incorporating pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models and an MLLM-based layout planner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UTDesign achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods in terms of stylistic consistency and text accuracy, and also exhibits unique advantages compared to proprietary commercial approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地雷是持续的人道主义威胁，每年造成26,000人伤亡，研究旨在通过无人机系统（UAS）结合热对比技术提高地表地雷检测效率。

Method: 使用YOLO架构（v8、v10、v11）对114张测试图像进行35,640次模型条件评估，结合RGB和LWIR融合技术。

Result: YOLOv11表现最佳（86.8% mAP），10-30%热融合在5-10m高度为最优参数；多时相训练数据集比季节特定方法表现更好。

Conclusion: 未来研究应量化不同土壤类型中不同埋藏深度的地雷的热对比效应。

Abstract: Landmines remain a persistent humanitarian threat, with 110 million actively deployed mines across 60 countries, claiming 26,000 casualties annually. This research evaluates adaptive Red-Green-Blue (RGB) and Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) fusion for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)-based detection of surface-laid landmines, leveraging the thermal contrast between the ordnance and the surrounding soil to enhance feature extraction. Using You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures (v8, v10, v11) across 114 test images, generating 35,640 model-condition evaluations, YOLOv11 achieved optimal performance (86.8% mAP), with 10 to 30% thermal fusion at 5 to 10m altitude identified as the optimal detection parameters. A complementary architectural comparison revealed that while RF-DETR achieved the highest accuracy (69.2% mAP), followed by Faster R-CNN (67.6%), YOLOv11 (64.2%), and RetinaNet (50.2%), YOLOv11 trained 17.7 times faster than the transformer-based RF-DETR (41 minutes versus 12 hours), presenting a critical accuracy-efficiency tradeoff for operational deployment. Aggregated multi-temporal training datasets outperformed season-specific approaches by 1.8 to 9.6%, suggesting that models benefit from exposure to diverse thermal conditions. Anti-Tank (AT) mines achieved 61.9% detection accuracy, compared with 19.2% for Anti-Personnel (AP) mines, reflecting both the size differential and thermal-mass differences between these ordnance classes. As this research examined surface-laid mines where thermal contrast is maximized, future research should quantify thermal contrast effects for mines buried at varying depths across heterogeneous soil types.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在快速运动、多物体交互和遮挡等复杂场景中难以保持运动保真度和时空一致性。

Method: 结合周期性激活的正弦表示网络和基于关键点的几何监督，引入物理启发约束，利用图神经网络建模关键点关系和结构相关性。

Result: 在Sintel、Bonn和DAVIS等基准测试中，SirenPose显著优于现有方法，如FVD降低17.8%，FID降低28.7%，LPIPS提升6.0%。

Conclusion: SirenPose在动态3D场景重建中表现出色，尤其在处理快速运动、多物体交互和遮挡等挑战性场景时，显著提升了时间一致性和几何精度。

Abstract: We introduce SirenPose, a geometry-aware loss formulation that integrates the periodic activation properties of sinusoidal representation networks with keypoint-based geometric supervision, enabling accurate and temporally consistent reconstruction of dynamic 3D scenes from monocular videos. Existing approaches often struggle with motion fidelity and spatiotemporal coherence in challenging settings involving fast motion, multi-object interaction, occlusion, and rapid scene changes. SirenPose incorporates physics inspired constraints to enforce coherent keypoint predictions across both spatial and temporal dimensions, while leveraging high frequency signal modeling to capture fine grained geometric details. We further expand the UniKPT dataset to 600,000 annotated instances and integrate graph neural networks to model keypoint relationships and structural correlations. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including Sintel, Bonn, and DAVIS demonstrate that SirenPose consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. On DAVIS, SirenPose achieves a 17.8 percent reduction in FVD, a 28.7 percent reduction in FID, and a 6.0 percent improvement in LPIPS compared to MoSCA. It also improves temporal consistency, geometric accuracy, user score, and motion smoothness. In pose estimation, SirenPose outperforms Monst3R with lower absolute trajectory error as well as reduced translational and rotational relative pose error, highlighting its effectiveness in handling rapid motion, complex dynamics, and physically plausible reconstruction.

TL;DR: AlignPose是一种无需对象特定训练的多视图6D姿态估计方法，通过特征度量细化优化姿态，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单视图RGB方法在深度模糊、杂乱和遮挡方面的局限性，同时避免现有多视图方法对单视图姿态估计的依赖或泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: AlignPose通过多视图特征度量细化优化对象姿态，最小化渲染对象特征与观察图像特征之间的差异。

Result: 在YCB-V、T-LESS、ITODD-MV和HouseCat6D数据集上，AlignPose优于其他已发表的方法。

Conclusion: AlignPose在多个数据集上表现出色，特别是在工业数据集上，证明了其多视图方法的有效性。

Abstract: Single-view RGB model-based object pose estimation methods achieve strong generalization but are fundamentally limited by depth ambiguity, clutter, and occlusions. Multi-view pose estimation methods have the potential to solve these issues, but existing works rely on precise single-view pose estimates or lack generalization to unseen objects. We address these challenges via the following three contributions. First, we introduce AlignPose, a 6D object pose estimation method that aggregates information from multiple extrinsically calibrated RGB views and does not require any object-specific training or symmetry annotation. Second, the key component of this approach is a new multi-view feature-metric refinement specifically designed for object pose. It optimizes a single, consistent world-frame object pose minimizing the feature discrepancy between on-the-fly rendered object features and observed image features across all views simultaneously. Third, we report extensive experiments on four datasets (YCB-V, T-LESS, ITODD-MV, HouseCat6D) using the BOP benchmark evaluation and show that AlignPose outperforms other published methods, especially on challenging industrial datasets where multiple views are readily available in practice.

Motivation: 现有方法通过粗粒度文本描述辅助图像融合，但难以理解细粒度细节并实现精确的跨模态对齐。MTIF旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: MTIF引入了多粒度文本描述，分别捕捉细节、结构线索和语义内容，通过分层跨模态调制模块引导图像融合。此外，采用显著性驱动增强模块来丰富训练数据。

Result: 实验表明，MTIF在多曝光和多焦点图像融合任务中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MTIF提出了一种新颖的多粒度文本引导图像融合范式，通过分层跨模态调制模块和密集语义内容增强，显著提升了融合质量，并在多曝光和多焦点图像融合任务中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Image fusion aims to synthesize a single high-quality image from a pair of inputs captured under challenging conditions, such as differing exposure levels or focal depths. A core challenge lies in effectively handling disparities in dynamic range and focus depth between the inputs. With the advent of vision-language models, recent methods incorporate textual descriptions as auxiliary guidance to enhance fusion quality. However, simply incorporating coarse-grained descriptions hampers the understanding of fine-grained details and poses challenges for precise cross-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-grained Text-guided Image Fusion (MTIF), a novel fusion paradigm with three key designs. First, it introduces multi-grained textual descriptions that separately capture fine details, structural cues, and semantic content, guiding image fusion through a hierarchical cross-modal modulation module. Second, it involves supervision signals at each granularity to facilitate alignment between visual and textual features and enhance the utility of auxiliary text. Third, it adopts a saliency-driven enrichment module to augment training data with dense semantic content, further strengthening the cross-modal modulation and alignment. Extensive experiments show that MTIF consistently outperforms previous methods on both multi-exposure and multi-focus image fusion tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在动态空间推理（DSR）方面表现较弱，主要由于缺乏可扩展的4D感知训练资源。

Method: 提出了轻量级的几何选择模块（GSM），将几何先验知识整合到视觉语言模型中，通过问题语义压缩和问题相关知识提取来优化模型。

Result: 实验表明，结合DSR-Train和GSM的模型在动态空间推理任务上表现显著提升，且不影响通用视频理解能力。

Conclusion: 整合DSR-Train和GSM的Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型显著提升了动态空间推理能力，同时保持通用视频理解的准确性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) excel at general understanding yet remain weak at dynamic spatial reasoning (DSR), i.e., reasoning about the evolvement of object geometry and relationship in 3D space over time, largely due to the scarcity of scalable 4D-aware training resources. To bridge this gap across aspects of dataset, benchmark and model, we introduce DSR Suite. First, we propose an automated pipeline that generates multiple-choice question-answer pairs from in-the-wild videos for DSR. By leveraging modern vision foundation models, the pipeline extracts rich geometric and motion information, including camera poses, local point clouds, object masks, orientations, and 3D trajectories. These geometric cues enable the construction of DSR-Train for learning and further human-refined DSR-Bench for evaluation. Compared with previous works, our data emphasize (i) in-the-wild video sources, (ii) object- and scene-level 3D requirements, (iii) viewpoint transformations, (iv) multi-object interactions, and (v) fine-grained, procedural answers. Beyond data, we propose a lightweight Geometry Selection Module (GSM) to seamlessly integrate geometric priors into VLMs, which condenses question semantics and extracts question-relevant knowledge from pretrained 4D reconstruction priors into a compact set of geometry tokens. This targeted extraction avoids overwhelming the model with irrelevant knowledge. Experiments show that integrating DSR-Train and GSM into Qwen2.5-VL-7B significantly enhances its dynamic spatial reasoning capability, while maintaining accuracy on general video understanding benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的令牌减少方法通常忽略文本查询或依赖不稳定的深度注意力图，导致语义对齐下降。

Method: FlashVLM提出了一种文本引导的视觉令牌选择框架，通过计算图像令牌与文本嵌入之间的显式跨模态相似性，并结合视觉显著性进行令牌选择。

Result: 在相同的令牌预算和评估协议下，FlashVLM在LLaVA 1.5上实现了高达77.8%的令牌修剪，同时保持了92.8%的准确率。

Conclusion: FlashVLM通过动态调整视觉输入以适应查询，实现了超越无损压缩的性能，同时在主流VLMs中保持了强大的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) typically process hundreds or thousands of visual tokens per image or video frame, incurring quadratic attention cost and substantial redundancy. Existing token reduction methods often ignore the textual query or rely on deep attention maps, whose instability under aggressive pruning leads to degraded semantic alignment.
  We propose FlashVLM, a text guided visual token selection framework that dynamically adapts visual inputs to the query. Instead of relying on noisy attention weights, FlashVLM computes an explicit cross modal similarity between projected image tokens and normalized text embeddings in the language model space. This extrinsic relevance is fused with intrinsic visual saliency using log domain weighting and temperature controlled sharpening. In addition, a diversity preserving partition retains a minimal yet representative set of background tokens to maintain global context.
  Under identical token budgets and evaluation protocols, FlashVLM achieves beyond lossless compression, slightly surpassing the unpruned baseline while pruning up to 77.8 percent of visual tokens on LLaVA 1.5, and maintaining 92.8 percent accuracy even under 94.4 percent compression. Extensive experiments on 14 image and video benchmarks demonstrate that FlashVLM delivers state of the art efficiency performance trade offs while maintaining strong robustness and generalization across mainstream VLMs.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖浅层卷积主干（如ResNet），缺乏时间一致性，在挑战性条件下匹配成本不可靠。视频DiTs因预训练于大规模真实视频，具备时空注意力，天然具有强点跟踪能力。

Method: DiTracker通过(1)查询-键注意力匹配，(2)轻量级LoRA调优，(3)与ResNet主干的成本融合，适配视频DiTs。

Result: DiTracker在ITTO基准上达到最先进性能，在TAP-Vid基准上匹配或超越现有模型。

Conclusion: DiTracker验证了视频DiT特征作为点跟踪任务的有效且高效的基础，尽管训练批次小8倍，仍在ITTO和TAP-Vid基准上达到或超越最先进性能。

Abstract: Point tracking aims to localize corresponding points across video frames, serving as a fundamental task for 4D reconstruction, robotics, and video editing. Existing methods commonly rely on shallow convolutional backbones such as ResNet that process frames independently, lacking temporal coherence and producing unreliable matching costs under challenging conditions. Through systematic analysis, we find that video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), pre-trained on large-scale real-world videos with spatio-temporal attention, inherently exhibit strong point tracking capability and robustly handle dynamic motions and frequent occlusions. We propose DiTracker, which adapts video DiTs through: (1) query-key attention matching, (2) lightweight LoRA tuning, and (3) cost fusion with a ResNet backbone. Despite training with 8 times smaller batch size, DiTracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging ITTO benchmark and matches or outperforms state-of-the-art models on TAP-Vid benchmarks. Our work validates video DiT features as an effective and efficient foundation for point tracking.

Motivation: FedPIDAvg在性能提升和通信成本减少方面表现良好，但其排除异常参与者和依赖先前轮次学习信息的局限性促使了FedPOD的开发。

Method: FedPOD通过包括被排除的异常参与者、消除对先前轮次学习信息的依赖，并在每轮应用验证损失计算方法，解决了FedPIDAvg的局限性。

Result: FedPOD在Dice分数（WT、ET和TC平均分别为0.78、0.71和0.72）和平均收敛分数（0.74）上表现与FedPIDAvg相当。

Conclusion: FedPOD展示了通过提高效率、灵活性和性能指标来增强联邦学习的潜力，特别是在兼容Kubernetes自动扩展方面。

Abstract: This paper proposes FedPOD (Proportionally Orchestrated Derivative) for optimizing learning efficiency and communication cost in federated learning among multiple clients. Inspired by FedPIDAvg, we define a round-wise task for FedPOD to enhance training efficiency. FedPIDAvg achieved performance improvement by incorporating the training loss reduction for prediction entropy as weights using differential terms. Furthermore, by modeling data distribution with a Poisson distribution and using a PID controller, it reduced communication costs even in skewed data distribution. However, excluding participants classified as outliers based on the Poisson distribution can limit data utilization. Additionally, PID controller requires the same participants to be maintained throughout the federated learning process as it uses previous rounds' learning information in the current round. In our approach, FedPOD addresses these issues by including participants excluded as outliers, eliminating dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and applying a method for calculating validation loss at each round. In this challenge, FedPOD presents comparable performance to FedPIDAvg in metrics of Dice score, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.72 for WT, ET and TC in average, and projected convergence score, 0.74 in average. Furthermore, the concept of FedPOD draws inspiration from Kubernetes' smallest computing unit, POD, designed to be compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling. Extending round-wise tasks of FedPOD to POD units allows flexible design by applying scale-out similar to Kubernetes' auto-scaling. This work demonstrated the potentials of FedPOD to enhance federated learning by improving efficiency, flexibility, and performance in metrics.

Conclusion: ORCA框架通过结合内部世界模型（IWM）能力和闭环OTAR周期，显著提升了视频虚拟形象的自主性和目标导向行为，验证了其在开放域场景中的多步任务完成能力。

Abstract: Current video avatar generation methods excel at identity preservation and motion alignment but lack genuine agency, they cannot autonomously pursue long-term goals through adaptive environmental interaction. We address this by introducing L-IVA (Long-horizon Interactive Visual Avatar), a task and benchmark for evaluating goal-directed planning in stochastic generative environments, and ORCA (Online Reasoning and Cognitive Architecture), the first framework enabling active intelligence in video avatars. ORCA embodies Internal World Model (IWM) capabilities through two key innovations: (1) a closed-loop OTAR cycle (Observe-Think-Act-Reflect) that maintains robust state tracking under generative uncertainty by continuously verifying predicted outcomes against actual generations, and (2) a hierarchical dual-system architecture where System 2 performs strategic reasoning with state prediction while System 1 translates abstract plans into precise, model-specific action captions. By formulating avatar control as a POMDP and implementing continuous belief updating with outcome verification, ORCA enables autonomous multi-step task completion in open-domain scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ORCA significantly outperforms open-loop and non-reflective baselines in task success rate and behavioral coherence, validating our IWM-inspired design for advancing video avatar intelligence from passive animation to active, goal-oriented behavior.

TL;DR: SpatialTree是一个认知科学启发的层次化框架，用于评估和提升MLLMs的空间能力，揭示了技能间的转移动态，并提出优化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解MLLMs中空间能力的层次结构，填补现有研究对多任务关注的不足。

Method: 基于认知科学启发的层次结构（SpatialTree），构建了首个以能力为中心的层次化基准，评估了主流MLLMs在27个子能力上的表现。通过有针对性的监督微调，探索了能力间的转移动态。

Result: 评估结果显示L1技能相对独立，而高级技能高度相关。监督微调揭示了L1内的负转移和低到高能力的强跨级转移。提出了一种简单的自动思考策略，抑制不必要的思考，使RL能一致提升所有层次的表现。

Conclusion: SpatialTree提供了一个概念验证框架，用于理解和系统性地扩展MLLMs中的空间能力。

Abstract: Cognitive science suggests that spatial ability develops progressively-from perception to reasoning and interaction. Yet in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), this hierarchy remains poorly understood, as most studies focus on a narrow set of tasks. We introduce SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy that organizes spatial abilities into four levels: low-level perception (L1), mental mapping (L2), simulation (L3), and agentic competence (L4). Based on this taxonomy, we construct the first capability-centric hierarchical benchmark, thoroughly evaluating mainstream MLLMs across 27 sub-abilities. The evaluation results reveal a clear structure: L1 skills are largely orthogonal, whereas higher-level skills are strongly correlated, indicating increasing interdependency. Through targeted supervised fine-tuning, we uncover a surprising transfer dynamic-negative transfer within L1, but strong cross-level transfer from low- to high-level abilities with notable synergy. Finally, we explore how to improve the entire hierarchy. We find that naive RL that encourages extensive "thinking" is unreliable: it helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception. We propose a simple auto-think strategy that suppresses unnecessary deliberation, enabling RL to consistently improve performance across all levels. By building SpatialTree, we provide a proof-of-concept framework for understanding and systematically scaling spatial abilities in MLLMs.

TL;DR: SemanticGen提出在语义空间生成视频的两阶段方法，显著提升效率和质量，尤其在长视频中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在VAE潜在空间中直接建模低层级视频标记，导致收敛慢且计算成本高。

Method: 采用两阶段生成过程：首先通过扩散模型生成紧凑的语义视频特征，再基于这些特征生成VAE潜在空间以输出最终视频。

Result: 实验表明，SemanticGen在生成质量和效率上优于现有方法，尤其适用于长视频生成。

Conclusion: SemanticGen通过在高层次语义空间生成视频，显著提升了生成效率和质量，尤其在长视频生成中表现出色。

Abstract: State-of-the-art video generative models typically learn the distribution of video latents in the VAE space and map them to pixels using a VAE decoder. While this approach can generate high-quality videos, it suffers from slow convergence and is computationally expensive when generating long videos. In this paper, we introduce SemanticGen, a novel solution to address these limitations by generating videos in the semantic space. Our main insight is that, due to the inherent redundancy in videos, the generation process should begin in a compact, high-level semantic space for global planning, followed by the addition of high-frequency details, rather than directly modeling a vast set of low-level video tokens using bi-directional attention. SemanticGen adopts a two-stage generation process. In the first stage, a diffusion model generates compact semantic video features, which define the global layout of the video. In the second stage, another diffusion model generates VAE latents conditioned on these semantic features to produce the final output. We observe that generation in the semantic space leads to faster convergence compared to the VAE latent space. Our method is also effective and computationally efficient when extended to long video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemanticGen produces high-quality videos and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅测量种子执行路径与目标位置之间的物理距离，忽视了代码段间的逻辑关系，导致在复杂二进制文件中产生冗余或误导性指导。

Method: 提出了一种名为注意力距离的新度量标准，利用大型语言模型的上下文分析来计算代码元素间的注意力分数。

Result: 在38个真实漏洞复现实验中，注意力距离使测试效率平均提高了3.43倍，相比DAFL和WindRanger分别提升了2.89倍和7.13倍。

Conclusion: 引入注意力距离显著提升了定向灰盒模糊测试的效率，且在现有工具中具有通用性。

Abstract: In the domain of software security testing, Directed Grey-Box Fuzzing (DGF) has garnered widespread attention for its efficient target localization and excellent detection performance. However, existing approaches measure only the physical distance between seed execution paths and target locations, overlooking logical relationships among code segments. This omission can yield redundant or misleading guidance in complex binaries, weakening DGF's real-world effectiveness. To address this, we introduce \textbf{attention distance}, a novel metric that leverages a large language model's contextual analysis to compute attention scores between code elements and reveal their intrinsic connections. Under the same AFLGo configuration -- without altering any fuzzing components other than the distance metric -- replacing physical distances with attention distances across 38 real vulnerability reproduction experiments delivers a \textbf{3.43$\times$} average increase in testing efficiency over the traditional method. Compared to state-of-the-art directed fuzzers DAFL and WindRanger, our approach achieves \textbf{2.89$\times$} and \textbf{7.13$\times$} improvements, respectively. To further validate the generalizability of attention distance, we integrate it into DAFL and WindRanger, where it also consistently enhances their original performance. All related code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/TheBinKing/Attention\_Distance.git.

Motivation: 现有系统将代理逻辑与特定编程语言和部署模型紧密耦合，限制了灵活性和开发效率。

Method: 论文提出了一种声明式系统，通过统一的领域特定语言（DSL）表达代理工作流，将逻辑与实现解耦，支持多后端语言和部署环境。

Result: 在PayPal的真实电商工作流中，该系统实现了开发时间减少60%，部署速度提升3倍，且非工程师也能安全修改代理行为。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的声明式系统通过统一的DSL显著简化了LLM代理的开发与部署，实现了跨语言和环境的灵活执行，并大幅提升了开发效率和部署速度。

Abstract: Building deployment-ready LLM agents requires complex orchestration of tools, data sources, and control flow logic, yet existing systems tightly couple agent logic to specific programming languages and deployment models. We present a declarative system that separates agent workflow specification from implementation, enabling the same pipeline definition to execute across multiple backend languages (Java, Python, Go) and deployment environments (cloud-native, on-premises).
  Our key insight is that most agent workflows consist of common patterns -- data serialization, filtering, RAG retrieval, API orchestration -- that can be expressed through a unified DSL rather than imperative code. This approach transforms agent development from application programming to configuration, where adding new tools or fine-tuning agent behaviors requires only pipeline specification changes, not code deployment. Our system natively supports A/B testing of agent strategies, allowing multiple pipeline variants to run on the same backend infrastructure with automatic metric collection and comparison.
  We evaluate our approach on real-world e-commerce workflows at PayPal, processing millions of daily interactions. Our results demonstrate 60% reduction in development time, and 3x improvement in deployment velocity compared to imperative implementations. The language's declarative approach enables non-engineers to modify agent behaviors safely, while maintaining sub-100ms orchestration overhead. We show that complex workflows involving product search, personalization, and cart management can be expressed in under 50 lines of DSL compared to 500+ lines of imperative code.

Method: 提出了一种基于CodeT5+的Just-In-Time CCI检测方法，通过将代码变更分解为有序的修改活动序列（如替换、删除、添加），以更有效地捕捉变更与过时注释之间的关联。

Result: 在JITDATA和CCIBENCH基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在F1-Score上比现有最先进模型提升高达13.54%，对微调LLMs（如DeepSeek-Coder、CodeLlama和Qwen2.5-Coder）的改进范围为4.18%至10.94%。

Conclusion: 本文提出的基于CodeT5+的Just-In-Time CCI检测方法，通过分解代码变更活动并捕捉其与过时注释的关联，显著提升了检测性能，超越了现有最先进模型和微调LLMs的表现。

Abstract: Ensuring semantic consistency between source code and its accompanying comments is crucial for program comprehension, effective debugging, and long-term maintainability. Comment inconsistency arises when developers modify code but neglect to update the corresponding comments, potentially misleading future maintainers and introducing errors. Recent approaches to code-comment inconsistency (CCI) detection leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) and rely on capturing the semantic relationship between code changes and outdated comments. However, they often ignore the structural complexity of code evolution, including historical change activities, and introduce privacy and resource challenges. In this paper, we propose a Just-In-Time CCI detection approach built upon the CodeT5+ backbone. Our method decomposes code changes into ordered sequences of modification activities such as replacing, deleting, and adding to more effectively capture the correlation between these changes and the corresponding outdated comments. Extensive experiments conducted on publicly available benchmark datasets-JITDATA and CCIBENCH--demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms recent state-of-the-art models by up to 13.54% in F1-Score and achieves an improvement ranging from 4.18% to 10.94% over fine-tuned LLMs including DeepSeek-Coder, CodeLlama and Qwen2.5-Coder.

Conclusion: 研究发现代码语言模型存在语言特定神经元和概念层，这些结构在多语言代码生成、克隆检测和代码摘要等任务中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Code language models excel on code intelligence tasks, yet their internal interpretability is underexplored. Existing neuron interpretability techniques from NLP are suboptimal for source code due to programming languages formal, hierarchical, and executable nature. We empirically investigate code LLMs at the neuron level, localizing language-specific neurons (selectively responsive to one language) and concept layers (feed-forward layers encoding language-agnostic code representations). We analyze Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B on multilingual inputs in C++, Java, Python, Go, and JavaScript, measuring neuron selectivity and layerwise contributions during generation. We find (1) neurons specialized for individual languages alongside a universal subset supporting general-purpose generation; and (2) lower layers mainly encode language-specific syntax, while middle layers capture semantic abstractions shared across languages, emerging as concept layers. We demonstrate utility on three tasks: neuron-guided fine-tuning for code generation, clone detection via concept-layer embeddings, and concept-layer-guided transfer for code summarization, each yielding consistent gains in multilingual settings.

Motivation: 当前评估方法主要关注功能正确性，忽视了生成计划的非功能最优性，导致性能下降和资源浪费。本文识别并形式化了非最优决策（NoDs）问题。

Method: 提出了NoD-DGMT框架，通过多样性引导的蜕变测试检测非最优决策，设计了四种新的蜕变关系来捕捉基本最优性属性，并引入多样性引导的选择策略以提高检测效率。

Result: 在AI2-THOR模拟器上对四种最先进的规划模型进行了广泛实验，NoD-DGMT平均实现了31.9%的违规检测率，多样性引导过滤器将检测率提高了4.3%，多样性得分提高了3.3。

Conclusion: NoD-DGMT显著优于六种基线方法，相对最佳基线提高了16.8%，并在不同模型架构和任务复杂度下表现一致优越。

Abstract: As embodied agents advance toward real-world deployment, ensuring optimal decisions becomes critical for resource-constrained applications. Current evaluation methods focus primarily on functional correctness, overlooking the non-functional optimality of generated plans. This gap can lead to significant performance degradation and resource waste. We identify and formalize the problem of Non-optimal Decisions (NoDs), where agents complete tasks successfully but inefficiently. We present NoD-DGMT, a systematic framework for detecting NoDs in embodied agent task planning via diversity-guided metamorphic testing. Our key insight is that optimal planners should exhibit invariant behavioral properties under specific transformations. We design four novel metamorphic relations capturing fundamental optimality properties: position detour suboptimality, action optimality completeness, condition refinement monotonicity, and scene perturbation invariance. To maximize detection efficiency, we introduce a diversity-guided selection strategy that actively selects test cases exploring different violation categories, avoiding redundant evaluations while ensuring comprehensive diversity coverage. Extensive experiments on the AI2-THOR simulator with four state-of-the-art planning models demonstrate that NoD-DGMT achieves violation detection rates of 31.9% on average, with our diversity-guided filter improving rates by 4.3% and diversity scores by 3.3 on average. NoD-DGMT significantly outperforms six baseline methods, with 16.8% relative improvement over the best baseline, and demonstrates consistent superiority across different model architectures and task complexities.

Conclusion: AXIOM框架通过规则引导的扰动和多源质量校准，成功构建了多样化和评分平衡的代码评估基准，解决了现有基准的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly deployed in real-world software engineering, fostering the development of code evaluation metrics to study the quality of LLM-generated code. Conventional rule-based metrics merely score programs based on their surface-level similarities with reference programs instead of analyzing functionality and code quality in depth. To address this limitation, researchers have developed LLM-as-a-judge metrics, prompting LLMs to evaluate and score code, and curated various code evaluation benchmarks to validate their effectiveness. However, these benchmarks suffer from critical limitations, hindering reliable assessments of evaluation capability: Some feature coarse-grained binary labels, which reduce rich code behavior to a single bit of information, obscuring subtle errors. Others propose fine-grained but subjective, vaguely-defined evaluation criteria, introducing unreliability in manually-annotated scores, which is the ground-truth they rely on. Furthermore, they often use uncontrolled data synthesis methods, leading to unbalanced score distributions that poorly represent real-world code generation scenarios.
  To curate a diverse benchmark with programs of well-balanced distributions across various quality levels and streamline the manual annotation procedure, we propose AXIOM, a novel perturbation-based framework for synthesizing code evaluation benchmarks at scale. It reframes program scores as the refinement effort needed for deployment, consisting of two stages: (1) Rule-guided perturbation, which prompts LLMs to apply sequences of predefined perturbation rules to existing high-quality programs to modify their functionality and code quality, enabling us to precisely control each program's target score to achieve balanced score distributions. (2) Multisource quality calibration, which first selects a subset of...

Motivation: 现有基于大型语言模型的漏洞修复方法存在两个主要限制：1) 忽略修补位置信息，仅关注修复内容；2) 缺乏对迭代过程中生成的候选补丁的质量评估。

Method: \sysname 是一个基于大型语言模型的方法，首先提供需要修补的位置信息，并通过评估测试失败补丁的质量来改进迭代修复策略。评估维度包括是否引入新漏洞和污点语句覆盖率。

Result: 在 VulnLoc+ 数据集上的实验结果显示，\sysname 生成了 27 个合理补丁，比基线方法多修复了 8 至 13 个漏洞。

Conclusion: \sysname 在自动修复软件漏洞方面表现出显著改进，能够生成更多合理的补丁，并修复更多漏洞，优于现有方法。

Abstract: The advances of large language models (LLMs) have paved the way for automated software vulnerability repair approaches, which iteratively refine the patch until it becomes plausible. Nevertheless, existing LLM-based vulnerability repair approaches face notable limitations: 1) they ignore the concern of locations that need to be patched and focus solely on the repair content. 2) they lack quality assessment for generated candidate patches in the iterative process.
  To tackle the two limitations, we propose \sysname, an LLM-based approach that provides information about where should be patched first. Furthermore, \sysname improves the iterative repair strategy by assessing the quality of test-failing patches and selecting the best patch for the next iteration. We introduce two dimensions to assess the quality of patches: whether they introduce new vulnerabilities and the taint statement coverage. We evaluated \sysname on a real-world C/C++ vulnerability repair dataset VulnLoc+, which contains 40 vulnerabilities and their Proofs-of-Vulnerability. The experimental results demonstrate that \sysname exhibits substantial improvements compared with the Neural Machine Translation-based, Program Analysis-based, and LLM-based state-of-the-art vulnerability repair approaches. Specifically, \sysname is able to generate 27 plausible patches, which is comparable to or even 8 to 22 more plausible patches than the baselines. In terms of correct patch generation, \sysname repairs 8 to 13 additional vulnerabilities compared with existing approaches.

Conclusion: FeatureSHAP 是软件工程领域向实用可解释AI迈进的重要一步，其通过高保真度的解释帮助从业者更好地理解模型输出并做出明智决策。

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has substantially advanced the automation of software engineering (SE) tasks, enabling complex activities such as code generation and code summarization. However, the black-box nature of LLMs remains a major barrier to their adoption in high-stakes and safety-critical domains, where explainability and transparency are vital for trust, accountability, and effective human supervision. Despite increasing interest in explainable AI for software engineering, existing methods lack domain-specific explanations aligned with how practitioners reason about SE artifacts. To address this gap, we introduce FeatureSHAP, the first fully automated, model-agnostic explainability framework tailored to software engineering tasks. Based on Shapley values, FeatureSHAP attributes model outputs to high-level input features through systematic input perturbation and task-specific similarity comparisons, while remaining compatible with both open-source and proprietary LLMs. We evaluate FeatureSHAP on two bi-modal SE tasks: code generation and code summarization. The results show that FeatureSHAP assigns less importance to irrelevant input features and produces explanations with higher fidelity than baseline methods. A practitioner survey involving 37 participants shows that FeatureSHAP helps practitioners better interpret model outputs and make more informed decisions. Collectively, FeatureSHAP represents a meaningful step toward practical explainable AI in software engineering. FeatureSHAP is available at https://github.com/deviserlab/FeatureSHAP.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在代码生成领域发展迅速，但现有研究多关注代码上下文对缺陷生成的影响，而忽略了注释代码中缺陷的潜在影响。AI编程助手对注释代码的解读可能影响其生成代码的质量。

Method: 本研究通过实验评估了GitHub Copilot和Cursor在存在缺陷注释代码的上下文中的表现，分析了生成代码的缺陷率及其行为模式。

Result: 实验结果显示，存在缺陷的注释代码会导致AI编程助手生成更多缺陷代码（最高达58.17%），且工具会主动推理并补全不完整的缺陷模式，而非简单复制缺陷代码。即使明确忽略缺陷注释代码，缺陷减少效果仍有限。

Conclusion: 研究发现，AI编程助手（如GitHub Copilot和Cursor）在生成代码时容易受到注释代码（CO code）中缺陷的影响，即使明确指示忽略这些缺陷，缺陷减少的效果有限（不超过21.84%）。这突显了提升AI编程助手鲁棒性和安全性的必要性。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models in code generation, AI-powered editors such as GitHub Copilot and Cursor are revolutionizing software development practices. At the same time, studies have identified potential defects in the generated code. Previous research has predominantly examined how code context influences the generation of defective code, often overlooking the impact of defects within commented-out code (CO code). AI coding assistants' interpretation of CO code in prompts affects the code they generate.
  This study evaluates how AI coding assistants, GitHub Copilot and Cursor, are influenced by defective CO code. The experimental results show that defective CO code in the context causes AI coding assistants to generate more defective code, reaching up to 58.17 percent. Our findings further demonstrate that the tools do not simply copy the defective code from the context. Instead, they actively reason to complete incomplete defect patterns and continue to produce defective code despite distractions such as incorrect indentation or tags. Even with explicit instructions to ignore the defective CO code, the reduction in defects does not exceed 21.84 percent. These findings underscore the need for improved robustness and security measures in AI coding assistants.

Abstract: In today's data-driven era, deep learning is vital for processing massive datasets, yet single-device training is constrained by computational and memory limits. Distributed deep learning overcomes these challenges by leveraging multiple GPUs or machines in parallel. While general-purpose frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow and PyTorch) provide distributed capabilities, these are often add-on features that demand significant manual effort for advanced parallelism, underscoring the need for specialized frameworks. This study conducts the first large-scale empirical analysis of practitioner challenges in dedicated distributed frameworks. We examine 849 real-world issues from DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI and construct a taxonomy of 34 bug symptoms, 28 root causes, and 6 fix patterns. Crucially, we establish explicit mappings between symptoms, causes, and fixes across distributed training stages, enabling a systematic understanding of how issues emerge and are resolved. Our results show that 45.1\% of bug symptoms are unique to distributed frameworks, with setup failures, memory issues, and performance anomalies being the most prevalent. Moreover, 95\% of issues in the communication setup stage occur exclusively in distributed contexts. We also find over 60\% of cases can be resolved through version and dependency management, and distributed feature, API, and communication tuning. Based on these findings, we provide actionable implications.

Abstract: Service-based architecture (SBA) has gained attention in industry and academia as a means to modernize legacy systems. It refers to a design style that enables systems to be developed as suites of small, loosely coupled, and autonomous components (services) that encapsulate functionality and communicate via language-agnostic APIs. However, defining appropriately sized services that capture cohesive subsets of system functionality remains challenging. Existing work often relies on the availability of documentation, access to project personnel, or a priori knowledge of the target number of services, assumptions that do not hold in many real-world scenarios. Our work addresses these limitations using a deep reinforcement learning-based approach to identify appropriately sized services directly from implementation artifacts. We present Rake, a reinforcement learning-based technique that leverages available system documentation and source code to guide service decomposition at the level of implementation methods. Rake does not require specific documentation or access to project personnel and is language-agnostic. It also supports a customizable objective function that balances modularization quality and business capability alignment, i.e., the degree to which a service covers the targeted business capability. We applied Rake to four open-source legacy projects and compared it with two state-of-the-art techniques. On average, Rake achieved 7-14 percent higher modularization quality and 18-22 percent stronger business capability alignment. Our results further show that optimizing solely for business context can degrade decomposition quality in tightly coupled systems, highlighting the need for balanced objectives.

TL;DR: SweRank+通过跨语言代码排名工具和代理搜索设置，显著提升了多语言代码库问题定位的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有排名方法通常以Python为中心且仅支持单次搜索，难以满足多语言大规模代码库的问题定位需求。

Method: SweRank+结合了SweRankMulti（跨语言代码排名工具）和SweRankAgent（代理搜索设置）。SweRankMulti包含代码嵌入检索器和列表式LLM重新排序器，并基于多语言问题定位数据集训练。SweRankAgent采用代理搜索循环，通过记忆缓冲区在多轮推理中积累候选定位。

Result: 实验表明，SweRankMulti在多语言问题定位基准测试中达到最新性能，SweRankAgent进一步提升了单次排名的定位效果。

Conclusion: SweRank+框架通过结合SweRankMulti和SweRankAgent，在多语言代码库中实现了更准确的问题定位，显著提升了现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Maintaining large-scale, multilingual codebases hinges on accurately localizing issues, which requires mapping natural-language error descriptions to the relevant functions that need to be modified. However, existing ranking approaches are often Python-centric and perform a single-pass search over the codebase. This work introduces SweRank+, a framework that couples SweRankMulti, a cross-lingual code ranking tool, with SweRankAgent, an agentic search setup, for iterative, multi-turn reasoning over the code repository. SweRankMulti comprises a code embedding retriever and a listwise LLM reranker, and is trained using a carefully curated large-scale issue localization dataset spanning multiple popular programming languages. SweRankAgent adopts an agentic search loop that moves beyond single-shot localization with a memory buffer to reason and accumulate relevant localization candidates over multiple turns. Our experiments on issue localization benchmarks spanning various languages demonstrate new state-of-the-art performance with SweRankMulti, while SweRankAgent further improves localization over single-pass ranking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决状态估计中方向分量的问题，并应对UWB定位中常见的非视距和多径效应带来的噪声挑战。

Method: 将ESGVI算法扩展到矩阵李群上，并引入因子以适应重尾和偏态噪声分布。

Result: 在UWB定位实验中，新方法显示出更高的准确性和可比的一致性。

Conclusion: 该论文通过扩展ESGVI算法，成功实现了在矩阵李群上的状态估计，并引入了因子来处理重尾和偏态噪声分布，在UWB定位实验中验证了其准确性和一致性。

Abstract: This letter extends the exactly sparse Gaussian variational inference (ESGVI) algorithm for state estimation in two complementary directions. First, ESGVI is generalized to operate on matrix Lie groups, enabling the estimation of states with orientation components while respecting the underlying group structure. Second, factors are introduced to accommodate heavy-tailed and skewed noise distributions, as commonly encountered in ultra-wideband (UWB) localization due to non-line-of-sight (NLOS) and multipath effects. Both extensions are shown to integrate naturally within the ESGVI framework while preserving its sparse and derivative-free structure. The proposed approach is validated in a UWB localization experiment with NLOS-rich measurements, demonstrating improved accuracy and comparable consistency. Finally, a Python implementation within a factor-graph-based estimation framework is made open-source (https://github.com/decargroup/gvi_ws) to support broader research use.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于优先级调度的高效算法，显著提升了无人机群初始编队的效率和可扩展性，成功实现了多达5000架无人机的无碰撞轨迹生成。

Abstract: Drone applications continue to expand across various domains, with flocking offering enhanced cooperative capabilities but introducing significant challenges during initial formation. Existing flocking algorithms often struggle with efficiency and scalability, particularly when potential collisions force drones into suboptimal trajectories. This paper presents a time-efficient prioritised scheduling algorithm that improves the initial formation process of drone flocks. The method assigns each drone a priority based on its number of potential collisions and its likelihood of reaching its target position without permanently obstructing other drones. Using this hierarchy, each drone computes an appropriate delay to ensure a collision-free path. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm successfully generates collision-free trajectories for flocks of up to 5000 drones and outperforms the coupling-degree-based heuristic prioritised planning method (CDH-PP) in both performance and computational efficiency.

Motivation: 解决VLA模型在个性化指令（如“拿我的杯子”）中难以处理视觉相似对象的问题。

Method: 提出了一种无需训练的感知适配器VAP，通过开放词汇检测和嵌入匹配，将个性化对象定位为视觉提示，并通过高亮和指令重写注入模型。

Result: VAP在仿真和真实世界基准测试中均优于通用策略和基于token学习的方法，成功率和正确对象操作率均有提升。

Conclusion: VAP（Visual Attentive Prompting）通过视觉提示和指令重写，显著提升了VLA模型在个性化对象操作任务中的表现，缩小了语义理解与实例级控制之间的差距。

Abstract: While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models generalize well to generic instructions, they struggle with personalized commands such as "bring my cup", where the robot must act on one specific instance among visually similar objects. We study this setting of manipulating personal objects, in which a VLA must identify and control a user-specific object unseen during training using only a few reference images. To address this challenge, we propose Visual Attentive Prompting (VAP), a simple-yet-effective training-free perceptual adapter that equips frozen VLAs with top-down selective attention. VAP treats the reference images as a non-parametric visual memory, grounds the personal object in the scene through open-vocabulary detection and embedding-based matching, and then injects this grounding as a visual prompt by highlighting the object and rewriting the instruction. We construct two simulation benchmarks, Personalized-SIMPLER and Personalized-VLABench, and a real-world tabletop benchmark to evaluate personalized manipulation across multiple robots and tasks. Experiments show that VAP consistently outperforms generic policies and token-learning baselines in both success rate and correct-object manipulation, helping to bridge the gap between semantic understanding and instance-level control.

Motivation: 现有视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型往往忽视历史信息和连贯动作序列生成的能力，导致长视野机器人操作任务表现不佳。

Method: 提出LoLA框架，利用视觉语言模型编码历史序列和多视角观察的上下文特征，并引入状态感知潜在重表示模块，将视觉输入和语言命令转化为可执行的机器人动作空间。

Result: 在仿真基准（SIMPLER和LIBERO）及真实任务（Franka和Bi-Manual Aloha机器人）中，LoLA显著优于现有方法（如pi0）。

Conclusion: LoLA框架通过整合长期多视角观察和机器人本体感知，显著提升了长视野机器人操作任务的性能，优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: The capability of performing long-horizon, language-guided robotic manipulation tasks critically relies on leveraging historical information and generating coherent action sequences. However, such capabilities are often overlooked by existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. To solve this challenge, we propose LoLA (Long Horizon Latent Action Learning), a framework designed for robot manipulation that integrates long-term multi-view observations and robot proprioception to enable multi-step reasoning and action generation. We first employ Vision-Language Models to encode rich contextual features from historical sequences and multi-view observations. We further introduces a key module, State-Aware Latent Re-representation, which transforms visual inputs and language commands into actionable robot motion space. Unlike existing VLA approaches that merely concatenate robot proprioception (e.g., joint angles) with VL embeddings, this module leverages such robot states to explicitly ground VL representations in physical scale through a learnable "embodiment-anchored" latent space. We trained LoLA on diverse robotic pre-training datasets and conducted extensive evaluations on simulation benchmarks (SIMPLER and LIBERO), as well as two real-world tasks on Franka and Bi-Manual Aloha robots. Results show that LoLA significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods (e.g., pi0), particularly in long-horizon manipulation tasks.

Motivation: 现有VLA系统因VLM推理速度慢而限制了策略性能，尤其是在全身体机器人操作中，同步执行严重影响了控制稳定性和实时性能。

Method: 引入了DuoCore-FS框架，将系统分为快速路径（高频动作生成）和慢速路径（丰富VLM推理），通过潜在表示缓冲区和全身体动作标记器实现异步执行。

Result: DuoCore-FS支持3B参数的VLM，同时实现30 Hz的全身体动作块生成，速度是同类VLA模型的三倍，实验显示任务成功率和响应速度显著提升。

Conclusion: DuoCore-FS框架通过异步执行VLM和动作专家，显著提升了全身体操作的任务成功率和响应速度，并已作为Astribot机器人平台的一部分提供给商业用户。

Abstract: Most Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems integrate a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for semantic reasoning with an action expert generating continuous action signals, yet both typically run at a single unified frequency. As a result, policy performance is constrained by the low inference speed of large VLMs. This mandatory synchronous execution severely limits control stability and real-time performance in whole-body robotic manipulation, which involves more joints, larger motion spaces, and dynamically changing views. We introduce a truly asynchronous Fast-Slow VLA framework (DuoCore-FS), organizing the system into a fast pathway for high-frequency action generation and a slow pathway for rich VLM reasoning. The system is characterized by two key features. First, a latent representation buffer bridges the slow and fast systems. It stores instruction semantics and action-reasoning representation aligned with the scene-instruction context, providing high-level guidance to the fast pathway. Second, a whole-body action tokenizer provides a compact, unified representation of whole-body actions. Importantly, the VLM and action expert are still jointly trained end-to-end, preserving unified policy learning while enabling asynchronous execution. DuoCore-FS supports a 3B-parameter VLM while achieving 30 Hz whole-body action-chunk generation, approximately three times as fast as prior VLA models with comparable model sizes. Real-world whole-body manipulation experiments demonstrate improved task success rates and significantly enhanced responsiveness compared to synchronous Fast-Slow VLA baselines. The implementation of DuoCore-FS, including training, inference, and deployment, is provided to commercial users by Astribot as part of the Astribot robotic platform.

Abstract: Due to the limitations of a single autonomous vehicle, Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) technology opens a new window for achieving fully autonomous driving through sensor information sharing. However, real-world datasets supporting vehicle-infrastructure cooperative navigation in complex urban environments remain rare. To address this gap, we present UrbanV2X, a comprehensive multisensory dataset collected from vehicles and roadside infrastructure in the Hong Kong C-V2X testbed, designed to support research on smart mobility applications in dense urban areas. Our onboard platform provides synchronized data from multiple industrial cameras, LiDARs, 4D radar, ultra-wideband (UWB), IMU, and high-precision GNSS-RTK/INS navigation systems. Meanwhile, our roadside infrastructure provides LiDAR, GNSS, and UWB measurements. The entire vehicle-infrastructure platform is synchronized using the Precision Time Protocol (PTP), with sensor calibration data provided. We also benchmark various navigation algorithms to evaluate the collected cooperative data. The dataset is publicly available at https://polyu-taslab.github.io/UrbanV2X/.

Conclusion: KnowVal通过整合开放世界感知和知识检索，显著提升了自动驾驶系统的规划性能，并在nuScenes和Bench2Drive上取得了最佳表现。

Abstract: Visual-language reasoning, driving knowledge, and value alignment are essential for advanced autonomous driving systems. However, existing approaches largely rely on data-driven learning, making it difficult to capture the complex logic underlying decision-making through imitation or limited reinforcement rewards. To address this, we propose KnowVal, a new autonomous driving system that enables visual-language reasoning through the synergistic integration of open-world perception and knowledge retrieval. Specifically, we construct a comprehensive driving knowledge graph that encodes traffic laws, defensive driving principles, and ethical norms, complemented by an efficient LLM-based retrieval mechanism tailored for driving scenarios. Furthermore, we develop a human-preference dataset and train a Value Model to guide interpretable, value-aligned trajectory assessment. Experimental results show that our method substantially improves planning performance while remaining compatible with existing architectures. Notably, KnowVal achieves the lowest collision rate on nuScenes and state-of-the-art results on Bench2Drive.

Abstract: Exploration of various applications is the frontier of research on inflatable robots. We proposed an articulated robots consisting of multiple pneumatic bladder links connected by rolling contact joints called Hillberry joints. The bladder link is made of a double-layered structure of tarpaulin sheet and polyurethane sheet, which is both airtight and flexible in shape. The integration of the Hilberry joint into an inflatable robot is also a new approach. The rolling contact joint allows wide range of motion of $\pm 150 ^{\circ}$, the largest among the conventional inflatable joints. Using the proposed mechanism for inflatable robots, we demonstrated moving a 500 g payload with a 3-DoF arm and lifting 3.4 kg and 5 kg payloads with 2-DoF and 1-DoF arms, respectively. We also experimented with a single 3-DoF inflatable leg attached to a dolly to show that the proposed structure worked for legged locomotion.

Conclusion: FAR-AVIO在定位精度和计算效率上均优于现有水下SLAM基线方法，适用于低功耗嵌入式平台，并已开源。

Abstract: Underwater environments impose severe challenges to visual-inertial odometry systems, as strong light attenuation, marine snow and turbidity, together with weakly exciting motions, degrade inertial observability and cause frequent tracking failures over long-term operation. While tightly coupled acoustic-visual-inertial fusion, typically implemented through an acoustic Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) integrated with visual-inertial measurements, can provide accurate state estimation, the associated graph-based optimization is often computationally prohibitive for real-time deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Here we present FAR-AVIO, a Schur-Complement based, tightly coupled acoustic-visual-inertial odometry framework tailored for underwater robots. FAR-AVIO embeds a Schur complement formulation into an Extended Kalman Filter(EKF), enabling joint pose-landmark optimization for accuracy while maintaining constant-time updates by efficiently marginalizing landmark states. On top of this backbone, we introduce Adaptive Weight Adjustment and Reliability Evaluation(AWARE), an online sensor health module that continuously assesses the reliability of visual, inertial and DVL measurements and adaptively regulates their sigma weights, and we develop an efficient online calibration scheme that jointly estimates DVL-IMU extrinsics, without dedicated calibration manoeuvres. Numerical simulations and real-world underwater experiments consistently show that FAR-AVIO outperforms state-of-the-art underwater SLAM baselines in both localization accuracy and computational efficiency, enabling robust operation on low-power embedded platforms. Our implementation has been released as open source software at https://far-vido.gitbook.io/far-vido-docs.

Abstract: The Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing League(A2RL) x Drone Champions League competition(DCL) requires teams to perform high-speed autonomous drone racing using only a single camera and a low-quality inertial measurement unit -- a minimal sensor set that mirrors expert human drone racing pilots. This sensor limitation makes the system susceptible to drift from Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), particularly during long and fast flights with aggressive maneuvers. This paper presents the system developed for the championship, which achieved a competitive performance. Our approach corrected VIO drift by fusing its output with global position measurements derived from a YOLO-based gate detector using a Kalman filter. A perception-aware planner generated trajectories that balance speed with the need to keep gates visible for the perception system. The system demonstrated high performance, securing podium finishes across multiple categories: third place in the AI Grand Challenge with top speed of 43.2 km/h, second place in the AI Drag Race with over 59 km/h, and second place in the AI Multi-Drone Race. We detail the complete architecture and present a performance analysis based on experimental data from the competition, contributing our insights on building a successful system for monocular vision-based autonomous drone flight.

Method: 采用环境光阻挡的光学配置，抑制非接触区域的内部和外部光线，仅传输接触点产生的漫射光。

Conclusion: LightTact传感器通过光学原理实现了对极轻接触的精准感知，并在机器人操作中展示了其实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Contact often occurs without macroscopic surface deformation, such as during interaction with liquids, semi-liquids, or ultra-soft materials. Most existing tactile sensors rely on deformation to infer contact, making such light-contact interactions difficult to perceive robustly. To address this, we present LightTact, a visual-tactile fingertip sensor that makes contact directly visible via a deformation-independent, optics-based principle. LightTact uses an ambient-blocking optical configuration that suppresses both external light and internal illumination at non-contact regions, while transmitting only the diffuse light generated at true contacts. As a result, LightTact produces high-contrast raw images in which non-contact pixels remain near-black (mean gray value < 3) and contact pixels preserve the natural appearance of the contacting surface. Built on this, LightTact achieves accurate pixel-level contact segmentation that is robust to material properties, contact force, surface appearance, and environmental lighting. We further integrate LightTact on a robotic arm and demonstrate manipulation behaviors driven by extremely light contact, including water spreading, facial-cream dipping, and thin-film interaction. Finally, we show that LightTact's spatially aligned visual-tactile images can be directly interpreted by existing vision-language models, enabling resistor value reasoning for robotic sorting.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对不相交可顺应性集合族问题的通用近似算法框架，证明了近似比为O(αlogτ)，并应用于多个经典问题，填补了理论空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决那些集合族具有不相交可顺应性但不满足对称性的经典算法问题（如k-MST、G-P2P等）的近似比问题，填补现有理论空白。

Method: 通过分析不相交可顺应性集合族的性质，结合经典原始对偶算法，提出了一种通用的近似算法框架，并针对具体问题（如G-P2P和多根覆盖Steiner问题）给出了具体的近似比。

Result: 证明了对于这类问题，近似比为O(αlogτ)，并给出了具体问题的应用结果，如G-P2P问题的O(log n)-近似算法和多根覆盖Steiner问题的O(log^4 n)-近似比。

Conclusion: 本文证明了对于任何具有不相交可顺应性（disjointness-compliable）但不一定对称的集合族的问题，其近似比为O(αlogτ)，其中τ是集合族中最小包含集的数量，α是当τ=1时的最佳已知近似比。此外，还讨论了参数化复杂度，并展示了在参数τ下，若集合族是proper的，则问题是固定参数可处理的，可在O*(3^τ)时间内解决。

Abstract: A set-family ${\cal F}$ is disjointness-compliable if $A' \subseteq A \in {\cal F}$ implies $A' \in {\cal F}$ or $A \setminus A' \in {\cal F}$; if ${\cal F}$ is also symmetric then ${\cal F}$ is proper. A classic result of Goemans and Williamson [SODA 92:307-316] states that the problem of covering a proper set-family by a min-cost edge set admits approximation ratio $2$, by a classic primal-dual algorithm. However, there are several famous algorithmic problems whose set-family ${\cal F}$ is disjointness-compliable but not symmetric -- among them $k$-Minimum Spanning Tree ($k$-MST), Generalized Point-to-Point Connection (G-P2P), Group Steiner, Covering Steiner, multiroot versions of these problems, and others. We will show that any such problem admits approximation ratio $O(α\log τ)$, where $τ$ is the number of inclusion-minimal sets in the family ${\cal F}$ that models the problem and $α$ is the best known approximation ratio for the case when $τ=1$. This immediately implies several results, among them the following two. (i) The first deterministic polynomial time $O(\log n)$-approximation algorithm for the G-P2P problem. Here the $τ=1$ case is the $k$-MST problem. (ii) Approximation ratio $O(\log^4 n)$ for the multiroot version of the Covering Steiner problem, where each root has its own set of groups. Here the $τ=1$ case is the Covering Steiner problem.
  We also discuss the parameterized complexity of covering a disjointness-compliable family ${\cal F}$, when parametrized by $τ$. We will show that if ${\cal F}$ is proper then the problem is fixed parameter tractable and can be solved in time $O^*(3^τ)$. For the non-symmetric case we will show that the problem admits approximation ratio between $α$ and $α+1$ in time $O^*(3^τ)$, which is essentially the best possible.

(2025) proved that $χ\leq 2r$, although empirical results by Cenzato et al. (2024) suggest that this bound is loose, with real data bounding $χ$ by around $1.13r$ to $1.33r$ when the size of the alphabet is $σ= 4$. To better understand this gap, we present two cases for the asymptotic tightness of the $χ\leq 2r$ bound: a general construction for arbitrary $σ$ values, and a binary alphabet case, consisting of de Bruijn sequences constructed by linear-feedback shift registers (LFSRs) from primitive polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_2$. The second is a novel characterization of which de Bruijn sequences achieve the literature run-minimal pattern for the cyclic BWT. Moreover, we show that de Bruijn sequences fail to close the gap for $σ\geq 3$.

Abstract: We live in a world filled with anisotropy, a ubiquitous characteristic of both natural and engineered systems. In this study, we concentrate on space deformation and introduce anisotropic Green coordinates, which provide versatile effects for cage-based and variational deformations in both two and three dimensions. The anisotropic Green coordinates are derived from the anisotropic Laplacian equation $\nabla\cdot(\mathbf{A}\nabla u)=0$, where $\mathbf{A}$ is a symmetric positive definite matrix. This equation belongs to the class of constant-coefficient second-order elliptic equations, exhibiting properties analogous to the Laplacian equation but incorporating the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ to characterize anisotropic behavior. Based on this equation, we establish the boundary integral formulation, which is subsequently discretized to derive anisotropic Green coordinates defined on the vertices and normals of oriented simplicial cages. The deformation satisfies basic properties such as linear reproduction and translation invariance, and has closed-form expressions for both 2D and 3D scenarios. We also offer intuitive geometric interpretations of this method. Furthermore, our approach computes the gradient and Hessian of the deformation coordinates and employs the local-global optimization framework to facilitate variational shape deformation, enabling flexible shape manipulation while achieving as-rigid-as-possible shape deformation. Experimental results demonstrate that anisotropic Green coordinates offer versatile and diverse deformation options, providing artists with enhanced flexibility and introducing a novel perspective on spatial deformation.

Abstract: This paper presents a system for procedurally generating agent-based narratives using large language models (LLMs). Users could drag and drop multiple agents and objects into a scene, with each entity automatically assigned semantic metadata describing its identity, role, and potential interactions. The scene structure is then serialized into a natural language prompt and sent to an LLM, which returns a structured string describing a sequence of actions and interactions among agents and objects. The returned string encodes who performed which actions, when, and how. A custom parser interprets this string and triggers coordinated agent behaviors, animations, and interaction modules. The system supports agent-based scenes, dynamic object manipulation, and diverse interaction types. Designed for ease of use and rapid iteration, the system enables the generation of virtual agent activity suitable for prototyping agent narratives. The performance of the developed system was evaluated using four popular lightweight LLMs. Each model's process and response time were measured under multiple complexity scenarios. The collected data were analyzed to compare consistency across the examined scenarios and to highlight the relative efficiency and suitability of each model for procedural agent-based narratives generation. The results demonstrate that LLMs can reliably translate high-level scene descriptions into executable agent-based behaviors.

Abstract: Advances in LLMs have produced agents with knowledge and operational capabilities comparable to human scientists, suggesting potential to assist, accelerate, and automate research. However, existing studies mainly evaluate such systems on well-defined benchmarks or general tasks like literature retrieval, limiting their end-to-end problem-solving ability in open scientific scenarios. This is particularly true in physics, which is abstract, mathematically intensive, and requires integrating analytical reasoning with code-based computation. To address this, we propose PhysMaster, an LLM-based agent functioning as an autonomous theoretical and computational physicist. PhysMaster couples absract reasoning with numerical computation and leverages LANDAU, the Layered Academic Data Universe, which preserves retrieved literature, curated prior knowledge, and validated methodological traces, enhancing decision reliability and stability. It also employs an adaptive exploration strategy balancing efficiency and open-ended exploration, enabling robust performance in ultra-long-horizon tasks. We evaluate PhysMaster on problems from high-energy theory, condensed matter theory to astrophysics, including: (i) acceleration, compressing labor-intensive research from months to hours; (ii) automation, autonomously executing hypothesis-driven loops ; and (iii) autonomous discovery, independently exploring open problems.

Abstract: The distribution of relief supplies to shelters is a critical aspect of post-disaster humanitarian logistics. In major disasters, prepositioned supplies often fall short of meeting all demands. We address the problem of planning vehicle routes from a distribution center to shelters while allocating limited relief supplies. To balance efficiency and equity, we formulate a bi-objective problem: minimizing a Gini-index-based measure of inequity in unsatisfied demand for fair distribution and minimizing total travel time for timely delivery. We propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and use the $ε$-constraint method to handle the bi-objective nature. By deriving mathematical properties of the optimal solution, we introduce valid inequalities and design an algorithm for optimal delivery allocations given feasible vehicle routes. A branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently. Computational tests on realistic datasets from a past earthquake in Van, Turkey, and predicted data for Istanbul's Kartal region show that the B&P algorithm significantly outperforms commercial MIP solvers. Our bi-objective approach reduces aid distribution inequity by 34% without compromising efficiency. Results indicate that when time constraints are very loose or tight, lexicographic optimization prioritizing demand coverage over fairness is effective. For moderately restrictive time constraints, a balanced approach is essential to avoid inequitable outcomes.

Abstract: Recent research has explored using very large language models (LLMs) as proxies for humans in tasks such as simulation, surveys, and studies. While LLMs do not possess a human psychology, they often can emulate human behaviors with sufficiently high fidelity to drive simulations to test human behavioral hypotheses, exhibiting more nuance and range than the rule-based agents often employed in behavioral economics. One key area of interest is the effect of personality on decision making, but the requirement that a prompt must be created for every tested personality profile introduces experimental overhead and degrades replicability. To address this issue, we leverage interpolative decoding, representing each dimension of personality as a pair of opposed prompts and employing an interpolation parameter to simulate behavior along the dimension. We show that interpolative decoding reliably modulates scores along each of the Big Five dimensions. We then show how interpolative decoding causes LLMs to mimic human decision-making behavior in economic games, replicating results from human psychological research. Finally, we present preliminary results of our efforts to ``twin'' individual human players in a collaborative game through systematic search for points in interpolation space that cause the system to replicate actions taken by the human subject.

Abstract: This paper presents an approach developed to address the PlantClef 2025 challenge, which consists of a fine-grained multi-label species identification, over high-resolution images. Our solution focused on employing class prototypes obtained from the training dataset as a proxy guidance for training a segmentation Vision Transformer (ViT) on the test set images. To obtain these representations, the proposed method extracts features from training dataset images and create clusters, by applying K-Means, with $K$ equals to the number of classes in the dataset. The segmentation model is a customized narrow ViT, built by replacing the patch embedding layer with a frozen DinoV2, pre-trained on the training dataset for individual species classification. This model is trained to reconstruct the class prototypes of the training dataset from the test dataset images. We then use this model to obtain attention scores that enable to identify and localize areas of interest and consequently guide the classification process. The proposed approach enabled a domain-adaptation from multi-class identification with individual species, into multi-label classification from high-resolution vegetation plots. Our method achieved fifth place in the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge on the private leaderboard, with an F1 score of 0.33331. Besides that, in absolute terms our method scored 0.03 lower than the top-performing submission, suggesting that it may achieved competitive performance in the benchmark task.

Abstract: Intra-class variability is given according to the significance in the degree of dissimilarity between images within a class. In that sense, depending on its intensity, intra-class variability can hinder the learning process for DL models, specially when such classes are also underrepresented, which is a very common scenario in Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) tasks. This paper proposes a novel method that aims at leveraging classification performance in FGVC tasks by learning fine-grained features via classification of class-wise cluster assignments. Our goal is to apply clustering over each class individually, which can allow to discover pseudo-labels that encodes a latent degree of similarity between images. In turn, those labels can be employed in a hierarchical classification process that allows to learn more fine-grained visual features and thereby mitigating intra-class variability issues. Initial experiments over the PlantNet300k enabled to shed light upon several key points in which future work will have to be developed in order to find more conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of our method. Our method still achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PlantNet300k dataset even though some of its components haven't been shown to be fully optimized.

Conclusion: LLMs在空间智能方面存在不足，但在处理具有明确文本线索的冲突时能接近人类水平。

Abstract: The integration of embodied agents into human environments demands embodied social intelligence: reasoning over both social norms and physical constraints. However, existing evaluations fail to address this integration, as they are limited to either disembodied social reasoning (e.g., in text) or socially-agnostic physical tasks. Both approaches fail to assess an agent's ability to integrate and trade off both physical and social constraints within a realistic, embodied context. To address this challenge, we introduce Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test (S$^{3}$IT), a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate embodied social intelligence. It is centered on a novel and challenging seat-ordering task, requiring an agent to arrange seating in a 3D environment for a group of large language model-driven (LLM-driven) NPCs with diverse identities, preferences, and intricate interpersonal relationships. Our procedurally extensible framework generates a vast and diverse scenario space with controllable difficulty, compelling the agent to acquire preferences through active dialogue, perceive the environment via autonomous exploration, and perform multi-objective optimization within a complex constraint network. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on S$^{3}$IT and found that they still struggle with this problem, showing an obvious gap compared with the human baseline. Results imply that LLMs have deficiencies in spatial intelligence, yet simultaneously demonstrate their ability to achieve near human-level competence in resolving conflicts that possess explicit textual cues.

Abstract: Symmetry is fundamental to understanding physical systems, and at the same time, can improve performance and sample efficiency in machine learning. Both pursuits require knowledge of the underlying symmetries in data. To address this, we propose learning symmetries directly from data via flow matching on Lie groups. We formulate symmetry discovery as learning a distribution over a larger hypothesis group, such that the learned distribution matches the symmetries observed in data. Relative to previous works, our method, \lieflow, is more flexible in terms of the types of groups it can discover and requires fewer assumptions. Experiments on 2D and 3D point clouds demonstrate the successful discovery of discrete groups, including reflections by flow matching over the complex domain. We identify a key challenge where the symmetric arrangement of the target modes causes ``last-minute convergence,'' where samples remain stationary until relatively late in the flow, and introduce a novel interpolation scheme for flow matching for symmetry discovery.

Conclusion: SOF框架通过从无动作视频中学习潜在技能，成功填补了现有视频生成模型与低级动作执行之间的鸿沟，并在多任务和长视野任务中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Learning from videos offers a promising path toward generalist robots by providing rich visual and temporal priors beyond what real robot datasets contain. While existing video generative models produce impressive visual predictions, they are difficult to translate into low-level actions. Conversely, latent-action models better align videos with actions, but they typically operate at the single-step level and lack high-level planning capabilities. We bridge this gap by introducing Skill Abstraction from Optical Flow (SOF), a framework that learns latent skills from large collections of action-free videos. Our key idea is to learn a latent skill space through an intermediate representation based on optical flow that captures motion information aligned with both video dynamics and robot actions. By learning skills in this flow-based latent space, SOF enables high-level planning over video-derived skills and allows for easier translation of these skills into actions. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves performance in both multitask and long-horizon settings, demonstrating the ability to acquire and compose skills directly from raw visual data.

Conclusion: G-SPEC框架通过神经符号方法有效解决了5G/6G网络中的意图驱动网络编排问题，显著提升了安全性和修复成功率。

Abstract: As networks evolve toward 5G Standalone and 6G, operators face orchestration challenges that exceed the limits of static automation and Deep Reinforcement Learning. Although Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a path toward intent-based networking, they introduce stochastic risks, including topology hallucinations and policy non-compliance. To mitigate this, we propose Graph-Symbolic Policy Enforcement and Control (G-SPEC), a neuro-symbolic framework that constrains probabilistic planning with deterministic verification. The architecture relies on a Governance Triad - a telecom-adapted agent (TSLAM-4B), a Network Knowledge Graph (NKG), and SHACL constraints. We evaluated G-SPEC on a simulated 450-node 5G Core, achieving zero safety violations and a 94.1% remediation success rate, significantly outperforming the 82.4% baseline. Ablation analysis indicates that NKG validation drives the majority of safety gains (68%), followed by SHACL policies (24%). Scalability tests on topologies ranging from 10K to 100K nodes demonstrate that validation latency scales as $O(k^{1.2})$ where $k$ is subgraph size. With a processing overhead of 142ms, G-SPEC is viable for SMO-layer operations.

Abstract: As Earth's climate changes, it is impacting disasters and extreme weather events across the planet. Record-breaking heat waves, drenching rainfalls, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense. Rapid and efficient response to disaster events is essential for climate resilience and sustainability. A key challenge in disaster response is to accurately and quickly identify disaster locations to support decision-making and resources allocation. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Cross-view Geolocalization approach, called ProbGLC, exploring new pathways towards generative location awareness for rapid disaster response. Herein, we combine probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models into a unified framework to simultaneously enhance model explainability (via uncertainty quantification) and achieve state-of-the-art geolocalization performance. Designed for rapid diaster response, the ProbGLC is able to address cross-view geolocalization across multiple disaster events as well as to offer unique features of probabilistic distribution and localizability score. To evaluate the ProbGLC, we conduct extensive experiments on two cross-view disaster datasets (i.e., MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster), consisting diverse cross-view imagery pairs of multiple disaster types (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires, floods, to tornadoes). Preliminary results confirms the superior geolocalization accuracy (i.e., 0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km) and model explainability (i.e., via probabilistic distributions and localizability scores) of the proposed ProbGLC approach, highlighting the great potential of leveraging generative cross-view approach to facilitate location awareness for better and faster disaster response.

Abstract: Content moderation at scale remains one of the most pressing challenges in today's digital ecosystem, where billions of user- and AI-generated artifacts must be continuously evaluated for policy violations. Although recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for policy-grounded moderation, the practical challenges of training these systems to achieve expert-level accuracy in real-world settings remain largely unexplored, particularly in regimes characterized by label sparsity, evolving policy definitions, and the need for nuanced reasoning beyond shallow pattern matching. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical investigation of scaling reinforcement learning (RL) for content classification, systematically evaluating multiple RL training recipes and reward-shaping strategies-including verifiable rewards and LLM-as-judge frameworks-to transform general-purpose language models into specialized, policy-aligned classifiers across three real-world content moderation tasks. Our findings provide actionable insights for industrial-scale moderation systems, demonstrating that RL exhibits sigmoid-like scaling behavior in which performance improves smoothly with increased training data, rollouts, and optimization steps before gradually saturating. Moreover, we show that RL substantially improves performance on tasks requiring complex policy-grounded reasoning while achieving up to 100x higher data efficiency than supervised fine-tuning, making it particularly effective in domains where expert annotations are scarce or costly.

TL;DR: Reason2Decide通过两阶段训练框架提升临床决策支持的预测与解释对齐，效果优于基线且模型更小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前临床决策支持系统中预测与解释不对齐的问题，特别是暴露偏差和任务分离的挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段训练框架：第一阶段专注于理由生成，第二阶段联合训练标签预测和理由生成，并应用计划采样逐步从依赖黄金标签过渡到模型预测。

Result: 在三个医学数据集上，Reason2Decide在预测（F1）和解释忠实度（BERTScore、BLEU、LLM-as-a-Judge）上优于其他微调基线和小型零样本LLM，且在分诊任务中对不同来源的解释表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Reason2Decide框架通过两阶段训练有效解决了临床决策支持系统中预测与解释对齐的问题，显著提升了预测准确性和解释忠实度，且模型规模较小，适合资源受限的场景。

Abstract: Despite the wide adoption of Large Language Models (LLM)s, clinical decision support systems face a critical challenge: achieving high predictive accuracy while generating explanations aligned with the predictions. Current approaches suffer from exposure bias leading to misaligned explanations. We propose Reason2Decide, a two-stage training framework that addresses key challenges in self-rationalization, including exposure bias and task separation. In Stage-1, our model is trained on rationale generation, while in Stage-2, we jointly train on label prediction and rationale generation, applying scheduled sampling to gradually transition from conditioning on gold labels to model predictions. We evaluate Reason2Decide on three medical datasets, including a proprietary triage dataset and public biomedical QA datasets. Across model sizes, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity (BERTScore, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge). In triage, Reason2Decide is rationale source-robust across LLM-generated, nurse-authored, and nurse-post-processed rationales. In our experiments, while using only LLM-generated rationales in Stage-1, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning variants. This indicates that LLM-generated rationales are suitable for pretraining models, reducing reliance on human annotations. Remarkably, Reason2Decide achieves these gains with models 40x smaller than contemporary foundation models, making clinical reasoning more accessible for resource-constrained deployments while still providing explainable decision support.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融情感分析未考虑股价或市场反馈的影响，因此提出一个自适应框架以提升情感分类效果。

Method: 提出了一个自适应框架，结合LLaMA 3.2 3B模型和指令学习，采用检索增强生成（RAG）管道动态选择多源上下文信息，并引入反馈驱动模块和基于近端策略优化（PPO）的强化学习代理。

Result: 在NIFTY 50新闻标题上的实验表明，该系统显著提升了分类准确性、F1分数和市场对齐性。

Conclusion: 结合指令调优的大型语言模型（LLMs）、动态反馈和强化学习，能够实现稳健且市场感知的金融情感建模。

Abstract: Financial sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in informing investment decisions, assessing market risk, and predicting stock price trends. Existing works in financial sentiment analysis have not considered the impact of stock prices or market feedback on sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose an adaptive framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with real-world stock market feedback to improve sentiment classification in the context of the Indian stock market. The proposed methodology fine-tunes the LLaMA 3.2 3B model using instruction-based learning on the SentiFin dataset. To enhance sentiment predictions, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline is employed that dynamically selects multi-source contextual information based on the cosine similarity of the sentence embeddings. Furthermore, a feedback-driven module is introduced that adjusts the reliability of the source by comparing predicted sentiment with actual next-day stock returns, allowing the system to iteratively adapt to market behavior. To generalize this adaptive mechanism across temporal data, a reinforcement learning agent trained using proximal policy optimization (PPO) is incorporated. The PPO agent learns to optimize source weighting policies based on cumulative reward signals from sentiment-return alignment. Experimental results on NIFTY 50 news headlines collected from 2024 to 2025 demonstrate that the proposed system significantly improves classification accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment over baseline models and static retrieval methods. The results validate the potential of combining instruction-tuned LLMs with dynamic feedback and reinforcement learning for robust, market-aware financial sentiment modeling.

TL;DR: MolAct框架通过强化学习将分子设计形式化为代理问题，两阶段训练和工具交互实现高效编辑与优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子编辑和优化是多步骤问题，需要迭代改进属性同时保持分子的化学有效性和结构相似性。

Method: 提出了MolAct框架，采用两阶段训练范式：首先建立编辑能力，然后重用学习到的编辑行为来优化属性。框架允许代理在多轮交互中调用化学工具进行有效性检查、属性评估和相似性控制。

Result: MolEditAgent-7B在分子编辑任务中表现优异，MolOptAgent-7B在分子优化任务中超越了最强的封闭式“思考”基线。

Conclusion: 将分子设计视为多步骤、工具增强的过程是实现可靠且可解释改进的关键。

Abstract: Molecular editing and optimization are multi-step problems that require iteratively improving properties while keeping molecules chemically valid and structurally similar. We frame both tasks as sequential, tool-guided decisions and introduce MolAct, an agentic reinforcement learning framework that employs a two-stage training paradigm: first building editing capability, then optimizing properties while reusing the learned editing behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize molecular design as an Agentic Reinforcement Learning problem, where an LLM agent learns to interleave reasoning, tool-use, and molecular optimization. The framework enables agents to interact in multiple turns, invoking chemical tools for validity checking, property assessment, and similarity control, and leverages their feedback to refine subsequent edits. We instantiate the MolAct framework to train two model families: MolEditAgent for molecular editing tasks and MolOptAgent for molecular optimization tasks. In molecular editing, MolEditAgent-7B delivers 100, 95, and 98 valid add, delete, and substitute edits, outperforming strong closed "thinking" baselines such as DeepSeek-R1; MolEditAgent-3B approaches the performance of much larger open "thinking" models like Qwen3-32B-think. In molecular optimization, MolOptAgent-7B (trained on MolEditAgent-7B) surpasses the best closed "thinking" baseline (e.g., Claude 3.7) on LogP and remains competitive on solubility, while maintaining balanced performance across other objectives. These results highlight that treating molecular design as a multi-step, tool-augmented process is key to reliable and interpretable improvements.

Motivation: 探索如何在不进行任何微调的情况下，直接利用现成的LLMs进行时间序列预测，克服其性能对输入数据文本表示的高度敏感性。

Method: 提出了一种简单而有效的策略：在时间序列数据token化前注入噪声，作为一种推理时增强手段，迫使冻结的LLM基于稳健的时间模式而非表面的数值伪影进行外推。

Result: 通过理论分析和多样化的基准测试验证了噪声注入策略的有效性，并在两个新引入的时间序列数据集上观察到一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: 本研究通过向原始时间序列注入噪声的策略，有效提升了冻结大型语言模型（LLMs）在时间序列预测中的性能，为直接利用现成LLMs进行时间序列预测提供了进一步支持。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness as zero-shot time series (TS) forecasters. The key challenge lies in tokenizing TS data into textual representations that align with LLMs' pre-trained knowledge. While existing work often relies on fine-tuning specialized modules to bridge this gap, a distinct, yet challenging, paradigm aims to leverage truly off-the-shelf LLMs without any fine-tuning whatsoever, relying solely on strategic tokenization of numerical sequences. The performance of these fully frozen models is acutely sensitive to the textual representation of the input data, as their parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet highly effective strategy to overcome this brittleness: injecting noise into the raw time series before tokenization. This non-invasive intervention acts as a form of inference-time augmentation, compelling the frozen LLM to extrapolate based on robust underlying temporal patterns rather than superficial numerical artifacts. We theoretically analyze this phenomenon and empirically validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks. Notably, to fully eliminate potential biases from data contamination during LLM pre-training, we introduce two novel TS datasets that fall outside all utilized LLMs' pre-training scopes, and consistently observe improved performance. This study provides a further step in directly leveraging off-the-shelf LLMs for time series forecasting.

Conclusion: ActionFlow通过系统级推理框架显著提升了VLA模型在边缘设备上的实时性能，无需重新训练即可实现动态操作的实时执行。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a unified paradigm for robotic perception and control, enabling emergent generalization and long-horizon task execution. However, their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments is severely hin dered by high inference latency. While smooth robotic interaction requires control frequencies of 20 to 30 Hz, current VLA models typi cally operate at only 3-5 Hz on edge devices due to the memory bound nature of autoregressive decoding. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise model accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ActionFlow, a system-level inference framework tailored for resource-constrained edge plat forms. At the core of ActionFlow is a Cross-Request Pipelin ing strategy, a novel scheduler that redefines VLA inference as a macro-pipeline of micro-requests. The strategy intelligently batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across continuous time steps to maximize hardware utilization. Furthermore, to support this scheduling, we propose a Cross Request State Packed Forward operator and a Unified KV Ring Buffer, which fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations. Experimental results demonstrate that ActionFlow achieves a 2.55x improvement in FPS on the OpenVLA-7B model without retraining, enabling real-time dy namic manipulation on edge hardware.

Method: 开发了基于BiGRU的PUE预测模型，并与GRU进行比较，使用RFECV算法选择关键特征集，并通过MSE、MAE和R-squared指标评估性能。

Result: BiGRU模型在各项指标上均优于GRU，证明了其在PUE预测中的有效性。

Conclusion: 优化后的BiGRU模型在PUE预测中表现优于GRU，通过关键特征选择和超参数优化显著提升了能源效率预测的准确性。

Abstract: Data centers account for significant global energy consumption and a carbon footprint. The recent increasing demand for edge computing and AI advancements drives the growth of data center storage capacity. Energy efficiency is a cost-effective way to combat climate change, cut energy costs, improve business competitiveness, and promote IT and environmental sustainability. Thus, optimizing data center energy management is the most important factor in the sustainability of the world. Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is used to represent the operational efficiency of the data center. Predicting PUE using Neural Networks provides an understanding of the effect of each feature on energy consumption, thus enabling targeted modifications of those key features to improve energy efficiency. In this paper, we have developed Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) based PUE prediction model and compared the model performance with GRU. The data set comprises 52,560 samples with 117 features using EnergyPlus, simulating a DC in Singapore. Sets of the most relevant features are selected using the Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) algorithm for different parameter settings. These feature sets are used to find the optimal hyperparameter configuration and train the BiGRU model. The performance of the optimized BiGRU-based PUE prediction model is then compared with that of GRU using mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared metrics.

Method: 使用贝叶斯模型作为分析框架，比较人类和LLM在数字游戏中的归纳偏差和推断策略。

Result: 人类能灵活推断基于规则和相似性的概念，并展示出少量样本泛化能力；LLM则更依赖数学规则且需要更多样本才能泛化。

Conclusion: 人类和大型语言模型（LLM）在数学概念推断和泛化方面存在根本差异，人类更灵活，而LLM更依赖数学规则。

Abstract: We compare human and large language model (LLM) generalization in the number game, a concept inference task. Using a Bayesian model as an analytical framework, we examined the inductive biases and inference strategies of humans and LLMs. The Bayesian model captured human behavior better than LLMs in that humans flexibly infer rule-based and similarity-based concepts, whereas LLMs rely more on mathematical rules. Humans also demonstrated a few-shot generalization, even from a single example, while LLMs required more samples to generalize. These contrasts highlight the fundamental differences in how humans and LLMs infer and generalize mathematical concepts.

Conclusion: PreSa框架通过直接学习策略而非间接学习奖励和成本模型，有效解决了长时连续控制任务中的安全性和性能问题，并在实验中表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) learns rewards and policies aligned with human preferences without the need for extensive reward engineering and direct interaction with human annotators. However, ensuring safety remains a critical challenge across many domains and tasks. Previous works on safe RL from human feedback (RLHF) first learn reward and cost models from offline data, then use constrained RL to optimize a safe policy. While such an approach works in the contextual bandits settings (LLMs), in long horizon continuous control tasks, errors in rewards and costs accumulate, leading to impairment in performance when used with constrained RL methods. To address these challenges, (a) instead of indirectly learning policies (from rewards and costs), we introduce a framework that learns a policy directly based on pairwise preferences regarding the agent's behavior in terms of rewards, as well as binary labels indicating the safety of trajectory segments; (b) we propose \textsc{PreSa} (Preference and Safety Alignment), a method that combines preference learning module with safety alignment in a constrained optimization problem. This optimization problem is solved within a Lagrangian paradigm that directly learns reward-maximizing safe policy \textit{without explicitly learning reward and cost models}, avoiding the need for constrained RL; (c) we evaluate our approach on continuous control tasks with both synthetic and real human feedback. Empirically, our method successfully learns safe policies with high rewards, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, and offline safe RL approaches with ground-truth reward and cost.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly advances, especially in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), research focus is shifting from single-modality text processing to the more complex domains of multimodal and embodied AI. Embodied intelligence focuses on training agents within realistic simulated environments, leveraging physical interaction and action feedback rather than conventionally labeled datasets. Yet, most existing simulation platforms remain narrowly designed, each tailored to specific tasks. A versatile, general-purpose training environment that can support everything from low-level embodied navigation to high-level composite activities, such as multi-agent social simulation and human-AI collaboration, remains largely unavailable. To bridge this gap, we introduce TongSIM, a high-fidelity, general-purpose platform for training and evaluating embodied agents. TongSIM offers practical advantages by providing over 100 diverse, multi-room indoor scenarios as well as an open-ended, interaction-rich outdoor town simulation, ensuring broad applicability across research needs. Its comprehensive evaluation framework and benchmarks enable precise assessment of agent capabilities, such as perception, cognition, decision-making, human-robot cooperation, and spatial and social reasoning. With features like customized scenes, task-adaptive fidelity, diverse agent types, and dynamic environmental simulation, TongSIM delivers flexibility and scalability for researchers, serving as a unified platform that accelerates training, evaluation, and advancement toward general embodied intelligence.

Method: 设计了MemR$^3$系统，包含两个核心机制：1）路由器，选择检索、反思或回答动作以优化答案质量；2）全局证据缺口跟踪器，使回答过程透明化并跟踪证据收集过程。

Result: 在LoCoMo基准测试中，MemR$^3$在LLM-as-a-Judge评分上超越强基线，尤其在RAG（+7.29%）和Zep（+1.94%）上表现突出。

Conclusion: MemR$^3$通过引入闭环控制机制，显著提升了大型语言模型（LLM）代理的记忆检索性能，为现有记忆存储提供了即插即用的控制器。

Abstract: Memory systems have been designed to leverage past experiences in Large Language Model (LLM) agents. However, many deployed memory systems primarily optimize compression and storage, with comparatively less emphasis on explicit, closed-loop control of memory retrieval. From this observation, we build memory retrieval as an autonomous, accurate, and compatible agent system, named MemR$^3$, which has two core mechanisms: 1) a router that selects among retrieve, reflect, and answer actions to optimize answer quality; 2) a global evidence-gap tracker that explicitly renders the answering process transparent and tracks the evidence collection process. This design departs from the standard retrieve-then-answer pipeline by introducing a closed-loop control mechanism that enables autonomous decision-making. Empirical results on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that MemR$^3$ surpasses strong baselines on LLM-as-a-Judge score, and particularly, it improves existing retrievers across four categories with an overall improvement on RAG (+7.29%) and Zep (+1.94%) using GPT-4.1-mini backend, offering a plug-and-play controller for existing memory stores.

Abstract: While CodeMem establishes executable code as the optimal representation for agentic procedural memory, the mechanism for autonomously synthesizing this memory from a blank slate remains underexplored. This paper operationalizes the transition of Large Language Models from passive tool-users to active workflow architects. Through a high-fidelity case study of a cross-service orchestration task involving Outlook and OneDrive, we identify and address four structural bottlenecks in automated skill generation: the Discovery Gap involving navigation of large tool registries, the Verification Gap regarding grounding tool response structures, the Decomposition Gap which replaces inefficient search with Linear State Anchoring, and the Scaling Gap focused on concurrency and persistence. We demonstrate that by enforcing a scientific methodology of hypothesize, probe, and code, agents can autonomously write robust, production-grade code skills.

Conclusion: SynCraft通过基于结构编辑的方法，显著提高了生成分子的合成可行性，同时保持了结构新颖性和药效团完整性。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence has revolutionized the exploration of chemical space, yet a critical bottleneck remains that a substantial fraction of generated molecules is synthetically inaccessible. Current solutions, such as post-hoc filtering or projection-based methods, often compromise structural novelty or disrupt key pharmacophores by forcing molecules into pre-defined synthetic templates. Herein, we introduce SynCraft, a reasoning-based framework that reframes synthesizability optimization not as a sequence translation task, but as a precise structural editing problem. Leveraging the emergent reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models, SynCraft navigates the "synthesis cliff" where minimal structural modifications yield significant gains in synthetic feasibility. By predicting executable sequences of atom-level edits rather than generating SMILES strings directly, SynCraft circumvents the syntactic fragility of LLMs while harnessing their chemical intuition. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that SynCraft outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating synthesizable analogs with high structural fidelity. Furthermore, through interaction-aware prompting, SynCraft successfully replicates expert medicinal chemistry intuition in editing PLK1 inhibitors and rescuing high-scoring but previously discarded RIPK1 candidates in previous molecular generation literatures.

Abstract: A global shortage of radiologists has been exacerbated by the significant volume of chest X-ray workloads, particularly in primary care. Although multimodal large language models show promise, existing evaluations predominantly rely on automated metrics or retrospective analyses, lacking rigorous prospective clinical validation. Janus-Pro-CXR (1B), a chest X-ray interpretation system based on DeepSeek Janus-Pro model, was developed and rigorously validated through a multicenter prospective trial (NCT07117266). Our system outperforms state-of-the-art X-ray report generation models in automated report generation, surpassing even larger-scale models including ChatGPT 4o (200B parameters), while demonstrating reliable detection of six clinically critical radiographic findings. Retrospective evaluation confirms significantly higher report accuracy than Janus-Pro and ChatGPT 4o. In prospective clinical deployment, AI assistance significantly improved report quality scores, reduced interpretation time by 18.3% (P < 0.001), and was preferred by a majority of experts in 54.3% of cases. Through lightweight architecture and domain-specific optimization, Janus-Pro-CXR improves diagnostic reliability and workflow efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained settings. The model architecture and implementation framework will be open-sourced to facilitate the clinical translation of AI-assisted radiology solutions.

Abstract: We propose a Vision-Language Simulation Model (VLSM) that unifies visual and textual understanding to synthesize executable FlexScript from layout sketches and natural-language prompts, enabling cross-modal reasoning for industrial simulation systems. To support this new paradigm, the study constructs the first large-scale dataset for generative digital twins, comprising over 120,000 prompt-sketch-code triplets that enable multimodal learning between textual descriptions, spatial structures, and simulation logic. In parallel, three novel evaluation metrics, Structural Validity Rate (SVR), Parameter Match Rate (PMR), and Execution Success Rate (ESR), are proposed specifically for this task to comprehensively evaluate structural integrity, parameter fidelity, and simulator executability. Through systematic ablation across vision encoders, connectors, and code-pretrained language backbones, the proposed models achieve near-perfect structural accuracy and high execution robustness. This work establishes a foundation for generative digital twins that integrate visual reasoning and language understanding into executable industrial simulation systems.

TL;DR: Bohrium+SciMaster通过基础设施和生态系统方法扩展代理科学，显著提升科学工作流的效率和可追溯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代理科学在多步骤科学工作流中展现出潜力，但扩展面临观察、重现、工具准备、执行追溯和治理等挑战。

Method: 提出了Bohrium作为AI4S资产的可追溯中心，SciMaster用于编排长期科学工作流，并构建科学智能基板以组织可重用模型、知识和组件。

Result: 在真实工作流中展示了11个代表性主代理，实现了科学周期时间的数量级减少，并在百万级规模上生成了执行基础的信号。

Conclusion: 采用Bohrium+SciMaster的基础设施和生态系统方法，能够有效扩展代理科学，显著减少科学周期时间，并从实际工作负载中生成执行基础的信号。

Abstract: AI agents are emerging as a practical way to run multi-step scientific workflows that interleave reasoning with tool use and verification, pointing to a shift from isolated AI-assisted steps toward \emph{agentic science at scale}. This shift is increasingly feasible, as scientific tools and models can be invoked through stable interfaces and verified with recorded execution traces, and increasingly necessary, as AI accelerates scientific output and stresses the peer-review and publication pipeline, raising the bar for traceability and credible evaluation.
  However, scaling agentic science remains difficult: workflows are hard to observe and reproduce; many tools and laboratory systems are not agent-ready; execution is hard to trace and govern; and prototype AI Scientist systems are often bespoke, limiting reuse and systematic improvement from real workflow signals.
  We argue that scaling agentic science requires an infrastructure-and-ecosystem approach, instantiated in Bohrium+SciMaster. Bohrium acts as a managed, traceable hub for AI4S assets -- akin to a HuggingFace of AI for Science -- that turns diverse scientific data, software, compute, and laboratory systems into agent-ready capabilities. SciMaster orchestrates these capabilities into long-horizon scientific workflows, on which scientific agents can be composed and executed. Between infrastructure and orchestration, a \emph{scientific intelligence substrate} organizes reusable models, knowledge, and components into executable building blocks for workflow reasoning and action, enabling composition, auditability, and improvement through use.
  We demonstrate this stack with eleven representative master agents in real workflows, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in end-to-end scientific cycle time and generating execution-grounded signals from real workloads at multi-million scale.

TL;DR: 研究表明，尽管LLMs在文本任务上表现优异，但在预测临床事件（如休克）方面并不显著优于SLMs。未来应专注于开发能预测临床轨迹的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的出现，自然语言处理领域的各种任务发生了变化，但它们在预测任务中的应用研究较少。及时预测休克可以促使早期干预，从而改善患者预后。

Method: 本研究比较了包括GatorTron-Base（基于临床数据训练）、Llama 8B和Mistral 7B在内的大型语言模型，与BioBERT、DocBERT、BioClinicalBERT、Word2Vec和Doc2Vec等模型，为预测重症患者的休克设置了基准。在微调过程中使用了焦点损失和交叉熵损失以解决类别不平衡问题。

Result: GatorTron Base获得了最高的加权召回率80.5%，但SLMs和LLMs之间的整体性能指标相当。

Conclusion: LLMs并不固有地优于SLMs在预测未来临床事件中，尽管它们在基于文本的任务上表现强劲。未来训练LLMs的努力应优先开发能够预测临床轨迹的模型，而非专注于命名实体识别或表型分析等简单任务。

Abstract: With the advent of LLMs, various tasks across the natural language processing domain have been transformed. However, their application in predictive tasks remains less researched. This study compares large language models, including GatorTron-Base (trained on clinical data), Llama 8B, and Mistral 7B, against models like BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec, setting benchmarks for predicting Shock in critically ill patients. Timely prediction of shock can enable early interventions, thus improving patient outcomes. Text data from 17,294 ICU stays of patients in the MIMIC III database were scored for length of stay > 24 hours and shock index (SI) > 0.7 to yield 355 and 87 patients with normal and abnormal SI-index, respectively. Both focal and cross-entropy losses were used during finetuning to address class imbalances. Our findings indicate that while GatorTron Base achieved the highest weighted recall of 80.5%, the overall performance metrics were comparable between SLMs and LLMs. This suggests that LLMs are not inherently superior to SLMs in predicting future clinical events despite their strong performance on text-based tasks. To achieve meaningful clinical outcomes, future efforts in training LLMs should prioritize developing models capable of predicting clinical trajectories rather than focusing on simpler tasks such as named entity recognition or phenotyping.

Motivation: 教师情感状态对教学效果和学生参与度有深远影响，但现有研究因表演性质常无法准确捕捉情感，且忽视了教学信息对情感表达的关键作用。

Method: 构建了首个大规模教师多模态情感分析数据集T-MED，并提出了基于非对称注意力机制的多模态教师情感分析模型AAM-TSA。

Result: AAM-TSA在T-MED数据集上的准确性和可解释性显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: AAM-TSA模型通过非对称注意力机制和分层门控单元，显著提升了教师情感分析的准确性和可解释性，为教育场景中的情感分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Teachers' emotional states are critical in educational scenarios, profoundly impacting teaching efficacy, student engagement, and learning achievements. However, existing studies often fail to accurately capture teachers' emotions due to the performative nature and overlook the critical impact of instructional information on emotional expression.In this paper, we systematically investigate teacher sentiment analysis by building both the dataset and the model accordingly. We construct the first large-scale teacher multimodal sentiment analysis dataset, T-MED.To ensure labeling accuracy and efficiency, we employ a human-machine collaborative labeling process.The T-MED dataset includes 14,938 instances of teacher emotional data from 250 real classrooms across 11 subjects ranging from K-12 to higher education, integrating multimodal text, audio, video, and instructional information.Furthermore, we propose a novel asymmetric attention-based multimodal teacher sentiment analysis model, AAM-TSA.AAM-TSA introduces an asymmetric attention mechanism and hierarchical gating unit to enable differentiated cross-modal feature fusion and precise emotional classification. Experimental results demonstrate that AAM-TSA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability on the T-MED dataset.

TL;DR: SAGE通过链式思考推理在SRS计划中表现优于非推理模型，接近人类水平，并提供了透明的优化轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于黑盒AI系统的不透明性限制了其在临床中的采用，研究旨在测试链式思考推理是否能提升代理规划的性能，以实现更透明的自动化SRS计划。

Method: 研究开发了基于大型语言模型（LLM）的SAGE规划代理，用于自动化SRS治疗计划。在41例脑转移患者的回顾性队列中，比较了非推理模型和推理模型生成的计划。

Result: 推理模型在主要终点（PTV覆盖、最大剂量、适形指数、梯度指数）上表现与人类规划师相当（p > 0.21），同时显著降低耳蜗剂量（p = 0.022）。推理模型还展示了系统性规划行为（如前瞻性约束验证和权衡审议），而非推理模型则缺乏这些行为。

Conclusion: SAGE（Secure Agent for Generative Dose Expertise）通过链式思考推理在立体定向放射外科（SRS）计划中表现出与人类规划师相当的剂量学性能，并在某些方面（如降低耳蜗剂量）优于人类基准。其优化轨迹可作为可审计的日志，为透明自动化规划提供了途径。

Abstract: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) demands precise dose shaping around critical structures, yet black-box AI systems have limited clinical adoption due to opacity concerns. We tested whether chain-of-thought reasoning improves agentic planning in a retrospective cohort of 41 patients with brain metastases treated with 18 Gy single-fraction SRS. We developed SAGE (Secure Agent for Generative Dose Expertise), an LLM-based planning agent for automated SRS treatment planning. Two variants generated plans for each case: one using a non-reasoning model, one using a reasoning model. The reasoning variant showed comparable plan dosimetry relative to human planners on primary endpoints (PTV coverage, maximum dose, conformity index, gradient index; all p > 0.21) while reducing cochlear dose below human baselines (p = 0.022). When prompted to improve conformity, the reasoning model demonstrated systematic planning behaviors including prospective constraint verification (457 instances) and trade-off deliberation (609 instances), while the standard model exhibited none of these deliberative processes (0 and 7 instances, respectively). Content analysis revealed that constraint verification and causal explanation concentrated in the reasoning agent. The optimization traces serve as auditable logs, offering a path toward transparent automated planning.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在长视频问答中因压缩内容或工具集有限而导致的时间定位不准确和细粒度线索缺失问题。

Method: 提出一个多智能体框架，包括一个主LLM、一个定位代理和一个视觉代理，主LLM通过强化学习训练以协调多代理合作。

Conclusion: 多智能体框架在长视频问答任务中显著优于非智能体基线方法，强化学习进一步提升了智能体的推理和规划能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal LLMs and systems that use tools for long-video QA point to the promise of reasoning over hour-long episodes. However, many methods still compress content into lossy summaries or rely on limited toolsets, weakening temporal grounding and missing fine-grained cues. We propose a multi-agent framework in which a master LLM coordinates a grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments and a vision agent to extract targeted textual observations. The master agent plans with a step limit, and is trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation. This design helps the master agent focus on relevant clips via grounding, complements subtitles with visual detail, and yields interpretable trajectories. On our proposed LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ which are episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+, our multi-agent system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines. Experiments also show reinforcement learning further strengthens reasoning and planning for the trained agent. Code and data will be shared at https://longvideoagent.github.io/.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: GRLDyP通过GNN辅助DRL动态选择路由和O-CU位置，显著降低O-RAN能耗并满足QoS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAN中逻辑功能与物理位置的静态绑定在时变流量和资源条件下效率低下，需通过动态SFC配置和O-CU选择解决此问题。

Method: 采用图神经网络（GNN）辅助的深度强化学习（DRL）方法GRLDyP，将问题建模为马尔可夫决策过程，动态选择路由和O-CU位置。

Result: 在蒙特利尔24小时流量数据集上评估，动态O-CU选择和路由相比静态映射基线显著降低能耗，且未违反QoS。

Conclusion: 动态服务功能链（SFC）配置与动态O-CU选择显著降低了能耗，同时满足QoS约束，验证了基于DRL的SFC配置在能源感知和资源自适应的O-RAN部署中的实用性。

Abstract: Open Radio Access Network (O RAN) disaggregates conventional RAN into interoperable components, enabling flexible resource allocation, energy savings, and agile architectural design. In legacy deployments, the binding between logical functions and physical locations is static, which leads to inefficiencies under time varying traffic and resource conditions. We address this limitation by relaxing the fixed mapping and performing dynamic service function chain (SFC) provisioning with on the fly O CU selection. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and solve it using GRLDyP, i.e., a graph neural network (GNN) assisted deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The proposed agent jointly selects routes and the O-CU location (from candidate sites) for each incoming service flow to minimize network energy consumption while satisfying quality of service (QoS) constraints. The GNN encodes the instantaneous network topology and resource utilization (e.g., CPU and bandwidth), and the DRL policy learns to balance grade of service, latency, and energy. We perform the evaluation of GRLDyP on a data set with 24-hour traffic traces from the city of Montreal, showing that dynamic O CU selection and routing significantly reduce energy consumption compared to a static mapping baseline, without violating QoS. The results highlight DRL based SFC provisioning as a practical control primitive for energy-aware, resource-adaptive O-RAN deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代电信网络数据量快速增长且规模不断扩大，高可靠性成为关键需求，传统故障诊断方法在复杂环境中效率不足。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）自动化网络故障检测和分类，通过在Kubernetes测试网络中注入不同类型的网络错误，收集健康与故障状态下的数据，包括来自不同网络组件（pods）的日志及补充数据（如系统描述、事件、RTT测试、pod状态信息）。

Result: 微调后的GPT-4.1 nano模型在故障检测准确率上相比基础模型有显著提升。

Conclusion: 本研究通过微调GPT-4.1 nano模型，显著提高了网络故障检测的准确性，展示了基于大型语言模型的方法在实现闭环、无操作员故障管理方面的潜力，从而提升网络可靠性并降低服务提供商的运营成本。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of data volume in modern telecommunication networks and the continuous expansion of their scale, maintaining high reliability has become a critical requirement. These networks support a wide range of applications and services, including highly sensitive and mission-critical ones, which demand rapid and accurate detection and resolution of network errors. Traditional fault-diagnosis methods are no longer efficient for such complex environments.\cite{b1} In this study, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate network fault detection and classification. Various types of network errors were intentionally injected into a Kubernetes-based test network, and data were collected under both healthy and faulty conditions. The dataset includes logs from different network components (pods), along with complementary data such as system descriptions, events, Round Trip Time (RTT) tests, and pod status information. The dataset covers common fault types such as pod failure, pod kill, network delay, network loss, and disk I/O failures. We fine-tuned the GPT-4.1 nano model via its API on this dataset, resulting in a significant improvement in fault-detection accuracy compared to the base model. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-based approaches for achieving closed-loop, and operator-free fault management, which can enhance network reliability and reduce downtime-related operational costs for service providers.

*Yejin Cho,John Heidemann*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 研究发现商业VPN在IPv6支持上存在两个问题：IPv4-only VPN泄露IPv6流量，双栈VPN用户倾向于选择IPv4。提出了新的IPv6地址范围解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是揭示商业VPN在IPv6支持上的不足，尤其是IPv4-only VPN泄露IPv6流量的问题，以及双栈VPN用户倾向于选择IPv4而非IPv6的现象。

Method: 研究方法包括使用WhatIsMyIPAddress.com的12.9万VPN用户数据集进行量化分析，并在Android上测试了6个VPN的表现。

Result: 研究结果显示，12个被认为安全的VPN仍有至少5%的用户存在IPv6泄露问题，且5%至57%的IPv4-only VPN用户会暴露原生IPv6地址。此外，大多数双栈VPN用户实际选择了IPv4。

Conclusion: 该论文的结论是发现了商业VPN在IPv6处理上的两个问题，并提出了一个解决方案，即定义一个新的IPv6地址范围以避免地址选择时的降优先级。

Abstract: How do commercial VPNs interact with IPv6? We show two "rough edges" in how commercial VPNs handle IPv6. First, we show that many IPv4-only VPNs leak IPv6 traffic to the ISP. Individual use VPNs in part to conceal their local IP addresses, so such leaks reduce user privacy. While prior work has studied VPNs in testbeds, we use a new dataset of 129k VPN-using daily visitors to WhatIsMyIPAddress.com that quantifies these leaks and show 12 VPNs previously considered safe still leak for at least 5% of their users. We show native IPv6 addresses leak most commonly in VPNs that claim only IPv4 support, with 5% to 57% of visitors of v4-only VPNs having their native IPv6 address exposed. Second, we show that most dual-stack VPNs users actually select IPv4 instead of IPv6. We observe this problem in our visitor data, and we identify the root cause arises because when user's computer follows standard address-selection rules, VPN-assigned addresses are often de-preferenced. Testing six VPNs on Android, we show that five consistently de-prioritize IPv6. Finally, we suggest a solution to IPv6 de-preferencing: we define a new IPv6 address range for VPNs that is not de-preferenced by address selection. We prototype this solution on Linux. Our findings help identify and address rough edges in the addition of IPv6 support to VPNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的非正交多址ISAC工作未能充分解决全息近场传播、速率分割多址集成干扰管理以及现实损伤下的统计验证问题。

Method: 提出了一种全面的全息MIMO NOMA-ISAC框架，包括统一的近场建模、新型速率分割增强NOMA架构、多目标优化套件以及严格的统计验证。

Result: RS-NOMA比传统NOMA实现了11.7%的总速率提升，比WMMSE在匹配感知效用时提升了18.8%，感知CRLB改善了2.4分贝，统计置信度为99%。

Conclusion: 该框架为6G全息MIMO ISAC的实际部署奠定了严格的基础。

Abstract: Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with extremely large apertures enable transformational capabilities for sixth-generation (6G) integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). However, existing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) ISAC works inadequately address: (i) holographic near-field propagation with sub-wavelength antenna spacing; (ii) rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) integration for interference management; (iii) statistical validation under realistic impairments. This paper presents a comprehensive holographic MIMO NOMA-ISAC framework featuring: \textbf{(1)} Unified near-field modeling incorporating spatially-correlated Rayleigh fading, spherical wavefront propagation, and sub-wavelength antenna coupling effects; \textbf{(2)} Novel rate-splitting enhanced NOMA (RS-NOMA) architecture enabling flexible interference management between sensing and communication; \textbf{(3)} Multi-objective optimization suite comparing hybrid alternating optimization with successive convex approximation (HAO-SCA), weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE), semidefinite relaxation (SDR), fractional programming (FP), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL); \textbf{(4)} Rigorous statistical validation over 5000 Monte Carlo runs with significance testing across massive MIMO scenarios (up to 1024 antennas). Results demonstrate that RS-NOMA achieves \SI{11.7}{\percent} higher sum-rate than conventional NOMA and \SI{18.8}{\percent} over WMMSE at matched sensing utility. Sensing CRLB improvements of \SI{2.4}{\decibel} are confirmed with 99\% statistical confidence. The framework establishes rigorous foundations for practical 6G holographic MIMO ISAC deployment.

Conclusion: VNF-Cache作为一种NFV-COIN服务，通过在地理分散的服务器上实施缓存策略，显著减少了响应时间并提高了每秒处理的请求数量。

Abstract: With the exponential growth of the amount of data available on the Internet, optimizing the response time and resource usage for data access becomes essential. Caches are an effective solution that brings data closer to clients, eliminating repetitive requests to servers. This paper presents VNF-Cache, a caching service for geographically remote key-value databases. VNF-Cache is an NFV-COIN (Network Function Virtualization-Computing In The Network) service, a technology undergoing standardization by the IETF that enables the implementation of arbitrary services directly in the network. VNF-Cache intercepts network packets, processes, stores, and sends values directly to clients when possible. Through a proof-of-concept implementation and experiments conducted with geographically dispersed servers in Brazil, the United States, and Japan, significant reductions in response time and increases in the number of requests processed per second were observed.

Motivation: 现有OS内核的单片设计限制了多路径TCP拥塞控制的演进，且网络统计中的固有噪声会导致数据驱动方法（如深度强化学习）的误导。

Method: Jazz采用解耦架构，将决策‘大脑’与内核数据路径分离，并利用基于Transformer的智能体处理历史观测序列，以克服单步强化学习的部分可观测性。

Result: 在双频Wi-Fi测试平台上，Jazz比传统方法提高了至少2.85%的带宽效率，并在1%丢包率下保持96.2%的性能。

Conclusion: Jazz系统通过解耦架构和基于Transformer的智能体，有效解决了多路径TCP拥塞控制中的部分可观测性问题，并在实际测试中展现了显著的性能提升，为敏捷网络智能提供了实用蓝图。

Abstract: Multipath TCP is widely adopted to enhance connection quality-of-service by leveraging multiple network pathways on modern devices. However, the evolution of its core congestion control is hindered by the OS kernel, whose monolithic design imposes high development overhead and lacks the resource flexibility required for data-driven methods. Furthermore, inherent noise in network statistics induces a partial observability problem, which can mislead data-driven methods like Deep Reinforcement Learning. To bridge this gap, we propose Jazz, a system that re-architects multipath congestion control through a decoupled architecture that separates the decision-making ``brain'' from the in-kernel datapath, enabling it to operate on an external (edge) entity. At its core, Jazz employs a Transformer-based agent that processes sequences of historical observations to overcome the partial observability of single-step reinforcement learning. This allows it to learn and master fluctuating link conditions and intricate cross-path dependencies. Tested on a dual-band (5GHz/6GHz) Wi-Fi testbed, our implementation improves bandwidth efficiency by at least 2.85\% over conventional methods and maintains 96.2\% performance under 1\% packet loss, validating this design as a practical blueprint for agile network intelligence.

Result: 在六个数据集和最多128个GPU上，Gaian减少了高达91%的通信，训练吞吐量提高了1.50x-3.71x。

Conclusion: Gaian作为一种通用的分布式训练系统，显著提升了PBDR方法的训练效率和资源利用率，减少了通信开销。

Abstract: Point-based Differentiable Rendering (PBDR) enables high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction, but scaling PBDR to high-resolution and large scenes requires efficient distributed training systems. Existing systems are tightly coupled to a specific PBDR method. And they suffer from severe communication overhead due to poor data locality. In this paper, we present Gaian, a general distributed training system for PBDR. Gaian provides a unified API expressive enough to support existing PBDR methods, while exposing rich data-access information, which Gaian leverages to optimize locality and reduce communication. We evaluated Gaian by implementing 4 PBDR algorithms. Our implementations achieve high performance and resource efficiency: across six datasets and up to 128 GPUs, it reduces communication by up to 91% and improves training throughput by 1.50x-3.71x.

TL;DR: UCCL-EP 是一种高性能、便携的专家并行通信系统，通过 GPU-CPU 控制通道和 RDMA 模拟解决了异构硬件的兼容性问题，显著提升了吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的专家并行通信系统（如 DeepEP）在异构 GPU 和 NIC 平台上表现不佳，主要原因是其架构依赖于 GPU 与 NIC 的紧密垂直集成。

Method: UCCL-EP 通过将 GPU 发起的 RDMA 替换为高吞吐量的 GPU-CPU 控制通道，并使用多线程 CPU 代理执行 GPUDirect RDMA 操作，同时通过 RDMA 即时数据模拟各种排序语义。

Result: UCCL-EP 在 EFA 上比现有最佳 EP 解决方案的调度和组合吞吐量提高了 2.1 倍，在 NVIDIA 平台上与 DeepEP 性能相当，并在 SGLang 和 DeepSeek-V3 训练中分别提升了 40% 和 45% 的吞吐量。

Conclusion: UCCL-EP 是一种便携的专家并行通信系统，能够在异构 GPU 和 NIC 硬件上提供与 DeepEP 相当的性能，同时解决了现有系统的可移植性问题。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) workloads rely on expert parallelism (EP) to achieve high GPU efficiency. State-of-the-art EP communication systems such as DeepEP demonstrate strong performance but exhibit poor portability across heterogeneous GPU and NIC platforms. The poor portability is rooted in architecture: GPU-initiated token-level RDMA communication requires tight vertical integration between GPUs and NICs, e.g., GPU writes to NIC driver/MMIO interfaces.
  We present UCCL-EP, a portable EP communication system that delivers DeepEP-level performance across heterogeneous GPU and NIC hardware. UCCL-EP replaces GPU-initiated RDMA with a high-throughput GPU-CPU control channel: compact token-routing commands are transferred to multithreaded CPU proxies, which then issue GPUDirect RDMA operations on behalf of GPUs. UCCL-EP further emulates various ordering semantics required by specialized EP communication modes using RDMA immediate data, enabling correctness on NICs that lack such ordering, e.g., AWS EFA. We implement UCCL-EP on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs with EFA and Broadcom NICs. On EFA, it outperforms the best existing EP solution by up to $2.1\times$ for dispatch and combine throughput. On NVIDIA-only platform, UCCL-EP achieves comparable performance to the original DeepEP. UCCL-EP also improves token throughput on SGLang by up to 40% on the NVIDIA+EFA platform, and improves DeepSeek-V3 training throughput over the AMD Primus/Megatron-LM framework by up to 45% on a 16-node AMD+Broadcom platform.

Motivation: Python科学计算生态系统主要局限于单节点并行，无法充分利用现代超级计算机的高性能资源，且传统HPC抽象缺乏灵活性。

Method: 基于Charm++运行时的CharmTyles框架，构建了一个自适应分布式抽象，支持NumPy-like语法以简化从原型到生产代码的迁移。

Result: 该抽象展示了动态调整运行应用节点数的资源弹性，并在性能上优于专用高性能stencil DSL和通用NumPy替代方案。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的自适应分布式抽象在多节点GPU上实现了显著的性能提升，并展示了资源弹性，为科学计算生态系统填补了单节点并行与高性能超级计算之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: The scientific computing ecosystem in Python is largely confined to single-node parallelism, creating a gap between high-level prototyping in NumPy and high-performance execution on modern supercomputers. The increasing prevalence of hardware accelerators and the need for energy efficiency have made resource adaptivity a critical requirement, yet traditional HPC abstractions remain rigid. To address these challenges, we present an adaptive, distributed abstraction for stencil computations on multi-node GPUs. This abstraction is built using CharmTyles, a framework based on the adaptive Charm++ runtime, and features a familiar NumPy-like syntax to minimize the porting effort from prototype to production code. We showcase the resource elasticity of our abstraction by dynamically rescaling a running application across a different number of nodes and present a performance analysis of the associated overheads. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our abstraction achieves significant performance improvements over both a specialized, high-performance stencil DSL and a generalized NumPy replacement.

Abstract: Collaborative learning has emerged as a key paradigm in large-scale intelligent systems, enabling distributed agents to cooperatively train their models while addressing their privacy concerns. Central to this paradigm is knowledge distillation (KD), a technique that facilitates efficient knowledge transfer among agents. However, the underlying mechanisms by which KD leverages memory and knowledge across agents remain underexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by offering a comprehensive review of KD in collaborative learning, with a focus on the roles of memory and knowledge. We define and categorize memory and knowledge within the KD process and explore their interrelationships, providing a clear understanding of how knowledge is extracted, stored, and shared in collaborative settings. We examine various collaborative learning patterns, including distributed, hierarchical, and decentralized structures, and provide insights into how memory and knowledge dynamics shape the effectiveness of KD in collaborative learning. Particularly, we emphasize task heterogeneity in distributed learning pattern covering federated learning (FL), multi-agent domain adaptation (MADA), federated multi-modal learning (FML), federated continual learning (FCL), federated multi-task learning (FMTL), and federated graph knowledge embedding (FKGE). Additionally, we highlight model heterogeneity, data heterogeneity, resource heterogeneity, and privacy concerns of these tasks. Our analysis categorizes existing work based on how they handle memory and knowledge. Finally, we discuss existing challenges and propose future directions for advancing KD techniques in the context of collaborative learning.

Result: Fast-MPS achieves over 10x speedup, scales to thousands of processes, and handles simulations with 8,176 sites and bond dimension chi = 10^4, outperforming existing simulators.

Conclusion: Fast-MPS demonstrates significant potential in high-performance tensor network applications, achieving scalability and speedup in large-scale MPS sampling.

Abstract: Matrix Product State (MPS) is a versatile tensor network representation widely applied in quantum physics, quantum chemistry, and machine learning, etc. MPS sampling serves as a critical fundamental operation in these fields. As the problems become more complex, the scale of MPS is rapidly increasing. Traditional data parallelism is limited by memory and heavy I/O in large-scale MPS. Model parallelism that can handle large-scale MPS imposes rigid process bindings and lacks scalability. This work proposes Fast-MPS, a multi-level parallel framework for scalable MPS sampling. Our design combines data parallelism across samples with tensor parallelism along bond dimensions. We eliminate memory and I/O pressure through compression and overlapping, and revive data parallel in large-scale MPS sampling. We evaluate our approach on Gaussian Boson Sampling, a representative and demanding application. Fast-MPS achieves over 10x speedup compared to existing simulators, scales to thousands of processes, and enables simulations with 8,176 sites and bond dimension chi = 10^4, significantly outperforming the state of the art. Fast-MPS has demonstrated great potential in high-performance tensor network applications.

Abstract: For nearly two decades, population protocols have been extensively studied, yielding efficient solutions for central problems in distributed computing, including leader election, and majority computation, a predicate type in Presburger Arithmetic closely tied to population protocols. Surprisingly, no protocols have achieved both time- and space-efficiency for congruency predicates, such as parity computation, which are complementary in this arithmetic framework. This gap highlights a significant challenge in the field. To address this gap, we explore the parity problem, where agents are tasked with computing the parity of the given sub-population size. Then we extend the solution for parity to compute congruences modulo an arbitrary $m$.
  Previous research on efficient population protocols has focused on protocols that minimise both stabilisation time and state utilisation for specific problems. In contrast, this work slightly relaxes this expectation, permitting protocols to place less emphasis on full optimisation and more on universality, robustness, and probabilistic guarantees. This allows us to propose a novel computing paradigm that integrates population weights (or simply weights), a robust clocking mechanism, and efficient anomaly detection coupled with a switching mechanism (which ensures slow but always correct solutions). This paradigm facilitates universal design of efficient multistage stable population protocols. Specifically, the first efficient parity and congruence protocols introduced here use both $O(\log^3 n)$ states and achieve silent stabilisation in $O(\log^3 n)$ time. We conclude by discussing the impact of implicit conversion between unary and binary representations enabled by the weight system, with applications to other problems, including the computation and representation of (sub-)population sizes.

Abstract: Distributed Sparse Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (SpMM) is a fundamental operation in numerous high-performance computing and deep learning applications. The major performance bottleneck in distributed SpMM lies in the substantial communication overhead, which limits both performance and scalability. In this paper, we identify and analyze sources of inefficient communication in existing distributed SpMM implementations at two levels and address these inefficiencies by proposing: (1) a fine-grained, sparsity-aware communication strategy that reduces communication overhead by exploiting the sparsity pattern of the sparse matrix, and (2) a hierarchical communication strategy that integrates the sparsity-aware strategy with the common two-tier network architectures in GPU-accelerated systems, to reduce redundant communication across slow network links. We implement these optimizations in a comprehensive distributed SpMM framework, \method{}. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets show that our framework demonstrates strong scalability up to 128 GPUs, achieving geometric mean speedups of 221.5$\times$, 56.0$\times$, 23.4$\times$, and 8.8$\times$ over four state-of-the-art baselines (CAGNET, SPA, BCL, and CoLa, respectively) at this scale.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体协调依赖于静态启发式工作流，导致资源浪费、高延迟和临时协议风险，需要类似分布式共识问题的形式化基础。

Method: 提出了一种多智能体精炼问题的形式化模型，并设计了Aegean共识协议，实现了Aegean-Serve服务引擎。

Result: 在四个数学推理基准测试中，Aegean将延迟降低了1.2-20倍，答案质量保持在2.5%以内。

Conclusion: Aegean协议为多智能体推理提供了可证明的安全性和活性保证，同时显著降低了延迟，保持了答案质量。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems have extended the capability of agentic AI. Instead of single inference passes, multiple agents perform collective reasoning to derive high quality answers. However, existing multi-agent orchestration relies on static heuristic workflows such as fixed loop limits and barrier synchronization. These ad-hoc approaches waste computational resources, incur high latency due to stragglers, and risk finalizing transient agreements. We argue that reliable multi-agent reasoning requires a formal foundation analogous to classical distributed consensus problem.
  To that end, we propose a formal model of the multi-agent refinement problem. The model includes definitions of the correctness guarantees and formal semantics of agent reasoning. We then introduce Aegean, a consensus protocol designed for stochastic reasoning agents that solves multi-agent refinement. We implement the protocol in Aegean-Serve, a consensus-aware serving engine that performs incremental quorum detection across concurrent agent executions, enabling early termination when sufficient agents converge. Evaluation using four mathematical reasoning benchmarks shows that Aegean provides provable safety and liveness guarantees while reducing latency by 1.2--20$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art baselines, maintaining answer quality within 2.5%. Consistent gains across both local GPU deployments and commercial API providers validate that consensus-based orchestration eliminates straggler delays without sacrificing correctness.

Conclusion: P-LoRA通过预测性预加载和基于页面的内存管理机制，显著提升了LoRA-based LLMs在无服务器环境中的推理效率和资源利用率。

Abstract: The serverless computing paradigm offers compelling advantages for deploying Large Language Model (LLM) inference services, including elastic scaling and pay-per-use billing. However, serving multiple fine-tuned LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in serverless environments faces critical challenges: reactive adapter loading causes significant cold start latency, and frequent adapter swapping leads to severe GPU memory fragmentation. In this paper, we present Predictive-LoRA (P-LoRA), a proactive and fragmentation-aware serverless inference system for LoRA-based LLMs. P-LoRA introduces two key innovations: (1) a lightweight LSTM-based traffic predictor that forecasts adapter demand and proactively prefetches hot adapters from host memory to GPU, reducing cold start latency by up to 68%; and (2) a page-based adapter memory management mechanism inspired by operating system virtual memory, which keeps GPU memory utilization above 87% even under heterogeneous adapter ranks. We evaluate P-LoRA using production-like workloads derived from the Azure Functions trace. Experimental results demonstrate that P-LoRA achieves 1.52x higher throughput than S-LoRA while reducing the average Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) by 35% under high concurrency scenarios.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于强化学习的故障感知路由方案，针对高斯互连网络中的节点和链路故障问题，通过PPO代理和特定奖励结构动态学习绕过故障区域，显著提高了通信可靠性。

Abstract: As Network-on-Chip (NoC) and Wireless Sensor Network architectures continue to scale, the topology of the underlying network becomes a critical factor in performance. Gaussian Interconnected Networks based on the arithmetic of Gaussian integers, offer attractive properties regarding diameter and symmetry. Despite their attractive theoretical properties, adaptive routing techniques in these networks are vulnerable to node and link faults, leading to rapid degradation in communication reliability. Node failures (particularly those following Gaussian distributions, such as thermal hotspots or physical damage clusters) pose severe challenges to traditional deterministic routing. This paper proposes a fault-aware Reinforcement Learning (RL) routing scheme tailored for Gaussian Interconnected Networks. By utilizing a PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) agent with a specific reward structure designed to penalize fault proximity, the system dynamically learns to bypass faulty regions. We compare our proposed RL-based routing protocol against a greedy adaptive shortest-path routing algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the RL agent significantly outperforms the adaptive routing sustaining a Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) of 0.95 at 40% fault density compared to 0.66 for the greedy. Furthermore, the RL approach exhibits effective delivery rates compared to the greedy adaptive routing, particularly under low network load of 20% at 0.57 vs. 0.43, showing greater proficiency in managing congestion, validating its efficacy in stochastic, fault-prone topologies

TL;DR: WOC是一种双路径共识协议，动态路由操作以平衡节点异构性和工作负载独立性，显著提升吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有共识协议无法同时优化节点异构性和工作负载独立性，如Cabinet和EPaxos各自存在局限性。

Method: WOC采用双路径共识协议，根据操作访问模式动态路由：独立操作通过快速路径（对象特定加权仲裁，单次网络往返）执行；冲突或共享对象通过慢速路径（节点加权共识，领导者协调）处理。

Result: 评估显示，WOC在独立对象占比>70%的工作负载下，吞吐量比Cabinet提升高达4倍，同时在高竞争下保持等效性能。

Conclusion: WOC协议通过动态路由操作到两条路径，有效解决了节点异构性和工作负载独立性的平衡问题，显著提升了吞吐量。

Abstract: Modern distributed systems face a critical challenge: existing consensus protocols optimize for either node heterogeneity or workload independence, but not both. For example, Cabinet leverages weighted quorums to handle node heterogeneity but serializes all operations through a global leader, limiting parallelism. EPaxos enables parallel execution for independent operations but treats all nodes uniformly, ignoring performance differences. To tackle this problem, we present WOC, a dual-path consensus protocol that dynamically routes operations into two paths based on their access patterns. Independent operations execute through a fast path that uses object-specific weighted quorums and completes in one network round-trip. Conflicting or shared objects route through a leader-coordinated slow path employing node-weighted consensus. Our evaluation demonstrates that WOC achieves up to 4X higher throughput than Cabinet for workloads with >70% independent objects, while maintaining equivalent performance under high contention.
