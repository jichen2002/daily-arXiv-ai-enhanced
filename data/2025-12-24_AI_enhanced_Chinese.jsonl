In this study, we concentrate on space deformation and introduce anisotropic Green coordinates, which provide versatile effects for cage-based and variational deformations in both two and three dimensions. The anisotropic Green coordinates are derived from the anisotropic Laplacian equation $\\nabla\\cdot(\\mathbf{A}\\nabla u)=0$, where $\\mathbf{A}$ is a symmetric positive definite matrix. This equation belongs to the class of constant-coefficient second-order elliptic equations, exhibiting properties analogous to the Laplacian equation but incorporating the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ to characterize anisotropic behavior. Based on this equation, we establish the boundary integral formulation, which is subsequently discretized to derive anisotropic Green coordinates defined on the vertices and normals of oriented simplicial cages. The deformation satisfies basic properties such as linear reproduction and translation invariance, and has closed-form expressions for both 2D and 3D scenarios. We also offer intuitive geometric interpretations of this method. Furthermore, our approach computes the gradient and Hessian of the deformation coordinates and employs the local-global optimization framework to facilitate variational shape deformation, enabling flexible shape manipulation while achieving as-rigid-as-possible shape deformation. Experimental results demonstrate that anisotropic Green coordinates offer versatile and diverse deformation options, providing artists with enhanced flexibility and introducing a novel perspective on spatial deformation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u683c\u6797\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u79ef\u5206\u516c\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5f62\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ebf\u6027\u518d\u73b0\u548c\u5e73\u79fb\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u591a\u6837\u5316\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5f62\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u65b9\u7a0b\u63a8\u5bfc\u8fb9\u754c\u79ef\u5206\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u540e\u5f97\u5230\u5b9a\u4e49\u5728\u6709\u5411\u7b80\u5355\u7b3c\u9876\u70b9\u548c\u6cd5\u7ebf\u4e0a\u7684\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u683c\u6797\u5750\u6807\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ebf\u6027\u518d\u73b0\u548c\u5e73\u79fb\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u683c\u6797\u5750\u6807\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u9009\u9879\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5f62\u53d8\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u521a\u6027\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u53d8\u5f62\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u683c\u6797\u5750\u6807\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b3c\u548c\u53d8\u5f62\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5f62\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u591a\u6837\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5f62\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Users could drag and drop multiple agents and objects into a scene, with each entity automatically assigned semantic metadata describing its identity, role, and potential interactions. The scene structure is then serialized into a natural language prompt and sent to an LLM, which returns a structured string describing a sequence of actions and interactions among agents and objects. The returned string encodes who performed which actions, when, and how. A custom parser interprets this string and triggers coordinated agent behaviors, animations, and interaction modules. The system supports agent-based scenes, dynamic object manipulation, and diverse interaction types. Designed for ease of use and rapid iteration, the system enables the generation of virtual agent activity suitable for prototyping agent narratives. The performance of the developed system was evaluated using four popular lightweight LLMs. Each model's process and response time were measured under multiple complexity scenarios. The collected data were analyzed to compare consistency across the examined scenarios and to highlight the relative efficiency and suitability of each model for procedural agent-based narratives generation. The results demonstrate that LLMs can reliably translate high-level scene descriptions into executable agent-based behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5229\u7528LLM\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u62d6\u653e\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u573a\u666f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793aLLM\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u5feb\u901f\u539f\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u7b80\u5316\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5feb\u901f\u8fed\u4ee3\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4ea4\u4e92\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u865a\u62df\u4ee3\u7406\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u539f\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u901a\u8fc7\u62d6\u653e\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u5230\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u4e3a\u5b9e\u4f53\u5206\u914d\u8bed\u4e49\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u573a\u666f\u7ed3\u6784\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u53d1\u9001\u7ed9LLM\uff0cLLM\u8fd4\u56de\u63cf\u8ff0\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\uff0c\u7531\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u89e3\u6790\u5668\u89e3\u91ca\u5e76\u89e6\u53d1\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LLM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aLLM\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ea7\u573a\u666f\u63cf\u8ff0\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u539f\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u53d9\u4e8b\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

Although motion blur obscures image details and degrades visual quality, it also encodes information about scene and camera motion during an exposure. Previous techniques leverage this information to estimate a sharp image from an input blurry one, or to predict a sequence of video frames showing what might have occurred at the moment of image capture. However, they rely on handcrafted priors or network architectures to resolve ambiguities in this inverse problem, and do not incorporate image and video priors on large-scale datasets. As such, existing methods struggle to reproduce complex scene dynamics and do not attempt to recover what occurred before or after an image was taken. Here, we introduce a new technique that repurposes a pre-trained video diffusion model trained on internet-scale datasets to recover videos revealing complex scene dynamics during the moment of capture and what might have occurred immediately into the past or future. Our approach is robust and versatile; it outperforms previous methods for this task, generalizes to challenging in-the-wild images, and supports downstream tasks such as recovering camera trajectories, object motion, and dynamic 3D scene structure.

We will show that any such problem admits approximation ratio $O(\u03b1\\log \u03c4)$, where $\u03c4$ is the number of inclusion-minimal sets in the family ${\\cal F}$ that models the problem and $\u03b1$ is the best known approximation ratio for the case when $\u03c4=1$. This immediately implies several results, among them the following two. (i) The first deterministic polynomial time $O(\\log n)$-approximation algorithm for the G-P2P problem. Here the $\u03c4=1$ case is the $k$-MST problem. (ii) Approximation ratio $O(\\log^4 n)$ for the multiroot version of the Covering Steiner problem, where each root has its own set of groups. Here the $\u03c4=1$ case is the Covering Steiner problem.\n  We also discuss the parameterized complexity of covering a disjointness-compliable family ${\\cal F}$, when parametrized by $\u03c4$. We will show that if ${\\cal F}$ is proper then the problem is fixed parameter tractable and can be solved in time $O^*(3^\u03c4)$. For the non-symmetric case we will show that the problem admits approximation ratio between $\u03b1$ and $\u03b1+1$ in time $O^*(3^\u03c4)$, which is essentially the best possible.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u76f8\u4ea4\u53ef\u987a\u5e94\u6027\u96c6\u5408\u65cf\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u4e3aO(\u03b1log\u03c4)\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u7ecf\u5178\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u90a3\u4e9b\u96c6\u5408\u65cf\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u76f8\u4ea4\u53ef\u987a\u5e94\u6027\u4f46\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u7b97\u6cd5\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982k-MST\u3001G-P2P\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u76f8\u4ea4\u53ef\u987a\u5e94\u6027\u96c6\u5408\u65cf\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u5178\u539f\u59cb\u5bf9\u5076\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u5177\u4f53\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982G-P2P\u548c\u591a\u6839\u8986\u76d6Steiner\u95ee\u9898\uff09\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fd9\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u4e3aO(\u03b1log\u03c4)\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5982G-P2P\u95ee\u9898\u7684O(log n)-\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u591a\u6839\u8986\u76d6Steiner\u95ee\u9898\u7684O(log^4 n)-\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u76f8\u4ea4\u53ef\u987a\u5e94\u6027\uff08disjointness-compliable\uff09\u4f46\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u96c6\u5408\u65cf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u4e3aO(\u03b1log\u03c4)\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u03c4\u662f\u96c6\u5408\u65cf\u4e2d\u6700\u5c0f\u5305\u542b\u96c6\u7684\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u03b1\u662f\u5f53\u03c4=1\u65f6\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5df2\u77e5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u03c4\u4e0b\uff0c\u82e5\u96c6\u5408\u65cf\u662fproper\u7684\uff0c\u5219\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u56fa\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\uff0c\u53ef\u5728O*(3^\u03c4)\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u89e3\u51b3\u3002"}}

First, ESGVI is generalized to operate on matrix Lie groups, enabling the estimation of states with orientation components while respecting the underlying group structure. Second, factors are introduced to accommodate heavy-tailed and skewed noise distributions, as commonly encountered in ultra-wideband (UWB) localization due to non-line-of-sight (NLOS) and multipath effects. Both extensions are shown to integrate naturally within the ESGVI framework while preserving its sparse and derivative-free structure. The proposed approach is validated in a UWB localization experiment with NLOS-rich measurements, demonstrating improved accuracy and comparable consistency.

In legacy deployments, the binding between logical functions and physical locations is static, which leads to inefficiencies under time varying traffic and resource conditions. We address this limitation by relaxing the fixed mapping and performing dynamic service function chain (SFC) provisioning with on the fly O CU selection. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and solve it using GRLDyP, i.e., a graph neural network (GNN) assisted deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The proposed agent jointly selects routes and the O-CU location (from candidate sites) for each incoming service flow to minimize network energy consumption while satisfying quality of service (QoS) constraints. The GNN encodes the instantaneous network topology and resource utilization (e.g., CPU and bandwidth), and the DRL policy learns to balance grade of service, latency, and energy. We perform the evaluation of GRLDyP on a data set with 24-hour traffic traces from the city of Montreal, showing that dynamic O CU selection and routing significantly reduce energy consumption compared to a static mapping baseline, without violating QoS.

However, existing approaches measure only the physical distance between seed execution paths and target locations, overlooking logical relationships among code segments. This omission can yield redundant or misleading guidance in complex binaries, weakening DGF's real-world effectiveness. To address this, we introduce \\textbf{attention distance}, a novel metric that leverages a large language model's contextual analysis to compute attention scores between code elements and reveal their intrinsic connections. Under the same AFLGo configuration -- without altering any fuzzing components other than the distance metric -- replacing physical distances with attention distances across 38 real vulnerability reproduction experiments delivers a \\textbf{3.43$\\times$} average increase in testing efficiency over the traditional method. Compared to state-of-the-art directed fuzzers DAFL and WindRanger, our approach achieves \\textbf{2.89$\\times$} and \\textbf{7.13$\\times$} improvements, respectively.

In this paper, we introduce PHANTOM (PHysical ANamorphic Threats Obstructing connected vehicle Mobility), a novel framework for crafting and deploying perspective-dependent adversarial examples using \\textit{anamorphic art}. PHANTOM exploits geometric distortions that appear natural to humans but are misclassified with high confidence by state-of-the-art object detectors. Unlike conventional attacks, PHANTOM operates in black-box settings without model access and demonstrates strong transferability across four diverse detector architectures (YOLOv5, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet). Comprehensive evaluation in CARLA across varying speeds, weather conditions, and lighting scenarios shows that PHANTOM achieves over 90\\% attack success rate under optimal conditions and maintains 60-80\\% effectiveness even in degraded environments. The attack activates within 6-10 meters of the target, providing insufficient time for safe maneuvering. Beyond individual vehicle deception, PHANTOM triggers network-wide disruption in CAV systems: SUMO-OMNeT++ co-simulation demonstrates that false emergency messages propagate through V2X links, increasing Peak Age of Information by 68-89\\% and degrading safety-critical communication.

In particular, researchers have explored its relationship to other repetitiveness measures, notably $r$, the number of runs in the Burrows--Wheeler Transform (BWT) of a string. Navarro et al. (2025) proved that $\u03c7\\leq 2r$, although empirical results by Cenzato et al. (2024) suggest that this bound is loose, with real data bounding $\u03c7$ by around $1.13r$ to $1.33r$ when the size of the alphabet is $\u03c3= 4$. To better understand this gap, we present two cases for the asymptotic tightness of the $\u03c7\\leq 2r$ bound: a general construction for arbitrary $\u03c3$ values, and a binary alphabet case, consisting of de Bruijn sequences constructed by linear-feedback shift registers (LFSRs) from primitive polynomials over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. The second is a novel characterization of which de Bruijn sequences achieve the literature run-minimal pattern for the cyclic BWT.

Existing flocking algorithms often struggle with efficiency and scalability, particularly when potential collisions force drones into suboptimal trajectories. This paper presents a time-efficient prioritised scheduling algorithm that improves the initial formation process of drone flocks. The method assigns each drone a priority based on its number of potential collisions and its likelihood of reaching its target position without permanently obstructing other drones. Using this hierarchy, each drone computes an appropriate delay to ensure a collision-free path. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm successfully generates collision-free trajectories for flocks of up to 5000 drones and outperforms the coupling-degree-based heuristic prioritised planning method (CDH-PP) in both performance and computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u5206\u914d\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7fa4\u521d\u59cb\u7f16\u961f\u4e2d\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7f16\u961f\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u78b0\u649e\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b21\u4f18\u8f68\u8ff9\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u6bcf\u67b6\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5206\u914d\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u78b0\u649e\u6b21\u6570\u548c\u5230\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u9002\u5f53\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8026\u5408\u5ea6\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08CDH-PP\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7fa4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7fa4\u521d\u59cb\u7f16\u961f\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u8fbe5000\u67b6\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

In major disasters, prepositioned supplies often fall short of meeting all demands. We address the problem of planning vehicle routes from a distribution center to shelters while allocating limited relief supplies. To balance efficiency and equity, we formulate a bi-objective problem: minimizing a Gini-index-based measure of inequity in unsatisfied demand for fair distribution and minimizing total travel time for timely delivery. We propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and use the $\u03b5$-constraint method to handle the bi-objective nature. By deriving mathematical properties of the optimal solution, we introduce valid inequalities and design an algorithm for optimal delivery allocations given feasible vehicle routes. A branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently. Computational tests on realistic datasets from a past earthquake in Van, Turkey, and predicted data for Istanbul's Kartal region show that the B&P algorithm significantly outperforms commercial MIP solvers. Our bi-objective approach reduces aid distribution inequity by 34% without compromising efficiency. Results indicate that when time constraints are very loose or tight, lexicographic optimization prioritizing demand coverage over fairness is effective.

We present a declarative system that separates agent workflow specification from implementation, enabling the same pipeline definition to execute across multiple backend languages (Java, Python, Go) and deployment environments (cloud-native, on-premises).\n  Our key insight is that most agent workflows consist of common patterns -- data serialization, filtering, RAG retrieval, API orchestration -- that can be expressed through a unified DSL rather than imperative code. This approach transforms agent development from application programming to configuration, where adding new tools or fine-tuning agent behaviors requires only pipeline specification changes, not code deployment. Our system natively supports A/B testing of agent strategies, allowing multiple pipeline variants to run on the same backend infrastructure with automatic metric collection and comparison.\n  We evaluate our approach on real-world e-commerce workflows at PayPal, processing millions of daily interactions. Our results demonstrate 60% reduction in development time, and 3x improvement in deployment velocity compared to imperative implementations. The language's declarative approach enables non-engineers to modify agent behaviors safely, while maintaining sub-100ms orchestration overhead.

State-of-the-art EP communication systems such as DeepEP demonstrate strong performance but exhibit poor portability across heterogeneous GPU and NIC platforms. The poor portability is rooted in architecture: GPU-initiated token-level RDMA communication requires tight vertical integration between GPUs and NICs, e.g., GPU writes to NIC driver/MMIO interfaces.\n  We present UCCL-EP, a portable EP communication system that delivers DeepEP-level performance across heterogeneous GPU and NIC hardware. UCCL-EP replaces GPU-initiated RDMA with a high-throughput GPU-CPU control channel: compact token-routing commands are transferred to multithreaded CPU proxies, which then issue GPUDirect RDMA operations on behalf of GPUs. UCCL-EP further emulates various ordering semantics required by specialized EP communication modes using RDMA immediate data, enabling correctness on NICs that lack such ordering, e.g., AWS EFA. We implement UCCL-EP on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs with EFA and Broadcom NICs. On EFA, it outperforms the best existing EP solution by up to $2.1\\times$ for dispatch and combine throughput. On NVIDIA-only platform, UCCL-EP achieves comparable performance to the original DeepEP. UCCL-EP also improves token throughput on SGLang by up to 40% on the NVIDIA+EFA platform, and improves DeepSeek-V3 training throughput over the AMD Primus/Megatron-LM framework by up to 45% on a 16-node AMD+Broadcom platform.", "AI": {"tldr": "UCCL-EP \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u4fbf\u643a\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e76\u884c\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 GPU-CPU \u63a7\u5236\u901a\u9053\u548c RDMA \u6a21\u62df\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e76\u884c\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982 DeepEP\uff09\u5728\u5f02\u6784 GPU \u548c NIC \u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u5176\u67b6\u6784\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e GPU \u4e0e NIC \u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u5782\u76f4\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "method": "UCCL-EP \u901a\u8fc7\u5c06 GPU \u53d1\u8d77\u7684 RDMA \u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u7684 GPU-CPU \u63a7\u5236\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b CPU \u4ee3\u7406\u6267\u884c GPUDirect RDMA \u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7 RDMA \u5373\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u62df\u5404\u79cd\u6392\u5e8f\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "result": "UCCL-EP \u5728 EFA \u4e0a\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73 EP \u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 2.1 \u500d\uff0c\u5728 NVIDIA \u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u4e0e DeepEP \u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5e76\u5728 SGLang \u548c DeepSeek-V3 \u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u4e86 40% \u548c 45% \u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "UCCL-EP \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4fbf\u643a\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e76\u884c\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5f02\u6784 GPU \u548c NIC \u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0e DeepEP \u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We study this setting of manipulating personal objects, in which a VLA must identify and control a user-specific object unseen during training using only a few reference images. To address this challenge, we propose Visual Attentive Prompting (VAP), a simple-yet-effective training-free perceptual adapter that equips frozen VLAs with top-down selective attention. VAP treats the reference images as a non-parametric visual memory, grounds the personal object in the scene through open-vocabulary detection and embedding-based matching, and then injects this grounding as a visual prompt by highlighting the object and rewriting the instruction. We construct two simulation benchmarks, Personalized-SIMPLER and Personalized-VLABench, and a real-world tabletop benchmark to evaluate personalized manipulation across multiple robots and tasks.

We show two \"rough edges\" in how commercial VPNs handle IPv6. First, we show that many IPv4-only VPNs leak IPv6 traffic to the ISP. Individual use VPNs in part to conceal their local IP addresses, so such leaks reduce user privacy. While prior work has studied VPNs in testbeds, we use a new dataset of 129k VPN-using daily visitors to WhatIsMyIPAddress.com that quantifies these leaks and show 12 VPNs previously considered safe still leak for at least 5% of their users. We show native IPv6 addresses leak most commonly in VPNs that claim only IPv4 support, with 5% to 57% of visitors of v4-only VPNs having their native IPv6 address exposed. Second, we show that most dual-stack VPNs users actually select IPv4 instead of IPv6. We observe this problem in our visitor data, and we identify the root cause arises because when user's computer follows standard address-selection rules, VPN-assigned addresses are often de-preferenced. Testing six VPNs on Android, we show that five consistently de-prioritize IPv6. Finally, we suggest a solution to IPv6 de-preferencing: we define a new IPv6 address range for VPNs that is not de-preferenced by address selection. We prototype this solution on Linux.

While LLMs do not possess a human psychology, they often can emulate human behaviors with sufficiently high fidelity to drive simulations to test human behavioral hypotheses, exhibiting more nuance and range than the rule-based agents often employed in behavioral economics. One key area of interest is the effect of personality on decision making, but the requirement that a prompt must be created for every tested personality profile introduces experimental overhead and degrades replicability. To address this issue, we leverage interpolative decoding, representing each dimension of personality as a pair of opposed prompts and employing an interpolation parameter to simulate behavior along the dimension. We show that interpolative decoding reliably modulates scores along each of the Big Five dimensions. We then show how interpolative decoding causes LLMs to mimic human decision-making behavior in economic games, replicating results from human psychological research.

Comment inconsistency arises when developers modify code but neglect to update the corresponding comments, potentially misleading future maintainers and introducing errors. Recent approaches to code-comment inconsistency (CCI) detection leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) and rely on capturing the semantic relationship between code changes and outdated comments. However, they often ignore the structural complexity of code evolution, including historical change activities, and introduce privacy and resource challenges. In this paper, we propose a Just-In-Time CCI detection approach built upon the CodeT5+ backbone. Our method decomposes code changes into ordered sequences of modification activities such as replacing, deleting, and adding to more effectively capture the correlation between these changes and the corresponding outdated comments. Extensive experiments conducted on publicly available benchmark datasets-JITDATA and CCIBENCH--demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms recent state-of-the-art models by up to 13.54% in F1-Score and achieves an improvement ranging from 4.18% to 10.94% over fine-tuned LLMs including DeepSeek-Coder, CodeLlama and Qwen2.5-Coder.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eCodeT5+\u7684Just-In-Time CCI\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\u6d3b\u52a8\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5bf9\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u8c03\u8bd5\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709CCI\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4ee3\u7801\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eCodeT5+\u7684Just-In-Time CCI\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6709\u5e8f\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u6d3b\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\uff08\u5982\u66ff\u6362\u3001\u5220\u9664\u3001\u6dfb\u52a0\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6355\u6349\u53d8\u66f4\u4e0e\u8fc7\u65f6\u6ce8\u91ca\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "result": "\u5728JITDATA\u548cCCIBENCH\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728F1-Score\u4e0a\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe13.54%\uff0c\u5bf9\u5fae\u8c03LLMs\uff08\u5982DeepSeek-Coder\u3001CodeLlama\u548cQwen2.5-Coder\uff09\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u8303\u56f4\u4e3a4.18%\u81f310.94%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eCodeT5+\u7684Just-In-Time CCI\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\u6d3b\u52a8\u5e76\u6355\u6349\u5176\u4e0e\u8fc7\u65f6\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5fae\u8c03LLMs\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, such capabilities are often overlooked by existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. To solve this challenge, we propose LoLA (Long Horizon Latent Action Learning), a framework designed for robot manipulation that integrates long-term multi-view observations and robot proprioception to enable multi-step reasoning and action generation. We first employ Vision-Language Models to encode rich contextual features from historical sequences and multi-view observations. We further introduces a key module, State-Aware Latent Re-representation, which transforms visual inputs and language commands into actionable robot motion space. Unlike existing VLA approaches that merely concatenate robot proprioception (e.g., joint angles) with VL embeddings, this module leverages such robot states to explicitly ground VL representations in physical scale through a learnable \"embodiment-anchored\" latent space. We trained LoLA on diverse robotic pre-training datasets and conducted extensive evaluations on simulation benchmarks (SIMPLER and LIBERO), as well as two real-world tasks on Franka and Bi-Manual Aloha robots.

Our solution focused on employing class prototypes obtained from the training dataset as a proxy guidance for training a segmentation Vision Transformer (ViT) on the test set images. To obtain these representations, the proposed method extracts features from training dataset images and create clusters, by applying K-Means, with $K$ equals to the number of classes in the dataset. The segmentation model is a customized narrow ViT, built by replacing the patch embedding layer with a frozen DinoV2, pre-trained on the training dataset for individual species classification. This model is trained to reconstruct the class prototypes of the training dataset from the test dataset images. We then use this model to obtain attention scores that enable to identify and localize areas of interest and consequently guide the classification process. The proposed approach enabled a domain-adaptation from multi-class identification with individual species, into multi-label classification from high-resolution vegetation plots. Our method achieved fifth place in the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge on the private leaderboard, with an F1 score of 0.33331.

Shekhovtsov"], "title": "RANSAC Scoring Functions: Analysis and Reality Check", "comment": null, "summary": "We revisit the problem of assigning a score (a quality of fit) to candidate geometric models -- one of the key components of RANSAC for robust geometric fitting. In a non-robust setting, the ``gold standard'' scoring function, known as the geometric error, follows from a probabilistic model with Gaussian noises. We extend it to spherical noises. In a robust setting, we consider a mixture with uniformly distributed outliers and show that a threshold-based parameterization leads to a unified view of likelihood-based and robust M-estimators and associated local optimization schemes.\n  Next we analyze MAGSAC++ which stands out for two reasons. First, it achieves the best results according to existing benchmarks. Second, it makes quite different modeling assumptions and derivation steps. We discovered, however that the derivation does not correspond to sound principles and the resulting score function is in fact numerically equivalent to a simple Gaussian-uniform likelihood, a basic model within the proposed framework.\n  Finally, we propose an experimental methodology for evaluating scoring functions: assuming either a large validation set, or a small random validation set in expectation. We find that all scoring functions, including using a learned inlier distribution, perform identically. In particular, MAGSAC++ score is found to be neither better performing than simple contenders nor less sensitive to the choice of the threshold hyperparameter.\n  Our theoretical and experimental analysis thus comprehensively revisit the state-of-the-art, which is critical for any future research seeking to improve the methods or apply them to other robust fitting problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6307\u51faMAGSAC++\u867d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u4f46\u63a8\u5bfc\u6709\u8bef\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u6548\u679c\u76f8\u540c\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u5206\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdbRANSAC\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u51e0\u4f55\u62df\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u975e\u9c81\u68d2\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u8bef\u5dee\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u81f3\u7403\u5f62\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8003\u8651\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9608\u503c\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e86MAGSAC++\u7684\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e0e\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0MAGSAC++\u7684\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e0d\u7b26\u5408\u5408\u7406\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5176\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af-\u5747\u5300\u4f3c\u7136\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u540c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u56de\u987e\uff0c\u6307\u51faMAGSAC++\u867d\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u63a8\u5bfc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u6570\u503c\u4e0a\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u9ad8\u65af-\u5747\u5300\u4f3c\u7136\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u540c\uff0cMAGSAC++\u5e76\u65e0\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Central to this paradigm is knowledge distillation (KD), a technique that facilitates efficient knowledge transfer among agents. However, the underlying mechanisms by which KD leverages memory and knowledge across agents remain underexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by offering a comprehensive review of KD in collaborative learning, with a focus on the roles of memory and knowledge. We define and categorize memory and knowledge within the KD process and explore their interrelationships, providing a clear understanding of how knowledge is extracted, stored, and shared in collaborative settings. We examine various collaborative learning patterns, including distributed, hierarchical, and decentralized structures, and provide insights into how memory and knowledge dynamics shape the effectiveness of KD in collaborative learning. Particularly, we emphasize task heterogeneity in distributed learning pattern covering federated learning (FL), multi-agent domain adaptation (MADA), federated multi-modal learning (FML), federated continual learning (FCL), federated multi-task learning (FMTL), and federated graph knowledge embedding (FKGE).

As a result, policy performance is constrained by the low inference speed of large VLMs. This mandatory synchronous execution severely limits control stability and real-time performance in whole-body robotic manipulation, which involves more joints, larger motion spaces, and dynamically changing views. We introduce a truly asynchronous Fast-Slow VLA framework (DuoCore-FS), organizing the system into a fast pathway for high-frequency action generation and a slow pathway for rich VLM reasoning. The system is characterized by two key features. First, a latent representation buffer bridges the slow and fast systems. It stores instruction semantics and action-reasoning representation aligned with the scene-instruction context, providing high-level guidance to the fast pathway. Second, a whole-body action tokenizer provides a compact, unified representation of whole-body actions. Importantly, the VLM and action expert are still jointly trained end-to-end, preserving unified policy learning while enabling asynchronous execution. DuoCore-FS supports a 3B-parameter VLM while achieving 30 Hz whole-body action-chunk generation, approximately three times as fast as prior VLA models with comparable model sizes. Real-world whole-body manipulation experiments demonstrate improved task success rates and significantly enhanced responsiveness compared to synchronous Fast-Slow VLA baselines.

In that sense, depending on its intensity, intra-class variability can hinder the learning process for DL models, specially when such classes are also underrepresented, which is a very common scenario in Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) tasks. This paper proposes a novel method that aims at leveraging classification performance in FGVC tasks by learning fine-grained features via classification of class-wise cluster assignments. Our goal is to apply clustering over each class individually, which can allow to discover pseudo-labels that encodes a latent degree of similarity between images. In turn, those labels can be employed in a hierarchical classification process that allows to learn more fine-grained visual features and thereby mitigating intra-class variability issues. Initial experiments over the PlantNet300k enabled to shed light upon several key points in which future work will have to be developed in order to find more conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of our method. Our method still achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PlantNet300k dataset even though some of its components haven't been shown to be fully optimized.

Current evaluation methods focus primarily on functional correctness, overlooking the non-functional optimality of generated plans. This gap can lead to significant performance degradation and resource waste. We identify and formalize the problem of Non-optimal Decisions (NoDs), where agents complete tasks successfully but inefficiently. We present NoD-DGMT, a systematic framework for detecting NoDs in embodied agent task planning via diversity-guided metamorphic testing. Our key insight is that optimal planners should exhibit invariant behavioral properties under specific transformations. We design four novel metamorphic relations capturing fundamental optimality properties: position detour suboptimality, action optimality completeness, condition refinement monotonicity, and scene perturbation invariance. To maximize detection efficiency, we introduce a diversity-guided selection strategy that actively selects test cases exploring different violation categories, avoiding redundant evaluations while ensuring comprehensive diversity coverage. Extensive experiments on the AI2-THOR simulator with four state-of-the-art planning models demonstrate that NoD-DGMT achieves violation detection rates of 31.9% on average, with our diversity-guided filter improving rates by 4.3% and diversity scores by 3.3 on average.

Achieving such fine-grained 3D understanding requires precise geometric reasoning and spatially consistent scene representation across complex environments.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce HyGE-Occ, a novel framework that leverages a hybrid view-transformation branch with 3D Gaussian and edge priors to enhance both geometric consistency and boundary awareness in 3D panoptic occupancy prediction. HyGE-Occ employs a hybrid view-transformation branch that fuses a continuous Gaussian-based depth representation with a discretized depth-bin formulation, producing BEV features with improved geometric consistency and structural coherence. In parallel, we extract edge maps from BEV features and use them as auxiliary information to learn edge cues.

However, existing evaluations fail to address this integration, as they are limited to either disembodied social reasoning (e.g., in text) or socially-agnostic physical tasks. Both approaches fail to assess an agent's ability to integrate and trade off both physical and social constraints within a realistic, embodied context. To address this challenge, we introduce Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test (S$^{3}$IT), a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate embodied social intelligence. It is centered on a novel and challenging seat-ordering task, requiring an agent to arrange seating in a 3D environment for a group of large language model-driven (LLM-driven) NPCs with diverse identities, preferences, and intricate interpersonal relationships. Our procedurally extensible framework generates a vast and diverse scenario space with controllable difficulty, compelling the agent to acquire preferences through active dialogue, perceive the environment via autonomous exploration, and perform multi-objective optimization within a complex constraint network. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on S$^{3}$IT and found that they still struggle with this problem, showing an obvious gap compared with the human baseline.

Conventional rule-based metrics merely score programs based on their surface-level similarities with reference programs instead of analyzing functionality and code quality in depth. To address this limitation, researchers have developed LLM-as-a-judge metrics, prompting LLMs to evaluate and score code, and curated various code evaluation benchmarks to validate their effectiveness. However, these benchmarks suffer from critical limitations, hindering reliable assessments of evaluation capability: Some feature coarse-grained binary labels, which reduce rich code behavior to a single bit of information, obscuring subtle errors. Others propose fine-grained but subjective, vaguely-defined evaluation criteria, introducing unreliability in manually-annotated scores, which is the ground-truth they rely on. Furthermore, they often use uncontrolled data synthesis methods, leading to unbalanced score distributions that poorly represent real-world code generation scenarios.\n  To curate a diverse benchmark with programs of well-balanced distributions across various quality levels and streamline the manual annotation procedure, we propose AXIOM, a novel perturbation-based framework for synthesizing code evaluation benchmarks at scale. It reframes program scores as the refinement effort needed for deployment, consisting of two stages: (1) Rule-guided perturbation, which prompts LLMs to apply sequences of predefined perturbation rules to existing high-quality programs to modify their functionality and code quality, enabling us to precisely control each program's target score to achieve balanced score distributions.

Prior work focuses largely on web pages and mobile screens, leaving app widgets underexplored. Unlike web or mobile UIs with rich hierarchical context, widgets are compact, context-free micro-interfaces that summarize key information through dense layouts and iconography under strict spatial constraints. Moreover, while (image, code) pairs are widely available for web or mobile UIs, widget designs are proprietary and lack accessible markup. We formalize this setting as the Widget-to-Code (Widget2Code) and introduce an image-only widget benchmark with fine-grained, multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. Benchmarking shows that although generalized multimodal large language models (MLLMs) outperform specialized UI2Code methods, they still produce unreliable and visually inconsistent code. To address these limitations, we develop a baseline that jointly advances perceptual understanding and structured code generation. At the perceptual level, we follow widget design principles to assemble atomic components into complete layouts, equipped with icon retrieval and reusable visualization modules.

Nevertheless, existing LLM-based vulnerability repair approaches face notable limitations: 1) they ignore the concern of locations that need to be patched and focus solely on the repair content. 2) they lack quality assessment for generated candidate patches in the iterative process.\n  To tackle the two limitations, we propose \\sysname, an LLM-based approach that provides information about where should be patched first. Furthermore, \\sysname improves the iterative repair strategy by assessing the quality of test-failing patches and selecting the best patch for the next iteration. We introduce two dimensions to assess the quality of patches: whether they introduce new vulnerabilities and the taint statement coverage. We evaluated \\sysname on a real-world C/C++ vulnerability repair dataset VulnLoc+, which contains 40 vulnerabilities and their Proofs-of-Vulnerability.

This involves aligning both the cortical surface of the brain and the interior volume. Traditional methods treat volumetric and surface-based registration separately, which often leads to inconsistencies that limit downstream analyses. We propose a deep learning framework, NeurAlign, that registers $3$D brain MRI images by jointly aligning both cortical and subcortical regions through a unified volume-and-surface-based representation. Our approach leverages an intermediate spherical coordinate space to bridge anatomical surface topology with volumetric anatomy, enabling consistent and anatomically accurate alignment. By integrating spherical registration into the learning, our method ensures geometric coherence between volume and surface domains. In a series of experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, our method consistently outperforms both classical and machine learning-based registration methods -- improving the Dice score by up to 7 points while maintaining regular deformation fields. Additionally, it is orders of magnitude faster than the standard method for this task, and is simpler to use because it requires no additional inputs beyond an MRI scan.

Surprisingly, no protocols have achieved both time- and space-efficiency for congruency predicates, such as parity computation, which are complementary in this arithmetic framework. This gap highlights a significant challenge in the field. To address this gap, we explore the parity problem, where agents are tasked with computing the parity of the given sub-population size. Then we extend the solution for parity to compute congruences modulo an arbitrary $m$.\n  Previous research on efficient population protocols has focused on protocols that minimise both stabilisation time and state utilisation for specific problems. In contrast, this work slightly relaxes this expectation, permitting protocols to place less emphasis on full optimisation and more on universality, robustness, and probabilistic guarantees. This allows us to propose a novel computing paradigm that integrates population weights (or simply weights), a robust clocking mechanism, and efficient anomaly detection coupled with a switching mechanism (which ensures slow but always correct solutions). This paradigm facilitates universal design of efficient multistage stable population protocols. Specifically, the first efficient parity and congruence protocols introduced here use both $O(\\log^3 n)$ states and achieve silent stabilisation in $O(\\log^3 n)$ time. We conclude by discussing the impact of implicit conversion between unary and binary representations enabled by the weight system, with applications to other problems, including the computation and representation of (sub-)population sizes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u4eba\u53e3\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u5947\u5076\u6027\u548c\u540c\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u6548\u7387\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u5207\u6362\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u7a33\u5b9a\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u53e3\u534f\u8bae\u9886\u57df\u5728\u5947\u5076\u6027\u8c13\u8bcd\u7b49\u540c\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6548\u7387\u517c\u5907\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u4fc3\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4eba\u53e3\u6743\u91cd\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u65f6\u949f\u673a\u5236\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5207\u6362\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u7a33\u5b9a\u4eba\u53e3\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u4f7f\u7528$O(\\log^3 n)$\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5728$O(\\log^3 n)$\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u9759\u9ed8\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5947\u5076\u6027\u548c\u540c\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6743\u91cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u7a33\u5b9a\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5947\u5076\u6027\u548c\u540c\u4f59\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u4eba\u53e3\u534f\u8bae\u9886\u57df\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u6743\u91cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9690\u5f0f\u8f6c\u6362\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

While existing video generative models produce impressive visual predictions, they are difficult to translate into low-level actions. Conversely, latent-action models better align videos with actions, but they typically operate at the single-step level and lack high-level planning capabilities. We bridge this gap by introducing Skill Abstraction from Optical Flow (SOF), a framework that learns latent skills from large collections of action-free videos. Our key idea is to learn a latent skill space through an intermediate representation based on optical flow that captures motion information aligned with both video dynamics and robot actions. By learning skills in this flow-based latent space, SOF enables high-level planning over video-derived skills and allows for easier translation of these skills into actions.

However, the black-box nature of LLMs remains a major barrier to their adoption in high-stakes and safety-critical domains, where explainability and transparency are vital for trust, accountability, and effective human supervision. Despite increasing interest in explainable AI for software engineering, existing methods lack domain-specific explanations aligned with how practitioners reason about SE artifacts. To address this gap, we introduce FeatureSHAP, the first fully automated, model-agnostic explainability framework tailored to software engineering tasks. Based on Shapley values, FeatureSHAP attributes model outputs to high-level input features through systematic input perturbation and task-specific similarity comparisons, while remaining compatible with both open-source and proprietary LLMs. We evaluate FeatureSHAP on two bi-modal SE tasks: code generation and code summarization. The results show that FeatureSHAP assigns less importance to irrelevant input features and produces explanations with higher fidelity than baseline methods. A practitioner survey involving 37 participants shows that FeatureSHAP helps practitioners better interpret model outputs and make more informed decisions.

Existing approaches lack effective learning of vehicle-related knowledge during pre-training, resulting in poor capability for modeling general vehicle perception representations. To handle this problem, we propose VehicleMAE-V2, a novel vehicle-centric pre-trained large model. By exploring and exploiting vehicle-related multimodal structured priors to guide the masked token reconstruction process, our approach can significantly enhance the model's capability to learn generalizable representations for vehicle-centric perception. Specifically, we design the Symmetry-guided Mask Module (SMM), Contour-guided Representation Module (CRM) and Semantics-guided Representation Module (SRM) to incorporate three kinds of structured priors into token reconstruction including symmetry, contour and semantics of vehicles respectively. SMM utilizes the vehicle symmetry constraints to avoid retaining symmetric patches and can thus select high-quality masked image patches and reduce information redundancy. CRM minimizes the probability distribution divergence between contour features and reconstructed features and can thus preserve holistic vehicle structure information during pixel-level reconstruction. SRM aligns image-text features through contrastive learning and cross-modal distillation to address the feature confusion caused by insufficient semantic understanding during masked reconstruction. To support the pre-training of VehicleMAE-V2, we construct Autobot4M, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 4 million vehicle images and 12,693 text descriptions.

While tightly coupled acoustic-visual-inertial fusion, typically implemented through an acoustic Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) integrated with visual-inertial measurements, can provide accurate state estimation, the associated graph-based optimization is often computationally prohibitive for real-time deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Here we present FAR-AVIO, a Schur-Complement based, tightly coupled acoustic-visual-inertial odometry framework tailored for underwater robots. FAR-AVIO embeds a Schur complement formulation into an Extended Kalman Filter(EKF), enabling joint pose-landmark optimization for accuracy while maintaining constant-time updates by efficiently marginalizing landmark states. On top of this backbone, we introduce Adaptive Weight Adjustment and Reliability Evaluation(AWARE), an online sensor health module that continuously assesses the reliability of visual, inertial and DVL measurements and adaptively regulates their sigma weights, and we develop an efficient online calibration scheme that jointly estimates DVL-IMU extrinsics, without dedicated calibration manoeuvres. Numerical simulations and real-world underwater experiments consistently show that FAR-AVIO outperforms state-of-the-art underwater SLAM baselines in both localization accuracy and computational efficiency, enabling robust operation on low-power embedded platforms.

To mitigate this, we propose Graph-Symbolic Policy Enforcement and Control (G-SPEC), a neuro-symbolic framework that constrains probabilistic planning with deterministic verification. The architecture relies on a Governance Triad - a telecom-adapted agent (TSLAM-4B), a Network Knowledge Graph (NKG), and SHACL constraints. We evaluated G-SPEC on a simulated 450-node 5G Core, achieving zero safety violations and a 94.1% remediation success rate, significantly outperforming the 82.4% baseline. Ablation analysis indicates that NKG validation drives the majority of safety gains (68%), followed by SHACL policies (24%). Scalability tests on topologies ranging from 10K to 100K nodes demonstrate that validation latency scales as $O(k^{1.2})$ where $k$ is subgraph size.

Record-breaking heat waves, drenching rainfalls, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense. Rapid and efficient response to disaster events is essential for climate resilience and sustainability. A key challenge in disaster response is to accurately and quickly identify disaster locations to support decision-making and resources allocation. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Cross-view Geolocalization approach, called ProbGLC, exploring new pathways towards generative location awareness for rapid disaster response. Herein, we combine probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models into a unified framework to simultaneously enhance model explainability (via uncertainty quantification) and achieve state-of-the-art geolocalization performance. Designed for rapid diaster response, the ProbGLC is able to address cross-view geolocalization across multiple disaster events as well as to offer unique features of probabilistic distribution and localizability score. To evaluate the ProbGLC, we conduct extensive experiments on two cross-view disaster datasets (i.e., MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster), consisting diverse cross-view imagery pairs of multiple disaster types (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires, floods, to tornadoes). Preliminary results confirms the superior geolocalization accuracy (i.e., 0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km) and model explainability (i.e., via probabilistic distributions and localizability scores) of the proposed ProbGLC approach, highlighting the great potential of leveraging generative cross-view approach to facilitate location awareness for better and faster disaster response.

At the same time, studies have identified potential defects in the generated code. Previous research has predominantly examined how code context influences the generation of defective code, often overlooking the impact of defects within commented-out code (CO code). AI coding assistants' interpretation of CO code in prompts affects the code they generate.\n  This study evaluates how AI coding assistants, GitHub Copilot and Cursor, are influenced by defective CO code. The experimental results show that defective CO code in the context causes AI coding assistants to generate more defective code, reaching up to 58.17 percent. Our findings further demonstrate that the tools do not simply copy the defective code from the context. Instead, they actively reason to complete incomplete defect patterns and continue to produce defective code despite distractions such as incorrect indentation or tags.

Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \\ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent computational cost. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "ViTs\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1ViTs\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u89c6\u89c9\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u91ca\u4ecd\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5584\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c06Transformer\u6df1\u5ea6\u89c6\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u6d41\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBlock-Recurrent Hypothesis\uff08BRH\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3Raptor\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cRaptor\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u75282\u4e2a\u5757\u5373\u53ef\u6062\u590dDINOv2 ImageNet-1k\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u948896%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86ViTs\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6536\u655b\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08ViTs\uff09\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Instead of single inference passes, multiple agents perform collective reasoning to derive high quality answers. However, existing multi-agent orchestration relies on static heuristic workflows such as fixed loop limits and barrier synchronization. These ad-hoc approaches waste computational resources, incur high latency due to stragglers, and risk finalizing transient agreements. We argue that reliable multi-agent reasoning requires a formal foundation analogous to classical distributed consensus problem.\n  To that end, we propose a formal model of the multi-agent refinement problem. The model includes definitions of the correctness guarantees and formal semantics of agent reasoning. We then introduce Aegean, a consensus protocol designed for stochastic reasoning agents that solves multi-agent refinement. We implement the protocol in Aegean-Serve, a consensus-aware serving engine that performs incremental quorum detection across concurrent agent executions, enabling early termination when sufficient agents converge. Evaluation using four mathematical reasoning benchmarks shows that Aegean provides provable safety and liveness guarantees while reducing latency by 1.2--20$\\times$ compared to state-of-the-art baselines, maintaining answer quality within 2.5%.

Although recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for policy-grounded moderation, the practical challenges of training these systems to achieve expert-level accuracy in real-world settings remain largely unexplored, particularly in regimes characterized by label sparsity, evolving policy definitions, and the need for nuanced reasoning beyond shallow pattern matching. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical investigation of scaling reinforcement learning (RL) for content classification, systematically evaluating multiple RL training recipes and reward-shaping strategies-including verifiable rewards and LLM-as-judge frameworks-to transform general-purpose language models into specialized, policy-aligned classifiers across three real-world content moderation tasks. Our findings provide actionable insights for industrial-scale moderation systems, demonstrating that RL exhibits sigmoid-like scaling behavior in which performance improves smoothly with increased training data, rollouts, and optimization steps before gradually saturating. Moreover, we show that RL substantially improves performance on tasks requiring complex policy-grounded reasoning while achieving up to 100x higher data efficiency than supervised fine-tuning, making it particularly effective in domains where expert annotations are scarce or costly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cRL\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u5ba1\u6838\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6311\u6218\u4ecd\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u6d45\u5c42\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cdRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u9020\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u548cLLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u6846\u67b6\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u901a\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "result": "RL\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3cS\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u7740\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3001\u5c55\u5f00\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u5e73\u6ed1\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u9010\u6e10\u9971\u548c\u3002RL\u5728\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u7b56\u7565\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6bd4\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u8fbe100\u500d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u5728\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u7b56\u7565\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6bd4\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

This study conducts the first large-scale empirical analysis of practitioner challenges in dedicated distributed frameworks.

Our results show that 45.1\\% of bug symptoms are unique to distributed frameworks, with setup failures, memory issues, and performance anomalies being the most prevalent.

However, serving multiple fine-tuned LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in serverless environments faces critical challenges: reactive adapter loading causes significant cold start latency, and frequent adapter swapping leads to severe GPU memory fragmentation. In this paper, we present Predictive-LoRA (P-LoRA), a proactive and fragmentation-aware serverless inference system for LoRA-based LLMs. P-LoRA introduces two key innovations: (1) a lightweight LSTM-based traffic predictor that forecasts adapter demand and proactively prefetches hot adapters from host memory to GPU, reducing cold start latency by up to 68%; and (2) a page-based adapter memory management mechanism inspired by operating system virtual memory, which keeps GPU memory utilization above 87% even under heterogeneous adapter ranks. We evaluate P-LoRA using production-like workloads derived from the Azure Functions trace. Experimental results demonstrate that P-LoRA achieves 1.52x higher throughput than S-LoRA while reducing the average Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) by 35% under high concurrency scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "P-LoRA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9LoRA-based LLMs\u7684\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u9884\u52a0\u8f7d\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72LoRA-based LLMs\u63a8\u7406\u670d\u52a1\u9762\u4e34\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u548cGPU\u5185\u5b58\u788e\u7247\u5316\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eLSTM\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u9002\u914d\u5668\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u9884\u52a0\u8f7d\uff1b2. \u5f15\u5165\u7c7b\u4f3c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u865a\u62df\u5185\u5b58\u7684\u9875\u9762\u5f0f\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "P-LoRA\u5728\u7c7b\u4f3c\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u7684Azure Functions\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e2d\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u53471.52\u500d\uff0c\u9ad8\u5e76\u53d1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5e73\u5747TTFT\u964d\u4f4e35%\u3002", "conclusion": "P-LoRA\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u9884\u52a0\u8f7d\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9875\u9762\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LoRA-based LLMs\u5728\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002"}}

Most existing tactile sensors rely on deformation to infer contact, making such light-contact interactions difficult to perceive robustly. To address this, we present LightTact, a visual-tactile fingertip sensor that makes contact directly visible via a deformation-independent, optics-based principle. LightTact uses an ambient-blocking optical configuration that suppresses both external light and internal illumination at non-contact regions, while transmitting only the diffuse light generated at true contacts. As a result, LightTact produces high-contrast raw images in which non-contact pixels remain near-black (mean gray value < 3) and contact pixels preserve the natural appearance of the contacting surface. Built on this, LightTact achieves accurate pixel-level contact segmentation that is robust to material properties, contact force, surface appearance, and environmental lighting. We further integrate LightTact on a robotic arm and demonstrate manipulation behaviors driven by extremely light contact, including water spreading, facial-cream dipping, and thin-film interaction.

In Stage-1, our model is trained on rationale generation, while in Stage-2, we jointly train on label prediction and rationale generation, applying scheduled sampling to gradually transition from conditioning on gold labels to model predictions. We evaluate Reason2Decide on three medical datasets, including a proprietary triage dataset and public biomedical QA datasets. Across model sizes, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity (BERTScore, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge). In triage, Reason2Decide is rationale source-robust across LLM-generated, nurse-authored, and nurse-post-processed rationales. In our experiments, while using only LLM-generated rationales in Stage-1, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning variants. This indicates that LLM-generated rationales are suitable for pretraining models, reducing reliance on human annotations. Remarkably, Reason2Decide achieves these gains with models 40x smaller than contemporary foundation models, making clinical reasoning more accessible for resource-constrained deployments while still providing explainable decision support.", "AI": {"tldr": "Reason2Decide\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u89e3\u91ca\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u66b4\u9732\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u7406\u7531\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u6807\u7b7e\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u7406\u7531\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u8ba1\u5212\u91c7\u6837\u9010\u6b65\u4ece\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ec4\u91d1\u6807\u7b7e\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cReason2Decide\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\uff08F1\uff09\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\uff08BERTScore\u3001BLEU\u3001LLM-as-a-Judge\uff09\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u5c0f\u578b\u96f6\u6837\u672cLLM\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5206\u8bca\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Reason2Decide\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u89e3\u91ca\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

It refers to a design style that enables systems to be developed as suites of small, loosely coupled, and autonomous components (services) that encapsulate functionality and communicate via language-agnostic APIs. However, defining appropriately sized services that capture cohesive subsets of system functionality remains challenging. Existing work often relies on the availability of documentation, access to project personnel, or a priori knowledge of the target number of services, assumptions that do not hold in many real-world scenarios. Our work addresses these limitations using a deep reinforcement learning-based approach to identify appropriately sized services directly from implementation artifacts. We present Rake, a reinforcement learning-based technique that leverages available system documentation and source code to guide service decomposition at the level of implementation methods. Rake does not require specific documentation or access to project personnel and is language-agnostic. It also supports a customizable objective function that balances modularization quality and business capability alignment, i.e., the degree to which a service covers the targeted business capability. We applied Rake to four open-source legacy projects and compared it with two state-of-the-art techniques. On average, Rake achieved 7-14 percent higher modularization quality and 18-22 percent stronger business capability alignment.

Gaussian Interconnected Networks based on the arithmetic of Gaussian integers, offer attractive properties regarding diameter and symmetry. Despite their attractive theoretical properties, adaptive routing techniques in these networks are vulnerable to node and link faults, leading to rapid degradation in communication reliability. Node failures (particularly those following Gaussian distributions, such as thermal hotspots or physical damage clusters) pose severe challenges to traditional deterministic routing. This paper proposes a fault-aware Reinforcement Learning (RL) routing scheme tailored for Gaussian Interconnected Networks. By utilizing a PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) agent with a specific reward structure designed to penalize fault proximity, the system dynamically learns to bypass faulty regions. We compare our proposed RL-based routing protocol against a greedy adaptive shortest-path routing algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the RL agent significantly outperforms the adaptive routing sustaining a Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) of 0.95 at 40% fault density compared to 0.66 for the greedy. Furthermore, the RL approach exhibits effective delivery rates compared to the greedy adaptive routing, particularly under low network load of 20% at 0.57 vs. 0.43, showing greater proficiency in managing congestion, validating its efficacy in stochastic, fault-prone topologies", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8ePPO\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u4e92\u8fde\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5728\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u94fe\u8def\u6545\u969c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u65af\u4e92\u8fde\u7f51\u7edc\u867d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u76f4\u5f84\u548c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7b49\u5438\u5f15\u4eba\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8def\u7531\u6280\u672f\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u94fe\u8def\u6545\u969c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u901a\u4fe1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8fc5\u901f\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528PPO\uff08\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6545\u969c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed5\u8fc7\u6545\u969c\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8def\u7531\u534f\u8bae\u572840%\u6545\u969c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u4e860.95\u7684\u5305\u4ea4\u4ed8\u7387\uff08PDR\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u8d2a\u5a6a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u8def\u7531\u7b97\u6cd5\u76840.66\u3002\u5728\u4f4e\u7f51\u7edc\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0820%\uff09\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4ea4\u4ed8\u7387\uff080.57 vs. 0.43\uff09\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u968f\u673a\u3001\u6613\u6545\u969c\u62d3\u6251\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6545\u969c\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u65af\u4e92\u8fde\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u94fe\u8def\u6545\u969c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7PPO\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u6784\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed5\u8fc7\u6545\u969c\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing works in financial sentiment analysis have not considered the impact of stock prices or market feedback on sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose an adaptive framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with real-world stock market feedback to improve sentiment classification in the context of the Indian stock market. The proposed methodology fine-tunes the LLaMA 3.2 3B model using instruction-based learning on the SentiFin dataset. To enhance sentiment predictions, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline is employed that dynamically selects multi-source contextual information based on the cosine similarity of the sentence embeddings. Furthermore, a feedback-driven module is introduced that adjusts the reliability of the source by comparing predicted sentiment with actual next-day stock returns, allowing the system to iteratively adapt to market behavior. To generalize this adaptive mechanism across temporal data, a reinforcement learning agent trained using proximal policy optimization (PPO) is incorporated. The PPO agent learns to optimize source weighting policies based on cumulative reward signals from sentiment-return alignment. Experimental results on NIFTY 50 news headlines collected from 2024 to 2025 demonstrate that the proposed system significantly improves classification accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment over baseline models and static retrieval methods. The results validate the potential of combining instruction-tuned LLMs with dynamic feedback and reinforcement learning for robust, market-aware financial sentiment modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408LLMs\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91d1\u878d\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u91d1\u878d\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u672a\u8003\u8651\u80a1\u4ef7\u6216\u5e02\u573a\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLaMA 3.2 3B\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7ba1\u9053\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u591a\u6e90\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08PPO\uff09\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728NIFTY 50\u65b0\u95fb\u6807\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001F1\u5206\u6570\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u5e02\u573a\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u60c5\u611f\u5efa\u6a21\u3002"}}

However, the clinical relevance of the tissue characteristics at the micro- and macro-environment level is limited by the lack of tools that facilitate the measurement of the spatial interaction of individual structure characteristics and their association with clinical parameters. To address these challenges, we introduce HistoWAS (Histology-Wide Association Study), a computational framework designed to link tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes. Specifically, HistoWAS implements (1) a feature space that augments conventional metrics with 30 topological and spatial features, adapted from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) point pattern analysis, to quantify tissue micro-architecture; and (2) an association study engine, inspired by Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS), that performs mass univariate regression for each feature with statistical correction. As a proof of concept, we applied HistoWAS to analyze a total of 102 features (72 conventional object-level features and our 30 spatial features) using 385 PAS-stained WSIs from 206 participants in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP).

To tackle this problem, we present WOC, a dual-path consensus protocol that dynamically routes operations into two paths based on their access patterns. Independent operations execute through a fast path that uses object-specific weighted quorums and completes in one network round-trip.

We frame both tasks as sequential, tool-guided decisions and introduce MolAct, an agentic reinforcement learning framework that employs a two-stage training paradigm: first building editing capability, then optimizing properties while reusing the learned editing behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize molecular design as an Agentic Reinforcement Learning problem, where an LLM agent learns to interleave reasoning, tool-use, and molecular optimization. The framework enables agents to interact in multiple turns, invoking chemical tools for validity checking, property assessment, and similarity control, and leverages their feedback to refine subsequent edits. We instantiate the MolAct framework to train two model families: MolEditAgent for molecular editing tasks and MolOptAgent for molecular optimization tasks. In molecular editing, MolEditAgent-7B delivers 100, 95, and 98 valid add, delete, and substitute edits, outperforming strong closed \"thinking\" baselines such as DeepSeek-R1; MolEditAgent-3B approaches the performance of much larger open \"thinking\" models like Qwen3-32B-think.

Moreover, due to the pronounced variations in tumor region scales across different WSIs, existing Transformer-based methods employing fixed-scale attention mechanisms face significant challenges in precisely capturing local instance correlations and fail to account for the distance-based decay effect of patch relevance. To address these challenges, we propose window scale decay MIL (WSD-MIL), designed to enhance the capacity to model tumor regions of varying scales while improving computational efficiency. WSD-MIL comprises: 1) a window scale decay based attention module, which employs a cluster-based sampling strategy to reduce computational costs while progressively decaying attention window-scale to capture local instance relationships at varying scales; and 2) a squeeze-and-excitation based region gate module, which dynamically adjusts window weights to enhance global information modeling.

One of the challenges is apple pose estimation, where key points, such as the calyx, are often occluded. Recently developed pose estimation methods no longer rely on these key points, but still require them for annotations, making annotating challenging and time-consuming. Due to the abovementioned occlusions, there can be conflicting and missing annotations of the same fruit between different images. Novel 3D reconstruction methods can be used to simplify annotating and enlarge datasets. We propose a novel pipeline consisting of 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct an orchard scene, simplified annotations, automated projection of the annotations to images, and the training and evaluation of a pose estimation method. Using our pipeline, 105 manual annotations were required to obtain 28,191 training labels, a reduction of 99.6%. Experimental results indicated that training with labels of fruits that are $\\leq95\\%$ occluded resulted in the best performance, with a neutral F1 score of 0.927 on the original images and 0.970 on the rendered images.

The key challenge lies in tokenizing TS data into textual representations that align with LLMs' pre-trained knowledge. While existing work often relies on fine-tuning specialized modules to bridge this gap, a distinct, yet challenging, paradigm aims to leverage truly off-the-shelf LLMs without any fine-tuning whatsoever, relying solely on strategic tokenization of numerical sequences. The performance of these fully frozen models is acutely sensitive to the textual representation of the input data, as their parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet highly effective strategy to overcome this brittleness: injecting noise into the raw time series before tokenization. This non-invasive intervention acts as a form of inference-time augmentation, compelling the frozen LLM to extrapolate based on robust underlying temporal patterns rather than superficial numerical artifacts. We theoretically analyze this phenomenon and empirically validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks. Notably, to fully eliminate potential biases from data contamination during LLM pre-training, we introduce two novel TS datasets that fall outside all utilized LLMs' pre-training scopes, and consistently observe improved performance.

In a nation like Bangladesh, enhancing guava production and agricultural practices plays a crucial role in its economy.

This study aims to create models using CNN alongside traditional machine learning techniques that can effectively identify guava diseases in locally cultivated varieties in Bangladesh. In order to achieve the highest classification accuracy of approximately 99.99% for the guava dataset, we propose utilizing ensemble models that combine CNNML with Gradient Boosting Machine.

However, their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments is severely hin dered by high inference latency. While smooth robotic interaction requires control frequencies of 20 to 30 Hz, current VLA models typi cally operate at only 3-5 Hz on edge devices due to the memory bound nature of autoregressive decoding. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise model accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ActionFlow, a system-level inference framework tailored for resource-constrained edge plat forms. At the core of ActionFlow is a Cross-Request Pipelin ing strategy, a novel scheduler that redefines VLA inference as a macro-pipeline of micro-requests. The strategy intelligently batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across continuous time steps to maximize hardware utilization. Furthermore, to support this scheduling, we propose a Cross Request State Packed Forward operator and a Unified KV Ring Buffer, which fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations. Experimental results demonstrate that ActionFlow achieves a 2.55x improvement in FPS on the OpenVLA-7B model without retraining, enabling real-time dy namic manipulation on edge hardware.

To tackle this problem, we propose DDTM, a dual-branch weakly supervised framework that explicitly decouples local semantic refinement from global contextual reasoning. Specifically, DDTM introduces a diffusion-based branch to progressively refine fine-scale local semantics under coarse supervision, while a transformer-based branch enforces long-range contextual consistency across large spatial extents. In addition, we design a pseudo-label confidence evaluation module to mitigate noise induced by cross-resolution inconsistencies and to selectively exploit reliable supervisory signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDTM establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Chesapeake Bay benchmark, achieving 66.52\\% mIoU and substantially outperforming prior weakly supervised methods.

Motivated by this gap, we empirically study how misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations can limit the effectiveness of imitation learning. More precisely, experts have significantly higher visibility (e.g., ignoring occlusions) and far lower uncertainty (e.g., knowing other vehicles' actions), making them difficult to imitate reliably. Furthermore, navigational intent (i.e., the route to follow) is under-specified in student models at test time via only a single target point. We demonstrate that these asymmetries can measurably limit driving performance in CARLA and offer practical interventions to address them. After careful modifications to narrow the gaps between expert and student, our TransFuser v6 (TFv6) student policy achieves a new state of the art on all major publicly available CARLA closed-loop benchmarks, reaching 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13.

However, ensuring safety remains a critical challenge across many domains and tasks. Previous works on safe RL from human feedback (RLHF) first learn reward and cost models from offline data, then use constrained RL to optimize a safe policy. While such an approach works in the contextual bandits settings (LLMs), in long horizon continuous control tasks, errors in rewards and costs accumulate, leading to impairment in performance when used with constrained RL methods. To address these challenges, (a) instead of indirectly learning policies (from rewards and costs), we introduce a framework that learns a policy directly based on pairwise preferences regarding the agent's behavior in terms of rewards, as well as binary labels indicating the safety of trajectory segments; (b) we propose \\textsc{PreSa} (Preference and Safety Alignment), a method that combines preference learning module with safety alignment in a constrained optimization problem. This optimization problem is solved within a Lagrangian paradigm that directly learns reward-maximizing safe policy \\textit{without explicitly learning reward and cost models}, avoiding the need for constrained RL; (c) we evaluate our approach on continuous control tasks with both synthetic and real human feedback.

Current models can parse simple, single-target commands but fail when presented with complex geospatial scenarios, e.g., segmenting objects at various granularities, executing multi-target instructions, and interpreting implicit user intent. To drive progress against these failures, we present LaSeRS, the first large-scale dataset built for comprehensive training and evaluation across four critical dimensions of language-guided segmentation: hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning requirements, and linguistic variability. By capturing these dimensions, LaSeRS moves beyond simple commands, providing a benchmark for complex geospatial reasoning. This addresses a critical gap: existing datasets oversimplify, leading to sensitivity-prone real-world models. We also propose SegEarth-R2, an MLLM architecture designed for comprehensive language-guided segmentation in RS, which directly confronts these challenges. The model's effectiveness stems from two key improvements: (1) a spatial attention supervision mechanism specifically handles the localization of small objects and their components, and (2) a flexible and efficient segmentation query mechanism that handles both single-target and multi-target scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our SegEarth-R2 achieves outstanding performance on LaSeRS and other benchmarks, establishing a powerful baseline for the next generation of geospatial segmentation.

However, many deployed memory systems primarily optimize compression and storage, with comparatively less emphasis on explicit, closed-loop control of memory retrieval. From this observation, we build memory retrieval as an autonomous, accurate, and compatible agent system, named MemR$^3$, which has two core mechanisms: 1) a router that selects among retrieve, reflect, and answer actions to optimize answer quality; 2) a global evidence-gap tracker that explicitly renders the answering process transparent and tracks the evidence collection process. This design departs from the standard retrieve-then-answer pipeline by introducing a closed-loop control mechanism that enables autonomous decision-making. Empirical results on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that MemR$^3$ surpasses strong baselines on LLM-as-a-Judge score, and particularly, it improves existing retrievers across four categories with an overall improvement on RAG (+7.29%) and Zep (+1.94%) using GPT-4.1-mini backend, offering a plug-and-play controller for existing memory stores.", "AI": {"tldr": "MemR$^3$\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3b\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u8bb0\u5fc6\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0cMemR$^3$\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86MemR$^3$\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\uff1a1\uff09\u8def\u7531\u5668\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u53cd\u601d\u6216\u56de\u7b54\u52a8\u4f5c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b2\uff09\u5168\u5c40\u8bc1\u636e\u7f3a\u53e3\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u56de\u7b54\u8fc7\u7a0b\u900f\u660e\u5316\u5e76\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8bc1\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728LoCoMo\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMemR$^3$\u5728LLM-as-a-Judge\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728RAG\uff08+7.29%\uff09\u548cZep\uff08+1.94%\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "MemR$^3$\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5b58\u50a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3002"}}

This study investigates whether incorporating road-facing views alongside driver-facing footage improves distraction detection accuracy in naturalistic driving conditions. Using synchronized dual-camera recordings from real-world driving, we benchmark three leading spatiotemporal action recognition architectures: SlowFast-R50, X3D-M, and SlowOnly-R50. Each model is evaluated under two input configurations: driver-only and stacked dual-view. Results show that while contextual inputs can improve detection in certain models, performance gains depend strongly on the underlying architecture. The single-pathway SlowOnly model achieved a 9.8 percent improvement with dual-view inputs, while the dual-pathway SlowFast model experienced a 7.2 percent drop in accuracy due to representational conflicts. These findings suggest that simply adding visual context is not sufficient and may lead to interference unless the architecture is specifically designed to support multi-view integration.

Current methods often overlook the rich hierarchical structures, such as the semantic hierarchy of primitives (e.g., apple fruit) and the conceptual hierarchy between primitives and compositions (e.g, sliced apple apple). A few recent efforts have shown effectiveness in modeling these hierarchies through loss regularization within Euclidean space. In this paper, we argue that they fail to scale to the large-scale taxonomies required for real-world CZSL: the space's polynomial volume growth in flat geometry cannot match the exponential structure, impairing generalization capacity. To this end, we propose H2em, a new framework that learns Hierarchical Hyperbolic EMbeddings for CZSL. H2em leverages the unique properties of hyperbolic geometry, a space naturally suited for embedding tree-like structures with low distortion. However, a naive hyperbolic mapping may suffer from hierarchical collapse and poor fine-grained discrimination. We further design two learning objectives to structure this space: a Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss that uses hyperbolic entailment cones to enforce the predefined hierarchies, and a Discriminative Alignment Loss with hard negative mining to establish a large geodesic distance between semantically similar compositions. Furthermore, we devise Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention to realize instance-aware cross-modal infusion within hyperbolic geometry.

We demonstrate that by enforcing a scientific methodology of hypothesize, probe, and code, agents can autonomously write robust, production-grade code skills.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6280\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406\u5982\u4f55\u81ea\u4e3b\u7f16\u5199\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7801\u6280\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u96f6\u5f00\u59cb\u81ea\u4e3b\u5408\u6210\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u6d89\u53caOutlook\u548cOneDrive\u7684\u8de8\u670d\u52a1\u7f16\u6392\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6280\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u4e3b\u7f16\u5199\u51fa\u5065\u58ee\u3001\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u6280\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65bd\u5047\u8bbe\u3001\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4e3b\u7f16\u5199\u51fa\u5065\u58ee\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7801\u6280\u80fd\u3002"}}

This task is particularly challenging for Mandarin, as visemes are highly ambiguous and homophones are prevalent. We propose VALLR-Pin, a novel two-stage framework that extends the recent VALLR architecture from English to Mandarin. First, a shared video encoder feeds into dual decoders, which jointly predict both Chinese character sequences and their standard Pinyin romanization. The multi-task learning of character and phonetic outputs fosters robust visual-semantic representations. During inference, the text decoder generates multiple candidate transcripts. We construct a prompt by concatenating the Pinyin output with these candidate Chinese sequences and feed it to a large language model to resolve ambiguities and refine the transcription. This provides the LLM with explicit phonetic context to correct homophone-induced errors. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM on synthetic noisy examples: we generate imperfect Pinyin-text pairs from intermediate VALLR-Pin checkpoints using the training data, creating instruction-response pairs for error correction. This endows the LLM with awareness of our model's specific error patterns.

Current solutions, such as post-hoc filtering or projection-based methods, often compromise structural novelty or disrupt key pharmacophores by forcing molecules into pre-defined synthetic templates. Herein, we introduce SynCraft, a reasoning-based framework that reframes synthesizability optimization not as a sequence translation task, but as a precise structural editing problem. Leveraging the emergent reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models, SynCraft navigates the \"synthesis cliff\" where minimal structural modifications yield significant gains in synthetic feasibility. By predicting executable sequences of atom-level edits rather than generating SMILES strings directly, SynCraft circumvents the syntactic fragility of LLMs while harnessing their chemical intuition. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that SynCraft outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating synthesizable analogs with high structural fidelity. Furthermore, through interaction-aware prompting, SynCraft successfully replicates expert medicinal chemistry intuition in editing PLK1 inhibitors and rescuing high-scoring but previously discarded RIPK1 candidates in previous molecular generation literatures.", "AI": {"tldr": "SynCraft\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u5b50\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u7f16\u8f91\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u5408\u6210\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u7d22\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5b50\u5408\u6210\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u727a\u7272\u7ed3\u6784\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u6216\u7834\u574f\u5173\u952e\u836f\u6548\u56e2\u3002", "method": "SynCraft\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c06\u5408\u6210\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u7ea7\u7f16\u8f91\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "SynCraft\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u9ad8\u7684\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7269\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u590d\u5236\u4e13\u5bb6\u76f4\u89c9\uff0c\u633d\u6551\u5148\u524d\u88ab\u4e22\u5f03\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u5019\u9009\u5206\u5b50\u3002", "conclusion": "SynCraft\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u5408\u6210\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u548c\u836f\u6548\u56e2\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002"}}

This gap limits the effectiveness of image understanding in domains like journalism, education, and digital archives, where richer, more informative descriptions are essential. To address this, we propose a multimodal pipeline that augments visual input with external textual knowledge. Our system retrieves semantically similar images using BEIT-3 (Flickr30k-384 and COCO-384) and SigLIP So-384, reranks them using ORB and SIFT for geometric alignment, and extracts contextual information from related articles via semantic search. A fine-tuned Qwen3 model with QLoRA then integrates this context with base captions generated by Instruct BLIP (Vicuna-7B) to produce event-enriched, context-aware descriptions.

Between infrastructure and orchestration, a \\emph{scientific intelligence substrate} organizes reusable models, knowledge, and components into executable building blocks for workflow reasoning and action, enabling composition, auditability, and improvement through use.\n  We demonstrate this stack with eleven representative master agents in real workflows, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in end-to-end scientific cycle time and generating execution-grounded signals from real workloads at multi-million scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "Bohrium+SciMaster\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u548c\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u4ee3\u7406\u79d1\u5b66\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u79d1\u5b66\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee3\u7406\u79d1\u5b66\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u79d1\u5b66\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u6269\u5c55\u9762\u4e34\u89c2\u5bdf\u3001\u91cd\u73b0\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u51c6\u5907\u3001\u6267\u884c\u8ffd\u6eaf\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Bohrium\u4f5c\u4e3aAI4S\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0cSciMaster\u7528\u4e8e\u7f16\u6392\u957f\u671f\u79d1\u5b66\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u79d1\u5b66\u667a\u80fd\u57fa\u677f\u4ee5\u7ec4\u7ec7\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e8611\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u5468\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u767e\u4e07\u7ea7\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u6267\u884c\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91c7\u7528Bohrium+SciMaster\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u548c\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u4ee3\u7406\u79d1\u5b66\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u79d1\u5b66\u5468\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u6267\u884c\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002"}}

This study compares large language models, including GatorTron-Base (trained on clinical data), Llama 8B, and Mistral 7B, against models like BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec, setting benchmarks for predicting Shock in critically ill patients. Timely prediction of shock can enable early interventions, thus improving patient outcomes. Text data from 17,294 ICU stays of patients in the MIMIC III database were scored for length of stay > 24 hours and shock index (SI) > 0.7 to yield 355 and 87 patients with normal and abnormal SI-index, respectively. Both focal and cross-entropy losses were used during finetuning to address class imbalances. Our findings indicate that while GatorTron Base achieved the highest weighted recall of 80.5%, the overall performance metrics were comparable between SLMs and LLMs. This suggests that LLMs are not inherently superior to SLMs in predicting future clinical events despite their strong performance on text-based tasks. To achieve meaningful clinical outcomes, future efforts in training LLMs should prioritize developing models capable of predicting clinical trajectories rather than focusing on simpler tasks such as named entity recognition or phenotyping.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1LLMs\u5728\u6587\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u4f11\u514b\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u5e76\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eSLMs\u3002\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLMs\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u53d1\u751f\u4e86\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u3002\u53ca\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u4f11\u514b\u53ef\u4ee5\u4fc3\u4f7f\u65e9\u671f\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584\u60a3\u8005\u9884\u540e\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5305\u62ecGatorTron-Base\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\u3001Llama 8B\u548cMistral 7B\u5728\u5185\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e0eBioBERT\u3001DocBERT\u3001BioClinicalBERT\u3001Word2Vec\u548cDoc2Vec\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u91cd\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u4f11\u514b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u7126\u70b9\u635f\u5931\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "GatorTron Base\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u53ec\u56de\u738780.5%\uff0c\u4f46SLMs\u548cLLMs\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5e76\u4e0d\u56fa\u6709\u5730\u4f18\u4e8eSLMs\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5f3a\u52b2\u3002\u672a\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3LLMs\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u6216\u8868\u578b\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Although deep learning-based HAR systems are widely adopted, the impact of Activation Functions (AFs) and Model Optimizers (MOs) on performance has not been sufficiently analyzed, particularly regarding how their combinations influence model behavior in practical scenarios. Most existing studies focus on architecture design, while the interaction between AF and MO choices remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we investigate the effect of three commonly used activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh) combined with four optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad) using two recurrent deep learning architectures, namely BiLSTM and ConvLSTM. Experiments are conducted on six medically relevant activity classes selected from the HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets, considering their suitability for healthcare-oriented HAR applications. Our experimental results show that ConvLSTM consistently outperforms BiLSTM across both datasets. ConvLSTM, combined with Adam or RMSprop, achieves an accuracy of up to 99.00%, demonstrating strong spatio-temporal learning capabilities and stable performance. While BiLSTM performs reasonably well on UCF101, with accuracy approaching 98.00%, its performance drops to approximately 60.00% on HMDB51, indicating limited robustness across datasets and weaker sensitivity to AF and MO variations.

We construct the first large-scale teacher multimodal sentiment analysis dataset, T-MED.To ensure labeling accuracy and efficiency, we employ a human-machine collaborative labeling process.The T-MED dataset includes 14,938 instances of teacher emotional data from 250 real classrooms across 11 subjects ranging from K-12 to higher education, integrating multimodal text, audio, video, and instructional information.Furthermore, we propose a novel asymmetric attention-based multimodal teacher sentiment analysis model, AAM-TSA.AAM-TSA introduces an asymmetric attention mechanism and hierarchical gating unit to enable differentiated cross-modal feature fusion and precise emotional classification.

Although previous methods achieve LiDAR point cloud generation from user inputs, they struggle to attain high-quality results while enabling versatile controllability, due to the imbalance between the complex distribution of LiDAR point clouds and the simple control signals. To address the limitation, we propose LiDARDraft, which utilizes the 3D layout to build a bridge between versatile conditional signals and LiDAR point clouds. The 3D layout can be trivially generated from various user inputs such as textual descriptions and images. Specifically, we represent text, images, and point clouds as unified 3D layouts, which are further transformed into semantic and depth control signals. Then, we employ a rangemap-based ControlNet to guide LiDAR point cloud generation.

We developed SAGE (Secure Agent for Generative Dose Expertise), an LLM-based planning agent for automated SRS treatment planning. Two variants generated plans for each case: one using a non-reasoning model, one using a reasoning model. The reasoning variant showed comparable plan dosimetry relative to human planners on primary endpoints (PTV coverage, maximum dose, conformity index, gradient index; all p > 0.21) while reducing cochlear dose below human baselines (p = 0.022). When prompted to improve conformity, the reasoning model demonstrated systematic planning behaviors including prospective constraint verification (457 instances) and trade-off deliberation (609 instances), while the standard model exhibited none of these deliberative processes (0 and 7 instances, respectively).

The first two authors contributed equally", "summary": "Novel view synthesis (NVS) seeks to render photorealistic, 3D-consistent images of a scene from unseen camera poses given only a sparse set of posed views. Existing deterministic networks render observed regions quickly but blur unobserved areas, whereas stochastic diffusion-based methods hallucinate plausible content yet incur heavy training- and inference-time costs. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework that unifies the strengths of both paradigms. A bidirectional transformer encodes multi-view image tokens and Plucker-ray embeddings, producing a shared latent representation.

However, many methods still compress content into lossy summaries or rely on limited toolsets, weakening temporal grounding and missing fine-grained cues. We propose a multi-agent framework in which a master LLM coordinates a grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments and a vision agent to extract targeted textual observations. The master agent plans with a step limit, and is trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation. This design helps the master agent focus on relevant clips via grounding, complements subtitles with visual detail, and yields interpretable trajectories. On our proposed LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ which are episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+, our multi-agent system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines.

While Ground Penetrating Radar and Infrared Thermography enable subsurface defect detection, single modal approaches face complementary constraints radar struggles with moisture and shallow defects, while thermography exhibits weather dependency and limited depth. This paper presents a multi modal attention network fusing radar temporal patterns with thermal spatial signatures for bridge deck delamination detection. Our architecture introduces temporal attention for radar processing, spatial attention for thermal features, and cross modal fusion with learnable embeddings discovering complementary defect patterns invisible to individual sensors. We incorporate uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo dropout and learned variance estimation, decomposing uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components for safety critical decisions. Experiments on five bridge datasets reveal that on balanced to moderately imbalanced data, our approach substantially outperforms baselines in accuracy and AUC representing meaningful improvements over single modal and concatenation based fusion. Ablation studies demonstrate cross modal attention provides critical gains beyond within modality attention, while multi head mechanisms achieve improved calibration. Uncertainty quantification reduces calibration error, enabling selective prediction by rejecting uncertain cases. However, under extreme class imbalance, attention mechanisms show vulnerability to majority class collapse. These findings provide actionable guidance: attention based architecture performs well across typical scenarios, while extreme imbalance requires specialized techniques.

However, existing methods often suffer from multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment, which lead to biases toward louder or larger objects while overlooking weaker, smaller, or co-occurring sources. To address these challenges, we propose DDAVS, a Disentangled Audio Semantics and Delayed Bidirectional Alignment framework. To mitigate multi-source entanglement, DDAVS employs learnable queries to extract audio semantics and anchor them within a structured semantic space derived from an audio prototype memory bank. This is further optimized through contrastive learning to enhance discriminability and robustness. To alleviate audio-visual misalignment, DDAVS introduces dual cross-attention with delayed modality interaction, improving the robustness of multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments on the AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks demonstrate that DDAVS consistently outperforms existing approaches, exhibiting strong performance across single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance scenarios. These results validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our framework under challenging real-world audio-visual segmentation conditions.

Existing pruning approaches treat either tokens or heads in isolation, relying on heuristics or first-order signals, which often sacrifice accuracy or fail to generalize across inputs. We introduce HEART-ViT, a Hessian-guided efficient dynamic attention and token pruning framework for vision transformers, which to the best of our knowledge is the first unified, second-order, input-adaptive framework for ViT optimization. HEART-ViT estimates curvature-weighted sensitivities of both tokens and attention heads using efficient Hessian-vector products, enabling principled pruning decisions under explicit loss budgets.This dual-view sensitivity reveals an important structural insight: token pruning dominates computational savings, while head pruning provides fine-grained redundancy removal, and their combination achieves a superior trade-off. On ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1K with ViT-B/16 and DeiT-B/16, HEART-ViT achieves up to 49.4 percent FLOPs reduction, 36 percent lower latency, and 46 percent higher throughput, while consistently matching or even surpassing baseline accuracy after fine-tuning, for example 4.7 percent recovery at 40 percent token pruning. Beyond theoretical benchmarks, we deploy HEART-ViT on different edge devices such as AGX Orin, demonstrating that our reductions in FLOPs and latency translate directly into real-world gains in inference speed and energy efficiency.

However, the radar signals are often sparse due to specular reflection, making the extraction of robust features from radar signals highly challenging. To address this, we present milliMamba, a radar-based 2D human pose estimation framework that jointly models spatio-temporal dependencies across both the feature extraction and decoding stages. Specifically, given the high dimensionality of radar inputs, we adopt a Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from longer sequences with linear complexity. A Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder then predicts joint coordinates across multiple frames. Together, this spatio-temporal modeling pipeline enables the model to leverage contextual cues from neighboring frames and joints to infer missing joints caused by specular reflections. To reinforce motion smoothness, we incorporate a velocity loss alongside the standard keypoint loss during training. Experiments on the TransHuPR and HuPR datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements, exceeding the baselines by 11.0 AP and 14.6 AP, respectively, while maintaining reasonable complexity.

A considerable challenge for modern low-shot counters are dense regions with small objects. While total counts in such situations are typically well addressed by density-based counters, their usefulness is limited by poor localization capabilities. This is better addressed by point-detection-based counters, which are based on query-based detectors. However, due to limited number of pre-trained queries, they underperform on images with very large numbers of objects, and resort to ad-hoc techniques like upsampling and tiling. We propose CoDi, the first latent diffusion-based low-shot counter that produces high-quality density maps on which object locations can be determined by non-maxima suppression. Our core contribution is the new exemplar-based conditioning module that extracts and adjusts the object prototypes to the intermediate layers of the denoising network, leading to accurate object location estimation.

Existing DIR methods are primarily based on image queries that retrieve documents within the same coarse semantic category, e.g., newspapers or receipts. However, these methods struggle to effectively retrieve document images in real-world scenarios where textual queries with fine-grained semantics are usually provided. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new Natural Language-based Document Image Retrieval (NL-DIR) benchmark with corresponding evaluation metrics. In this work, natural language descriptions serve as semantically rich queries for the DIR task. The NL-DIR dataset contains 41K authentic document images, each paired with five high-quality, fine-grained semantic queries generated and evaluated through large language models in conjunction with manual verification. We perform zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations of existing mainstream contrastive vision-language models and OCR-free visual document understanding (VDU) models.

However, they encounter difficulties in achieving both high-realism and high-fidelity at low bitrate, as the pixel-space distortion may not align with human perception. To address this issue, we introduce a Generative Latent Coding (GLC) architecture, which performs transform coding in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), instead of in the pixel space. The generative latent space is characterized by greater sparsity, richer semantic and better alignment with human perception, rendering it advantageous for achieving high-realism and high-fidelity compression. Additionally, we introduce a categorical hyper module to reduce the bit cost of hyper-information, and a code-prediction-based supervision to enhance the semantic consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our GLC maintains high visual quality with less than 0.04 bpp on natural images and less than 0.01 bpp on facial images. On the CLIC2020 test set, we achieve the same FID as MS-ILLM with 45% fewer bits.

The degradations present nonlinear coupling rather than simple superposition, which renders the effective processing of such coupled degradations particularly challenging. Most existing methods focus on designing specific branches, modules, or strategies for specific degradations, with little attention paid to the potential information embedded in their coupling. Consequently, they struggle to effectively capture and process the nonlinear interactions of multiple degradations from a bottom-up perspective. To address this issue, we propose JDPNet, a joint degradation processing network, that mines and unifies the potential information inherent in coupled degradations within a unified framework. Specifically, we introduce a joint feature-mining module, along with a probabilistic bootstrap distribution strategy, to facilitate effective mining and unified adjustment of coupled degradation features. Furthermore, to balance color, clarity, and contrast, we design a novel AquaBalanceLoss to guide the network in learning from multiple coupled degradation losses.

Current multi-modal 3D object detectors often rely on complex architectures and training strategies to achieve higher detection accuracy. However, these methods heavily rely on the LiDAR sensor so that they suffer from large performance drops when LiDAR is absent, which compromises the robustness and safety of autonomous systems in practical scenarios. Moreover, existing multi-modal detectors face difficulties in deployment on diverse hardware platforms, such as NPUs and FPGAs, due to their reliance on 3D sparse convolution operators, which are primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. To address these challenges, we reconsider the role of LiDAR in the camera-LiDAR fusion paradigm and introduce a novel multi-modal 3D detector, LiteFusion. Instead of treating LiDAR point clouds as an independent modality with a separate feature extraction backbone, LiteFusion utilizes LiDAR data as a complementary source of geometric information to enhance camera-based detection. This straightforward approach completely eliminates the reliance on a 3D backbone, making the method highly deployment-friendly. Specifically, LiteFusion integrates complementary features from LiDAR points into image features within a quaternion space, where the orthogonal constraints are well-preserved during network training. This helps model domain-specific relations across modalities, yielding a compact cross-modal embedding.

However, existing large-scale datasets like PubLayNet and DocBank lack fine-grained region labels and multilingual diversity, making them insufficient for representing complex document layouts. In contrast, human-annotated datasets such as M6Doc and D4LA offer richer labels and greater domain diversity, but are too small to train robust models and lack adequate multilingual coverage. This gap is especially pronounced for Indic documents, which encompass diverse scripts yet remain underrepresented in current datasets, further limiting progress in this space. To address these shortcomings, we introduce IndicDLP, a large-scale foundational document layout dataset spanning 11 representative Indic languages alongside English and 12 common document domains. Additionally, we curate UED-mini, a dataset derived from DocLayNet and M6Doc, to enhance pretraining and provide a solid foundation for Indic layout models. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning existing English models on IndicDLP significantly boosts performance, validating its effectiveness.

However, existing methods often depend on explicit degradation priors (e.g., degradation labels) as prompts to guide restoration, which are difficult to obtain due to complex and mixed degradations in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-Aware Metric Prompting (DAMP) framework. Instead of relying on predefined degradation priors, we design spatial-spectral degradation metrics to continuously quantify multi-dimensional degradations, serving as Degradation Prompts (DP). These DP enable the model to capture cross-task similarities in degradation distributions and enhance shared feature learning. Furthermore, we introduce a Spatial-Spectral Adaptive Module (SSAM) that dynamically modulates spatial and spectral feature extraction through learnable parameters. By integrating SSAM as experts within a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, and using DP as the gating router, the framework enables adaptive, efficient, and robust restoration under diverse, mixed, or unseen degradations. Extensive experiments on natural and remote sensing HSI datasets show that DAMP achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates exceptional generalization capability.

However, it has long faced the challenges of high inter-class similarity and large intra-class variability. Existing approaches often struggle to effectively inject abstract yet strongly discriminative semantic knowledge into pixel-level feature learning, leading to blurred boundaries and class confusion in complex scenes. To address these challenges, we propose Bidirectional Co-Refinement Framework for HRSS (BiCoR-Seg). Specifically, we design a Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy Module (HBIS), which establishes a bidirectional information flow between feature maps and class embeddings by generating class-level heatmaps. Based on HBIS, we further introduce a hierarchical supervision strategy, where the interpretable heatmaps generated by each HBIS module are directly utilized as low-resolution segmentation predictions for supervision, thereby enhancing the discriminative capacity of shallow features. In addition, to further improve the discriminability of the embedding representations, we propose a cross-layer class embedding Fisher Discriminative Loss to enforce intra-class compactness and enlarge inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA, Vaihingen, and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that BiCoR-Seg achieves outstanding segmentation performance while offering stronger interpretability.

Recently, such techniques have been increasingly employed to distort narratives of important events and to spread misinformation on social media, prompting the development of misinformation detectors. In the context of misinformation conveyed through image-text pairs, several detection methods have been proposed. However, these approaches typically rely on computationally intensive architectures or require large amounts of annotated data. In this work we introduce LADLE-MM: Limited Annotation based Detector with Learned Ensembles for Multimodal Misinformation, a model-soup initialized multimodal misinformation detector designed to operate under a limited annotation setup and constrained training resources. LADLE-MM is composed of two unimodal branches and a third multimodal one that enhances image and text representations with additional multimodal embeddings extracted from BLIP, serving as fixed reference space. Despite using 60.3% fewer trainable parameters than previous state-of-the-art models, LADLE-MM achieves competitive performance on both binary and multi-label classification tasks on the DGM4 benchmark, outperforming existing methods when trained without grounding annotations.

Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias.

They also incur high computational costs due to additional interaction modules introduced into DiTs, while the limited scale and quality of existing public datasets also restrict model generalization and effective training. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, KeyTailor, along with a large-scale, high-definition dataset, ViT-HD. The core idea of KeyTailor is a keyframe-driven details injection strategy, motivated by the fact that keyframes inherently contain both foreground dynamics and background consistency. Specifically, KeyTailor adopts an instruction-guided keyframe sampling strategy to filter informative frames from the input video. Subsequently,two tailored keyframe-driven modules, the garment details enhancement module and the collaborative background optimization module, are employed to distill garment dynamics into garment-related latents and to optimize the integrity of background latents, both guided by keyframes.These enriched details are then injected into standard DiT blocks together with pose, mask, and noise latents, enabling efficient and realistic try-on video synthesis.

However, existing approaches often rely on implicit, holistic critiques or unconstrained prompt rewrites, making their behavior difficult to interpret, control, or stop reliably. In contrast, large language models have benefited from explicit, structured forms of **thinking** based on verification, targeted correction, and early stopping.\n  We introduce CRAFT (Continuous Reasoning and Agentic Feedback Tuning), a training-free, model-agnostic framework that brings this structured reasoning paradigm to multimodal image generation. CRAFT decomposes a prompt into dependency-structured visual questions, veries generated images using a vision-language model, and applies targeted prompt edits through an LLM agent only where constraints fail. The process iterates with an explicit stopping criterion once all constraints are satised, yielding an interpretable and controllable inference-time renement loop.\n  Across multiple model families and challenging benchmarks, CRAFT consistently improves compositional accuracy, text rendering, and preference-based evaluations, with particularly strong gains for lightweight generators. Importantly, these improvements incur only a negligible inference-time overhead, allowing smaller or cheaper models to approach the quality of substantially more expensive systems. Our results suggest that explicitly structured, constraint-driven inference-time reasoning is a key ingredient for improving the reliability of multimodal generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "CRAFT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u53cd\u9988\u4f18\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8f7b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9690\u5f0f\u6216\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u884c\u4e3a\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u6216\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "CRAFT\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u5931\u8d25\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "result": "CRAFT\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u7ec4\u5408\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6587\u672c\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u504f\u597d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "CRAFT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Inspired by 3D Gaussian Splatting, recent 2D Gaussian image models improve representation efficiency, yet existing methods struggle to balance compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. To address this issue, we propose SmartSplat, a highly adaptive and feature-aware GS-based image compression framework that supports arbitrary image resolutions and compression ratios. SmartSplat leverages image-aware features such as gradients and color variances, introducing a Gradient-Color Guided Variational Sampling strategy together with an Exclusion-based Uniform Sampling scheme to improve the non-overlapping coverage of Gaussian primitives in pixel space. In addition, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Color Sampling method to enhance color initialization across scales. Through joint optimization of spatial layout, scale, and color initialization, SmartSplat efficiently captures both local structures and global textures using a limited number of Gaussians, achieving high reconstruction quality under strong compression. Extensive experiments on DIV8K and a newly constructed 16K dataset demonstrate that SmartSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods at comparable compression ratios and exceeds their compression limits, showing strong scalability and practical applicability.

We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives.

However, when applied to textured defect images, conventional anomaly detection methods have limitations including non-negligible misidentification, low robustness, and excessive reliance on large-scale and structured datasets. This paper proposes a texture basis integrated smooth decomposition (TBSD) approach, which is targeted at efficient anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds and sparse anomalies. Mathematical formulation of quasi-periodicity and its theoretical properties are investigated for image texture estimation. TBSD method consists of two principal processes: the first process learns the texture basis functions to effectively extract quasi-periodic texture patterns; the subsequent anomaly detection process utilizes that texture basis as prior knowledge to prevent texture misidentification and capture potential anomalies with high accuracy.The proposed method surpasses benchmarks with less misidentification, smaller training dataset requirement, and superior anomaly detection performance on both simulation and real-world datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTBSD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7eb9\u7406\u57fa\u96c6\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u7eb9\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bef\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u7eb9\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8bef\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u53ef\u5ffd\u89c6\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4f4e\u53ca\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7b49\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "TBSD\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u5b66\u4e60\u7eb9\u7406\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u7eb9\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u7eb9\u7406\u57fa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u7eb9\u7406\u8bef\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6355\u6349\u6f5c\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "result": "TBSD\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bef\u8bc6\u522b\u51cf\u5c11\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9700\u6c42\u964d\u4f4e\u53ca\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684TBSD\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7eb9\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8bef\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods overlook physical cues such as joint actuation forces that are fundamental in biomechanics. This gap motivates our study: if and when do physically inferred forces enhance motion understanding? By incorporating forces into established motion understanding pipelines, we systematically evaluate their impact across baseline models on 3 major tasks: gait recognition, action recognition, and fine-grained video captioning. Across 8 benchmarks, incorporating forces yields consistent performance gains; for example, on CASIA-B, Rank-1 gait recognition accuracy improved from 89.52% to 90.39% (+0.87), with larger gain observed under challenging conditions: +2.7% when wearing a coat and +3.0% at the side view. On Gait3D, performance also increases from 46.0% to 47.3% (+1.3). In action recognition, CTR-GCN achieved +2.00% on Penn Action, while high-exertion classes like punching/slapping improved by +6.96%.

While diffusion-based text-to-image models have demonstrated strong capabilities in visual content generation, their text rendering performance, particularly for small-scale typography and non-Latin scripts, remains limited. In this paper, we propose UTDesign, a unified framework for high-precision stylized text editing and conditional text generation in design images, supporting both English and Chinese scripts. Our framework introduces a novel DiT-based text style transfer model trained from scratch on a synthetic dataset, capable of generating transparent RGBA text foregrounds that preserve the style of reference glyphs. We further extend this model into a conditional text generation framework by training a multi-modal condition encoder on a curated dataset with detailed text annotations, enabling accurate, style-consistent text synthesis conditioned on background images, prompts, and layout specifications. Finally, we integrate our approach into a fully automated text-to-design (T2D) pipeline by incorporating pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models and an MLLM-based layout planner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UTDesign achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods in terms of stylistic consistency and text accuracy, and also exhibits unique advantages compared to proprietary commercial approaches.

This research evaluates adaptive Red-Green-Blue (RGB) and Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) fusion for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)-based detection of surface-laid landmines, leveraging the thermal contrast between the ordnance and the surrounding soil to enhance feature extraction. Using You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures (v8, v10, v11) across 114 test images, generating 35,640 model-condition evaluations, YOLOv11 achieved optimal performance (86.8% mAP), with 10 to 30% thermal fusion at 5 to 10m altitude identified as the optimal detection parameters. A complementary architectural comparison revealed that while RF-DETR achieved the highest accuracy (69.2% mAP), followed by Faster R-CNN (67.6%), YOLOv11 (64.2%), and RetinaNet (50.2%), YOLOv11 trained 17.7 times faster than the transformer-based RF-DETR (41 minutes versus 12 hours), presenting a critical accuracy-efficiency tradeoff for operational deployment. Aggregated multi-temporal training datasets outperformed season-specific approaches by 1.8 to 9.6%, suggesting that models benefit from exposure to diverse thermal conditions. Anti-Tank (AT) mines achieved 61.9% detection accuracy, compared with 19.2% for Anti-Personnel (AP) mines, reflecting both the size differential and thermal-mass differences between these ordnance classes.

We propose a method fusing video frames and object detection representations, improving recognition robustness and accuracy.\n  Chapter 7 investigates multimodal knowledge transference for egocentric action recognition. We demonstrate how multimodal knowledge distillation enables RGB-only models to mimic multimodal fusion-based capabilities, reducing computational requirements while maintaining performance.\n  These contributions advance methodologies for spatial language understanding, medical text interpretation, knowledge graph enrichment, and action recognition, enhancing computational systems' ability to process complex, multimodal inputs across diverse applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4e94\u7ae0\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u522b\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3001\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u672c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u94fe\u63a5\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u878d\u5408\u53ca\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5668\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u7b2c\u4e09\u7ae0\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86Spatial-Reasoning Bert\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e3a2D\u6392\u5217\uff1b\u7b2c\u56db\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u672c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e3a\u89e3\u5256\u56fe\u8c31\u4e2d\u7279\u5b9a3D\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e94\u7ae0\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e2d\u89c4\u8303\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b\u7b2c\u516d\u7ae0\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e03\u7ae0\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u7801\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bed\u8a00\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u672c\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u53d6\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d21\u732e\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u672c\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e30\u5bcc\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u5904\u7406\u8de8\u591a\u6837\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing approaches often struggle with motion fidelity and spatiotemporal coherence in challenging settings involving fast motion, multi-object interaction, occlusion, and rapid scene changes. SirenPose incorporates physics inspired constraints to enforce coherent keypoint predictions across both spatial and temporal dimensions, while leveraging high frequency signal modeling to capture fine grained geometric details. We further expand the UniKPT dataset to 600,000 annotated instances and integrate graph neural networks to model keypoint relationships and structural correlations. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including Sintel, Bonn, and DAVIS demonstrate that SirenPose consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. On DAVIS, SirenPose achieves a 17.8 percent reduction in FVD, a 28.7 percent reduction in FID, and a 6.0 percent improvement in LPIPS compared to MoSCA. It also improves temporal consistency, geometric accuracy, user score, and motion smoothness.

Multi-view pose estimation methods have the potential to solve these issues, but existing works rely on precise single-view pose estimates or lack generalization to unseen objects.

First, we introduce AlignPose, a 6D object pose estimation method that aggregates information from multiple extrinsically calibrated RGB views and does not require any object-specific training or symmetry annotation. Second, the key component of this approach is a new multi-view feature-metric refinement specifically designed for object pose. It optimizes a single, consistent world-frame object pose minimizing the feature discrepancy between on-the-fly rendered object features and observed image features across all views simultaneously.

A core challenge lies in effectively handling disparities in dynamic range and focus depth between the inputs. With the advent of vision-language models, recent methods incorporate textual descriptions as auxiliary guidance to enhance fusion quality. However, simply incorporating coarse-grained descriptions hampers the understanding of fine-grained details and poses challenges for precise cross-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-grained Text-guided Image Fusion (MTIF), a novel fusion paradigm with three key designs. First, it introduces multi-grained textual descriptions that separately capture fine details, structural cues, and semantic content, guiding image fusion through a hierarchical cross-modal modulation module. Second, it involves supervision signals at each granularity to facilitate alignment between visual and textual features and enhance the utility of auxiliary text.

First, we propose an automated pipeline that generates multiple-choice question-answer pairs from in-the-wild videos for DSR. By leveraging modern vision foundation models, the pipeline extracts rich geometric and motion information, including camera poses, local point clouds, object masks, orientations, and 3D trajectories. These geometric cues enable the construction of DSR-Train for learning and further human-refined DSR-Bench for evaluation. Compared with previous works, our data emphasize (i) in-the-wild video sources, (ii) object- and scene-level 3D requirements, (iii) viewpoint transformations, (iv) multi-object interactions, and (v) fine-grained, procedural answers. Beyond data, we propose a lightweight Geometry Selection Module (GSM) to seamlessly integrate geometric priors into VLMs, which condenses question semantics and extracts question-relevant knowledge from pretrained 4D reconstruction priors into a compact set of geometry tokens. This targeted extraction avoids overwhelming the model with irrelevant knowledge.

Existing token reduction methods often ignore the textual query or rely on deep attention maps, whose instability under aggressive pruning leads to degraded semantic alignment.\n  We propose FlashVLM, a text guided visual token selection framework that dynamically adapts visual inputs to the query. Instead of relying on noisy attention weights, FlashVLM computes an explicit cross modal similarity between projected image tokens and normalized text embeddings in the language model space. This extrinsic relevance is fused with intrinsic visual saliency using log domain weighting and temperature controlled sharpening. In addition, a diversity preserving partition retains a minimal yet representative set of background tokens to maintain global context.\n  Under identical token budgets and evaluation protocols, FlashVLM achieves beyond lossless compression, slightly surpassing the unpruned baseline while pruning up to 77.8 percent of visual tokens on LLaVA 1.5, and maintaining 92.8 percent accuracy even under 94.4 percent compression.

Inspired by FedPIDAvg, we define a round-wise task for FedPOD to enhance training efficiency. FedPIDAvg achieved performance improvement by incorporating the training loss reduction for prediction entropy as weights using differential terms. Furthermore, by modeling data distribution with a Poisson distribution and using a PID controller, it reduced communication costs even in skewed data distribution. However, excluding participants classified as outliers based on the Poisson distribution can limit data utilization. Additionally, PID controller requires the same participants to be maintained throughout the federated learning process as it uses previous rounds' learning information in the current round. In our approach, FedPOD addresses these issues by including participants excluded as outliers, eliminating dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and applying a method for calculating validation loss at each round. In this challenge, FedPOD presents comparable performance to FedPIDAvg in metrics of Dice score, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.72 for WT, ET and TC in average, and projected convergence score, 0.74 in average. Furthermore, the concept of FedPOD draws inspiration from Kubernetes' smallest computing unit, POD, designed to be compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling. Extending round-wise tasks of FedPOD to POD units allows flexible design by applying scale-out similar to Kubernetes' auto-scaling.

Yet in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), this hierarchy remains poorly understood, as most studies focus on a narrow set of tasks. We introduce SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy that organizes spatial abilities into four levels: low-level perception (L1), mental mapping (L2), simulation (L3), and agentic competence (L4). Based on this taxonomy, we construct the first capability-centric hierarchical benchmark, thoroughly evaluating mainstream MLLMs across 27 sub-abilities. The evaluation results reveal a clear structure: L1 skills are largely orthogonal, whereas higher-level skills are strongly correlated, indicating increasing interdependency. Through targeted supervised fine-tuning, we uncover a surprising transfer dynamic-negative transfer within L1, but strong cross-level transfer from low- to high-level abilities with notable synergy. Finally, we explore how to improve the entire hierarchy. We find that naive RL that encourages extensive \"thinking\" is unreliable: it helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception. We propose a simple auto-think strategy that suppresses unnecessary deliberation, enabling RL to consistently improve performance across all levels.

While this approach can generate high-quality videos, it suffers from slow convergence and is computationally expensive when generating long videos. In this paper, we introduce SemanticGen, a novel solution to address these limitations by generating videos in the semantic space. Our main insight is that, due to the inherent redundancy in videos, the generation process should begin in a compact, high-level semantic space for global planning, followed by the addition of high-frequency details, rather than directly modeling a vast set of low-level video tokens using bi-directional attention. SemanticGen adopts a two-stage generation process. In the first stage, a diffusion model generates compact semantic video features, which define the global layout of the video. In the second stage, another diffusion model generates VAE latents conditioned on these semantic features to produce the final output. We observe that generation in the semantic space leads to faster convergence compared to the VAE latent space. Our method is also effective and computationally efficient when extended to long video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemanticGen produces high-quality videos and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "SemanticGen\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728VAE\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u5efa\u6a21\u4f4e\u5c42\u7ea7\u89c6\u9891\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6536\u655b\u6162\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u89c6\u9891\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u518d\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u751f\u6210VAE\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u8f93\u51fa\u6700\u7ec8\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSemanticGen\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "SemanticGen\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}
