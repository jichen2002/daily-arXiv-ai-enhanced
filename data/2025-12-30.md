### [1] [Characterizing Motion Encoding in Video Diffusion Timesteps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22175)
*Vatsal Baherwani,Yixuan Ren,Abhinav Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现视频扩散模型中运动主要在早期时间步编码，外观在后期时间步编码，提出了时间步约束的运动转移方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解文本到视频扩散模型中运动如何在时间步中编码，以及如何将运动与外观分离。

Method: 通过注入新条件在指定时间步范围内，代理视频扩散时间步中的运动编码，并通过大规模定量研究来表征这一代理。

Result: 确定了早期运动主导和后期外观主导的机制，在时间步空间中建立了操作性的运动-外观边界。

Conclusion: 通过时间步约束的配方，简化了当前的一镜头运动定制范式，实现了强大的运动转移，无需辅助去偏模块或专门目标。

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models synthesize temporal motion and spatial appearance through iterative denoising, yet how motion is encoded across timesteps remains poorly understood. Practitioners often exploit the empirical heuristic that early timesteps mainly shape motion and layout while later ones refine appearance, but this behavior has not been systematically characterized. In this work, we proxy motion encoding in video diffusion timesteps by the trade-off between appearance editing and motion preservation induced when injecting new conditions over specified timestep ranges, and characterize this proxy through a large-scale quantitative study. This protocol allows us to factor motion from appearance by quantitatively mapping how they compete along the denoising trajectory. Across diverse architectures, we consistently identify an early, motion-dominant regime and a later, appearance-dominant regime, yielding an operational motion-appearance boundary in timestep space. Building on this characterization, we simplify current one-shot motion customization paradigm by restricting training and inference to the motion-dominant regime, achieving strong motion transfer without auxiliary debiasing modules or specialized objectives. Our analysis turns a widely used heuristic into a spatiotemporal disentanglement principle, and our timestep-constrained recipe can serve as ready integration into existing motion transfer and editing methods.

Abstract: This paper presents a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) recognition system utilizing a hybrid deep learning architecture combining 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The system processes webcam video streams to recognize word-level ASL signs, addressing communication barriers for over 70 million deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals worldwide.

Conclusion: ByteLoom通过引入RCM-cache机制和渐进式训练课程，有效解决了HOI视频生成中的多视角一致性和手部网格标注依赖问题，显著提升了生成视频的质量和几何一致性。

Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) video generation has garnered increasing attention due to its promising applications in digital humans, e-commerce, advertising, and robotics imitation learning. However, existing methods face two critical limitations: (1) a lack of effective mechanisms to inject multi-view information of the object into the model, leading to poor cross-view consistency, and (2) heavy reliance on fine-grained hand mesh annotations for modeling interaction occlusions. To address these challenges, we introduce ByteLoom, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework that generates realistic HOI videos with geometrically consistent object illustration, using simplified human conditioning and 3D object inputs. We first propose an RCM-cache mechanism that leverages Relative Coordinate Maps (RCM) as a universal representation to maintain object's geometry consistency and precisely control 6-DoF object transformations in the meantime. To compensate HOI dataset scarcity and leverage existing datasets, we further design a training curriculum that enhances model capabilities in a progressive style and relaxes the demand of hand mesh. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method faithfully preserves human identity and the object's multi-view geometry, while maintaining smooth motion and object manipulation.

This framework is supported by our meticulous data processing pipeline, which performs rigorous motion cleaning and captioning. Consequently, our model achieves the most extensive coverage, spanning over 200 motion categories across 6 major classes. We release HY-Motion 1.0 to the open-source community to foster future research and accelerate the transition of 3D human motion generation models towards commercial maturity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISTA框架通过解耦感知与推理，减少虚假相关性依赖，提升视觉问答鲁棒性，并在多个测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的端到端视觉语言模型（VLMs）在回答视觉问题时容易利用虚假相关性而非因果视觉证据，微调后更易依赖捷径。

Method: VISTA采用模块化设计，通过信息瓶颈将感知（冻结的VLM传感器）与推理（纯文本LLM）解耦，使用强化学习训练无偏见的视觉推理。

Result: VISTA在SpuriVerse上显著提升鲁棒性（Qwen-2.5-VL-7B提升16.29%，Llama-3.2-Vision-11B提升6.77%），在MMVP和SeedBench子集上保持竞争力，并能跨传感器迁移及感知失败恢复。

Conclusion: VISTA框架通过分离感知与推理，显著提升了视觉语言模型在真实世界中的鲁棒性，减少了对虚假相关性的依赖，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: End-to-end Vision-language Models (VLMs) often answer visual questions by exploiting spurious correlations instead of causal visual evidence, and can become more shortcut-prone when fine-tuned. We introduce VISTA (Visual-Information Separation for Text-based Analysis), a modular framework that decouples perception from reasoning via an explicit information bottleneck. A frozen VLM sensor is restricted to short, objective perception queries, while a text-only LLM reasoner decomposes each question, plans queries, and aggregates visual facts in natural language. This controlled interface defines a reward-aligned environment for training unbiased visual reasoning with reinforcement learning. Instantiated with Qwen2.5-VL and Llama3.2-Vision sensors, and trained with GRPO from only 641 curated multi-step questions, VISTA significantly improves robustness to real-world spurious correlations on SpuriVerse (+16.29% with Qwen-2.5-VL-7B and +6.77% with Llama-3.2-Vision-11B), while remaining competitive on MMVP and a balanced SeedBench subset. VISTA transfers robustly across unseen VLM sensors and is able to recognize and recover from VLM perception failures. Human analysis further shows that VISTA's reasoning traces are more neutral, less reliant on spurious attributes, and more explicitly grounded in visual evidence than end-to-end VLM baselines.

### [7] [SAMM2D: Scale-Aware Multi-Modal 2D Dual-Encoder for High-Sensitivity Intracrania Aneurysm Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22185)
*Antara Titikhsha,Divyanshu Tak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMM2D框架通过强预训练而非数据增强，显著提升动脉瘤检测性能，挑战了'更多增强总是更好'的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动脉瘤检测对预防致命性出血至关重要，但由于动脉瘤形态细微、类别不平衡及标注数据稀缺，检测仍具挑战性。

Method: 引入SAMM2D双编码器框架，并在六种增强方案中进行全面消融实验。

Result: SAMM2D在RSNA颅内动脉瘤数据集上AUC达0.686，比临床基线提升32%。未增强基线模型优于所有增强变体1.75-2.23个百分点。校准决策阈值后，敏感性达95%，超过放射科医生平均水平。

Conclusion: 未来医学影像工作流程可能更多受益于强大的预训练，而非日益复杂的增强流程。

Abstract: Effective aneurysm detection is essential to avert life-threatening hemorrhages, but it remains challenging due to the subtle morphology of the aneurysm, pronounced class imbalance, and the scarcity of annotated data. We introduce SAMM2D, a dual-encoder framework that achieves an AUC of 0.686 on the RSNA intracranial aneurysm dataset; an improvement of 32% over the clinical baseline. In a comprehensive ablation across six augmentation regimes, we made a striking discovery: any form of data augmentation degraded performance when coupled with a strong pretrained backbone. Our unaugmented baseline model outperformed all augmented variants by 1.75--2.23 percentage points (p < 0.01), overturning the assumption that "more augmentation is always better" in low-data medical settings. We hypothesize that ImageNet-pretrained features already capture robust invariances, rendering additional augmentations both redundant and disruptive to the learned feature manifold. By calibrating the decision threshold, SAMM2D reaches 95% sensitivity, surpassing average radiologist performance, and translates to a projected \$13.9M in savings per 1,000 patients in screening applications. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm that 85% of true positives attend to relevant vascular regions (62% IoU with expert annotations), demonstrating the model's clinically meaningful focus. Our results suggest that future medical imaging workflows could benefit more from strong pretraining than from increasingly complex augmentation pipelines.

Result: 在四个公共病理数据集上的实验表明，HookMIL在性能和计算效率上均达到最先进水平，并提升了可解释性。

Conclusion: HookMIL通过引入可学习的hook tokens和多模态初始化，显著提升了MIL框架的上下文感知能力和计算效率，并在多个病理数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has enabled weakly supervised analysis of whole-slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology. However, traditional MIL approaches often lose crucial contextual information, while transformer-based variants, though more expressive, suffer from quadratic complexity and redundant computations. To address these limitations, we propose HookMIL, a context-aware and computationally efficient MIL framework that leverages compact, learnable hook tokens for structured contextual aggregation. These tokens can be initialized from (i) key-patch visual features, (ii) text embeddings from vision-language pathology models, and (iii) spatially grounded features from spatial transcriptomics-vision models. This multimodal initialization enables Hook Tokens to incorporate rich textual and spatial priors, accelerating convergence and enhancing representation quality. During training, Hook tokens interact with instances through bidirectional attention with linear complexity. To further promote specialization, we introduce a Hook Diversity Loss that encourages each token to focus on distinct histopathological patterns. Additionally, a hook-to-hook communication mechanism refines contextual interactions while minimizing redundancy. Extensive experiments on four public pathology datasets demonstrate that HookMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improved computational efficiency and interpretability.

TL;DR: Tiny-YOLOSAM结合YOLO检测器和稀疏点提示，显著提升分割效率和覆盖率，替代密集提示方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决TinySAM在‘segment-everything’模式下计算成本高、速度慢的问题。

Method: 提出Tiny-YOLOSAM，一种快速混合管道，使用YOLOv12检测器为TinySAM生成框提示，并在未覆盖区域补充稀疏点提示。

Result: 在COCO val2017上，混合系统显著提升了类无关覆盖率（AR从16.4%提升至77.1%，mIoU从19.2%提升至67.8%），并将端到端运行时间从49.20秒/图像减少至10.39秒/图像（4.7倍加速）。

Conclusion: Tiny-YOLOSAM通过结合YOLO检测器和稀疏点提示，显著提升了分割覆盖率和效率，为实际全场景分割提供了一种有效替代密集提示的方法。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) enables promptable, high-quality segmentation but is often too computationally expensive for latency-critical settings. TinySAM is a lightweight, distilled SAM variant that preserves strong zero-shot mask quality, yet its "segment-everything" mode still requires hundreds of prompts and remains slow in practice. We first replicate TinySAM on COCO val2017 using official checkpoints, matching the reported AP within 0.03%, establishing a reliable experimental baseline. Building on this, we propose Tiny-YOLOSAM, a fast hybrid pipeline that uses a recent YOLO detector (YOLOv12) to generate box prompts for TinySAM on salient foreground objects, and supplements uncovered regions with sparse point prompts sampled only where YOLO-guided masks provide no coverage. On COCO val2017, the hybrid system substantially improves class-agnostic coverage (AR from 16.4% to 77.1%, mIoU from 19.2% to 67.8%) while reducing end-to-end runtime from 49.20s/image to 10.39s/image (4.7x) on an Apple M1 Pro CPU. These results suggest detector-guided prompting combined with targeted sparse sampling as an effective alternative to dense "segment-everything" prompting for practical full-scene segmentation.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, requiring early detection to preserve sight. Limited access to physicians often leaves DR undiagnosed. To address this, AI models utilize lesion segmentation for interpretability; however, manually annotating lesions is impractical for clinicians. Physicians require a model that explains the reasoning for classifications rather than just highlighting lesion locations. Furthermore, current models are one-dimensional, relying on a single imaging modality for explainability and achieving limited effectiveness. In contrast, a quantitative-detection system that identifies individual DR lesions in natural language would overcome these limitations, enabling diverse applications in screening, treatment, and research settings. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel multimodal explainability model utilizing a VLM with few-shot learning, which mimics an ophthalmologist's reasoning by analyzing lesion distributions within retinal quadrants for fundus images. The model generates paired Grad-CAM heatmaps, showcasing individual neuron weights across both OCT and fundus images, which visually highlight the regions contributing to DR severity classification. Using a dataset of 3,000 fundus images and 1,000 OCT images, this innovative methodology addresses key limitations in current DR diagnostics, offering a practical and comprehensive tool for improving patient outcomes.

Conclusion: TCFormer 是一个参数仅500万的超轻量级、弱监督的基于Transformer的人群计数框架，在多个基准测试中展现了优异的参数效率与计数准确性平衡，适合边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Crowd counting typically relies on labor-intensive point-level annotations and computationally intensive backbones, restricting its scalability and deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the TCFormer, a tiny, ultra-lightweight, weakly-supervised transformer-based crowd counting framework with only 5 million parameters that achieves competitive performance. Firstly, a powerful yet efficient vision transformer is adopted as the feature extractor, the global context-aware capabilities of which provides semantic meaningful crowd features with a minimal memory footprint. Secondly, to compensate for the lack of spatial supervision, we design a feature aggregation mechanism termed the Learnable Density-Weighted Averaging module. This module dynamically re-weights local tokens according to predicted density scores, enabling the network to adaptively modulate regional features based on their specific density characteristics without the need for additional annotations. Furthermore, this paper introduces a density-level classification loss, which discretizes crowd density into distinct grades, thereby regularizing the training process and enhancing the model's classification power across varying levels of crowd density. Therefore, although TCformer is trained under a weakly-supervised paradigm utilizing only image-level global counts, the joint optimization of count and density-level losses enables the framework to achieve high estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks including ShanghaiTech A/B, UCF-QNRF, and NWPU datasets demonstrate that our approach strikes a superior trade-off between parameter efficiency and counting accuracy and can be a good solution for crowd counting tasks in edge devices.

Abstract: Malaria remains a prevalent health concern in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. The cause of malaria is the Plasmodium parasite, which is transmitted through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as microscopic blood smear analysis, are low in sensitivity, depend on expert judgment, and require resources that may not be available in remote settings. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a deep learning-based approach utilizing a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically classify blood cell images as parasitized or uninfected. The model achieves an accuracy of 96%, with precision and recall scores exceeding 0.95 for both classes. This study also compares the custom CNN with established deep learning architectures, including ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet121. To enhance model interpretability, Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP, LIME, and Saliency Maps are applied. The proposed system shows how deep learning can provide quick, accurate and understandable malaria diagnosis, especially in areas with limited resources.

Conclusion: Signal-SGN++ 通过结合结构自适应与时间-频率脉冲动态，实现了在动作识别中的高能效与高准确性，显著优于现有SNN方法，并在能耗大幅降低的情况下与最先进的GCN竞争。

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) demonstrate strong capability in modeling skeletal topology for action recognition, yet their dense floating-point computations incur high energy costs. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), characterized by event-driven and sparse activation, offer energy efficiency but remain limited in capturing coupled temporal-frequency and topological dependencies of human motion. To bridge this gap, this article proposes Signal-SGN++, a topology-aware spiking graph framework that integrates structural adaptivity with time-frequency spiking dynamics. The network employs a backbone composed of 1D Spiking Graph Convolution (1D-SGC) and Frequency Spiking Convolution (FSC) for joint spatiotemporal and spectral feature extraction. Within this backbone, a Topology-Shift Self-Attention (TSSA) mechanism is embedded to adaptively route attention across learned skeletal topologies, enhancing graph-level sensitivity without increasing computational complexity. Moreover, an auxiliary Multi-Scale Wavelet Transform Fusion (MWTF) branch decomposes spiking features into multi-resolution temporal-frequency representations, wherein a Topology-Aware Time-Frequency Fusion (TATF) unit incorporates structural priors to preserve topology-consistent spectral fusion. Comprehensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks validate that Signal-SGN++ achieves superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, outperforming existing SNN-based methods and achieving competitive results against state-of-the-art GCNs under substantially reduced energy consumption.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) involves predicting fine-grained attributes such as clothing color, gender, and accessories from pedestrian imagery, yet is hindered by severe class imbalance, intricate attribute co-dependencies, and domain shifts. We introduce VLM-PAR, a modular vision-language framework built on frozen SigLIP 2 multilingual encoders. By first aligning image and prompt embeddings via refining visual features through a compact cross-attention fusion, VLM-PAR achieves significant accuracy improvement on the highly imbalanced PA100K benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art performance, while also delivering significant gains in mean accuracy across PETA and Market-1501 benchmarks. These results underscore the efficacy of integrating large-scale vision-language pretraining with targeted cross-modal refinement to overcome imbalance and generalization challenges in PAR.

TL;DR: ViSignVQA是首个越南语标牌VQA数据集，整合OCR和语言模型提升性能，多智能体框架达75.98%准确率，凸显领域资源对低资源语言VQA的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然场景中标牌文本的理解对VQA的实际应用至关重要，但尤其在低资源语言中研究不足。越南语标牌的多样性（如双语文本、非正式用语及视觉元素）需要专门的资源支持。

Method: 通过整合越南语OCR模型（SwinTextSpotter）和预训练语言模型（ViT5），对现有VQA模型（如BLIP-2、LaTr、PreSTU、SaL）进行适配，并提出了结合感知与推理代理的多智能体VQA框架（使用GPT-4）。

Result: 实验表明OCR增强的上下文显著提升性能（F1分数最高提升209%），多智能体框架通过多数投票达到75.98%准确率。

Conclusion: ViSignVQA作为首个针对越南语标牌的大规模多模态数据集，强调了领域特定资源在提升低资源语言文本VQA中的重要性，并为OCR集成的VQA模型提供了开发和评估基准。

Abstract: Understanding signboard text in natural scenes is essential for real-world applications of Visual Question Answering (VQA), yet remains underexplored, particularly in low-resource languages. We introduce ViSignVQA, the first large-scale Vietnamese dataset designed for signboard-oriented VQA, which comprises 10,762 images and 25,573 question-answer pairs. The dataset captures the diverse linguistic, cultural, and visual characteristics of Vietnamese signboards, including bilingual text, informal phrasing, and visual elements such as color and layout. To benchmark this task, we adapted state-of-the-art VQA models (e.g., BLIP-2, LaTr, PreSTU, and SaL) by integrating a Vietnamese OCR model (SwinTextSpotter) and a Vietnamese pretrained language model (ViT5). The experimental results highlight the significant role of the OCR-enhanced context, with F1-score improvements of up to 209% when the OCR text is appended to questions. Additionally, we propose a multi-agent VQA framework combining perception and reasoning agents with GPT-4, achieving 75.98% accuracy via majority voting. Our study presents the first large-scale multimodal dataset for Vietnamese signboard understanding. This underscores the importance of domain-specific resources in enhancing text-based VQA for low-resource languages. ViSignVQA serves as a benchmark capturing real-world scene text characteristics and supporting the development and evaluation of OCR-integrated VQA models in Vietnamese.

TL;DR: 利用2D VLM相关性激活作为抽象表示，结合历史数据高效定位隐藏物体，提升家庭机器人搜索效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决隐藏物体（部分遮挡物体）无法被VLM直接识别的问题，提升家庭机器人搜索效率。

Method: 利用2D视觉语言模型（VLM）的相关性激活作为‘抽象物体’表示，结合历史数据优化隐藏物体的3D定位与补全。

Result: 模型能首次尝试即准确识别隐藏物体的完整3D位置，显著快于随机搜索。

Conclusion: 通过语义抽象框架的扩展，家庭机器人能够更高效地定位隐藏物体，节省时间和精力。

Abstract: Semantic Abstraction's key observation is that 2D VLMs' relevancy activations roughly correspond to their confidence of whether and where an object is in the scene. Thus, relevancy maps are treated as "abstract object" representations. We use this framework for learning 3D localization and completion for the exclusive domain of hidden objects, defined as objects that cannot be directly identified by a VLM because they are at least partially occluded. This process of localizing hidden objects is a form of unstructured search that can be performed more efficiently using historical data of where an object is frequently placed. Our model can accurately identify the complete 3D location of a hidden object on the first try significantly faster than a naive random search. These extensions to semantic abstraction hope to provide household robots with the skills necessary to save time and effort when looking for lost objects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有静态策略在连续视频流中产生的碎片化或过度压缩输出的问题，提升长视频多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的理解能力。

Method: VideoScaffold框架包含弹性尺度事件分割（EES）和层次事件整合（HEC）两个关键组件，EES动态优化事件边界，HEC逐步聚合语义相关片段。

Result: 在离线和流媒体视频理解基准测试中，VideoScaffold实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VideoScaffold通过动态调整事件粒度和保留细粒度视觉语义，实现了流媒体视频理解的最先进性能，并能够无缝扩展现有基于图像的MLLM。

Abstract: Understanding long videos with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging due to the heavy redundancy across frames and the need for temporally coherent representations. Existing static strategies, such as sparse sampling, frame compression, and clustering, are optimized for offline settings and often produce fragmented or over-compressed outputs when applied to continuous video streams. We present VideoScaffold, a dynamic representation framework designed for streaming video understanding. It adaptively adjusts event granularity according to video duration while preserving fine-grained visual semantics. VideoScaffold introduces two key components: Elastic-Scale Event Segmentation (EES), which performs prediction-guided segmentation to dynamically refine event boundaries, and Hierarchical Event Consolidation (HEC), which progressively aggregates semantically related segments into multi-level abstractions. Working in concert, EES and HEC enable VideoScaffold to transition smoothly from fine-grained frame understanding to abstract event reasoning as the video stream unfolds. Extensive experiments across both offline and streaming video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that VideoScaffold achieves state-of-the-art performance. The framework is modular and plug-and-play, seamlessly extending existing image-based MLLMs to continuous video comprehension. The code is available at https://github.com/zheng980629/VideoScaffold.

*HaoNan Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出KAN-FPN-Stem架构，通过KAN算子改进FPN融合质量，显著提升ViT在姿态估计中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViT在密集预测任务（如姿态估计）中表现受限，主要由于前端设计过于简单，导致多尺度变化处理不佳和初始特征提取阶段的信息丢失。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的KAN增强FPN-Stem架构，保留了FPN经典的‘上采样并相加’融合流，但将其终端标准线性3x3平滑卷积替换为基于KAN的卷积层。

Result: 在COCO数据集上的大量实验表明，KAN-FPN-Stem相比轻量级ViTPose-S基线实现了高达+2.0 AP的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该论文不仅提供了一个即插即用的高性能模块，更重要的是揭示了ViT前端性能瓶颈通常不在于‘特征细化’（注意力机制），而在于‘特征融合’（融合）的质量，并通过引入KAN算子提供了解决这一瓶颈的有效路径。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViT) have demonstrated significant promise in dense prediction tasks such as pose estimation. However, their performance is frequently constrained by the overly simplistic front-end designs employed in models like ViTPose. This naive patchification mechanism struggles to effectively handle multi-scale variations and results in irreversible information loss during the initial feature extraction phase. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel KAN-enhanced FPN-Stem architecture. Through rigorous ablation studies, we first identified that the true bottleneck for performance improvement lies not in plug-and-play attention modules (e.g., CBAM), but in the post-fusion non-linear smoothing step within the FPN. Guided by this insight, our core innovation is to retain the classic "upsample-and-add" fusion stream of the FPN, but replace its terminal, standard linear 3x3 smoothing convolution with a powerful KAN-based convolutional layer. Leveraging its superior non-linear modeling capabilities, this KAN-based layer adaptively learns and rectifies the "artifacts" generated during the multi-scale fusion process. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset demonstrate that our KAN-FPN-Stem achieves a significant performance boost of up to +2.0 AP over the lightweight ViTPose-S baseline. This work not only delivers a plug-and-play, high-performance module but, more importantly, reveals that: the performance bottleneck in ViT front-end often lies not in 'feature refinement' (Attention), but in the quality of 'feature fusion' (Fusion). Furthermore, it provides an effective path to address this bottleneck through the introduction of the KAN operator.

TL;DR: MiG-DM是一种新型低剂量PET成像方法，通过整合元信息和跨域处理，显著提升图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量PET成像在减少患者辐射暴露方面至关重要，但面临噪声干扰、对比度降低和生理细节保留困难等挑战。现有方法常忽略投影域物理知识和患者特异性元信息。

Method: 提出了一种元信息引导的跨域协同扩散模型（MiG-DM），结合了投影域和图像域处理，通过元信息编码模块将临床参数转化为语义提示。

Result: 在UDPET公共数据集和不同剂量水平的临床数据集上，MiG-DM在提升PET图像质量和保留生理细节方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MiG-DM模型通过整合跨模态先验知识和患者特异性元信息，显著提升了低剂量PET成像的质量，同时保留了生理细节，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Low-dose PET imaging is crucial for reducing patient radiation exposure but faces challenges like noise interference, reduced contrast, and difficulty in preserving physiological details. Existing methods often neglect both projection-domain physics knowledge and patient-specific meta-information, which are critical for functional-semantic correlation mining. In this study, we introduce a meta-information guided cross-domain synergistic diffusion model (MiG-DM) that integrates comprehensive cross-modal priors to generate high-quality PET images. Specifically, a meta-information encoding module transforms clinical parameters into semantic prompts by considering patient characteristics, dose-related information, and semi-quantitative parameters, enabling cross-modal alignment between textual meta-information and image reconstruction. Additionally, the cross-domain architecture combines projection-domain and image-domain processing. In the projection domain, a specialized sinogram adapter captures global physical structures through convolution operations equivalent to global image-domain filtering. Experiments on the UDPET public dataset and clinical datasets with varying dose levels demonstrate that MiG-DM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing PET image quality and preserving physiological details.

Motivation: 在智能农业中，资源受限的边缘设备上部署深度学习模型面临计算效率与识别准确性之间的权衡挑战。

Method: 研究设计了一个结合倒置残差块和密集连接的自定义学生模型，并在ResNet18教师网络的指导下，采用多目标策略（包括硬标签监督、特征级蒸馏、响应级蒸馏和自蒸馏）进行训练。

Result: 在稻种品种分类任务中，学生模型达到了98.56%的准确率（教师模型为98.65%），仅需0.68 GFLOPs和约107万参数，计算成本降低约2.7倍，模型大小减少超10倍。在植物叶片病害数据集上也表现一致。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的混合知识蒸馏框架在资源受限的边缘设备上实现了轻量且高性能的卷积神经网络，显著降低了计算成本和模型大小，同时保持了高分类准确率，展示了在智能农业系统中的强大部署潜力。

Abstract: Deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained edge devices remains a major challenge in smart agriculture due to the trade-off between computational efficiency and recognition accuracy. To address this challenge, this study proposes a hybrid knowledge distillation framework for developing a lightweight yet high-performance convolutional neural network. The proposed approach designs a customized student model that combines inverted residual blocks with dense connectivity and trains it under the guidance of a ResNet18 teacher network using a multi-objective strategy that integrates hard-label supervision, feature-level distillation, response-level distillation, and self-distillation. Experiments are conducted on a rice seed variety identification dataset containing nine varieties and further extended to four plant leaf disease datasets, including rice, potato, coffee, and corn, to evaluate generalization capability. On the rice seed variety classification task, the distilled student model achieves an accuracy of 98.56%, which is only 0.09% lower than the teacher model (98.65%), while requiring only 0.68 GFLOPs and approximately 1.07 million parameters. This corresponds to a reduction of about 2.7 times in computational cost and more than 10 times in model size compared with the ResNet18 teacher model. In addition, compared with representative pretrained models, the proposed student reduces the number of parameters by more than 6 times relative to DenseNet121 and by over 80 times compared with the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, while maintaining comparable or superior classification accuracy. Consistent performance gains across multiple plant leaf disease datasets further demonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and strong deployment potential of the proposed framework for hardware-limited smart agriculture systems.

TL;DR: 提出自适应RGB-LWIR融合框架，动态选择最优检测模型，显著提升低光环境下的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB检测管道在低光环境下表现不佳，而基于热感的系统缺乏颜色和纹理信息。为克服这些限制，提出了自适应融合框架。

Method: 通过在多融合比率下融合RGB和长波红外（LWIR）视频流，并动态选择每种光照条件下的最优检测模型。训练了33个YOLO模型，基于超过22,000张标注图像，涵盖三种光照水平：无光（<10 lux）、弱光（10-1000 lux）和全光（>1000 lux）。融合通过以10%为增量，从全RGB（100/0）到全LWIR（0/100）的十一种比率混合对齐的RGB和LWIR帧来实现。

Result: 最佳全光模型（80/20 RGB-LWIR）和弱光模型（90/10融合）分别达到92.8%和92.0%的平均置信度，显著优于YOLOv5 nano和YOLOv11 nano基线。无光条件下，最佳40/60融合达到71.0%，虽无统计显著性，但仍优于基线。

Conclusion: 自适应RGB-LWIR融合框架显著提升了所有光照条件下的检测置信度和可靠性，增强了自主机器人视觉性能。

Abstract: Autonomous robotic platforms are playing a growing role across the emergency services sector, supporting missions such as search and rescue operations in disaster zones and reconnaissance. However, traditional red-green-blue (RGB) detection pipelines struggle in low-light environments, and thermal-based systems lack color and texture information. To overcome these limitations, we present an adaptive framework that fuses RGB and long-wave infrared (LWIR) video streams at multiple fusion ratios and dynamically selects the optimal detection model for each illumination condition. We trained 33 You Only Look Once (YOLO) models on over 22,000 annotated images spanning three light levels: no-light (<10 lux), dim-light (10-1000 lux), and full-light (>1000 lux). To integrate both modalities, fusion was performed by blending aligned RGB and LWIR frames at eleven ratios, from full RGB (100/0) to full LWIR (0/100) in 10% increments. Evaluation showed that the best full-light model (80/20 RGB-LWIR) and dim-light model (90/10 fusion) achieved 92.8% and 92.0% mean confidence; both significantly outperformed the YOLOv5 nano (YOLOv5n) and YOLOv11 nano (YOLOv11n) baselines. Under no-light conditions, the top 40/60 fusion reached 71.0%, exceeding baselines though not statistically significant. Adaptive RGB-LWIR fusion improved detection confidence and reliability across all illumination conditions, enhancing autonomous robotic vision performance.

Motivation: 解决文本到图像扩散模型依赖表面外观而忽略几何约束的问题，缩小人类感知与当前生成模型之间的语义鸿沟。

Method: 使用轻量级、现成的鉴别器作为外部指导信号，提出Human Perception Embedding (HPE)教师模型，通过注入梯度到潜在扩散过程中实现几何与风格的可控分离。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在三种架构（Stable Diffusion v1.5、SiT-XL/2、PixArt-Σ）中均有效，几何对齐效果提升约80%。

Conclusion: 小型教师模型可以可靠地指导大型生成系统，增强几何控制并拓宽文本到图像合成的创意范围。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate highly detailed textures, yet they often rely on surface appearance and fail to follow strict geometric constraints, particularly when those constraints conflict with the style implied by the text prompt. This reflects a broader semantic gap between human perception and current generative models. We investigate whether geometric understanding can be introduced without specialized training by using lightweight, off-the-shelf discriminators as external guidance signals. We propose a Human Perception Embedding (HPE) teacher trained on the THINGS triplet dataset, which captures human sensitivity to object shape. By injecting gradients from this teacher into the latent diffusion process, we show that geometry and style can be separated in a controllable manner. We evaluate this approach across three architectures: Stable Diffusion v1.5 with a U-Net backbone, the flow-matching model SiT-XL/2, and the diffusion transformer PixArt-Σ. Our experiments reveal that flow models tend to drift back toward their default trajectories without continuous guidance, and we demonstrate zero-shot transfer of complex three-dimensional shapes, such as an Eames chair, onto conflicting materials such as pink metal. This guided generation improves semantic alignment by about 80 percent compared to unguided baselines. Overall, our results show that small teacher models can reliably guide large generative systems, enabling stronger geometric control and broadening the creative range of text-to-image synthesis.

Abstract: We introduce GeCo, a geometry-grounded metric for jointly detecting geometric deformation and occlusion-inconsistency artifacts in static scenes. By fusing residual motion and depth priors, GeCo produces interpretable, dense consistency maps that reveal these artifacts. We use GeCo to systematically benchmark recent video generation models, uncovering common failure modes, and further employ it as a training-free guidance loss to reduce deformation artifacts during video generation.

Motivation: 评估基础模型在临床推理中的真实能力，超越现有基于医学执照考试或精选案例的局限性，捕捉真实世界患者护理所需的多模态推理。

Method: 开发了Bones and Joints（B&J）基准测试，包含1,245个来自真实骨科和运动医学患者案例的问题，评估模型在7项任务中的表现，涵盖知识回忆、文本和图像解释、诊断生成、治疗计划和理由提供。

Result: 最先进模型在结构化多选题上准确率超过90%，但在需要多模态整合的开放式任务中表现显著下降，准确率仅达60%。视觉语言模型（VLMs）在医学图像解释上存在严重限制，常出现文本驱动的幻觉。

Conclusion: 当前的人工智能模型尚不具备复杂多模态推理的临床能力，其安全部署应限于支持性、基于文本的角色。未来在核心临床任务上的进展有待于多模态整合和视觉理解的根本性突破。

Abstract: Background: The rapid integration of foundation models into clinical practice and public health necessitates a rigorous evaluation of their true clinical reasoning capabilities beyond narrow examination success. Current benchmarks, typically based on medical licensing exams or curated vignettes, fail to capture the integrated, multimodal reasoning essential for real-world patient care. Methods: We developed the Bones and Joints (B&J) Benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation framework comprising 1,245 questions derived from real-world patient cases in orthopedics and sports medicine. This benchmark assesses models across 7 tasks that mirror the clinical reasoning pathway, including knowledge recall, text and image interpretation, diagnosis generation, treatment planning, and rationale provision. We evaluated eleven vision-language models (VLMs) and six large language models (LLMs), comparing their performance against expert-derived ground truth. Results: Our results demonstrate a pronounced performance gap between task types. While state-of-the-art models achieved high accuracy, exceeding 90%, on structured multiple-choice questions, their performance markedly declined on open-ended tasks requiring multimodal integration, with accuracy scarcely reaching 60%. VLMs demonstrated substantial limitations in interpreting medical images and frequently exhibited severe text-driven hallucinations, often ignoring contradictory visual evidence. Notably, models specifically fine-tuned for medical applications showed no consistent advantage over general-purpose counterparts. Conclusions: Current artificial intelligence models are not yet clinically competent for complex, multimodal reasoning. Their safe deployment should currently be limited to supportive, text-based roles. Future advancement in core clinical tasks awaits fundamental breakthroughs in multimodal integration and visual understanding.

Motivation: 全球缺乏训练有素的超声医师，深度学习可能提升效率并支持新从业者培训，但目前缺乏评估VLMs在胎儿超声成像中性能的标准基准。

Method: 提出了Fetal-Gauge基准测试，包含42,000多张图像和93,000多个问答对，涵盖多个胎儿超声任务，并系统评估了多个最先进的VLMs。

Result: 最佳模型仅达到55%的准确率，远低于临床要求，分析揭示了当前VLMs在胎儿超声解释中的关键局限性。

Conclusion: Fetal-Gauge作为首个专门评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在胎儿超声任务中性能的基准测试，揭示了当前模型在临床需求下的显著性能差距，并强调了领域适应架构和专门训练方法的紧迫性。

Abstract: The growing demand for prenatal ultrasound imaging has intensified a global shortage of trained sonographers, creating barriers to essential fetal health monitoring. Deep learning has the potential to enhance sonographers' efficiency and support the training of new practitioners. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are particularly promising for ultrasound interpretation, as they can jointly process images and text to perform multiple clinical tasks within a single framework. However, despite the expansion of VLMs, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate their performance in fetal ultrasound imaging. This gap is primarily due to the modality's challenging nature, operator dependency, and the limited public availability of datasets. To address this gap, we present Fetal-Gauge, the first and largest visual question answering benchmark specifically designed to evaluate VLMs across various fetal ultrasound tasks. Our benchmark comprises over 42,000 images and 93,000 question-answer pairs, spanning anatomical plane identification, visual grounding of anatomical structures, fetal orientation assessment, clinical view conformity, and clinical diagnosis. We systematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLMs, including general-purpose and medical-specific models, and reveal a substantial performance gap: the best-performing model achieves only 55\% accuracy, far below clinical requirements. Our analysis identifies critical limitations of current VLMs in fetal ultrasound interpretation, highlighting the urgent need for domain-adapted architectures and specialized training approaches. Fetal-Gauge establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing multimodal deep learning in prenatal care and provides a pathway toward addressing global healthcare accessibility challenges. Our benchmark will be publicly available once the paper gets accepted.

Abstract: We introduce Uni4D, a unified framework for large scale open vocabulary 3D retrieval and controlled 4D generation based on structured three level alignment across text, 3D models, and image modalities. Built upon the Align3D 130 dataset, Uni4D employs a 3D text multi head attention and search model to optimize text to 3D retrieval through improved semantic alignment. The framework further strengthens cross modal alignment through three components: precise text to 3D retrieval, multi view 3D to image alignment, and image to text alignment for generating temporally consistent 4D assets. Experimental results demonstrate that Uni4D achieves high quality 3D retrieval and controllable 4D generation, advancing dynamic multimodal understanding and practical applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析两种现代视觉语言模型的架构属性，并解释它们如何映射到实际的视频到人工制品流水线中，以便为设计稳健接口和评估计划提供依据。

Method: 报告首先总结了共享的多模态基础（视觉标记化、Transformer注意力和指令跟随），然后详细描述了每种架构，以证明工程选择的合理性。系统通过采样视频帧、提示VLM检测可见人物并生成带有提示条件属性的像素空间边界框（默认为情感）、使用预定义模式验证输出结构，并可选地渲染带注释的视频来实现。

Result: 报告揭示了结构化输出可以语法有效但语义不正确，模式验证是结构性的（而非几何正确性），人物标识符在当前提示合同中是帧本地的，交互式单帧分析返回自由格式文本而非模式强制的JSON。这些区别对于编写可辩护的声明、设计稳健接口和规划评估至关重要。

Conclusion: 该报告通过架构分析揭示了两种现代视觉语言模型（VLM）的工程选择如何映射到实际的视频到人工制品流水线中，强调了结构化输出与语义正确性之间的差异对设计稳健接口和评估计划的重要性。

Abstract: This report provides an architecture-led analysis of two modern vision-language models (VLMs), Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct, and explains how their architectural properties map to a practical video-to-artifact pipeline implemented in the BodyLanguageDetection repository [1]. The system samples video frames, prompts a VLM to detect visible people and generate pixel-space bounding boxes with prompt-conditioned attributes (emotion by default), validates output structure using a predefined schema, and optionally renders an annotated video. We first summarize the shared multimodal foundation (visual tokenization, Transformer attention, and instruction following), then describe each architecture at a level sufficient to justify engineering choices without speculative internals. Finally, we connect model behavior to system constraints: structured outputs can be syntactically valid while semantically incorrect, schema validation is structural (not geometric correctness), person identifiers are frame-local in the current prompting contract, and interactive single-frame analysis returns free-form text rather than schema-enforced JSON.

Motivation: 现有方法在快速移动和多目标场景中难以保持运动建模的准确性和时空一致性。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的损失函数SirenPose，结合了正弦表示网络的周期性激活特性和关键点结构的几何先验，并引入了物理启发的约束机制。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用SirenPose训练的模型在时空一致性指标上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SirenPose通过结合周期性激活特性和几何先验，显著提升了动态3D场景重建的准确性，尤其在快速运动和复杂场景变化中表现优异。

Abstract: We propose SirenPose, a novel loss function that combines the periodic activation properties of sinusoidal representation networks with geometric priors derived from keypoint structures to improve the accuracy of dynamic 3D scene reconstruction. Existing approaches often struggle to maintain motion modeling accuracy and spatiotemporal consistency in fast moving and multi target scenes. By introducing physics inspired constraint mechanisms, SirenPose enforces coherent keypoint predictions across both spatial and temporal dimensions. We further expand the training dataset to 600,000 annotated instances to support robust learning. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained with SirenPose achieve significant improvements in spatiotemporal consistency metrics compared to prior methods, showing superior performance in handling rapid motion and complex scene changes.

Motivation: 在计算、功耗和成本严格限制下，低延迟识别驾驶员分心和困倦行为的需求。

Method: 结合了（i）紧凑的每帧视觉模型，（ii）减少视觉相似误报的混杂感知标签设计，以及（iii）仅在预测既自信又持续时才触发警报的时序决策头。

Result: 在Raspberry Pi 5上实现约16 FPS（每帧延迟低于60毫秒），在Coral Edge TPU上实现约25 FPS，支持实时监控和稳定警报生成。

Conclusion: 可靠的驾驶员状态感知可以作为上游输入，推动以人为中心的车辆智能发展，包括新兴的代理车辆概念。

Abstract: In-cabin Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS) must recognize distraction- and drowsiness-related behaviors with low latency under strict constraints on compute, power, and cost. We present a single-camera in-cabin driver behavior recognition system designed for deployment on two low-cost edge platforms: Raspberry Pi 5 (CPU-only) and Google Coral Edge TPU. The proposed pipeline combines (i) a compact per-frame vision model, (ii) a confounder-aware label design to reduce visually similar false positives, and (iii) a temporal decision head that triggers alerts only when predictions are both confident and sustained. The system covers 17 behavior classes, including multiple phone-use modes, eating/drinking, smoking, reaching behind, gaze/attention shifts, passenger interaction, grooming, control-panel interaction, yawning, and eyes-closed sleep. Training and evaluation use licensed datasets spanning diverse drivers, vehicles, and lighting conditions (details in Section 6), and we further validate runtime behavior in real in-vehicle tests. The optimized deployments achieve about 16 FPS on Raspberry Pi 5 with INT8 inference (per-frame latency under 60 ms) and about 25 FPS on Coral Edge TPU, enabling real-time monitoring and stable alert generation on inexpensive hardware. Finally, we discuss how reliable in-cabin human-state perception can serve as an upstream input for human-centered vehicle intelligence, including emerging agentic vehicle concepts.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种模块化、数据高效且实际可部署的攻击感知检测基线，具有校准概率和可操作的篡改热图。

Abstract: This work presents an attack-aware deepfake and image-forensics detector designed for robustness, well-calibrated probabilities, and transparent evidence under realistic deployment conditions. The method combines red-team training with randomized test-time defense in a two-stream architecture, where one stream encodes semantic content using a pretrained backbone and the other extracts forensic residuals, fused via a lightweight residual adapter for classification, while a shallow Feature Pyramid Network style head produces tamper heatmaps under weak supervision. Red-team training applies worst-of-K counter-forensics per batch, including JPEG realign and recompress, resampling warps, denoise-to-regrain operations, seam smoothing, small color and gamma shifts, and social-app transcodes, while test-time defense injects low-cost jitters such as resize and crop phase changes, mild gamma variation, and JPEG phase shifts with aggregated predictions. Heatmaps are guided to concentrate within face regions using face-box masks without strict pixel-level annotations. Evaluation on existing benchmarks, including standard deepfake datasets and a surveillance-style split with low light and heavy compression, reports clean and attacked performance, AUC, worst-case accuracy, reliability, abstention quality, and weak-localization scores. Results demonstrate near-perfect ranking across attacks, low calibration error, minimal abstention risk, and controlled degradation under regrain, establishing a modular, data-efficient, and practically deployable baseline for attack-aware detection with calibrated probabilities and actionable heatmaps.

Conclusion: PortionNet通过跨模态知识蒸馏框架，成功在仅需RGB图像的情况下实现了高精度的食物营养估计，无需深度传感器，展现了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate food nutrition estimation from single images is challenging due to the loss of 3D information. While depth-based methods provide reliable geometry, they remain inaccessible on most smartphones because of depth-sensor requirements. To overcome this challenge, we propose PortionNet, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that learns geometric features from point clouds during training while requiring only RGB images at inference. Our approach employs a dual-mode training strategy where a lightweight adapter network mimics point cloud representations, enabling pseudo-3D reasoning without any specialized hardware requirements. PortionNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on MetaFood3D, outperforming all previous methods in both volume and energy estimation. Cross-dataset evaluation on SimpleFood45 further demonstrates strong generalization in energy estimation.

Method: 提出了Scale-Aware Modulation（SMO）模块和Fourier Fusion策略，并设计了Scale-Permutation Stability Loss联合优化。

Result: MoFu在保持自然尺度、主体保真度和整体视觉质量方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MoFu框架通过Scale-Aware Modulation和Fourier Fusion策略有效解决了多主体视频生成中的尺度不一致和排列敏感性问题，显著提升了生成视频的自然度和视觉质量。

Abstract: Multi-subject video generation aims to synthesize videos from textual prompts and multiple reference images, ensuring that each subject preserves natural scale and visual fidelity. However, current methods face two challenges: scale inconsistency, where variations in subject size lead to unnatural generation, and permutation sensitivity, where the order of reference inputs causes subject distortion. In this paper, we propose MoFu, a unified framework that tackles both challenges. For scale inconsistency, we introduce Scale-Aware Modulation (SMO), an LLM-guided module that extracts implicit scale cues from the prompt and modulates features to ensure consistent subject sizes. To address permutation sensitivity, we present a simple yet effective Fourier Fusion strategy that processes the frequency information of reference features via the Fast Fourier Transform to produce a unified representation. Besides, we design a Scale-Permutation Stability Loss to jointly encourage scale-consistent and permutation-invariant generation. To further evaluate these challenges, we establish a dedicated benchmark with controlled variations in subject scale and reference permutation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoFu significantly outperforms existing methods in preserving natural scale, subject fidelity, and overall visual quality.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在长视频理解中受限于上下文窗口，依赖均匀帧采样或静态预选可能忽略关键证据且无法纠正初始选择错误。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：首先通过监督微调阶段在精选数据集上训练，随后通过强化学习进一步优化代理策略。

Result: 7B模型展现出多样且复杂的推理模式，在多个长视频理解和推理基准测试中表现优异，效率更高。

Conclusion: VideoZoomer框架通过动态控制视觉焦点和多轮交互式推理，显著提升了MLLMs在长视频理解任务中的表现，不仅在多个基准测试中超越现有开源模型，甚至在效率上也优于专有系统。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language tasks yet remain limited in long video understanding due to the limited context window. Consequently, prevailing approaches tend to rely on uniform frame sampling or static pre-selection, which might overlook critical evidence and unable to correct its initial selection error during its reasoning process. To overcome these limitations, we propose VideoZoomer, a novel agentic framework that enables MLLMs to dynamically control their visual focus during reasoning. Starting from a coarse low-frame-rate overview, VideoZoomer invokes a temporal zoom tool to obtain high-frame-rate clips at autonomously chosen moments, thereby progressively gathering fine-grained evidence in a multi-turn interactive manner. Accordingly, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase on a curated dataset of distilled exemplar and reflection trajectories, followed by reinforcement learning to further refine the agentic policy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 7B model delivers diverse and complex reasoning patterns, yielding strong performance across a broad set of long video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. These emergent capabilities allow it to consistently surpass existing open-source models and even rival proprietary systems on challenging tasks, while achieving superior efficiency under reduced frame budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在编辑时对所有token进行统一处理和去噪，导致冗余计算并可能降低未修改区域的质量，因此提出了是否需要在编辑时重新生成每个区域的问题。

Method: SpotEdit包含两个关键组件：SpotSelector通过感知相似性识别稳定区域并跳过其计算；SpotFusion通过动态融合机制自适应地混合这些特征与编辑后的token。

Result: SpotEdit通过减少冗余计算并保持未修改区域的保真度，实现了高效且精确的图像编辑。

Conclusion: SpotEdit通过选择性更新修改区域，减少了不必要的计算，同时保持了未修改区域的高保真度，实现了高效且精确的图像编辑。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models have significantly advanced image editing by encoding conditional images and integrating them into transformer layers. However, most edits involve modifying only small regions, while current methods uniformly process and denoise all tokens at every timestep, causing redundant computation and potentially degrading unchanged areas. This raises a fundamental question: Is it truly necessary to regenerate every region during editing? To address this, we propose SpotEdit, a training-free diffusion editing framework that selectively updates only the modified regions. SpotEdit comprises two key components: SpotSelector identifies stable regions via perceptual similarity and skips their computation by reusing conditional image features; SpotFusion adaptively blends these features with edited tokens through a dynamic fusion mechanism, preserving contextual coherence and editing quality. By reducing unnecessary computation and maintaining high fidelity in unmodified areas, SpotEdit achieves efficient and precise image editing.

Conclusion: DeMoGen通过能量扩散模型实现了对复杂运动的分解学习，能够发现并重新组合可重用的运动基元，展示了在训练分布之外的泛化能力。

Abstract: Human motions are compositional: complex behaviors can be described as combinations of simpler primitives. However, existing approaches primarily focus on forward modeling, e.g., learning holistic mappings from text to motion or composing a complex motion from a set of motion concepts. In this paper, we consider the inverse perspective: decomposing a holistic motion into semantically meaningful sub-components. We propose DeMoGen, a compositional training paradigm for decompositional learning that employs an energy-based diffusion model. This energy formulation directly captures the composed distribution of multiple motion concepts, enabling the model to discover them without relying on ground-truth motions for individual concepts. Within this paradigm, we introduce three training variants to encourage a decompositional understanding of motion: 1. DeMoGen-Exp explicitly trains on decomposed text prompts; 2. DeMoGen-OSS performs orthogonal self-supervised decomposition; 3. DeMoGen-SC enforces semantic consistency between original and decomposed text embeddings. These variants enable our approach to disentangle reusable motion primitives from complex motion sequences. We also demonstrate that the decomposed motion concepts can be flexibly recombined to generate diverse and novel motions, generalizing beyond the training distribution. Additionally, we construct a text-decomposed dataset to support compositional training, serving as an extended resource to facilitate text-to-motion generation and motion composition.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于变分自编码器（VAE）的多视图潜在表示学习框架，用于整合来自T1Gd和FLAIR MRI的互补放射组学特征，有效保留了模态特异性结构并实现了多模态整合，从而提高了MGMT启动子甲基化分类的准确性。

Abstract: Non-invasive inference of molecular tumor characteristics from medical imaging is a central goal of radiogenomics, particularly in glioblastoma (GBM), where O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation carries important prognostic and therapeutic significance. Although radiomics-based machine learning methods have shown promise for this task, conventional unimodal and early-fusion approaches are often limited by high feature redundancy and an incomplete modeling of modality-specific information. In this work, we introduce a multi-view latent representation learning framework based on variational autoencoders (VAE) to integrate complementary radiomic features derived from post-contrast T1-weighted (T1Gd) and Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By encoding each modality through an independent probabilistic encoder and performing fusion in a compact latent space, the proposed approach preserves modality-specific structure while enabling effective multimodal integration. The resulting latent embeddings are subsequently used for MGMT promoter methylation classification.

Abstract: The popular use of histopathology images, such as hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), has proven to be useful in detecting tumors. However, moving such cancer cases forward for treatment requires accurate on the amount of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein expression. Predicting both the lower and higher levels of HER2 can be challenging. Moreover, jointly analyzing H&E and immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained images for HER2 scoring is difficult. Although several deep learning methods have been investigated to address the challenge of HER2 scoring, they suffer from providing a pixel-level localization of HER2 status. In this study, we propose a single end-to-end pipeline using a system of vision transformers with HER2 status scoring on whole slide images of WSIs. The method includes patch-wise processing of H&E WSIs for tumor localization. A novel mapping function is proposed to correspondingly identify correlated IHC WSIs regions with malignant regions on H&E. A clinically inspired HER2 scoring mechanism is embedded in the pipeline and allows for automatic pixel-level annotation of 4-way HER2 scoring (0, 1+, 2+, and 3+). Also, the proposed method accurately returns HER2-negative and HER2-positive. Privately curated datasets were collaboratively extracted from 13 different cases of WSIs of H&E and IHC. A thorough experiment is conducted on the proposed method. Results obtained showed a good classification accuracy during tumor localization. Also, a classification accuracy of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.933 were returned for the prediction of HER2 status, scoring in the 4-way methods. The applicability of the proposed pipeline was investigated using WSIs patches as comparable to human pathologists. Findings from the study showed the usability of jointly evaluated H&E and IHC images on end-to-end ViTs-based models for HER2 scoring

Conclusion: 人类感知启发的伪着色技术能够提升医疗机器智能的数据效率、可解释性和因果推理能力。

Abstract: Machine vision models, particularly deep neural networks, are increasingly applied to physiological signal interpretation, including electrocardiography (ECG), yet they typically require large training datasets and offer limited insight into the causal features underlying their predictions. This lack of data efficiency and interpretability constrains their clinical reliability and alignment with human reasoning. Here, we show that a perception-informed pseudo-colouring technique, previously demonstrated to enhance human ECG interpretation, can improve both explainability and few-shot learning in deep neural networks analysing complex physiological data.
  We focus on acquired, drug-induced long QT syndrome (LQTS) as a challenging case study characterised by heterogeneous signal morphology, variable heart rate, and scarce positive cases associated with life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. This setting provides a stringent test of model generalisation under extreme data scarcity. By encoding clinically salient temporal features, such as QT-interval duration, into structured colour representations, models learn discriminative and interpretable features from as few as one or five training examples. Using prototypical networks and a ResNet-18 architecture, we evaluate one-shot and few-shot learning on ECG images derived from single cardiac cycles and full 10-second rhythms. Explainability analyses show that pseudo-colouring guides attention toward clinically meaningful ECG features while suppressing irrelevant signal components. Aggregating multiple cardiac cycles further improves performance, mirroring human perceptual averaging across heartbeats. Together, these findings demonstrate that human-like perceptual encoding can bridge data efficiency, explainability, and causal reasoning in medical machine intelligence.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in 2D vision-language tasks, their application to complex 3D scene manipulation remains underexplored. In this paper, we bridge this critical gap by tackling three key challenges in 3D object arrangement task using MLLMs. First, to address the weak visual grounding of MLLMs, which struggle to link programmatic edits with precise 3D outcomes, we introduce an MCP-based API. This shifts the interaction from brittle raw code manipulation to more robust, function-level updates. Second, we augment the MLLM's 3D scene understanding with a suite of specialized visual tools to analyze scene state, gather spatial information, and validate action outcomes. This perceptual feedback loop is critical for closing the gap between language-based updates and precise 3D-aware manipulation. Third, to manage the iterative, error-prone updates, we propose a collaborative multi-agent framework with designated roles for planning, execution, and verification. This decomposition allows the system to robustly handle multi-step instructions and recover from intermediate errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a diverse set of 25 complex object arrangement tasks, where it significantly outperforms existing baselines. Website: vulcan-3d.github.io

Motivation: 传统扩散或流模型依赖局部监督，通常需要大量推理步骤；而基于蒸馏的方法需要预训练的教师模型。Self-E 旨在填补这两种范式之间的差距，实现高效且可扩展的生成。

Method: Self-E 采用了一种新颖的自评估机制，通过当前评分估计对自身生成的样本进行评估，充当动态自教师，结合了流匹配模型的学习方式。

Result: 在大规模文本到图像基准测试中，Self-E 在少步生成中表现优异，并且在50步推理中与最先进的流匹配模型竞争。其性能随推理步骤增加而单调提升。

Conclusion: Self-E 是一种创新的文本到图像生成模型，通过结合即时局部学习和自驱动的全局匹配，实现了从零开始训练的高质量模型，支持任意步数的推理，并在少步和多步生成中均表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce the Self-Evaluating Model (Self-E), a novel, from-scratch training approach for text-to-image generation that supports any-step inference. Self-E learns from data similarly to a Flow Matching model, while simultaneously employing a novel self-evaluation mechanism: it evaluates its own generated samples using its current score estimates, effectively serving as a dynamic self-teacher. Unlike traditional diffusion or flow models, it does not rely solely on local supervision, which typically necessitates many inference steps. Unlike distillation-based approaches, it does not require a pretrained teacher. This combination of instantaneous local learning and self-driven global matching bridges the gap between the two paradigms, enabling the training of a high-quality text-to-image model from scratch that excels even at very low step counts. Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image benchmarks show that Self-E not only excels in few-step generation, but is also competitive with state-of-the-art Flow Matching models at 50 steps. We further find that its performance improves monotonically as inference steps increase, enabling both ultra-fast few-step generation and high-quality long-trajectory sampling within a single unified model. To our knowledge, Self-E is the first from-scratch, any-step text-to-image model, offering a unified framework for efficient and scalable generation.

Conclusion: DeFloMat通过引入条件流匹配（CFM）和确定性流场，显著提升了生成式目标检测的速度和准确性，解决了扩散模型在时间敏感临床应用中的瓶颈问题。

Abstract: We propose DeFloMat (Detection with Flow Matching), a novel generative object detection framework that addresses the critical latency bottleneck of diffusion-based detectors, such as DiffusionDet, by integrating Conditional Flow Matching (CFM). Diffusion models achieve high accuracy by formulating detection as a multi-step stochastic denoising process, but their reliance on numerous sampling steps ($T \gg 60$) makes them impractical for time-sensitive clinical applications like Crohn's Disease detection in Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE). DeFloMat replaces this slow stochastic path with a highly direct, deterministic flow field derived from Conditional Optimal Transport (OT) theory, specifically approximating the Rectified Flow. This shift enables fast inference via a simple Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver. We demonstrate the superiority of DeFloMat on a challenging MRE clinical dataset. Crucially, DeFloMat achieves state-of-the-art accuracy ($43.32\% \text{ } AP_{10:50}$) in only $3$ inference steps, which represents a $1.4\times$ performance improvement over DiffusionDet's maximum converged performance ($31.03\% \text{ } AP_{10:50}$ at $4$ steps). Furthermore, our deterministic flow significantly enhances localization characteristics, yielding superior Recall and stability in the few-step regime. DeFloMat resolves the trade-off between generative accuracy and clinical efficiency, setting a new standard for stable and rapid object localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D亮场显微镜技术在无标记情况下难以实现稳健体积分割的问题。

Method: 结合硬件对齐的Native Sparse Attention机制、深度-宽度残差HyperConnections和软混合专家系统（Mixture-of-Experts），以及各向异性补丁嵌入技术。

Result: Bright-4B在多个共聚焦数据集上表现优异，能够保留跨深度和细胞类型的精细结构细节，优于现有的CNN和Transformer基线模型。

Conclusion: Bright-4B模型通过创新的架构设计，成功实现了直接从3D亮场体积中分割亚细胞结构，无需荧光标记或复杂后处理，为大规模、无标记的3D细胞映射提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Label-free 3D brightfield microscopy offers a fast and noninvasive way to visualize cellular morphology, yet robust volumetric segmentation still typically depends on fluorescence or heavy post-processing. We address this gap by introducing Bright-4B, a 4 billion parameter foundation model that learns on the unit hypersphere to segment subcellular structures directly from 3D brightfield volumes. Bright-4B combines a hardware-aligned Native Sparse Attention mechanism (capturing local, coarse, and selected global context), depth-width residual HyperConnections that stabilize representation flow, and a soft Mixture-of-Experts for adaptive capacity. A plug-and-play anisotropic patch embed further respects confocal point-spread and axial thinning, enabling geometry-faithful 3D tokenization. The resulting model produces morphology-accurate segmentations of nuclei, mitochondria, and other organelles from brightfield stacks alone--without fluorescence, auxiliary channels, or handcrafted post-processing. Across multiple confocal datasets, Bright-4B preserves fine structural detail across depth and cell types, outperforming contemporary CNN and Transformer baselines. All code, pretrained weights, and models for downstream finetuning will be released to advance large-scale, label-free 3D cell mapping.

TL;DR: FluenceFormer是一个基于Transformer的两阶段框架，用于直接、几何感知的fluence回归，显著提升了放疗计划的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统卷积方法在捕捉长距离依赖关系上的不足，导致结构不一致或物理不可行计划的问题。

Method: FluenceFormer是一个基于Transformer的两阶段框架，第一阶段从解剖输入预测全局剂量先验，第二阶段结合显式光束几何条件回归物理校准的fluence图。采用Fluence-Aware Regression (FAR)损失函数，整合了体素级保真度、梯度平滑性、结构一致性和光束级能量守恒。

Result: FluenceFormer在多个Transformer骨干网络（如Swin UNETR、UNETR、nnFormer和MedFormer）上表现出色，其中Swin UNETR版本表现最佳，显著降低了能量误差并提升了结构保真度。

Conclusion: FluenceFormer结合Swin UNETR在性能上超越了现有的CNN和单阶段方法，显著降低了能量误差至4.5%，并在结构保真度上取得了统计学上的显著提升（p < 0.05）。

Abstract: Fluence map prediction is central to automated radiotherapy planning but remains an ill-posed inverse problem due to the complex relationship between volumetric anatomy and beam-intensity modulation. Convolutional methods in prior work often struggle to capture long-range dependencies, which can lead to structurally inconsistent or physically unrealizable plans. We introduce \textbf{FluenceFormer}, a backbone-agnostic transformer framework for direct, geometry-aware fluence regression. The model uses a unified two-stage design: Stage~1 predicts a global dose prior from anatomical inputs, and Stage~2 conditions this prior on explicit beam geometry to regress physically calibrated fluence maps. Central to the approach is the \textbf{Fluence-Aware Regression (FAR)} loss, a physics-informed objective that integrates voxel-level fidelity, gradient smoothness, structural consistency, and beam-wise energy conservation. We evaluate the generality of the framework across multiple transformer backbones, including Swin UNETR, UNETR, nnFormer, and MedFormer, using a prostate IMRT dataset. FluenceFormer with Swin UNETR achieves the strongest performance among the evaluated models and improves over existing benchmark CNN and single-stage methods, reducing Energy Error to $\mathbf{4.5\%}$ and yielding statistically significant gains in structural fidelity ($p < 0.05$).

Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在内容一致性上表现良好但缺乏情感意识，而情感驱动模型则以内容失真为代价生成情感化结果。

Method: 提出了EmoCtrl框架，结合文本和视觉情感增强模块，通过描述性语义和感知线索丰富情感表达。

Result: 定量和定性实验表明EmoCtrl在内容和情感控制上优于现有方法，用户研究证实其与人类偏好高度一致。

Conclusion: EmoCtrl成功实现了在保持内容一致性的同时控制图像情感表达，其学习到的情感标记具有互补效应，并在用户研究中显示出与人类偏好的高度一致性。

Abstract: An image conveys meaning through both its visual content and emotional tone, jointly shaping human perception. We introduce Controllable Emotional Image Content Generation (C-EICG), which aims to generate images that remain faithful to a given content description while expressing a target emotion. Existing text-to-image models ensure content consistency but lack emotional awareness, whereas emotion-driven models generate affective results at the cost of content distortion. To address this gap, we propose EmoCtrl, supported by a dataset annotated with content, emotion, and affective prompts, bridging abstract emotions to visual cues. EmoCtrl incorporates textual and visual emotion enhancement modules that enrich affective expression via descriptive semantics and perceptual cues. The learned emotion tokens exhibit complementary effects, as demonstrated through ablations and visualizations. Quantatitive and qualatitive experiments demonstrate that EmoCtrl achieves faithful content and expressive emotion control, outperforming existing methods across multiple aspects. User studies confirm EmoCtrl's strong alignment with human preference. Moreover, EmoCtrl generalizes well to creative applications, further demonstrating the robustness and adaptability of the learned emotion tokens.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR感知在自主系统中受限于固定的垂直光束分辨率，且环境遮挡导致的光束丢失进一步影响了性能。

Method: 该论文提出了一种基于图注意力的框架SuperiorGAT，通过将LiDAR扫描建模为光束感知图，并结合门控残差融合和前馈细化，实现了稀疏LiDAR点云中缺失高程信息的准确重建。

Result: 在KITTI环境中的广泛实验表明，SuperiorGAT相比基于PointNet的模型和更深的GAT基线，始终实现更低的重建误差和更好的几何一致性。

Conclusion: SuperiorGAT通过架构优化提供了一种计算高效的方法，无需额外传感器硬件即可提升LiDAR分辨率。

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception in autonomous systems is constrained by fixed vertical beam resolution and further compromised by beam dropout resulting from environmental occlusions. This paper introduces SuperiorGAT, a graph attention-based framework designed to reconstruct missing elevation information in sparse LiDAR point clouds. By modeling LiDAR scans as beam-aware graphs and incorporating gated residual fusion with feed-forward refinement, SuperiorGAT enables accurate reconstruction without increasing network depth. To evaluate performance, structured beam dropout is simulated by removing every fourth vertical scanning beam. Extensive experiments across diverse KITTI environments, including Person, Road, Campus, and City sequences, demonstrate that SuperiorGAT consistently achieves lower reconstruction error and improved geometric consistency compared to PointNet-based models and deeper GAT baselines. Qualitative X-Z projections further confirm the model's ability to preserve structural integrity with minimal vertical distortion. These results suggest that architectural refinement offers a computationally efficient method for improving LiDAR resolution without requiring additional sensor hardware.

Motivation: 解决现有姿势代码框架在捕捉细微时间动态和高频细节上的不足，提升重建保真度和局部可控性。

Method: 提出了一种混合表示方法PGR$^2$M，通过残差向量量化（RVQ）学习残差代码，并结合姿势代码。使用基础Transformer预测姿势代码，细化Transformer预测残差代码。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上，PGR$^2$M在生成和编辑任务中均优于CoMo及基于扩散和标记化的基线方法，用户研究证实其支持直观、结构保持的动作编辑。

Conclusion: PGR$^2$M通过结合可解释的姿势代码和残差代码，显著提升了文本到3D动作生成和编辑的质量，同时保持了语义对齐和可编辑性。

Abstract: Text-based 3D motion generation aims to automatically synthesize diverse motions from natural-language descriptions to extend user creativity, whereas motion editing modifies an existing motion sequence in response to text while preserving its overall structure. Pose-code-based frameworks such as CoMo map quantifiable pose attributes into discrete pose codes that support interpretable motion control, but their frame-wise representation struggles to capture subtle temporal dynamics and high-frequency details, often degrading reconstruction fidelity and local controllability. To address this limitation, we introduce pose-guided residual refinement for motion (PGR$^2$M), a hybrid representation that augments interpretable pose codes with residual codes learned via residual vector quantization (RVQ). A pose-guided RVQ tokenizer decomposes motion into pose latents that encode coarse global structure and residual latents that model fine-grained temporal variations. Residual dropout further discourages over-reliance on residuals, preserving the semantic alignment and editability of the pose codes. On top of this tokenizer, a base Transformer autoregressively predicts pose codes from text, and a refine Transformer predicts residual codes conditioned on text, pose codes, and quantization stage. Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show that PGR$^2$M improves Fréchet inception distance and reconstruction metrics for both generation and editing compared with CoMo and recent diffusion- and tokenization-based baselines, while user studies confirm that it enables intuitive, structure-preserving motion edits.

Conclusion: 提出的基于线的事件相机校准框架在模拟和真实世界实验中均表现出可行性和准确性，适用于单目和立体事件相机。

Abstract: Camera calibration is an essential prerequisite for event-based vision applications. Current event camera calibration methods typically involve using flashing patterns, reconstructing intensity images, and utilizing the features extracted from events. Existing methods are generally time-consuming and require manually placed calibration objects, which cannot meet the needs of rapidly changing scenarios. In this paper, we propose a line-based event camera calibration framework exploiting the geometric lines of commonly-encountered objects in man-made environments, e.g., doors, windows, boxes, etc. Different from previous methods, our method detects lines directly from event streams and leverages an event-line calibration model to generate the initial guess of camera parameters, which is suitable for both planar and non-planar lines. Then, a non-linear optimization is adopted to refine camera parameters. Both simulation and real-world experiments have demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of our method, with validation performed on monocular and stereo event cameras.

Result: Qwen2.5-VL-3B模型在MUSON上的决策准确率为0.8625，验证了数据集的有效性。

Conclusion: MUSON数据集通过结构化的五步Chain-of-Thought标注和平衡的动作空间，为社交导航提供了有效的基准，Qwen2.5-VL-3B模型在MUSON上达到了最高的决策准确率0.8625。

Abstract: Socially compliant navigation requires structured reasoning over dynamic pedestrians and physical constraints to ensure safe and interpretable decisions. However, existing social navigation datasets often lack explicit reasoning supervision and exhibit highly long-tailed action distributions, limiting models' ability to learn safety-critical behaviors. To address these issues, we introduce MUSON, a multimodal dataset for short-horizon social navigation collected across diverse indoor and outdoor campus scenes. MUSON adopts a structured five-step Chain-of-Thought annotation consisting of perception, prediction, reasoning, action, and explanation, with explicit modeling of static physical constraints and a rationally balanced discrete action space. Compared to SNEI, MUSON provides consistent reasoning, action, and explanation. Benchmarking multiple state-of-the-art Small Vision Language Models on MUSON shows that Qwen2.5-VL-3B achieves the highest decision accuracy of 0.8625, demonstrating that MUSON serves as an effective and reusable benchmark for socially compliant navigation.

Method: 提出了一种新颖的Quality-Aware Dynamic Fusion Network (QDFNet)，包括Dynamic Modality Quality Assessment (DMQA)模块和Orthogonal Constraint Normalization Fusion (OCNF)模块，动态评估特征可靠性并自适应融合。

Result: 在SpaceNet6-OTD和OGSOD-2.0数据集上的实验表明，QDFNet在模态缺失或退化场景下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: QDFNet通过动态评估特征可靠性和自适应融合机制，显著提升了光学-SAR融合目标检测的鲁棒性和性能，特别是在模态缺失或退化情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) fusion-based object detection has attracted significant research interest in remote sensing, as these modalities provide complementary information for all-weather monitoring. However, practical deployment is severely limited by inherent challenges. Due to distinct imaging mechanisms, temporal asynchrony, and registration difficulties, obtaining well-aligned optical-SAR image pairs remains extremely difficult, frequently resulting in missing or degraded modality data. Although recent approaches have attempted to address this issue, they still suffer from limited robustness to random missing modalities and lack effective mechanisms to ensure consistent performance improvement in fusion-based detection. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Quality-Aware Dynamic Fusion Network (QDFNet) for robust optical-SAR object detection. Our proposed method leverages learnable reference tokens to dynamically assess feature reliability and guide adaptive fusion in the presence of missing modalities. In particular, we design a Dynamic Modality Quality Assessment (DMQA) module that employs learnable reference tokens to iteratively refine feature reliability assessment, enabling precise identification of degraded regions and providing quality guidance for subsequent fusion. Moreover, we develop an Orthogonal Constraint Normalization Fusion (OCNF) module that employs orthogonal constraints to preserve modality independence while dynamically adjusting fusion weights based on reliability scores, effectively suppressing unreliable feature propagation. Extensive experiments on the SpaceNet6-OTD and OGSOD-2.0 datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of QDFNet compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly under partial modality corruption or missing data scenarios.

Abstract: Locating objects for the visually impaired is a significant challenge and is something no one can get used to over time. However, this hinders their independence and could push them towards risky and dangerous scenarios. Hence, in the spirit of making the visually challenged more self-sufficient, we present SonoVision, a smart-phone application that helps them find everyday objects using sound cues through earphones/headphones. This simply means, if an object is on the right or left side of a user, the app makes a sinusoidal sound in a user's respective ear through ear/headphones. However, to indicate objects located directly in front, both the left and right earphones are rung simultaneously. These sound cues could easily help a visually impaired individual locate objects with the help of their smartphones and reduce the reliance on people in their surroundings, consequently making them more independent. This application is made with the flutter development platform and uses the Efficientdet-D2 model for object detection in the backend. We believe the app will significantly assist the visually impaired in a safe and user-friendly manner with its capacity to work completely offline. Our application can be accessed here https://github.com/MohammedZ666/SonoVision.git.

Abstract: Monocular 3D building reconstruction from remote sensing imagery is essential for scalable urban modeling, yet existing methods often require task-specific architectures and intensive supervision. This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of SAM 3D, a general-purpose image-to-3D foundation model, for monocular remote sensing building reconstruction. We benchmark SAM 3D against TRELLIS on samples from the NYC Urban Dataset, employing Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and CLIP-based Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) as evaluation metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that SAM 3D produces more coherent roof geometry and sharper boundaries compared to TRELLIS. We further extend SAM 3D to urban scene reconstruction through a segment-reconstruct-compose pipeline, demonstrating its potential for urban scene modeling. We also analyze practical limitations and discuss future research directions. These findings provide practical guidance for deploying foundation models in urban 3D reconstruction and motivate future integration of scene-level structural priors.

Abstract: Electrical substations are a significant component of an electrical grid. Indeed, the assets at these substations (e.g., transformers) are prone to disruption from many hazards, including hurricanes, flooding, earthquakes, and geomagnetically induced currents (GICs). As electrical grids are considered critical national infrastructure, any failure can have significant economic and public safety implications. To help prevent and mitigate these failures, it is thus essential that we identify key substation components to quantify vulnerability. Unfortunately, traditional manual mapping of substation infrastructure is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, an autonomous solution utilizing computer vision models is preferable, as it allows for greater convenience and efficiency. In this research paper, we train and compare the outputs of 3 models (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, RF-DETR) on a manually labeled dataset of US substation images. Each model is evaluated for detection accuracy, precision, and efficiency. We present the key strengths and limitations of each model, identifying which provides reliable and large-scale substation component mapping. Additionally, we utilize these models to effectively map the various substation components in the United States, showcasing a use case for machine learning in substation mapping.

Abstract: Accurate measurement of shock wave motion parameters with high spatiotemporal resolution is essential for applications such as power field testing and damage assessment. However, significant challenges are posed by the fast, uneven propagation of shock waves and unstable testing conditions. To address these challenges, a novel framework is proposed that utilizes multiple event cameras to estimate the asymmetry of shock waves, leveraging its high-speed and high-dynamic range capabilities. Initially, a polar coordinate system is established, which encodes events to reveal shock wave propagation patterns, with adaptive region-of-interest (ROI) extraction through event offset calculations. Subsequently, shock wave front events are extracted using iterative slope analysis, exploiting the continuity of velocity changes. Finally, the geometric model of events and shock wave motion parameters is derived according to event-based optical imaging model, along with the 3D reconstruction model. Through the above process, multi-angle shock wave measurement, motion field reconstruction, and explosive equivalence inversion are achieved. The results of the speed measurement are compared with those of the pressure sensors and the empirical formula, revealing a maximum error of 5.20% and a minimum error of 0.06%. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-precision measurement of the shock wave motion field with both high spatial and temporal resolution, representing significant progress.

Abstract: Infrared small object detection urgently requires semi-supervised paradigms due to the high cost of annotation. However, existing methods like SAM face significant challenges of domain gaps, inability of encoding physical priors, and inherent architectural complexity. To address this, we designed a Hierarchical MoE Adapter consisting of four white-box neural operators. Building upon this core component, we propose a two-stage paradigm for knowledge distillation and transfer: (1) Prior-Guided Knowledge Distillation, where we use our MoE adapter and 10% of available fully supervised data to distill SAM into an expert teacher (Scalpel-SAM); and (2) Deployment-Oriented Knowledge Transfer, where we use Scalpel-SAM to generate pseudo labels for training lightweight and efficient downstream models. Experiments demonstrate that with minimal annotations, our paradigm enables downstream models to achieve performance comparable to, or even surpassing, their fully supervised counterparts. To our knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised paradigm that systematically addresses the data scarcity issue in IR-SOT using SAM as the teacher model.

Abstract: We propose Video Gaussian Masked Autoencoders (Video-GMAE), a self-supervised approach for representation learning that encodes a sequence of images into a set of Gaussian splats moving over time. Representing a video as a set of Gaussians enforces a reasonable inductive bias: that 2-D videos are often consistent projections of a dynamic 3-D scene. We find that tracking emerges when pretraining a network with this architecture. Mapping the trajectory of the learnt Gaussians onto the image plane gives zero-shot tracking performance comparable to state-of-the-art. With small-scale finetuning, our models achieve 34.6% improvement on Kinetics, and 13.1% on Kubric datasets, surpassing existing self-supervised video approaches.

Abstract: Reliable and precise detection of small and irregular objects, such as meteor fragments and rocks, is critical for autonomous navigation and operation in lunar surface exploration. Existing multimodal 3D perception methods designed for terrestrial autonomous driving often underperform in off world environments due to poor feature alignment, limited multimodal synergy, and weak small object detection. This paper presents SCAFusion, a multimodal 3D object detection model tailored for lunar robotic missions. Built upon the BEVFusion framework, SCAFusion integrates a Cognitive Adapter for efficient camera backbone tuning, a Contrastive Alignment Module to enhance camera LiDAR feature consistency, a Camera Auxiliary Training Branch to strengthen visual representation, and most importantly, a Section aware Coordinate Attention mechanism explicitly designed to boost the detection performance of small, irregular targets. With negligible increase in parameters and computation, our model achieves 69.7% mAP and 72.1% NDS on the nuScenes validation set, improving the baseline by 5.0% and 2.7%, respectively. In simulated lunar environments built on Isaac Sim, SCAFusion achieves 90.93% mAP, outperforming the baseline by 11.5%, with notable gains in detecting small meteor like obstacles.

Conclusion: DreamOmni3通过创新的数据合成流程和框架设计，在基于涂鸦的编辑和生成任务中表现出色，并公开了模型和代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Recently unified generation and editing models have achieved remarkable success with their impressive performance. These models rely mainly on text prompts for instruction-based editing and generation, but language often fails to capture users intended edit locations and fine-grained visual details. To this end, we propose two tasks: scribble-based editing and generation, that enables more flexible creation on graphical user interface (GUI) combining user textual, images, and freehand sketches. We introduce DreamOmni3, tackling two challenges: data creation and framework design. Our data synthesis pipeline includes two parts: scribble-based editing and generation. For scribble-based editing, we define four tasks: scribble and instruction-based editing, scribble and multimodal instruction-based editing, image fusion, and doodle editing. Based on DreamOmni2 dataset, we extract editable regions and overlay hand-drawn boxes, circles, doodles or cropped image to construct training data. For scribble-based generation, we define three tasks: scribble and instruction-based generation, scribble and multimodal instruction-based generation, and doodle generation, following similar data creation pipelines. For the framework, instead of using binary masks, which struggle with complex edits involving multiple scribbles, images, and instructions, we propose a joint input scheme that feeds both the original and scribbled source images into the model, using different colors to distinguish regions and simplify processing. By applying the same index and position encodings to both images, the model can precisely localize scribbled regions while maintaining accurate editing. Finally, we establish comprehensive benchmarks for these tasks to promote further research. Experimental results demonstrate that DreamOmni3 achieves outstanding performance, and models and code will be publicly released.

Conclusion: CoAgent通过其协作闭环框架显著提升了长视频生成的连贯性、视觉一致性和叙事质量。

Abstract: Maintaining narrative coherence and visual consistency remains a central challenge in open-domain video generation. Existing text-to-video models often treat each shot independently, resulting in identity drift, scene inconsistency, and unstable temporal structure. We propose CoAgent, a collaborative and closed-loop framework for coherent video generation that formulates the process as a plan-synthesize-verify pipeline. Given a user prompt, style reference, and pacing constraints, a Storyboard Planner decomposes the input into structured shot-level plans with explicit entities, spatial relations, and temporal cues. A Global Context Manager maintains entity-level memory to preserve appearance and identity consistency across shots. Each shot is then generated by a Synthesis Module under the guidance of a Visual Consistency Controller, while a Verifier Agent evaluates intermediate results using vision-language reasoning and triggers selective regeneration when inconsistencies are detected. Finally, a pacing-aware editor refines temporal rhythm and transitions to match the desired narrative flow. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoAgent significantly improves coherence, visual consistency, and narrative quality in long-form video generation.

Conclusion: SR-MCR通过整合五种自参考信号和优化的训练目标，显著提升了多模态LLM的答案准确性和推理连贯性，在同类开源模型中达到最佳性能。

Abstract: Multimodal LLMs often produce fluent yet unreliable reasoning, exhibiting weak step-to-step coherence and insufficient visual grounding, largely because existing alignment approaches supervise only the final answer while ignoring the reliability of the intermediate reasoning process. We introduce SR-MCR, a lightweight and label-free framework that aligns reasoning by exploiting intrinsic process signals derived directly from model outputs. Five self-referential cues -- semantic alignment, lexical fidelity, non-redundancy, visual grounding, and step consistency -- are integrated into a normalized, reliability-weighted reward that provides fine-grained process-level guidance. A critic-free GRPO objective, enhanced with a confidence-aware cooling mechanism, further stabilizes training and suppresses trivial or overly confident generations. Built on Qwen2.5-VL, SR-MCR improves both answer accuracy and reasoning coherence across a broad set of visual benchmarks; among open-source models of comparable size, SR-MCR-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 81.4%. Ablation studies confirm the independent contributions of each reward term and the cooling module.

Conclusion: The study successfully addresses key challenges in glioma diagnosis by introducing ReFRM3D, a novel radiomics-enhanced network, and a multi-feature classifier, demonstrating significant improvements in segmentation performance across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Gliomas are among the most aggressive cancers, characterized by high mortality rates and complex diagnostic processes. Existing studies on glioma diagnosis and classification often describe issues such as high variability in imaging data, inadequate optimization of computational resources, and inefficient segmentation and classification of gliomas. To address these challenges, we propose novel techniques utilizing multi-parametric MRI data to enhance tumor segmentation and classification efficiency. Our work introduces the first-ever radiomics-enhanced fused residual multiparametric 3D network (ReFRM3D) for brain tumor characterization, which is based on a 3D U-Net architecture and features multi-scale feature fusion, hybrid upsampling, and an extended residual skip mechanism. Additionally, we propose a multi-feature tumor marker-based classifier that leverages radiomic features extracted from the segmented regions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation performance across the BraTS2019, BraTS2020, and BraTS2021 datasets, achieving high Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of 94.04%, 92.68%, and 93.64% for whole tumor (WT), enhancing tumor (ET), and tumor core (TC) respectively in BraTS2019; 94.09%, 92.91%, and 93.84% in BraTS2020; and 93.70%, 90.36%, and 92.13% in BraTS2021.

Conclusion: KV-Tracker通过缓存自注意力块的键值对实现了实时6-DoF姿态跟踪和在线重建，显著提升了推理速度，且无需重新训练即可应用于其他多视图网络。

Abstract: Multi-view 3D geometry networks offer a powerful prior but are prohibitively slow for real-time applications. We propose a novel way to adapt them for online use, enabling real-time 6-DoF pose tracking and online reconstruction of objects and scenes from monocular RGB videos. Our method rapidly selects and manages a set of images as keyframes to map a scene or object via $π^3$ with full bidirectional attention. We then cache the global self-attention block's key-value (KV) pairs and use them as the sole scene representation for online tracking. This allows for up to $15\times$ speedup during inference without the fear of drift or catastrophic forgetting. Our caching strategy is model-agnostic and can be applied to other off-the-shelf multi-view networks without retraining. We demonstrate KV-Tracker on both scene-level tracking and the more challenging task of on-the-fly object tracking and reconstruction without depth measurements or object priors. Experiments on the TUM RGB-D, 7-Scenes, Arctic and OnePose datasets show the strong performance of our system while maintaining high frame-rates up to ${\sim}27$ FPS.

Conclusion: PTalker框架通过风格解耦和三重对齐机制，成功生成了具有个性化说话风格的高质量3D说话头部动画，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D talking head generation aims to produce lifelike facial animations precisely synchronized with speech. While considerable progress has been made in achieving high lip-synchronization accuracy, existing methods largely overlook the intricate nuances of individual speaking styles, which limits personalization and realism. In this work, we present a novel framework for personalized 3D talking head animation, namely "PTalker". This framework preserves speaking style through style disentanglement from audio and facial motion sequences and enhances lip-synchronization accuracy through a three-level alignment mechanism between audio and mesh modalities. Specifically, to effectively disentangle style and content, we design disentanglement constraints that encode driven audio and motion sequences into distinct style and content spaces to enhance speaking style representation. To improve lip-synchronization accuracy, we adopt a modality alignment mechanism incorporating three aspects: spatial alignment using Graph Attention Networks to capture vertex connectivity in the 3D mesh structure, temporal alignment using cross-attention to capture and synchronize temporal dependencies, and feature alignment by top-k bidirectional contrastive losses and KL divergence constraints to ensure consistency between speech and mesh modalities. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on public datasets demonstrate that PTalker effectively generates realistic, stylized 3D talking heads that accurately match identity-specific speaking styles, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于稀疏差分Transformer（SDT）的预测驱动Top-K Jaccard相似度系数方法，显著提高了人脸聚类性能，并在多个数据集上实现了SOTA性能。

Abstract: The method used to measure relationships between face embeddings plays a crucial role in determining the performance of face clustering. Existing methods employ the Jaccard similarity coefficient instead of the cosine distance to enhance the measurement accuracy. However, these methods introduce too many irrelevant nodes, producing Jaccard coefficients with limited discriminative power and adversely affecting clustering performance. To address this issue, we propose a prediction-driven Top-K Jaccard similarity coefficient that enhances the purity of neighboring nodes, thereby improving the reliability of similarity measurements. Nevertheless, accurately predicting the optimal number of neighbors (Top-K) remains challenging, leading to suboptimal clustering results. To overcome this limitation, we develop a Transformer-based prediction model that examines the relationships between the central node and its neighboring nodes near the Top-K to further enhance the reliability of similarity estimation. However, vanilla Transformer, when applied to predict relationships between nodes, often introduces noise due to their overemphasis on irrelevant feature relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a Sparse Differential Transformer (SDT), instead of the vanilla Transformer, to eliminate noise and enhance the model's anti-noise capabilities. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, such as MS-Celeb-1M, demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, outperforming existing methods and providing a more robust solution for face clustering.

Abstract: While autoregressive Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their sequential generation often limits their efficacy in complex visual planning and dynamic robotic control. In this work, we investigate the potential of constructing Vision-Language Models upon diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) to overcome these limitations. We introduce Dream-VL, an open diffusion-based VLM (dVLM) that achieves state-of-the-art performance among previous dVLMs. Dream-VL is comparable to top-tier AR-based VLMs trained on open data on various benchmarks but exhibits superior potential when applied to visual planning tasks. Building upon Dream-VL, we introduce Dream-VLA, a dLLM-based Vision-Language-Action model (dVLA) developed through continuous pre-training on open robotic datasets. We demonstrate that the natively bidirectional nature of this diffusion backbone serves as a superior foundation for VLA tasks, inherently suited for action chunking and parallel generation, leading to significantly faster convergence in downstream fine-tuning. Dream-VLA achieves top-tier performance of 97.2% average success rate on LIBERO, 71.4% overall average on SimplerEnv-Bridge, and 60.5% overall average on SimplerEnv-Fractal, surpassing leading models such as $π_0$ and GR00T-N1. We also validate that dVLMs surpass AR baselines on downstream tasks across different training objectives. We release both Dream-VL and Dream-VLA to facilitate further research in the community.

Abstract: \noindent Memory has become the central mechanism enabling robust visual object tracking in modern segmentation-based frameworks. Recent methods built upon Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) have demonstrated strong performance by refining how past observations are stored and reused. However, existing approaches address memory limitations in a method-specific manner, leaving the broader design principles of memory in SAM-based tracking poorly understood. Moreover, it remains unclear how these memory mechanisms transfer to stronger, next-generation foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3). In this work, we present a systematic memory-centric study of SAM-based visual object tracking. We first analyze representative SAM2-based trackers and show that most methods primarily differ in how short-term memory frames are selected, while sharing a common object-centric representation. Building on this insight, we faithfully reimplement these memory mechanisms within the SAM3 framework and conduct large-scale evaluations across ten diverse benchmarks, enabling a controlled analysis of memory design independent of backbone strength. Guided by our empirical findings, we propose a unified hybrid memory framework that explicitly decomposes memory into short-term appearance memory and long-term distractor-resolving memory. This decomposition enables the integration of existing memory policies in a modular and principled manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under long-term occlusion, complex motion, and distractor-heavy scenarios on both SAM2 and SAM3 backbones. Code is available at: https://github.com/HamadYA/SAM3_Tracking_Zoo. \textbf{This is a preprint. Some results are being finalized and may be updated in a future revision.}

Conclusion: Envision 通过明确的目标图像约束生成，实现了物理合理性和目标一致性，为具身智能体提供了可靠的视觉规划指导。

Abstract: Embodied visual planning aims to enable manipulation tasks by imagining how a scene evolves toward a desired goal and using the imagined trajectories to guide actions. Video diffusion models, through their image-to-video generation capability, provide a promising foundation for such visual imagination. However, existing approaches are largely forward predictive, generating trajectories conditioned on the initial observation without explicit goal modeling, thus often leading to spatial drift and goal misalignment. To address these challenges, we propose Envision, a diffusion-based framework that performs visual planning for embodied agents. By explicitly constraining the generation with a goal image, our method enforces physical plausibility and goal consistency throughout the generated trajectory. Specifically, Envision operates in two stages. First, a Goal Imagery Model identifies task-relevant regions, performs region-aware cross attention between the scene and the instruction, and synthesizes a coherent goal image that captures the desired outcome. Then, an Env-Goal Video Model, built upon a first-and-last-frame-conditioned video diffusion model (FL2V), interpolates between the initial observation and the goal image, producing smooth and physically plausible video trajectories that connect the start and goal states. Experiments on object manipulation and image editing benchmarks demonstrate that Envision achieves superior goal alignment, spatial consistency, and object preservation compared to baselines. The resulting visual plans can directly support downstream robotic planning and control, providing reliable guidance for embodied agents.

Conclusion: 实验验证了该方法在全局质量和局部真实性上的有效性，适用于RLHF方法的ISR模型。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has proven effective in image generation field guided by reward models to align human preferences. Motivated by this, adapting RLHF for Image Super-Resolution (ISR) tasks has shown promise in optimizing perceptual quality with Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model as reward models. However, the traditional IQA model usually output a single global score, which are exceptionally insensitive to local and fine-grained distortions. This insensitivity allows ISR models to produce perceptually undesirable artifacts that yield spurious high scores, misaligning optimization objectives with perceptual quality and results in reward hacking. To address this, we propose a Fine-grained Perceptual Reward Model (FinPercep-RM) based on an Encoder-Decoder architecture. While providing a global quality score, it also generates a Perceptual Degradation Map that spatially localizes and quantifies local defects. We specifically introduce the FGR-30k dataset to train this model, consisting of diverse and subtle distortions from real-world super-resolution models. Despite the success of the FinPercep-RM model, its complexity introduces significant challenges in generator policy learning, leading to training instability. To address this, we propose a Co-evolutionary Curriculum Learning (CCL) mechanism, where both the reward model and the ISR model undergo synchronized curricula. The reward model progressively increases in complexity, while the ISR model starts with a simpler global reward for rapid convergence, gradually transitioning to the more complex model outputs. This easy-to-hard strategy enables stable training while suppressing reward hacking. Experiments validates the effectiveness of our method across ISR models in both global quality and local realism on RLHF methods.

TL;DR: 研究比较多种深度学习架构用于超声心动图视频的LVEF估计，发现改进的3D Inception性能最佳（RMSE 6.79%），但模型易过拟合且对超参数敏感，结论对视频分析任务有普适意义。

Motivation: 超声心动图作为非侵入性成像技术广泛用于LVEF评估，但手动评估耗时且存在观察者间差异。深度学习有望提供与专家相当的性能，因此研究探索了多种架构的有效性。

Method: 研究采用了3D Inception、双流和CNN-RNN等深度学习架构，通过系统评估架构修改和融合策略，优化预测准确性。模型在包含10,030个超声心动图视频的EchoNet-Dynamic数据集上进行训练和评估。

Result: 改进的3D Inception架构表现最佳（RMSE 6.79%），但所有架构均显示过拟合倾向，较小且简单的模型泛化能力更强。模型性能对卷积核大小和归一化策略等超参数高度敏感。

Conclusion: 本研究通过比较多种深度学习架构，发现改进的3D Inception架构在LVEF估计中表现最佳，RMSE为6.79%。研究还揭示了模型易过拟合及对超参数敏感的问题，这些发现对更广泛的视频分析任务具有参考价值。

Abstract: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is a key indicator of cardiac function and plays a central role in the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease. Echocardiography, as a readily accessible and non-invasive imaging modality, is widely used in clinical practice to estimate LVEF. However, manual assessment of cardiac function from echocardiograms is time-consuming and subject to considerable inter-observer variability. Deep learning approaches offer a promising alternative, with the potential to achieve performance comparable to that of experienced human experts. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of several deep learning architectures for LVEF estimation from echocardiography videos, including 3D Inception, two-stream, and CNN-RNN models. We systematically evaluate architectural modifications and fusion strategies to identify configurations that maximize prediction accuracy. Models were trained and evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, comprising 10,030 echocardiogram videos. Our results demonstrate that modified 3D Inception architectures achieve the best overall performance, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 6.79%. Across architectures, we observe a tendency toward overfitting, with smaller and simpler models generally exhibiting improved generalization. Model performance was also found to be highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, particularly convolutional kernel sizes and normalization strategies. While this study focuses on echocardiography-based LVEF estimation, the insights gained regarding architectural design and training strategies may be applicable to a broader range of medical and non-medical video analysis tasks.

Abstract: In the big data era, the computer vision field benefits from large-scale datasets such as LAION-2B, LAION-400M, and ImageNet-21K, Kinetics, on which popular models like the ViT and ConvNeXt series have been pre-trained, acquiring substantial knowledge. However, numerous downstream tasks in specialized and data-limited scientific domains continue to pose significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel Cluster Attention Adapter (CLAdapter), which refines and adapts the rich representations learned from large-scale data to various data-limited downstream tasks. Specifically, CLAdapter introduces attention mechanisms and cluster centers to personalize the enhancement of transformed features through distribution correlation and transformation matrices. This enables models fine-tuned with CLAdapter to learn distinct representations tailored to different feature sets, facilitating the models' adaptation from rich pre-trained features to various downstream scenarios effectively. In addition, CLAdapter's unified interface design allows for seamless integration with multiple model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers, in both 2D and 3D contexts. Through extensive experiments on 10 datasets spanning domains such as generic, multimedia, biological, medical, industrial, agricultural, environmental, geographical, materials science, out-of-distribution (OOD), and 3D analysis, CLAdapter achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse data-limited scientific domains, demonstrating its effectiveness in unleashing the potential of foundation vision models via adaptive transfer.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable visual fidelity but often struggle with semantic alignment to complex prompts. We introduce CritiFusion, a novel inference-time framework that integrates a multimodal semantic critique mechanism with frequency-domain refinement to improve text-to-image consistency and detail. The proposed CritiCore module leverages a vision-language model and multiple large language models to enrich the prompt context and produce high-level semantic feedback, guiding the diffusion process to better align generated content with the prompt's intent. Additionally, SpecFusion merges intermediate generation states in the spectral domain, injecting coarse structural information while preserving high-frequency details. No additional model training is required. CritiFusion serves as a plug-in refinement stage compatible with existing diffusion backbones. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our method notably improves human-aligned metrics of text-to-image correspondence and visual quality. CritiFusion consistently boosts performance on human preference scores and aesthetic evaluations, achieving results on par with state-of-the-art reward optimization approaches. Qualitative results further demonstrate superior detail, realism, and prompt fidelity, indicating the effectiveness of our semantic critique and spectral alignment strategy.

Abstract: Motion prediction has been studied in different contexts with models trained on narrow distributions and applied to downstream tasks in human motion prediction and robotics. Simultaneously, recent efforts in scaling video prediction have demonstrated impressive visual realism, yet they struggle to accurately model complex motions despite massive scale. Inspired by the scaling of video generation, we develop autoregressive flow matching (ARFM), a new method for probabilistic modeling of sequential continuous data and train it on diverse video datasets to generate future point track locations over long horizons. To evaluate our model, we develop benchmarks for evaluating the ability of motion prediction models to predict human and robot motion. Our model is able to predict complex motions, and we demonstrate that conditioning robot action prediction and human motion prediction on predicted future tracks can significantly improve downstream task performance.

Abstract: This work proposes a multimodal diffeomorphic registration method using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). Nonrigid registration algorithms exhibit tradeoffs between their accuracy, the computational complexity of their deformation model, and its proper regularization. In addition, they also assume intensity correlation in anatomically homologous regions of interest among image pairs, limiting their applicability to the monomodal setting. Unlike learning-based models, we propose an instance-specific framework that is not subject to high scan requirements for training and does not suffer performance degradation at inference time on modalities unseen during training. Our method exploits the potential of continuous-depth networks in the Neural ODE paradigm with structural descriptors, widely adopted as modality-agnostic metric models which exploit self-similarities on parameterized neighborhood geometries. We propose three different variants that integrate image-based or feature-based structural descriptors and nonstructural image similarities computed by local mutual information. We conduct extensive evaluations on different experiments formed by scan dataset combinations and show surpassing qualitative and quantitative results compared to state-of-the-art baselines adequate for large or small deformations, and specific of multimodal registration. Lastly, we also demonstrate the underlying robustness of the proposed framework to varying levels of explicit regularization while maintaining low error, its suitability for registration at varying scales, and its efficiency with respect to other methods targeted to large-deformation registration.

Method: 采用3D高斯喷绘（GS）车辆资产表示与3D场景点云，通过扩散模型生成高质量图像，联合处理资产插入和NVS。

Result: 在Waymo Open Dataset上的评估表明，SCPainter能有效实现3D资产插入和NVS，生成多样且逼真的驾驶数据。

Conclusion: SCPainter框架成功整合了3D高斯喷绘（GS）车辆资产表示与3D场景点云，结合基于扩散的生成技术，实现了逼真的3D资产插入和新视角合成（NVS），为自动驾驶训练数据的多样性和真实性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Asset insertion and novel view synthesis (NVS) are key components for autonomous driving simulation, enhancing the diversity of training data. With better training data that is diverse and covers a wide range of situations, including long-tailed driving scenarios, autonomous driving models can become more robust and safer. This motivates a unified simulation framework that can jointly handle realistic integration of inserted 3D assets and NVS. Recent 3D asset reconstruction methods enable reconstruction of dynamic actors from video, supporting their re-insertion into simulated driving scenes. While the overall structure and appearance can be accurate, it still struggles to capture the realism of 3D assets through lighting or shadows, particularly when inserted into scenes. In parallel, recent advances in NVS methods have demonstrated promising results in synthesizing viewpoints beyond the originally recorded trajectories. However, existing approaches largely treat asset insertion and NVS capabilities in isolation. To allow for interaction with the rest of the scene and to enable more diverse creation of new scenarios for training, realistic 3D asset insertion should be combined with NVS. To address this, we present SCPainter (Street Car Painter), a unified framework which integrates 3D Gaussian Splat (GS) car asset representations and 3D scene point clouds with diffusion-based generation to jointly enable realistic 3D asset insertion and NVS. The 3D GS assets and 3D scene point clouds are projected together into novel views, and these projections are used to condition a diffusion model to generate high quality images. Evaluation on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate the capability of our framework to enable 3D asset insertion and NVS, facilitating the creation of diverse and realistic driving data.

Motivation: 囊性水瘤是高风险的产前超声发现，自动化检测可提高可重复性并支持早期筛查。监督深度学习方法受限于小规模标注数据集。

Method: 使用超声自监督预训练模型USF-MAE进行微调，用于二分类任务（正常对照与囊性水瘤病例）。评估指标包括准确率、灵敏度、特异性和ROC-AUC。

Result: USF-MAE在所有评估指标上均优于DenseNet-169基线模型（准确率0.96 vs. 0.93，ROC-AUC 0.98 vs. 0.94），且性能提升具有统计学意义（p=0.0057）。

Conclusion: USF-MAE模型在检测囊性水瘤方面表现优异，显著优于DenseNet-169基线模型，且具有临床相关性。

Abstract: Cystic hygroma is a high-risk prenatal ultrasound finding that portends high rates of chromosomal abnormalities, structural malformations, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Automated detection can increase reproducibility and support scalable early screening programs, but supervised deep learning methods are limited by small labelled datasets. This study assesses whether ultrasound-specific self-supervised pretraining can facilitate accurate, robust deep learning detection of cystic hygroma in first-trimester ultrasound images. We fine-tuned the Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), pretrained on over 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images, for binary classification of normal controls and cystic hygroma cases used in this study. Performance was evaluated on the same curated ultrasound dataset, preprocessing pipeline, and 4-fold cross-validation protocol as for the DenseNet-169 baseline, using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). Model interpretability was analyzed qualitatively using Score-CAM visualizations. USF-MAE outperformed the DenseNet-169 baseline on all evaluation metrics. The proposed model yielded a mean accuracy of 0.96, sensitivity of 0.94, specificity of 0.98, and ROC-AUC of 0.98 compared to 0.93, 0.92, 0.94, and 0.94 for the DenseNet-169 baseline, respectively. Qualitative Score-CAM visualizations of model predictions demonstrated clinical relevance by highlighting expected regions in the fetal neck for both positive and negative cases. Paired statistical analysis using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test confirmed that performance improvements achieved by USF-MAE were statistically significant (p = 0.0057).

Conclusion: 该论文通过引入Freetime FeatureGS和流式特征学习策略，显著提升了4D场景分解重建的质量，无需依赖视频分割结果。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of decomposed 4D scene reconstruction from multi-view videos. Recent methods achieve this by lifting video segmentation results to a 4D representation through differentiable rendering techniques. Therefore, they heavily rely on the quality of video segmentation maps, which are often unstable, leading to unreliable reconstruction results. To overcome this challenge, our key idea is to represent the decomposed 4D scene with the Freetime FeatureGS and design a streaming feature learning strategy to accurately recover it from per-image segmentation maps, eliminating the need for video segmentation. Freetime FeatureGS models the dynamic scene as a set of Gaussian primitives with learnable features and linear motion ability, allowing them to move to neighboring regions over time. We apply a contrastive loss to Freetime FeatureGS, forcing primitive features to be close or far apart based on whether their projections belong to the same instance in the 2D segmentation map. As our Gaussian primitives can move across time, it naturally extends the feature learning to the temporal dimension, achieving 4D segmentation. Furthermore, we sample observations for training in a temporally ordered manner, enabling the streaming propagation of features over time and effectively avoiding local minima during the optimization process. Experimental results on several datasets show that the reconstruction quality of our method outperforms recent methods by a large margin.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种针对长上下文多图像场景的自适应视觉令牌修剪方法，通过分解冗余为图像内和图像间组件，并动态分配预算，有效减少了视觉令牌数量，同时保持了性能。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have proven effective on various tasks. They typically encode visual inputs into Original Model sequences of tokens, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly processed by the language model. However, the growing number of visual tokens greatly increases inference cost. Visual token pruning has emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods often overlook scenarios involving long context inputs with multiple images. In this paper, we analyze the challenges of visual token pruning in long context, multi-image settings and introduce an adaptive pruning method tailored for such scenarios. We decompose redundancy into intra-image and inter-image components and quantify them through intra-image diversity and inter-image variation, which jointly guide dynamic budget allocation. Our approach consists of two stages. The intra-image stage allocates each image a content-aware token budget and greedily selects its most representative tokens. The inter-image stage performs global diversity filtering to form a candidate pool and then applies a Pareto selection procedure that balances diversity with text alignment. Extensive experiments show that our approach maintains strong performance in long context settings while significantly cutting down the number of visual tokens.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in visual recognition tasks, but redundant token representations limit their computational efficiency. Existing token merging and pruning strategies often overlook spatial continuity and neighbor relationships, resulting in the loss of local context. This paper proposes novel neighbor-aware token reduction methods based on Hilbert curve reordering, which explicitly preserves the neighbor structure in a 2D space using 1D sequential representations. Our method introduces two key strategies: Neighbor-Aware Pruning (NAP) for selective token retention and Merging by Adjacent Token similarity (MAT) for local token aggregation. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to existing methods. This work highlights the importance of spatial continuity and neighbor structure, offering new insights for the architectural optimization of ViTs.

Abstract: Understanding semantics and dynamics has been crucial for embodied agents in various tasks. Both tasks have much more data redundancy than the static scene understanding task. We formulate the view selection problem as an active learning problem, where the goal is to prioritize frames that provide the greatest information gain for model training. To this end, we propose an active learning algorithm with Fisher Information that quantifies the informativeness of candidate views with respect to both semantic Gaussian parameters and deformation networks. This formulation allows our method to jointly handle semantic reasoning and dynamic scene modeling, providing a principled alternative to heuristic or random strategies. We evaluate our method on large-scale static images and dynamic video datasets by selecting informative frames from multi-camera setups. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently improves rendering quality and semantic segmentation performance, outperforming baseline methods based on random selection and uncertainty-based heuristics.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种基于算术GRM的质量分级模块（AGQG），该模块具有即插即用的优势，能够显著提升现有AGIQA模型的性能，并展示了在自然图像和屏幕内容图像质量评估中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing AGIQA models typically estimate image quality by measuring and aggregating the similarities between image embeddings and text embeddings derived from multi-grade quality descriptions. Although effective, we observe that such similarity distributions across grades usually exhibit multimodal patterns. For instance, an image embedding may show high similarity to both "excellent" and "poor" grade descriptions while deviating from the "good" one. We refer to this phenomenon as "semantic drift", where semantic inconsistencies between text embeddings and their intended descriptions undermine the reliability of text-image shared-space learning. To mitigate this issue, we draw inspiration from psychometrics and propose an improved Graded Response Model (GRM) for AGIQA. The GRM is a classical assessment model that categorizes a subject's ability across grades using test items with various difficulty levels. This paradigm aligns remarkably well with human quality rating, where image quality can be interpreted as an image's ability to meet various quality grades. Building on this philosophy, we design a two-branch quality grading module: one branch estimates image ability while the other constructs multiple difficulty levels. To ensure monotonicity in difficulty levels, we further model difficulty generation in an arithmetic manner, which inherently enforces a unimodal and interpretable quality distribution. Our Arithmetic GRM based Quality Grading (AGQG) module enjoys a plug-and-play advantage, consistently improving performance when integrated into various state-of-the-art AGIQA frameworks. Moreover, it also generalizes effectively to both natural and screen content image quality assessment, revealing its potential as a key component in future IQA models.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved state-of-the-art generative performance but suffer from high sampling latency due to their sequential denoising nature. Existing solver-based acceleration methods often face significant image quality degradation under a low-latency budget, primarily due to accumulated truncation errors arising from the inability to capture high-curvature trajectory segments. In this paper, we propose the Ensemble Parallel Direction solver (dubbed as EPD-Solver), a novel ODE solver that mitigates these errors by incorporating multiple parallel gradient evaluations in each step. Motivated by the geometric insight that sampling trajectories are largely confined to a low-dimensional manifold, EPD-Solver leverages the Mean Value Theorem for vector-valued functions to approximate the integral solution more accurately. Importantly, since the additional gradient computations are independent, they can be fully parallelized, preserving low-latency sampling nature. We introduce a two-stage optimization framework. Initially, EPD-Solver optimizes a small set of learnable parameters via a distillation-based approach. We further propose a parameter-efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning scheme that reformulates the solver as a stochastic Dirichlet policy. Unlike traditional methods that fine-tune the massive backbone, our RL approach operates strictly within the low-dimensional solver space, effectively mitigating reward hacking while enhancing performance in complex text-to-image (T2I) generation tasks. In addition, our method is flexible and can serve as a plugin (EPD-Plugin) to improve existing ODE samplers.

TL;DR: VPTracker利用多模态大语言模型和位置感知视觉提示机制，实现了更鲁棒的视觉-语言跟踪，尤其在视角变化、遮挡和快速移动等挑战性场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常局限于局部搜索，容易在视角变化、遮挡和快速目标移动时失败，因此需要一种更鲁棒的全局跟踪方法。

Method: 提出了一个基于多模态大语言模型的全局跟踪框架（VPTracker），并设计了一种位置感知的视觉提示机制，通过目标先前位置构建区域级提示，优先进行区域级识别，仅在必要时进行全局推理。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在挑战性场景下显著提升了跟踪稳定性和目标辨别能力。

Conclusion: VPTracker通过结合多模态大语言模型和位置感知视觉提示机制，显著提升了视觉-语言跟踪的稳定性和目标辨别能力，为MLLMs在视觉跟踪领域的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Tracking aims to continuously localize objects described by a visual template and a language description. Existing methods, however, are typically limited to local search, making them prone to failures under viewpoint changes, occlusions, and rapid target movements. In this work, we introduce the first global tracking framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (VPTracker), exploiting their powerful semantic reasoning to locate targets across the entire image space. While global search improves robustness and reduces drift, it also introduces distractions from visually or semantically similar objects. To address this, we propose a location-aware visual prompting mechanism that incorporates spatial priors into the MLLM. Specifically, we construct a region-level prompt based on the target's previous location, enabling the model to prioritize region-level recognition and resort to global inference only when necessary. This design retains the advantages of global tracking while effectively suppressing interference from distracting visual content. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly enhances tracking stability and target disambiguation under challenging scenarios, opening a new avenue for integrating MLLMs into visual tracking.

Conclusion: 该方法为医学图像的3D可视化和临床分析提供了一种高效可靠的新途径。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of medical images is a key technology in medical image analysis and clinical diagnosis, providing structural visualization support for disease assessment and surgical planning. Traditional methods are computationally expensive and prone to structural discontinuities and loss of detail in sparse slices, making it difficult to meet clinical accuracy requirements.To address these challenges, we propose an efficient 3D reconstruction method based on 3D Gaussian and tri-plane representations. This method not only maintains the advantages of Gaussian representation in efficient rendering and geometric representation but also significantly enhances structural continuity and semantic consistency under sparse slicing conditions. Experimental results on multimodal medical datasets such as US and MRI show that our proposed method can generate high-quality, anatomically coherent, and semantically stable medical images under sparse data conditions, while significantly improving reconstruction efficiency. This provides an efficient and reliable new approach for 3D visualization and clinical analysis of medical images.

In this study, we aim to evaluate the performance of existing models on open-vocabulary object detection tasks under low-quality image conditions. For this purpose, we introduce a new dataset that simulates low-quality images in the real world. In our evaluation experiment, we find that although open-vocabulary object detection models exhibited no significant decrease in mAP scores under low-level image degradation, the performance of all models dropped sharply under high-level image degradation. OWLv2 models consistently performed better across different types of degradation, while OWL-ViT, GroundingDINO, and Detic showed significant performance declines.

Method: 首先构建HRD数据集解决数据稀缺和对齐问题，然后提出EgoReAct框架，结合VQ-VAE压缩动作空间和GPT生成反应动作，并融入3D动态特征增强空间定位。

Result: EgoReAct在实验中表现出更高的真实感、空间一致性和生成效率，同时保持严格因果性。

Conclusion: EgoReAct通过构建HRD数据集和开发自回归框架，成功实现了从自我中心视频流中实时生成3D对齐的人类反应动作，显著提升了真实感、空间一致性和生成效率。

Abstract: Humans exhibit adaptive, context-sensitive responses to egocentric visual input. However, faithfully modeling such reactions from egocentric video remains challenging due to the dual requirements of strictly causal generation and precise 3D spatial alignment. To tackle this problem, we first construct the Human Reaction Dataset (HRD) to address data scarcity and misalignment by building a spatially aligned egocentric video-reaction dataset, as existing datasets (e.g., ViMo) suffer from significant spatial inconsistency between the egocentric video and reaction motion, e.g., dynamically moving motions are always paired with fixed-camera videos. Leveraging HRD, we present EgoReAct, the first autoregressive framework that generates 3D-aligned human reaction motions from egocentric video streams in real-time. We first compress the reaction motion into a compact yet expressive latent space via a Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder and then train a Generative Pre-trained Transformer for reaction generation from the visual input. EgoReAct incorporates 3D dynamic features, i.e., metric depth, and head dynamics during the generation, which effectively enhance spatial grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EgoReAct achieves remarkably higher realism, spatial consistency, and generation efficiency compared with prior methods, while maintaining strict causality during generation. We will release code, models, and data upon acceptance.

Method: 通过从ViT主干学习一个移位参数，将模型的尺度和移位不变输出转换为尺度不变估计，并集成圆形填充到DPT解码器中以消除接缝伪影。

Conclusion: DA360在零样本全景深度估计方面取得了新的最先进性能，显著超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Panoramic depth estimation provides a comprehensive solution for capturing complete $360^\circ$ environmental structural information, offering significant benefits for robotics and AR/VR applications. However, while extensively studied in indoor settings, its zero-shot generalization to open-world domains lags far behind perspective images, which benefit from abundant training data. This disparity makes transferring capabilities from the perspective domain an attractive solution. To bridge this gap, we present Depth Anything in $360^\circ$ (DA360), a panoramic-adapted version of Depth Anything V2. Our key innovation involves learning a shift parameter from the ViT backbone, transforming the model's scale- and shift-invariant output into a scale-invariant estimate that directly yields well-formed 3D point clouds. This is complemented by integrating circular padding into the DPT decoder to eliminate seam artifacts, ensuring spatially coherent depth maps that respect spherical continuity. Evaluated on standard indoor benchmarks and our newly curated outdoor dataset, Metropolis, DA360 shows substantial gains over its base model, achieving over 50\% and 10\% relative depth error reduction on indoor and outdoor benchmarks, respectively. Furthermore, DA360 significantly outperforms robust panoramic depth estimation methods, achieving about 30\% relative error improvement compared to PanDA across all three test datasets and establishing new state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot panoramic depth estimation.

Conclusion: KANO 提供了一种透明且结构化的潜在退化拟合过程表示，通过理论建模和实验评估，系统地比较了 MLPs 和 KANs 在处理复杂序列拟合任务中的表现，为可解释 SR 技术的发展提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: The highly nonlinear degradation process, complex physical interactions, and various sources of uncertainty render single-image Super-resolution (SR) a particularly challenging task. Existing interpretable SR approaches, whether based on prior learning or deep unfolding optimization frameworks, typically rely on black-box deep networks to model latent variables, which leaves the degradation process largely unknown and uncontrollable. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem (KAT), we for the first time propose a novel interpretable operator, termed Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Operator (KANO), with the application to image SR. KANO provides a transparent and structured representation of the latent degradation fitting process. Specifically, we employ an additive structure composed of a finite number of B-spline functions to approximate continuous spectral curves in a piecewise fashion. By learning and optimizing the shape parameters of these spline functions within defined intervals, our KANO accurately captures key spectral characteristics, such as local linear trends and the peak-valley structures at nonlinear inflection points, thereby endowing SR results with physical interpretability. Furthermore, through theoretical modeling and experimental evaluations across natural images, aerial photographs, and satellite remote sensing data, we systematically compare multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) in handling complex sequence fitting tasks. This comparative study elucidates the respective advantages and limitations of these models in characterizing intricate degradation mechanisms, offering valuable insights for the development of interpretable SR techniques.

Abstract: Change detection plays a vital role in scene monitoring, exploration, and continual reconstruction. Existing 3D change detection methods often exhibit spatial inconsistency in the detected changes and fail to explicitly separate pre- and post-change states. To address these limitations, we propose SCaR-3D, a novel 3D scene change detection framework that identifies object-level changes from a dense-view pre-change image sequence and sparse-view post-change images. Our approach consists of a signed-distance-based 2D differencing module followed by multi-view aggregation with voting and pruning, leveraging the consistent nature of 3DGS to robustly separate pre- and post-change states. We further develop a continual scene reconstruction strategy that selectively updates dynamic regions while preserving the unchanged areas. We also contribute CCS3D, a challenging synthetic dataset that allows flexible combinations of 3D change types to support controlled evaluations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves both high accuracy and efficiency, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to estimate the relative pose and focal length between two views with known intrinsic parameters except for an unknown focal length from two affine correspondences (ACs). Cameras are commonly used in combination with inertial measurement units (IMUs) in applications such as self-driving cars, smartphones, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The vertical direction of camera views can be obtained by IMU measurements. The relative pose between two cameras is reduced from 5DOF to 3DOF. We propose a new solver to estimate the 3DOF relative pose and focal length. First, we establish constraint equations from two affine correspondences when the vertical direction is known. Then, based on the properties of the equation system with nontrivial solutions, four equations can be derived. These four equations only involve two parameters: the focal length and the relative rotation angle. Finally, the polynomial eigenvalue method is utilized to solve the problem of focal length and relative rotation angle. The proposed solver is evaluated using synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that our solver performs better than the existing state-of-the-art solvers.

Abstract: Foundation models have been successful in natural language processing and computer vision because they are capable of capturing the underlying structures (foundation) of natural languages. However, in medical imaging, the key foundation lies in human anatomy, as these images directly represent the internal structures of the body, reflecting the consistency, coherence, and hierarchy of human anatomy. Yet, existing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often overlook these perspectives, limiting their ability to effectively learn anatomical features. To overcome the limitation, we built Lamps (learning anatomy from multiple perspectives via self-supervision) pre-trained on large-scale chest radiographs by harmoniously utilizing the consistency, coherence, and hierarchy of human anatomy as the supervision signal. Extensive experiments across 10 datasets evaluated through fine-tuning and emergent property analysis demonstrate Lamps' superior robustness, transferability, and clinical potential when compared to 10 baseline models. By learning from multiple perspectives, Lamps presents a unique opportunity for foundation models to develop meaningful, robust representations that are aligned with the structure of human anatomy.

Abstract: Deep learning models are known to often learn features that spuriously correlate with the class label during training but are irrelevant to the prediction task. Existing methods typically address this issue by annotating potential spurious attributes, or filtering spurious features based on some empirical assumptions (e.g., simplicity of bias). However, these methods may yield unsatisfactory performance due to the intricate and elusive nature of spurious correlations in real-world data. In this paper, we propose a data-oriented approach to mitigate the spurious correlation in deep learning models. We observe that samples that are influenced by spurious features tend to exhibit a dispersed distribution in the learned feature space. This allows us to identify the presence of spurious features. Subsequently, we obtain a bias-invariant representation by neutralizing the spurious features based on a simple grouping strategy. Then, we learn a feature transformation to eliminate the spurious features by aligning with this bias-invariant representation. Finally, we update the classifier by incorporating the learned feature transformation and obtain an unbiased model. By integrating the aforementioned identifying, neutralizing, eliminating and updating procedures, we build an effective pipeline for mitigating spurious correlation. Experiments on image and NLP debiasing benchmarks show an improvement in worst group accuracy of more than 20% compared to standard empirical risk minimization (ERM).

Conclusion: M-ErasureBench和IRECE为构建更可靠的概念擦除生成模型提供了实用的保障措施，首次全面评估了文本提示之外的概念擦除效果。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models may generate harmful or copyrighted content, motivating research on concept erasure. However, existing approaches primarily focus on erasing concepts from text prompts, overlooking other input modalities that are increasingly critical in real-world applications such as image editing and personalized generation. These modalities can become attack surfaces, where erased concepts re-emerge despite defenses. To bridge this gap, we introduce M-ErasureBench, a novel multimodal evaluation framework that systematically benchmarks concept erasure methods across three input modalities: text prompts, learned embeddings, and inverted latents. For the latter two, we evaluate both white-box and black-box access, yielding five evaluation scenarios. Our analysis shows that existing methods achieve strong erasure performance against text prompts but largely fail under learned embeddings and inverted latents, with Concept Reproduction Rate (CRR) exceeding 90% in the white-box setting. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose IRECE (Inference-time Robustness Enhancement for Concept Erasure), a plug-and-play module that localizes target concepts via cross-attention and perturbs the associated latents during denoising. Experiments demonstrate that IRECE consistently restores robustness, reducing CRR by up to 40% under the most challenging white-box latent inversion scenario, while preserving visual quality. To the best of our knowledge, M-ErasureBench provides the first comprehensive benchmark of concept erasure beyond text prompts. Together with IRECE, our benchmark offers practical safeguards for building more reliable protective generative models.

Abstract: The recent integration of artificial intelligence into medical imaging has driven remarkable advances in automated organ segmentation. However, most existing 3D segmentation frameworks rely exclusively on visual learning from large annotated datasets restricting their adaptability to new domains and clinical tasks. The lack of semantic understanding in these models makes them ineffective in addressing flexible, user-defined segmentation objectives. To overcome these limitations, we propose SwinTF3D, a lightweight multimodal fusion approach that unifies visual and linguistic representations for text-guided 3D medical image segmentation. The model employs a transformer-based visual encoder to extract volumetric features and integrates them with a compact text encoder via an efficient fusion mechanism. This design allows the system to understand natural-language prompts and correctly align semantic cues with their corresponding spatial structures in medical volumes, while producing accurate, context-aware segmentation results with low computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the BTCV dataset demonstrate that SwinTF3D achieves competitive Dice and IoU scores across multiple organs, despite its compact architecture. The model generalizes well to unseen data and offers significant efficiency gains compared to conventional transformer-based segmentation networks. Bridging visual perception with linguistic understanding, SwinTF3D establishes a practical and interpretable paradigm for interactive, text-driven 3D medical image segmentation, opening perspectives for more adaptive and resource-efficient solutions in clinical imaging.

Conclusion: GPS通过将采样路径限制在数据流形上，解决了CFG的不稳定性问题，为迭代细化提供了稳健框架，显著提升了生成质量和语义对齐。

Abstract: Iterative refinement methods based on a denoising-inversion cycle are powerful tools for enhancing the quality and control of diffusion models. However, their effectiveness is critically limited when combined with standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). We identify a fundamental limitation: CFG's extrapolative nature systematically pushes the sampling path off the data manifold, causing the approximation error to diverge and undermining the refinement process. To address this, we propose Guided Path Sampling (GPS), a new paradigm for iterative refinement. GPS replaces unstable extrapolation with a principled, manifold-constrained interpolation, ensuring the sampling path remains on the data manifold. We theoretically prove that this correction transforms the error series from unbounded amplification to strictly bounded, guaranteeing stability. Furthermore, we devise an optimal scheduling strategy that dynamically adjusts guidance strength, aligning semantic injection with the model's natural coarse-to-fine generation process. Extensive experiments on modern backbones like SDXL and Hunyuan-DiT show that GPS outperforms existing methods in both perceptual quality and complex prompt adherence. For instance, GPS achieves a superior ImageReward of 0.79 and HPS v2 of 0.2995 on SDXL, while improving overall semantic alignment accuracy on GenEval to 57.45%. Our work establishes that path stability is a prerequisite for effective iterative refinement, and GPS provides a robust framework to achieve it.

Method: 基于输入高斯斑点的坐标识别并剪枝无效特征，仅对有效特征进行编码。

Result: 在标准化委员会定义的通用测试条件下，平均比特率比基线方法降低了8%。

Conclusion: 提出的哈希网格特征剪枝方法在不影响模型性能的情况下减少了存储需求，提升了率失真性能。

Abstract: Hash grids are widely used to learn an implicit neural field for Gaussian splatting, serving either as part of the entropy model or for inter-frame prediction. However, due to the irregular and non-uniform distribution of Gaussian splats in 3D space, numerous sparse regions exist, rendering many features in the hash grid invalid. This leads to redundant storage and transmission overhead. In this work, we propose a hash grid feature pruning method that identifies and prunes invalid features based on the coordinates of the input Gaussian splats, so that only the valid features are encoded. This approach reduces the storage size of the hash grid without compromising model performance, leading to improved rate-distortion performance. Following the Common Test Conditions (CTC) defined by the standardization committee, our method achieves an average bitrate reduction of 8% compared to the baseline approach.

Conclusion: JavisGPT通过其创新的架构和训练流程，在联合音频-视频理解和生成任务中表现出色，尤其在复杂和时间同步的场景中超越了现有的多模态大语言模型。

Abstract: This paper presents JavisGPT, the first unified multimodal large language model (MLLM) for Joint Audio-Video (JAV) comprehension and generation. JavisGPT adopts a concise encoder-LLM-decoder architecture, featuring a SyncFusion module for spatio-temporal audio-video fusion and synchrony-aware learnable queries to bridge a pretrained JAV-DiT generator. This design enables temporally coherent video-audio understanding and generation from multimodal instructions. We design an effective three-stage training pipeline consisting of multimodal pretraining, audio-video fine-tuning, and large-scale instruction-tuning, to progressively build multimodal comprehension and generation from existing vision-language models. To support this, we further construct JavisInst-Omni, a high-quality instruction dataset with over 200K GPT-4o-curated audio-video-text dialogues that span diverse and multi-level comprehension and generation scenarios. Extensive experiments on JAV comprehension and generation benchmarks show that JavisGPT outperforms existing MLLMs, particularly in complex and temporally synchronized settings.

Motivation: 解决当前基于VLM的规划器面临的三个关键挑战：离散文本推理与连续控制的不匹配、自回归链式解码的高延迟以及非因果规划器的低效性。

Method: 提出ColaVLA框架，结合认知潜在推理器（Cognitive Latent Reasoner）和分层并行规划器（Hierarchical Parallel Planner），通过两次VLM前向传递和单次前向传递生成多尺度、因果一致的轨迹。

Result: 在nuScenes基准测试中实现了开环和闭环设置下的最优性能。

Conclusion: ColaVLA在nuScenes基准测试中展示了开环和闭环设置下的最先进性能，兼具高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires generating safe and reliable trajectories from complex multimodal inputs. Traditional modular pipelines separate perception, prediction, and planning, while recent end-to-end (E2E) systems learn them jointly. Vision-language models (VLMs) further enrich this paradigm by introducing cross-modal priors and commonsense reasoning, yet current VLM-based planners face three key challenges: (i) a mismatch between discrete text reasoning and continuous control, (ii) high latency from autoregressive chain-of-thought decoding, and (iii) inefficient or non-causal planners that limit real-time deployment. We propose ColaVLA, a unified vision-language-action framework that transfers reasoning from text to a unified latent space and couples it with a hierarchical, parallel trajectory decoder. The Cognitive Latent Reasoner compresses scene understanding into compact, decision-oriented meta-action embeddings through ego-adaptive selection and only two VLM forward passes. The Hierarchical Parallel Planner then generates multi-scale, causality-consistent trajectories in a single forward pass. Together, these components preserve the generalization and interpretability of VLMs while enabling efficient, accurate and safe trajectory generation. Experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that ColaVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop settings with favorable efficiency and robustness.

Method: 设计了密度生成分支（DGB）建模物体分布模式，密集区域聚焦模块（DAFM）实现高效局部-全局特征交互，以及双滤波器融合模块（DFFM）增强多尺度特征互补性。

Conclusion: DRMNet通过密度图引导的适应性特征学习，显著提升了高密度小物体检测的性能，尤其在复杂场景中表现优异。

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing imagery increasingly contains dense clusters of tiny objects, the detection of which is extremely challenging due to severe mutual occlusion and limited pixel footprints. Existing detection methods typically allocate computational resources uniformly, failing to adaptively focus on these density-concentrated regions, which hinders feature learning effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose the Dense Region Mining Network (DRMNet), which leverages density maps as explicit spatial priors to guide adaptive feature learning. First, we design a Density Generation Branch (DGB) to model object distribution patterns, providing quantifiable priors that guide the network toward dense regions. Second, to address the computational bottleneck of global attention, our Dense Area Focusing Module (DAFM) uses these density maps to identify and focus on dense areas, enabling efficient local-global feature interaction. Finally, to mitigate feature degradation during hierarchical extraction, we introduce a Dual Filter Fusion Module (DFFM). It disentangles multi-scale features into high- and low-frequency components using a discrete cosine transform and then performs density-guided cross-attention to enhance complementarity while suppressing background interference. Extensive experiments on the AI-TOD and DTOD datasets demonstrate that DRMNet surpasses state-of-the-art methods, particularly in complex scenarios with high object density and severe occlusion.

Conclusion: CLIP-Joint-Detect框架通过结合CLIP风格的对比视觉-语言监督，显著提升了闭集检测性能，适用于多种架构和数据集，同时保持了实时推理速度。

Abstract: Conventional object detectors rely on cross-entropy classification, which can be vulnerable to class imbalance and label noise. We propose CLIP-Joint-Detect, a simple and detector-agnostic framework that integrates CLIP-style contrastive vision-language supervision through end-to-end joint training. A lightweight parallel head projects region or grid features into the CLIP embedding space and aligns them with learnable class-specific text embeddings via InfoNCE contrastive loss and an auxiliary cross-entropy term, while all standard detection losses are optimized simultaneously. The approach applies seamlessly to both two-stage and one-stage architectures. We validate it on Pascal VOC 2007+2012 using Faster R-CNN and on the large-scale MS COCO 2017 benchmark using modern YOLO detectors (YOLOv11), achieving consistent and substantial improvements while preserving real-time inference speed. Extensive experiments and ablations demonstrate that joint optimization with learnable text embeddings markedly enhances closed-set detection performance across diverse architectures and datasets.

Result: 在K-Radar基准测试中，WRCFormer在所有场景下性能提升2.4%，在雨雪场景下提升1.6%，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: WRCFormer通过结合原始雷达立方体与相机输入，利用多视角表示和几何引导的渐进融合机制，显著提升了3D物体检测性能，尤其在恶劣天气条件下表现出色。

Abstract: 4D millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar has been widely adopted in autonomous driving and robot perception due to its low cost and all-weather robustness. However, its inherent sparsity and limited semantic richness significantly constrain perception capability. Recently, fusing camera data with 4D radar has emerged as a promising cost effective solution, by exploiting the complementary strengths of the two modalities. Nevertheless, point-cloud-based radar often suffer from information loss introduced by multi-stage signal processing, while directly utilizing raw 4D radar data incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose WRCFormer, a novel 3D object detection framework that fuses raw radar cubes with camera inputs via multi-view representations of the decoupled radar cube. Specifically, we design a Wavelet Attention Module as the basic module of wavelet-based Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to enhance the representation of sparse radar signals and image data. We further introduce a two-stage query-based, modality-agnostic fusion mechanism termed Geometry-guided Progressive Fusion to efficiently integrate multi-view features from both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WRCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the K-Radar benchmarks, surpassing the best model by approximately 2.4% in all scenarios and 1.6% in the sleet scenario, highlighting its robustness under adverse weather conditions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前增量目标检测方法主要依赖Faster R-CNN或DETR系列检测器，无法适配实时YOLO检测框架，且存在灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 1) Conflict-Aware Pseudo-Label Refinement (CPR) 2) Importance-based Kernel Selection (IKS) 3) Cross-Stage Asymmetric Knowledge Distillation (CAKD)

Result: 在常规和LoCo COCO基准测试中，YOLO-IOD表现出色，遗忘最小。

Conclusion: YOLO-IOD框架通过冲突感知伪标签细化、基于重要性的内核选择和跨阶段非对称知识蒸馏，有效解决了YOLO增量目标检测中的知识冲突问题，显著减少了灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: Current methods for incremental object detection (IOD) primarily rely on Faster R-CNN or DETR series detectors; however, these approaches do not accommodate the real-time YOLO detection frameworks. In this paper, we first identify three primary types of knowledge conflicts that contribute to catastrophic forgetting in YOLO-based incremental detectors: foreground-background confusion, parameter interference, and misaligned knowledge distillation. Subsequently, we introduce YOLO-IOD, a real-time Incremental Object Detection (IOD) framework that is constructed upon the pretrained YOLO-World model, facilitating incremental learning via a stage-wise parameter-efficient fine-tuning process. Specifically, YOLO-IOD encompasses three principal components: 1) Conflict-Aware Pseudo-Label Refinement (CPR), which mitigates the foreground-background confusion by leveraging the confidence levels of pseudo labels and identifying potential objects relevant to future tasks. 2) Importancebased Kernel Selection (IKS), which identifies and updates the pivotal convolution kernels pertinent to the current task during the current learning stage. 3) Cross-Stage Asymmetric Knowledge Distillation (CAKD), which addresses the misaligned knowledge distillation conflict by transmitting the features of the student target detector through the detection heads of both the previous and current teacher detectors, thereby facilitating asymmetric distillation between existing and newly introduced categories. We further introduce LoCo COCO, a more realistic benchmark that eliminates data leakage across stages. Experiments on both conventional and LoCo COCO benchmarks show that YOLO-IOD achieves superior performance with minimal forgetting.

Conclusion: ReamCamo框架通过引入布局控制和多模态文本-视觉条件，显著提升了伪装图像生成的语义一致性和视觉逼真度，为COD任务提供了更高质量的合成数据。

Abstract: Camouflaged image generation (CIG) has recently emerged as an efficient alternative for acquiring high-quality training data for camouflaged object detection (COD). However, existing CIG methods still suffer from a substantial gap to real camouflaged imagery: generated images either lack sufficient camouflage due to weak visual similarity, or exhibit cluttered backgrounds that are semantically inconsistent with foreground targets. To address these limitations, we propose ReamCamo, a unified out-painting based framework for realistic camouflaged image generation. ReamCamo explicitly introduces additional layout controls to regulate global image structure, thereby improving semantic coherence between foreground objects and generated backgrounds. Moreover, we construct a multi-modal textual-visual condition by combining a unified fine-grained textual task description with texture-oriented background retrieval, which jointly guides the generation process to enhance visual fidelity and realism. To quantitatively assess camouflage quality, we further introduce a background-foreground distribution divergence metric that measures the effectiveness of camouflage in generated images. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

Motivation: 解决高速和低光场景下6DoF姿态估计的挑战，尤其是针对事件相机在高速度物体移动时的性能不足问题。

Method: PoseStreamer 整合了三个核心组件：自适应姿态记忆队列、以物体为中心的2D跟踪器和光线姿态过滤器。

Result: 实验证明PoseStreamer在高速移动场景下表现优异，并在未见物体上具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: PoseStreamer 在高速移动场景下不仅实现了更高的精度，还作为一个无模板框架对未见过的移动物体表现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Six degree of freedom (6DoF) pose estimation for novel objects is a critical task in computer vision, yet it faces significant challenges in high-speed and low-light scenarios where standard RGB cameras suffer from motion blur. While event cameras offer a promising solution due to their high temporal resolution, current 6DoF pose estimation methods typically yield suboptimal performance in high-speed object moving scenarios. To address this gap, we propose PoseStreamer, a robust multi-modal 6DoF pose estimation framework designed specifically on high-speed moving scenarios. Our approach integrates three core components: an Adaptive Pose Memory Queue that utilizes historical orientation cues for temporal consistency, an Object-centric 2D Tracker that provides strong 2D priors to boost 3D center recall, and a Ray Pose Filter for geometric refinement along camera rays. Furthermore, we introduce MoCapCube6D, a novel multi-modal dataset constructed to benchmark performance under rapid motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseStreamer not only achieves superior accuracy in high-speed moving scenarios, but also exhibits strong generalizability as a template-free framework for unseen moving objects.

Conclusion: OpenGround通过其ACR模块成功解决了现有3D视觉定位方法依赖预定义OLT的限制，实现了在开放世界场景中的零样本应用，并在多个数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to locate objects based on natural language descriptions in 3D scenes. Existing methods rely on a pre-defined Object Lookup Table (OLT) to query Visual Language Models (VLMs) for reasoning about object locations, which limits the applications in scenarios with undefined or unforeseen targets. To address this problem, we present OpenGround, a novel zero-shot framework for open-world 3D visual grounding. Central to OpenGround is the Active Cognition-based Reasoning (ACR) module, which is designed to overcome the fundamental limitation of pre-defined OLTs by progressively augmenting the cognitive scope of VLMs. The ACR module performs human-like perception of the target via a cognitive task chain and actively reasons about contextually relevant objects, thereby extending VLM cognition through a dynamically updated OLT. This allows OpenGround to function with both pre-defined and open-world categories. We also propose a new dataset named OpenTarget, which contains over 7000 object-description pairs to evaluate our method in open-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OpenGround achieves competitive performance on Nr3D, state-of-the-art on ScanRefer, and delivers a substantial 17.6% improvement on OpenTarget.

Conclusion: SSA框架通过对称最优传输对齐机制和复合方向引导策略，显著提升了医学图像分割的准确性，特别是在处理具有空间关系约束的病变时表现优异。

Abstract: Text-guided Medical Image Segmentation has shown considerable promise for medical image segmentation, with rich clinical text serving as an effective supplement for scarce data. However, current methods have two key bottlenecks. On one hand, they struggle to process diagnostic and descriptive texts simultaneously, making it difficult to identify lesions and establish associations with image regions. On the other hand, existing approaches focus on lesions description and fail to capture positional constraints, leading to critical deviations. Specifically, with the text "in the left lower lung", the segmentation results may incorrectly cover both sides of the lung. To address the limitations, we propose the Spatial-aware Symmetric Alignment (SSA) framework to enhance the capacity of referring hybrid medical texts consisting of locational, descriptive, and diagnostic information. Specifically, we propose symmetric optimal transport alignment mechanism to strengthen the associations between image regions and multiple relevant expressions, which establishes bi-directional fine-grained multimodal correspondences. In addition, we devise a composite directional guidance strategy that explicitly introduces spatial constraints in the text by constructing region-level guidance masks. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that SSA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, particularly in accurately segmenting lesions characterized by spatial relational constraints.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generation of realistic facial images conditioned on textual prompts and human identities, enabling creating personalized facial imagery. However, existing prompt-based methods for removing or modifying identity-specific features rely either on the subject being well-represented in the pre-trained model or require model fine-tuning for specific identities. In this work, we analyze the identity generation process and introduce a reverse personalization framework for face anonymization. Our approach leverages conditional diffusion inversion, allowing direct manipulation of images without using text prompts. To generalize beyond subjects in the model's training data, we incorporate an identity-guided conditioning branch. Unlike prior anonymization methods, which lack control over facial attributes, our framework supports attribute-controllable anonymization. We demonstrate that our method achieves a state-of-the-art balance between identity removal, attribute preservation, and image quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合MedSAM分割和深度学习的CXR分类方法，发现肺部掩码的选择应根据任务和网络架构调整，而非统一应用，以提高分类性能和筛查效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CXR成像广泛用于筛查和诊断肺部异常，但自动化解释仍面临疾病信号弱、数据集偏差和空间监督有限的挑战。医学图像分割的基础模型（MedSAM）为引入解剖学基础先验提供了机会，可能提高CXR分析的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Method: 提出了一种分割引导的CXR分类流程，集成了MedSAM作为肺部区域提取模块，随后进行多标签异常分类。MedSAM使用Airlangga大学医院的公共图像-掩码数据集进行微调，并应用于NIH CXR数据集的精选子集，训练和评估用于五种异常（Mass、Nodule、Pneumonia、Edema和Fibrosis）多标签预测的深度卷积神经网络。

Result: 实验表明，MedSAM在不同成像条件下产生解剖学上合理的肺部掩码。掩码效果既依赖于任务也依赖于架构。ResNet50在原始图像上训练实现了最强的异常区分能力，而宽松的肺部掩码产生可比的宏观AUROC，但显著提高了正常病例的筛查，表明异常特异性分类和正常病例筛查之间存在权衡。紧密掩码一致降低了异常级别性能，但提高了训练效率。宽松掩码通过保留肺门和周围上下文部分缓解了这种退化。

Conclusion: 肺部遮罩应被视为可控制的空间先验，根据主干网络和临床目标选择，而非统一应用。

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is widely used for screening and diagnosing pulmonary abnormalities, yet automated interpretation remains challenging due to weak disease signals, dataset bias, and limited spatial supervision. Foundation models for medical image segmentation (MedSAM) provide an opportunity to introduce anatomically grounded priors that may improve robustness and interpretability in CXR analysis. We propose a segmentation-guided CXR classification pipeline that integrates MedSAM as a lung region extraction module prior to multi-label abnormality classification. MedSAM is fine-tuned using a public image-mask dataset from Airlangga University Hospital. We then apply it to a curated subset of the public NIH CXR dataset to train and evaluate deep convolutional neural networks for multi-label prediction of five abnormalities (Mass, Nodule, Pneumonia, Edema, and Fibrosis), with the normal case (No Finding) evaluated via a derived score. Experiments show that MedSAM produces anatomically plausible lung masks across diverse imaging conditions. We find that masking effects are both task-dependent and architecture-dependent. ResNet50 trained on original images achieves the strongest overall abnormality discrimination, while loose lung masking yields comparable macro AUROC but significantly improves No Finding discrimination, indicating a trade-off between abnormality-specific classification and normal case screening. Tight masking consistently reduces abnormality level performance but improves training efficiency. Loose masking partially mitigates this degradation by preserving perihilar and peripheral context. These results suggest that lung masking should be treated as a controllable spatial prior selected to match the backbone and clinical objective, rather than applied uniformly.

Conclusion: PathoSyn通过解耦的解剖重建和病理偏差建模，显著提升了MRI图像合成的真实性和解剖保真度，为低数据环境下的诊断算法开发和临床决策支持系统提供了有力工具。

Abstract: We present PathoSyn, a unified generative framework for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) image synthesis that reformulates imaging-pathology as a disentangled additive deviation on a stable anatomical manifold. Current generative models typically operate in the global pixel domain or rely on binary masks, these paradigms often suffer from feature entanglement, leading to corrupted anatomical substrates or structural discontinuities. PathoSyn addresses these limitations by decomposing the synthesis task into deterministic anatomical reconstruction and stochastic deviation modeling. Central to our framework is a Deviation-Space Diffusion Model designed to learn the conditional distribution of pathological residuals, thereby capturing localized intensity variations while preserving global structural integrity by construction. To ensure spatial coherence, the diffusion process is coupled with a seam-aware fusion strategy and an inference-time stabilization module, which collectively suppress boundary artifacts and produce high-fidelity internal lesion heterogeneity. PathoSyn provides a mathematically principled pipeline for generating high-fidelity patient-specific synthetic datasets, facilitating the development of robust diagnostic algorithms in low-data regimes. By allowing interpretable counterfactual disease progression modeling, the framework supports precision intervention planning and provides a controlled environment for benchmarking clinical decision-support systems. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on tumor imaging benchmarks demonstrate that PathoSyn significantly outperforms holistic diffusion and mask-conditioned baselines in both perceptual realism and anatomical fidelity. The source code of this work will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 本文提出Geo-Semantic Contextual Graph (GSCG)框架，通过显式结构和可解释的上下文信息显著提升物体分类性能，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过丰富的场景理解（如空间关系、材质属性和物体共现）轻松识别物体，而现有计算系统往往忽略这些关键上下文信息。本文旨在填补这一差距。

Method: 通过构建Geo-Semantic Contextual Graph (GSCG)，整合深度估计和全景及材质分割模型，将物体表示为节点，空间关系表示为边，并提出基于图的分类器聚合目标物体、邻近物体及全局场景的特征进行分类。

Result: GSCG框架在COCO 2017数据集上达到73.4%的分类准确率，显著优于无上下文版本（最低38.4%）、微调ResNet模型（最高53.5%）及多模态大语言模型Llama 4 Scout（最高42.3%）。

Conclusion: 本文提出的Geo-Semantic Contextual Graph (GSCG)框架显著提升了物体分类的准确性，证明了显式结构和可解释的上下文信息在物体识别任务中的优越性。

Abstract: Humans effortlessly identify objects by leveraging a rich understanding of the surrounding scene, including spatial relationships, material properties, and the co-occurrence of other objects. In contrast, most computational object recognition systems operate on isolated image regions, devoid of meaning in isolation, thus ignoring this vital contextual information. This paper argues for the critical role of context and introduces a novel framework for contextual object classification. We first construct a Geo-Semantic Contextual Graph (GSCG) from a single monocular image. This rich, structured representation is built by integrating a metric depth estimator with a unified panoptic and material segmentation model. The GSCG encodes objects as nodes with detailed geometric, chromatic, and material attributes, and their spatial relationships as edges. This explicit graph structure makes the model's reasoning process inherently interpretable. We then propose a specialized graph-based classifier that aggregates features from a target object, its immediate neighbors, and the global scene context to predict its class. Through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that our context-aware model achieves a classification accuracy of 73.4%, dramatically outperforming context-agnostic versions (as low as 38.4%). Furthermore, our GSCG-based approach significantly surpasses strong baselines, including fine-tuned ResNet models (max 53.5%) and a state-of-the-art multimodal Large Language Model (LLM), Llama 4 Scout, which, even when given the full image alongside a detailed description of objects, maxes out at 42.3%. These results on COCO 2017 train/val splits highlight the superiority of explicitly structured and interpretable context for object recognition tasks.

Abstract: This research proposes "ForCM", a novel approach to forest cover mapping that combines Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) with Deep Learning (DL) using multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery. The study explores several DL models, including UNet, UNet++, ResUNet, AttentionUNet, and ResNet50-Segnet, applied to high-resolution Sentinel-2 Level 2A satellite images of the Amazon Rainforest.

Motivation: 军事目标检测在多变环境中面临挑战，现有方法主要针对自然或自动驾驶场景，且SAR数据成本高，RGB相机是一种低成本替代方案但缺乏数据集。

Method: 使用Unreal Engine生成基于RGB的合成数据，并进行合成到真实的迁移实验，比较了不同监督程度的领域自适应方法。

Result: 实验表明，使用最少图像提示（如对象类别）的当前方法在无监督或半监督DA方法上取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 论文指出，尽管当前领域自适应方法在军事目标检测中取得了一定进展，但仍存在挑战需要克服，特别是在多变的军事环境中。

Abstract: Object detection is one of the key target tasks of interest in the context of civil and military applications. In particular, the real-world deployment of target detection methods is pivotal in the decision-making process during military command and reconnaissance. However, current domain adaptive object detection algorithms consider adapting one domain to another similar one only within the scope of natural or autonomous driving scenes. Since military domains often deal with a mixed variety of environments, detecting objects from multiple varying target domains poses a greater challenge. Several studies for armored military target detection have made use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data due to its robustness to all weather, long range, and high-resolution characteristics. Nevertheless, the costs of SAR data acquisition and processing are still much higher than those of the conventional RGB camera, which is a more affordable alternative with significantly lower data processing time. Furthermore, the lack of military target detection datasets limits the use of such a low-cost approach. To mitigate these issues, we propose to generate RGB-based synthetic data using a photorealistic visual tool, Unreal Engine, for military target detection in a cross-domain setting. To this end, we conducted synthetic-to-real transfer experiments by training our synthetic dataset and validating on our web-collected real military target datasets. We benchmark the state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods distinguished by the degree of supervision on our proposed train-val dataset pair, and find that current methods using minimal hints on the image (e.g., object class) achieve a substantial improvement over unsupervised or semi-supervised DA methods. From these observations, we recognize the current challenges that remain to be overcome.

Conclusion: Co2S框架通过结合视觉语言模型和自我监督模型的先验知识，有效解决了半监督遥感图像语义分割中的伪标签漂移问题，并在多个数据集上展示了其优越性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised remote sensing (RS) image semantic segmentation offers a promising solution to alleviate the burden of exhaustive annotation, yet it fundamentally struggles with pseudo-label drift, a phenomenon where confirmation bias leads to the accumulation of errors during training. In this work, we propose Co2S, a stable semi-supervised RS segmentation framework that synergistically fuses priors from vision-language models and self-supervised models. Specifically, we construct a heterogeneous dual-student architecture comprising two distinct ViT-based vision foundation models initialized with pretrained CLIP and DINOv3 to mitigate error accumulation and pseudo-label drift. To effectively incorporate these distinct priors, an explicit-implicit semantic co-guidance mechanism is introduced that utilizes text embeddings and learnable queries to provide explicit and implicit class-level guidance, respectively, thereby jointly enhancing semantic consistency. Furthermore, a global-local feature collaborative fusion strategy is developed to effectively fuse the global contextual information captured by CLIP with the local details produced by DINOv3, enabling the model to generate highly precise segmentation results. Extensive experiments on six popular datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, which consistently achieves leading performance across various partition protocols and diverse scenarios.

Motivation: 时尚物品检测因外观多样性和子类别相似性而存在歧义，传统独立检测方法无法有效利用物品间的上下文关系。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的Holistic Detection Transformer（Holi-DETR），通过整合三种异构上下文信息（共现概率、物品间空间排列、物品与人体关键点的关系）来检测时尚物品。

Result: 实验表明，Holi-DETR在平均精度（AP）上分别比vanilla DETR和Co-DETR提升了3.6和1.1个百分点。

Conclusion: Holi-DETR通过整合三种上下文信息（共现关系、相对位置与大小、与人体关键点的空间关系），显著提升了时尚物品检测的性能，优于传统检测器和现有先进模型。

Abstract: Fashion item detection is challenging due to the ambiguities introduced by the highly diverse appearances of fashion items and the similarities among item subcategories. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Holistic Detection Transformer (Holi-DETR) that detects fashion items in outfit images holistically, by leveraging contextual information. Fashion items often have meaningful relationships as they are combined to create specific styles. Unlike conventional detectors that detect each item independently, Holi-DETR detects multiple items while reducing ambiguities by leveraging three distinct types of contextual information: (1) the co-occurrence relationship between fashion items, (2) the relative position and size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) the spatial relationships between items and human body key-points. %Holi-DETR explicitly incorporates three types of contextual information: (1) the co-occurrence probability between fashion items, (2) the relative position and size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) the spatial relationships between items and human body key-points. To this end, we propose a novel architecture that integrates these three types of heterogeneous contextual information into the Detection Transformer (DETR) and its subsequent models. In experiments, the proposed methods improved the performance of the vanilla DETR and the more recently developed Co-DETR by 3.6 percent points (pp) and 1.1 pp, respectively, in terms of average precision (AP).

Motivation: To address the high cost and labor intensity of collecting large-scale 3D scene scans by exploring learning 3D representations from unlabeled videos.

Method: Laplacian-Aware Multi-level 3D Clustering with Sinkhorn-Knopp (LAM3C), a self-supervised framework learning from video-generated point clouds, including a noise-regularized loss for stability.

Result: LAM3C outperforms previous self-supervised methods on indoor semantic and instance segmentation without using real 3D scans.

Conclusion: LAM3C demonstrates that unlabeled videos can serve as a valuable data source for 3D self-supervised learning, achieving superior performance without real 3D scans.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D self-supervised learning, collecting large-scale 3D scene scans remains expensive and labor-intensive. In this work, we investigate whether 3D representations can be learned from unlabeled videos recorded without any real 3D sensors. We present Laplacian-Aware Multi-level 3D Clustering with Sinkhorn-Knopp (LAM3C), a self-supervised framework that learns from video-generated point clouds from unlabeled videos. We first introduce RoomTours, a video-generated point cloud dataset constructed by collecting room-walkthrough videos from the web (e.g., real-estate tours) and generating 49,219 scenes using an off-the-shelf feed-forward reconstruction model. We also propose a noise-regularized loss that stabilizes representation learning by enforcing local geometric smoothness and ensuring feature stability under noisy point clouds. Remarkably, without using any real 3D scans, LAM3C achieves higher performance than the previous self-supervised methods on indoor semantic and instance segmentation. These results suggest that unlabeled videos represent an abundant source of data for 3D self-supervised learning.

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a vital role in industrial manufacturing. Due to the scarcity of real defect images, unsupervised approaches that rely solely on normal images have been extensively studied. Recently, diffusion-based generative models brought attention to training data synthesis as an alternative solution. In this work, we focus on a strategy to effectively leverage synthetic images to maximize the anomaly detection performance. Previous synthesis strategies are broadly categorized into two groups, presenting a clear trade-off. Rule-based synthesis, such as injecting noise or pasting patches, is cost-effective but often fails to produce realistic defect images. On the other hand, generative model-based synthesis can create high-quality defect images but requires substantial cost. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained text-guided image-to-image translation model and image retrieval model to efficiently generate synthetic defect images. Specifically, the image retrieval model assesses the similarity of the generated images to real normal images and filters out irrelevant outputs, thereby enhancing the quality and relevance of the generated defect images. To effectively leverage synthetic images, we also introduce a two stage training strategy. In this strategy, the model is first pre-trained on a large volume of images from rule-based synthesis and then fine-tuned on a smaller set of high-quality images. This method significantly reduces the cost for data collection while improving the anomaly detection performance. Experiments on the MVTec AD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: Video-BrowseComp 是首个针对开放式网络视频研究的基准测试，推动了从被动感知到主动视频推理的领域发展。

Abstract: The evolution of autonomous agents is redefining information seeking, transitioning from passive retrieval to proactive, open-ended web research. However, while textual and static multimodal agents have seen rapid progress, a significant modality gap remains in processing the web's most dynamic modality: video. Existing video benchmarks predominantly focus on passive perception, feeding curated clips to models without requiring external retrieval. They fail to evaluate agentic video research, which necessitates actively interrogating video timelines, cross-referencing dispersed evidence, and verifying claims against the open web. To bridge this gap, we present \textbf{Video-BrowseComp}, a challenging benchmark comprising 210 questions tailored for open-web agentic video reasoning. Unlike prior benchmarks, Video-BrowseComp enforces a mandatory dependency on temporal visual evidence, ensuring that answers cannot be derived solely through text search but require navigating video timelines to verify external claims. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals a critical bottleneck: even advanced search-augmented models like GPT-5.1 (w/ Search) achieve only 15.24\% accuracy. Our analysis reveals that these models largely rely on textual proxies, excelling in metadata-rich domains (e.g., TV shows with plot summaries) but collapsing in metadata-sparse, dynamic environments (e.g., sports, gameplay) where visual grounding is essential. As the first open-web video research benchmark, Video-BrowseComp advances the field beyond passive perception toward proactive video reasoning.

Abstract: Detecting infrared gas leaks is critical for environmental monitoring and industrial safety, yet remains difficult because plumes are faint, small, semitransparent, and have weak, diffuse boundaries. We present physics-edge hybrid gas dynamic routing network (PEG-DRNet). First, we introduce the Gas Block, a diffusion-convection unit modeling gas transport: a local branch captures short-range variations, while a large-kernel branch captures long-range propagation. An edge-gated learnable fusion module balances local detail and global context, strengthening weak-contrast plume and contour cues. Second, we propose the adaptive gradient and phase edge operator (AGPEO), computing reliable edge priors from multi-directional gradients and phase-consistent responses. These are transformed by a multi-scale edge perception module (MSEPM) into hierarchical edge features that reinforce boundaries. Finally, the content-adaptive sparse routing path aggregation network (CASR-PAN), with adaptive information modulation modules for fusion and self, selectively propagates informative features across scales based on edge and content cues, improving cross-scale discriminability while reducing redundancy. Experiments on the IIG dataset show that PEG-DRNet achieves an overall AP of 29.8\%, an AP$_{50}$ of 84.3\%, and a small-object AP of 25.3\%, surpassing the RT-DETR-R18 baseline by 3.0\%, 6.5\%, and 5.3\%, respectively, while requiring only 43.7 Gflops and 14.9 M parameters. The proposed PEG-DRNet achieves superior overall performance with the best balance of accuracy and computational efficiency, outperforming existing CNN and Transformer detectors in AP and AP$_{50}$ on the IIG and LangGas dataset.

Conclusion: ViLaCD-R1通过两阶段框架显著提升了遥感变化检测的语义识别和定位能力，有效抑制了非语义变化，并在复杂现实场景中达到了最先进的准确率。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD), a complex multi-image inference task, traditionally uses pixel-based operators or encoder-decoder networks that inadequately capture high-level semantics and are vulnerable to non-semantic perturbations. Although recent multimodal and vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches enhance semantic understanding of change regions by incorporating textual descriptions, they still suffer from challenges such as inaccurate spatial localization, imprecise pixel-level boundary delineation, and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose ViLaCD-R1, a two-stage framework comprising a Multi-Image Reasoner (MIR) and a Mask-Guided Decoder (MGD). Specifically, the VLM is trained through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) on block-level dual-temporal inference tasks, taking dual-temporal image patches as input and outputting a coarse change mask. Then, the decoder integrates dual-temporal image features with this coarse mask to predict a precise binary change map. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple RSCD benchmarks demonstrate that ViLaCD-R1 substantially improves true semantic change recognition and localization, robustly suppresses non-semantic variations, and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced deformable image registration, surpassing traditional optimization-based methods in both accuracy and efficiency. However, learning-based models are widely believed to be sensitive to domain shift, with robustness typically pursued through large and diverse training datasets, without explaining the underlying mechanisms. In this work, we show that domain-shift immunity is an inherent property of deep deformable registration models, arising from their reliance on local feature representations rather than global appearance for deformation estimation. To isolate and validate this mechanism, we introduce UniReg, a universal registration framework that decouples feature extraction from deformation estimation using fixed, pre-trained feature extractors and a UNet-based deformation network. Despite training on a single dataset, UniReg exhibits robust cross-domain and multi-modal performance comparable to optimization-based methods. Our analysis further reveals that failures of conventional CNN-based models under modality shift originate from dataset-induced biases in early convolutional layers. These findings identify local feature consistency as the key driver of robustness in learning-based deformable registration and motivate backbone designs that preserve domain-invariant local features.

Some previous methods have shown substantial improvements by either employing heterogeneous teacher models to provide high-quality pseudo labels or enforcing feature-perspective consistency between the teacher and student networks. However, these methods overlook the fact that the model usually tends to exhibit low sensitivity to object geometries with limited labeled data, making it difficult to capture geometric information, which is crucial for enhancing the student model's ability in object perception and localization. In this paper, we propose GeoTeacher to enhance the student model's ability to capture geometric relations of objects with limited training data, especially unlabeled data. We design a keypoint-based geometric relation supervision module that transfers the teacher model's knowledge of object geometry to the student, thereby improving the student's capability in understanding geometric relations. Furthermore, we introduce a voxel-wise data augmentation strategy that increases the diversity of object geometries, thereby further improving the student model's ability to comprehend geometric structures. To preserve the integrity of distant objects during augmentation, we incorporate a distance-decay mechanism into this strategy. Moreover, GeoTeacher can be combined with different SS3D methods to further improve their performance. Extensive experiments on the ONCE and Waymo datasets indicate the effectiveness and generalization of our method and we achieve the new state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: SoulX-LiveTalk 是一个14B参数的框架，通过自校正双向蒸馏策略和多步回顾自校正机制，实现了高保真实时流式生成，并在计算负载和延迟约束之间取得了平衡。

Abstract: Deploying massive diffusion models for real-time, infinite-duration, audio-driven avatar generation presents a significant engineering challenge, primarily due to the conflict between computational load and strict latency constraints. Existing approaches often compromise visual fidelity by enforcing strictly unidirectional attention mechanisms or reducing model capacity. To address this problem, we introduce \textbf{SoulX-LiveTalk}, a 14B-parameter framework optimized for high-fidelity real-time streaming. Diverging from conventional unidirectional paradigms, we use a \textbf{Self-correcting Bidirectional Distillation} strategy that retains bidirectional attention within video chunks. This design preserves critical spatiotemporal correlations, significantly enhancing motion coherence and visual detail. To ensure stability during infinite generation, we incorporate a \textbf{Multi-step Retrospective Self-Correction Mechanism}, enabling the model to autonomously recover from accumulated errors and preventing collapse. Furthermore, we engineered a full-stack inference acceleration suite incorporating hybrid sequence parallelism, Parallel VAE, and kernel-level optimizations. Extensive evaluations confirm that SoulX-LiveTalk is the first 14B-scale system to achieve a \textbf{sub-second start-up latency (0.87s)} while reaching a real-time throughput of \textbf{32 FPS}, setting a new standard for high-fidelity interactive digital human synthesis.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像（T2I）模型的评估方法缺乏细粒度可解释性，难以反映人类偏好，因此需要一种更精细的对齐评估框架。

Method: 采用基于强化学习的Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）和复合奖励函数，结合结构化范式（grounding-reasoning-conclusion），利用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）进行显式语义元素定位和可解释对齐判断。

Result: 在四个基准测试（EvalMuse-40K、RichHF、MHaluBench和GenAI-Bench）中，REVEALER表现优于现有专有模型和监督基线，并展示了更高的推理效率。

Conclusion: REVEALER框架通过强化引导的视觉推理，在元素级对齐评估中实现了最先进的性能，并在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Evaluating the alignment between textual prompts and generated images is critical for ensuring the reliability and usability of text-to-image (T2I) models. However, most existing evaluation methods rely on coarse-grained metrics or static QA pipelines, which lack fine-grained interpretability and struggle to reflect human preferences. To address this, we propose REVEALER, a unified framework for element-level alignment evaluation based on reinforcement-guided visual reasoning. Adopting a structured "grounding-reasoning-conclusion" paradigm, our method enables Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to explicitly localize semantic elements and derive interpretable alignment judgments. We optimize the model via Group Relative Policy Optimization(GRPO) using a composite reward function that incorporates structural format, grounding accuracy, and alignment fidelity. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks-EvalMuse-40K, RichHF, MHaluBench, and GenAI-Bench-demonstrate that REVEALER achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our approach consistently outperforms both strong proprietary models and supervised baselines while demonstrating superior inference efficiency compared to existing iterative visual reasoning methods.

Conclusion: GVSynergy-Det通过高斯-体素协同表示学习，显著提升了基于图像的3D物体检测性能，无需深度或密集3D几何监督。

Abstract: Image-based 3D object detection aims to identify and localize objects in 3D space using only RGB images, eliminating the need for expensive depth sensors required by point cloud-based methods. Existing image-based approaches face two critical challenges: methods achieving high accuracy typically require dense 3D supervision, while those operating without such supervision struggle to extract accurate geometry from images alone. In this paper, we present GVSynergy-Det, a novel framework that enhances 3D detection through synergistic Gaussian-Voxel representation learning. Our key insight is that continuous Gaussian and discrete voxel representations capture complementary geometric information: Gaussians excel at modeling fine-grained surface details while voxels provide structured spatial context. We introduce a dual-representation architecture that: 1) adapts generalizable Gaussian Splatting to extract complementary geometric features for detection tasks, and 2) develops a cross-representation enhancement mechanism that enriches voxel features with geometric details from Gaussian fields. Unlike previous methods that either rely on time-consuming per-scene optimization or utilize Gaussian representations solely for depth regularization, our synergistic strategy directly leverages features from both representations through learnable integration, enabling more accurate object localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GVSynergy-Det achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging indoor benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing methods on both ScanNetV2 and ARKitScenes datasets, all without requiring any depth or dense 3D geometry supervision (e.g., point clouds or TSDF).

Abstract: Monitoring states of road surfaces provides valuable information for the planning and controlling vehicles and active vehicle control systems. Classical road monitoring methods are expensive and unsystematic because they require time for measurements. This article proposes an real time system based on weather conditional data and road surface condition data. For this purpose, we collected data with a mobile phone camera on the roads around the campus of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. We tested a large number of different image-based deep learning algorithms for road classification. In addition, we used road acceleration data along with road image data for training by using them as images. We compared the performances of acceleration-based and camera image-based approaches. The performances of the simple Alexnet, LeNet, VGG, and Resnet algorithms were compared as deep learning algorithms. For road condition classification, 5 classes were considered: asphalt, damaged asphalt, gravel road, damaged gravel road, pavement road and over 95% accuracy performance was achieved. It is also proposed to use the acceleration or the camera image to classify the road surface according to the weather and the time of day using fuzzy logic.

Abstract: Driving World Models (DWMs) have been developing rapidly with the advances of generative models. However, existing DWMs lack 3D scene understanding capabilities and can only generate content conditioned on input data, without the ability to interpret or reason about the driving environment. Moreover, current approaches represent 3D spatial information with point cloud or BEV features do not accurately align textual information with the underlying 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified DWM framework based on 3D Gaussian scene representation, which enables both 3D scene understanding and multi-modal scene generation, while also enabling contextual enrichment for understanding and generation tasks. Our approach directly aligns textual information with the 3D scene by embedding rich linguistic features into each Gaussian primitive, thereby achieving early modality alignment. In addition, we design a novel task-aware language-guided sampling strategy that removes redundant 3D Gaussians and injects accurate and compact 3D tokens into LLM. Furthermore, we design a dual-condition multi-modal generation model, where the information captured by our vision-language model is leveraged as a high-level language condition in combination with a low-level image condition, jointly guiding the multi-modal generation process. We conduct comprehensive studies on the nuScenes, and NuInteract datasets to validate the effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. We will release the code publicly on GitHub https://github.com/dtc111111/GaussianDWM.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多模态理解和生成方面取得了显著进展，但仍倾向于产生与视觉输入不一致的幻觉内容，限制了其在现实应用中的可靠性。

Method: CoFi-Dec 首先生成基于图像粗粒度和细粒度视图的中间文本响应，然后通过文本到图像模型将这些响应转换为合成图像，形成多级视觉假设。通过 Wasserstein 基础的融合机制，将这些预测统一为一个几何一致的解码轨迹。

Conclusion: CoFi-Dec 是一个无需训练的解码框架，通过生成自我反馈和粗到细的视觉条件集成，显著减少了大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）中的幻觉内容，提高了输出的可靠性和一致性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multi-modal understanding and generation. However, they still tend to produce hallucinated content that is inconsistent with the visual input, which limits their reliability in real-world applications. We propose \textbf{CoFi-Dec}, a training-free decoding framework that mitigates hallucinations by integrating generative self-feedback with coarse-to-fine visual conditioning. Inspired by the human visual process from global scene perception to detailed inspection, CoFi-Dec first generates two intermediate textual responses conditioned on coarse- and fine-grained views of the original image. These responses are then transformed into synthetic images using a text-to-image model, forming multi-level visual hypotheses that enrich grounding cues. To unify the predictions from these multiple visual conditions, we introduce a Wasserstein-based fusion mechanism that aligns their predictive distributions into a geometrically consistent decoding trajectory. This principled fusion reconciles high-level semantic consistency with fine-grained visual grounding, leading to more robust and faithful outputs. Extensive experiments on six hallucination-focused benchmarks show that CoFi-Dec substantially reduces both entity-level and semantic-level hallucinations, outperforming existing decoding strategies. The framework is model-agnostic, requires no additional training, and can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of LVLMs. The implementation is available at https://github.com/AI-Researcher-Team/CoFi-Dec.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的任务感知时间步选择（TTS）和时间步特征整合（TFC）模块，结合参数高效的微调适配器，显著提升了少样本密集预测任务的性能。

Abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models have brought tremendous advances in generative tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance thus far. Current diffusion model-based applications exploit the power of learned visual representations from multistep forward-backward Markovian processes for single-task prediction tasks by attaching a task-specific decoder. However, the heuristic selection of diffusion timestep features still heavily relies on empirical intuition, often leading to sub-optimal performance biased towards certain tasks. To alleviate this constraint, we investigate the significance of versatile diffusion timestep features by adaptively selecting timesteps best suited for the few-shot dense prediction task, evaluated on an arbitrary unseen task. To this end, we propose two modules: Task-aware Timestep Selection (TTS) to select ideal diffusion timesteps based on timestep-wise losses and similarity scores, and Timestep Feature Consolidation (TFC) to consolidate the selected timestep features to improve the dense predictive performance in a few-shot setting. Accompanied by our parameter-efficient fine-tuning adapter, our framework effectively achieves superiority in dense prediction performance given only a few support queries. We empirically validate our learnable timestep consolidation method on the large-scale challenging Taskonomy dataset for dense prediction, particularly for practical universal and few-shot learning scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-subject customization aims to synthesize multiple user-specified subjects into a coherent image. To address issues such as subjects missing or conflicts, recent works incorporate layout guidance to provide explicit spatial constraints. However, existing methods still struggle to balance three critical objectives: text alignment, subject identity preservation, and layout control, while the reliance on additional training further limits their scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we present AnyMS, a novel training-free framework for layout-guided multi-subject customization. AnyMS leverages three input conditions: text prompt, subject images, and layout constraints, and introduces a bottom-up dual-level attention decoupling mechanism to harmonize their integration during generation. Specifically, global decoupling separates cross-attention between textual and visual conditions to ensure text alignment. Local decoupling confines each subject's attention to its designated area, which prevents subject conflicts and thus guarantees identity preservation and layout control. Moreover, AnyMS employs pre-trained image adapters to extract subject-specific features aligned with the diffusion model, removing the need for subject learning or adapter tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnyMS achieves state-of-the-art performance, supporting complex compositions and scaling to a larger number of subjects.

Conclusion: AVOID数据集为实时障碍物检测提供了全面的多任务支持，尤其在恶劣条件下表现优异。

Abstract: Understanding road scenes for visual perception remains crucial for intelligent self-driving cars. In particular, it is desirable to detect unexpected small road hazards reliably in real-time, especially under varying adverse conditions (e.g., weather and daylight). However, existing road driving datasets provide large-scale images acquired in either normal or adverse scenarios only, and often do not contain the road obstacles captured in the same visual domain as for the other classes. To address this, we introduce a new dataset called AVOID, the Adverse Visual Conditions Dataset, for real-time obstacle detection collected in a simulated environment. AVOID consists of a large set of unexpected road obstacles located along each path captured under various weather and time conditions. Each image is coupled with the corresponding semantic and depth maps, raw and semantic LiDAR data, and waypoints, thereby supporting most visual perception tasks. We benchmark the results on high-performing real-time networks for the obstacle detection task, and also propose and conduct ablation studies using a comprehensive multi-task network for semantic segmentation, depth and waypoint prediction tasks.

Method: 通过构建MM-UAVBench，一个包含19个子任务和超过5.7K手动标注问题的综合基准，系统评估MLLM在低空无人机场景中的感知、认知和规划能力。

Result: 对16个开源和专有MLLM的广泛实验表明，当前模型难以适应低空场景的复杂视觉和认知需求，分析还揭示了空间偏见和多视角理解等关键瓶颈。

Conclusion: MM-UAVBench的提出旨在促进未来针对无人机场景的稳健和可靠MLLM研究。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited remarkable general intelligence across diverse domains, their potential in low-altitude applications dominated by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) remains largely underexplored. Existing MLLM benchmarks rarely cover the unique challenges of low-altitude scenarios, while UAV-related evaluations mainly focus on specific tasks such as localization or navigation, without a unified evaluation of MLLMs'general intelligence. To bridge this gap, we present MM-UAVBench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates MLLMs across three core capability dimensions-perception, cognition, and planning-in low-altitude UAV scenarios. MM-UAVBench comprises 19 sub-tasks with over 5.7K manually annotated questions, all derived from real-world UAV data collected from public datasets. Extensive experiments on 16 open-source and proprietary MLLMs reveal that current models struggle to adapt to the complex visual and cognitive demands of low-altitude scenarios. Our analyses further uncover critical bottlenecks such as spatial bias and multi-view understanding that hinder the effective deployment of MLLMs in UAV scenarios. We hope MM-UAVBench will foster future research on robust and reliable MLLMs for real-world UAV intelligence.

Abstract: Recent pathological foundation models have substantially advanced visual representation learning and multimodal interaction. However, most models still rely on a static inference paradigm in which whole-slide images are processed once to produce predictions, without reassessment or targeted evidence acquisition under ambiguous diagnoses. This contrasts with clinical diagnostic workflows that refine hypotheses through repeated slide observations and further examination requests. We propose PathFound, an agentic multimodal model designed to support evidence-seeking inference in pathological diagnosis. PathFound integrates the power of pathological visual foundation models, vision-language models, and reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning to perform proactive information acquisition and diagnosis refinement by progressing through the initial diagnosis, evidence-seeking, and final decision stages. Across several large multimodal models, adopting this strategy consistently improves diagnostic accuracy, indicating the effectiveness of evidence-seeking workflows in computational pathology. Among these models, PathFound achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance across diverse clinical scenarios and demonstrates strong potential to discover subtle details, such as nuclear features and local invasions.

Abstract: The integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into chemistry promises to revolutionize scientific discovery, yet their ability to comprehend the dense, graphical language of reactions within authentic literature remains underexplored. Here, we introduce RxnBench, a multi-tiered benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate MLLMs on chemical reaction understanding from scientific PDFs. RxnBench comprises two tasks: Single-Figure QA (SF-QA), which tests fine-grained visual perception and mechanistic reasoning using 1,525 questions derived from 305 curated reaction schemes, and Full-Document QA (FD-QA), which challenges models to synthesize information from 108 articles, requiring cross-modal integration of text, schemes, and tables. Our evaluation of MLLMs reveals a critical capability gap: while models excel at extracting explicit text, they struggle with deep chemical logic and precise structural recognition. Notably, models with inference-time reasoning significantly outperform standard architectures, yet none achieve 50\% accuracy on FD-QA. These findings underscore the urgent need for domain-specific visual encoders and stronger reasoning engines to advance autonomous AI chemists.

Conclusion: UniMAGE通过统一的导演模型，成功将剧本起草和关键镜头设计整合到一个框架中，显著提升了非专业人士制作长上下文、多镜头电影的能力。

Abstract: Existing AI-driven video creation systems typically treat script drafting and key-shot design as two disjoint tasks: the former relies on large language models, while the latter depends on image generation models. We argue that these two tasks should be unified within a single framework, as logical reasoning and imaginative thinking are both fundamental qualities of a film director. In this work, we propose UniMAGE, a unified director model that bridges user prompts with well-structured scripts, thereby empowering non-experts to produce long-context, multi-shot films by leveraging existing audio-video generation models. To achieve this, we employ the Mixture-of-Transformers architecture that unifies text and image generation. To further enhance narrative logic and keyframe consistency, we introduce a ``first interleaving, then disentangling'' training paradigm. Specifically, we first perform Interleaved Concept Learning, which utilizes interleaved text-image data to foster the model's deeper understanding and imaginative interpretation of scripts. We then conduct Disentangled Expert Learning, which decouples script writing from keyframe generation, enabling greater flexibility and creativity in storytelling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniMAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models, generating logically coherent video scripts and visually consistent keyframe images.

Method: SGPS结合了Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE)梯度更新和PCA噪声估计，以校正采样轨迹偏差。

Result: 在多种逆问题上的广泛评估表明，SGPS在低NFE计数下始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SGPS通过SURE梯度更新和PCA噪声估计有效减少了采样轨迹偏差，显著降低了误差累积，从而在少于100次NFE的情况下仍能保持高质量重建。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful learned priors for solving inverse problems. However, current iterative solving approaches which alternate between diffusion sampling and data consistency steps typically require hundreds or thousands of steps to achieve high quality reconstruction due to accumulated errors. We address this challenge with SURE Guided Posterior Sampling (SGPS), a method that corrects sampling trajectory deviations using Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE) gradient updates and PCA based noise estimation. By mitigating noise induced errors during the critical early and middle sampling stages, SGPS enables more accurate posterior sampling and reduces error accumulation. This allows our method to maintain high reconstruction quality with fewer than 100 Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs). Our extensive evaluation across diverse inverse problems demonstrates that SGPS consistently outperforms existing methods at low NFE counts.

Abstract: Diffusion-based remote sensing (RS) generative foundation models are cruial for downstream tasks. However, these models rely on large amounts of globally representative data, which often contain redundancy, noise, and class imbalance, reducing training efficiency and preventing convergence. Existing RS diffusion foundation models typically aggregate multiple classification datasets or apply simplistic deduplication, overlooking the distributional requirements of generation modeling and the heterogeneity of RS imagery. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free, two-stage data pruning approach that quickly select a high-quality subset under high pruning ratios, enabling a preliminary foundation model to converge rapidly and serve as a versatile backbone for generation, downstream fine-tuning, and other applications. Our method jointly considers local information content with global scene-level diversity and representativeness. First, an entropy-based criterion efficiently removes low-information samples. Next, leveraging RS scene classification datasets as reference benchmarks, we perform scene-aware clustering with stratified sampling to improve clustering effectiveness while reducing computational costs on large-scale unlabeled data. Finally, by balancing cluster-level uniformity and sample representativeness, the method enables fine-grained selection under high pruning ratios while preserving overall diversity and representativeness. Experiments show that, even after pruning 85\% of the training data, our method significantly improves convergence and generation quality. Furthermore, diffusion foundation models trained with our method consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance across downstream tasks, including super-resolution and semantic image synthesis. This data pruning paradigm offers practical guidance for developing RS generative foundation models.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion of remote sensing images serves as a core technology for overcoming the limitations of single-source data and improving the accuracy of surface information extraction, which exhibits significant application value in fields such as environmental monitoring and urban planning. To address the deficiencies of existing methods, including the failure of fixed resolutions to balance efficiency and detail, as well as the lack of semantic hierarchy in single-scale alignment, this study proposes a Vision-language Model (VLM) framework integrated with two key innovations: the Dynamic Resolution Input Strategy (DRIS) and the Multi-scale Vision-language Alignment Mechanism (MS-VLAM).Specifically, the DRIS adopts a coarse-to-fine approach to adaptively allocate computational resources according to the complexity of image content, thereby preserving key fine-grained features while reducing redundant computational overhead. The MS-VLAM constructs a three-tier alignment mechanism covering object, local-region and global levels, which systematically captures cross-modal semantic consistency and alleviates issues of semantic misalignment and granularity imbalance.Experimental results on the RS-GPT4V dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the accuracy of semantic understanding and computational efficiency in tasks including image captioning and cross-modal retrieval. Compared with conventional methods, it achieves superior performance in evaluation metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr for image captioning, as well as R@10 for cross-modal retrieval. This technical framework provides a novel approach for constructing efficient and robust multimodal remote sensing systems, laying a theoretical foundation and offering technical guidance for the engineering application of intelligent remote sensing interpretation.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved visual quality and text alignment. However, generating a sequence of images while preserving consistent character identity across diverse scene descriptions remains a challenging task. Existing methods often struggle with a trade-off between maintaining identity consistency and ensuring per-image prompt alignment. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, ASemconsist, that addresses this challenge through selective text embedding modification, enabling explicit semantic control over character identity without sacrificing prompt alignment. Furthermore, based on our analysis of padding embeddings in FLUX, we propose a semantic control strategy that repurposes padding embeddings as semantic containers. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive feature-sharing strategy that automatically evaluates textual ambiguity and applies constraints only to the ambiguous identity prompt. Finally, we propose a unified evaluation protocol, the Consistency Quality Score (CQS), which integrates identity preservation and per-image text alignment into a single comprehensive metric, explicitly capturing performance imbalances between the two metrics. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively overcoming prior trade-offs. Project page: https://minjung-s.github.io/asemconsist

Conclusion: 提出的Contour Information-Aware 2D Gaussian Splatting框架通过结合对象分割先验，显著提升了在少量高斯分布情况下的边缘重建质量，同时保持了快速渲染和低内存使用的优势。

Abstract: Image representation is a fundamental task in computer vision. Recently, Gaussian Splatting has emerged as an efficient representation framework, and its extension to 2D image representation enables lightweight, yet expressive modeling of visual content. While recent 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) approaches provide compact storage and real-time decoding, they often produce blurry or indistinct boundaries when the number of Gaussians is small due to the lack of contour awareness. In this work, we propose a Contour Information-Aware 2D Gaussian Splatting framework that incorporates object segmentation priors into Gaussian-based image representation. By constraining each Gaussian to a specific segmentation region during rasterization, our method prevents cross-boundary blending and preserves edge structures under high compression. We also introduce a warm-up scheme to stabilize training and improve convergence. Experiments on synthetic color charts and the DAVIS dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves higher reconstruction quality around object edges compared to existing 2DGS methods. The improvement is particularly evident in scenarios with very few Gaussians, while our method still maintains fast rendering and low memory usage.

Conclusion: CEM作为一种模型无关的插件，通过累积误差最小化显著提升了现有加速模型的生成保真度，并在多个任务和模型上验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Although Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has emerged as a predominant architecture for image and video generation, its iterative denoising process results in slow inference, which hinders broader applicability and development. Caching-based methods achieve training-free acceleration, while suffering from considerable computational error. Existing methods typically incorporate error correction strategies such as pruning or prediction to mitigate it. However, their fixed caching strategy fails to adapt to the complex error variations during denoising, which limits the full potential of error correction. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel fidelity-optimization plugin for existing error correction methods via cumulative error minimization, named CEM. CEM predefines the error to characterize the sensitivity of model to acceleration jointly influenced by timesteps and cache intervals. Guided by this prior, we formulate a dynamic programming algorithm with cumulative error approximation for strategy optimization, which achieves the caching error minimization, resulting in a substantial improvement in generation fidelity. CEM is model-agnostic and exhibits strong generalization, which is adaptable to arbitrary acceleration budgets. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing error correction frameworks and quantized models without introducing any additional computational overhead. Extensive experiments conducted on nine generation models and quantized methods across three tasks demonstrate that CEM significantly improves generation fidelity of existing acceleration models, and outperforms the original generation performance on FLUX.1-dev, PixArt-$α$, StableDiffusion1.5 and Hunyuan. The code will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有实时目标检测方法采用静态密集计算，导致计算资源分配不均，性能不佳。

Method: 提出了一种基于高效稀疏专家混合（ES-MoE）块的YOLO-like框架，通过轻量级动态路由网络动态分配计算资源。

Result: 在MS COCO上达到42.4% AP，延迟1.62ms，优于YOLOv13-N。

Conclusion: YOLO-Master通过引入实例条件自适应计算，显著提升了实时目标检测的性能和效率，尤其在复杂场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Existing Real-Time Object Detection (RTOD) methods commonly adopt YOLO-like architectures for their favorable trade-off between accuracy and speed. However, these models rely on static dense computation that applies uniform processing to all inputs, misallocating representational capacity and computational resources such as over-allocating on trivial scenes while under-serving complex ones. This mismatch results in both computational redundancy and suboptimal detection performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose YOLO-Master, a novel YOLO-like framework that introduces instance-conditional adaptive computation for RTOD. This is achieved through a Efficient Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (ES-MoE) block that dynamically allocates computational resources to each input according to its scene complexity. At its core, a lightweight dynamic routing network guides expert specialization during training through a diversity enhancing objective, encouraging complementary expertise among experts. Additionally, the routing network adaptively learns to activate only the most relevant experts, thereby improving detection performance while minimizing computational overhead during inference. Comprehensive experiments on five large-scale benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of YOLO-Master. On MS COCO, our model achieves 42.4% AP with 1.62ms latency, outperforming YOLOv13-N by +0.8% mAP and 17.8% faster inference. Notably, the gains are most pronounced on challenging dense scenes, while the model preserves efficiency on typical inputs and maintains real-time inference speed. Code will be available.

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition and behavior-based emotion prediction are both highly challenging tasks that require modeling subtle, fine-grained human behaviors, primarily leveraging video and skeletal pose data. In this work, we present two multimodal frameworks designed to tackle both problems on the iMiGUE dataset. For micro-gesture classification, we explore the complementary strengths of RGB and 3D pose-based representations to capture nuanced spatio-temporal patterns. To comprehensively represent gestures, video, and skeletal embeddings are extracted using MViTv2-S and 2s-AGCN, respectively. Then, they are integrated through a Cross-Modal Token Fusion module to combine spatial and pose information. For emotion recognition, our framework extends to behavior-based emotion prediction, a binary classification task identifying emotional states based on visual cues. We leverage facial and contextual embeddings extracted using SwinFace and MViTv2-S models and fuse them through an InterFusion module designed to capture emotional expressions and body gestures. Experiments conducted on the iMiGUE dataset, within the scope of the MiGA 2025 Challenge, demonstrate the robust performance and accuracy of our method in the behavior-based emotion prediction task, where our approach secured 2nd place.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is essential in industrial design, but the complexity of traditional CAD modeling and workflows presents significant challenges for automating the generation of high-precision, editable CAD models. Existing methods that reconstruct 3D models from sketches often produce non-editable and approximate models that fall short of meeting the stringent requirements for precision and editability in industrial design. Moreover, the reliance on text or image-based inputs often requires significant manual annotation, limiting their scalability and applicability in industrial settings. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Heterogeneous Collaborative Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (CME-CAD) paradigm, a novel training paradigm for CAD code generation. Our approach integrates the complementary strengths of these models, facilitating collaborative learning and improving the model's ability to generate accurate, constraint-compatible, and fully editable CAD models. We introduce a two-stage training process: Multi-Expert Fine-Tuning (MEFT), and Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (MERL). Additionally, we present CADExpert, an open-source benchmark consisting of 17,299 instances, including orthographic projections with precise dimension annotations, expert-generated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, executable CADQuery code, and rendered 3D models.

Abstract: We study visual representation learning from a structural and topological perspective. We begin from a single hypothesis: that visual understanding presupposes a semantic language for vision, in which many perceptual observations correspond to a small number of discrete semantic states. Together with widely assumed premises on transferability and abstraction in representation learning, this hypothesis implies that the visual observation space must be organized in a fiber bundle like structure, where nuisance variation populates fibers and semantics correspond to a quotient base space. From this structure we derive two theoretical consequences. First, the semantic quotient $X/G$ is not a submanifold of $X$ and cannot be obtained through smooth deformation alone, semantic invariance requires a non-homeomorphic, discriminative target, for example, supervision via labels, cross instance identification, or multimodal alignment that supplies explicit semantic equivalence. Second, we show that approximating the quotient also places structural demands on the model architecture. Semantic abstraction requires not only an external semantic target, but a representation mechanism capable of supporting topology change: an expand-and-snap process in which the manifold is first geometrically expanded to separate structure and then collapsed to form discrete semantic regions. We emphasize that these results are interpretive rather than prescriptive: the framework provides a topological lens that aligns with empirical regularities observed in large-scale discriminative and multimodal models, and with classical principles in statistical learning theory.

Conclusion: CountGD++ 通过引入新的提示灵活性和自动化视觉示例标注，显著提升了多模态开放世界计数的准确性、效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: The flexibility and accuracy of methods for automatically counting objects in images and videos are limited by the way the object can be specified. While existing methods allow users to describe the target object with text and visual examples, the visual examples must be manually annotated inside the image, and there is no way to specify what not to count. To address these gaps, we introduce novel capabilities that expand how the target object can be specified. Specifically, we extend the prompt to enable what not to count to be described with text and/or visual examples, introduce the concept of `pseudo-exemplars' that automate the annotation of visual examples at inference, and extend counting models to accept visual examples from both natural and synthetic external images. We also use our new counting model, CountGD++, as a vision expert agent for an LLM. Together, these contributions expand the prompt flexibility of multi-modal open-world counting and lead to significant improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and generalization across multiple datasets.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked the potential for enhanced 3D scene understanding and spatial reasoning. However, existing approaches often rely on pre-constructed 3D representations or off-the-shelf reconstruction pipelines, which constrain scalability and real-world applicability. A recent line of work explores learning spatial reasoning directly from multi-view images, enabling Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand 3D scenes without explicit 3D reconstructions. Nevertheless, key challenges that frequently arise in real-world environments, such as partial visibility, occlusion, and low-overlap conditions that require spatial reasoning from fragmented visual cues, remain under-explored. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable multi-view data generation and annotation pipeline that constructs realistic spatial reasoning QAs, resulting in SpatialMosaic, a comprehensive instruction-tuning dataset featuring 2M QA pairs. We further introduce SpatialMosaic-Bench, a challenging benchmark for evaluating multi-view spatial reasoning under realistic and challenging scenarios, consisting of 1M QA pairs across 6 tasks. In addition, we present SpatialMosaicVLM, a hybrid framework that integrates 3D reconstruction models as geometry encoders within VLMs for robust spatial reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and VQA tasks effectively enhance spatial reasoning under challenging multi-view conditions, validating the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline in constructing realistic and diverse QA pairs. Code and dataset will be available soon.

Abstract: Two-view correspondence learning is a key task in computer vision, which aims to establish reliable matching relationships for applications such as camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods have limitations in local geometric modeling and cross-stage information optimization, which make it difficult to accurately capture the geometric constraints of matched pairs and thus reduce the robustness of the model. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Graph Contextual Attention Network (MGCA-Net), which consists of a Contextual Geometric Attention (CGA) module and a Cross-Stage Multi-Graph Consensus (CSMGC) module. Specifically, CGA dynamically integrates spatial position and feature information via an adaptive attention mechanism and enhances the capability to capture both local and global geometric relationships. Meanwhile, CSMGC establishes geometric consensus via a cross-stage sparse graph network, ensuring the consistency of geometric information across different stages. Experimental results on two representative YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets show that MGCA-Net significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods in the outlier rejection and camera pose estimation tasks.

Abstract: The accessibility surge and abuse risks of user-friendly image editing models have created an urgent need for generalizable, up-to-date methods for Image Manipulation Detection and Localization (IMDL). Current IMDL research typically uses cross-dataset evaluation, where models trained on one benchmark are tested on others. However, this simplified evaluation approach conceals the fragility of existing methods when handling diverse AI-generated content, leading to misleading impressions of progress. This paper challenges this illusion by proposing NeXT-IMDL, a large-scale diagnostic benchmark designed not just to collect data, but to probe the generalization boundaries of current detectors systematically. Specifically, NeXT-IMDL categorizes AIGC-based manipulations along four fundamental axes: editing models, manipulation types, content semantics, and forgery granularity. Built upon this, NeXT-IMDL implements five rigorous cross-dimension evaluation protocols. Our extensive experiments on 11 representative models reveal a critical insight: while these models perform well in their original settings, they exhibit systemic failures and significant performance degradation when evaluated under our designed protocols that simulate real-world, various generalization scenarios. By providing this diagnostic toolkit and the new findings, we aim to advance the development towards building truly robust, next-generation IMDL models.

Motivation: 解决3D牙齿实例分割中因拥挤牙弓、模糊边界、缺失牙齿和罕见第三磨牙等带来的挑战，避免现有方法中的边界泄漏、中心漂移和身份不一致问题。

Method: SOFTooth采用语义增强的2D-3D融合框架，包括点级残差门控模块、中心引导的掩膜优化和顺序感知的匈牙利匹配策略。

Result: 在3DTeethSeg'22数据集上，SOFTooth实现了最先进的整体准确率和平均IoU，尤其在处理第三磨牙时表现突出。

Conclusion: SOFTooth框架通过结合2D语义和3D几何信息，显著提升了3D牙齿实例分割的准确性，特别是在处理复杂解剖结构和罕见牙齿（如第三磨牙）时表现优异。

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) tooth instance segmentation remains challenging due to crowded arches, ambiguous tooth-gingiva boundaries, missing teeth, and rare yet clinically important third molars. Native 3D methods relying on geometric cues often suffer from boundary leakage, center drift, and inconsistent tooth identities, especially for minority classes and complex anatomies. Meanwhile, 2D foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provide strong boundary-aware semantics, but directly applying them in 3D is impractical in clinical workflows. To address these issues, we propose SOFTooth, a semantics-enhanced, order-aware 2D-3D fusion framework that leverages frozen 2D semantics without explicit 2D mask supervision. First, a point-wise residual gating module injects occlusal-view SAM embeddings into 3D point features to refine tooth-gingiva and inter-tooth boundaries. Second, a center-guided mask refinement regularizes consistency between instance masks and geometric centroids, reducing center drift. Furthermore, an order-aware Hungarian matching strategy integrates anatomical tooth order and center distance into similarity-based assignment, ensuring coherent labeling even under missing or crowded dentitions. On 3DTeethSeg'22, SOFTooth achieves state-of-the-art overall accuracy and mean IoU, with clear gains on cases involving third molars, demonstrating that rich 2D semantics can be effectively transferred to 3D tooth instance segmentation without 2D fine-tuning.

Motivation: 美学质量评估的复杂性及现有数据集的不足（数据稀缺、不平衡）和模型方法的局限性（碎片化、难以处理长文本）是研究的主要动机。

Method: 通过迭代流程生成大规模多维度结构化数据集RAD，并设计ArtQuant框架，结合联合描述生成和LLM解码器优化长文本语义建模。

Result: ArtQuant在多个数据集上达到最先进性能，仅需传统训练周期的33%，缩小了艺术图像与美学判断之间的认知差距。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了ArtQuant框架和RAD数据集，有效解决了美学质量评估中的数据稀缺与模型碎片化问题，显著提升了评估性能并减少了训练成本。

Abstract: The aesthetic quality assessment task is crucial for developing a human-aligned quantitative evaluation system for AIGC. However, its inherently complex nature, spanning visual perception, cognition, and emotion, poses fundamental challenges. Although aesthetic descriptions offer a viable representation of this complexity, two critical challenges persist: (1) data scarcity and imbalance: existing dataset overly focuses on visual perception and neglects deeper dimensions due to the expensive manual annotation; and (2) model fragmentation: current visual networks isolate aesthetic attributes with multi-branch encoder, while multimodal methods represented by contrastive learning struggle to effectively process long-form textual descriptions. To resolve challenge (1), we first present the Refined Aesthetic Description (RAD) dataset, a large-scale (70k), multi-dimensional structured dataset, generated via an iterative pipeline without heavy annotation costs and easy to scale. To address challenge (2), we propose ArtQuant, an aesthetics assessment framework for artistic images which not only couples isolated aesthetic dimensions through joint description generation, but also better models long-text semantics with the help of LLM decoders. Besides, theoretical analysis confirms this symbiosis: RAD's semantic adequacy (data) and generation paradigm (model) collectively minimize prediction entropy, providing mathematical grounding for the framework. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several datasets while requiring only 33% of conventional training epochs, narrowing the cognitive gap between artistic images and aesthetic judgment. We will release both code and dataset to support future research.

Motivation: 当前自动驾驶世界模型与运动规划解耦，限制了性能。DriveLaW旨在统一两者，提升一致性和可靠性。

Method: DriveLaW包含DriveLaW-Video（高保真世界模型）和DriveLaW-Act（扩散规划器），通过三阶段渐进训练策略优化。

Result: DriveLaW在视频预测任务中FID提升33.3%，FVD提升1.8%，并在NAVSIM规划基准上创下新纪录。

Conclusion: DriveLaW通过统一视频生成和运动规划，实现了高保真未来生成与可靠轨迹规划的内在一致性，显著提升了自动驾驶性能。

Abstract: World models have become crucial for autonomous driving, as they learn how scenarios evolve over time to address the long-tail challenges of the real world. However, current approaches relegate world models to limited roles: they operate within ostensibly unified architectures that still keep world prediction and motion planning as decoupled processes. To bridge this gap, we propose DriveLaW, a novel paradigm that unifies video generation and motion planning. By directly injecting the latent representation from its video generator into the planner, DriveLaW ensures inherent consistency between high-fidelity future generation and reliable trajectory planning. Specifically, DriveLaW consists of two core components: DriveLaW-Video, our powerful world model that generates high-fidelity forecasting with expressive latent representations, and DriveLaW-Act, a diffusion planner that generates consistent and reliable trajectories from the latent of DriveLaW-Video, with both components optimized by a three-stage progressive training strategy. The power of our unified paradigm is demonstrated by new state-of-the-art results across both tasks. DriveLaW not only advances video prediction significantly, surpassing best-performing work by 33.3% in FID and 1.8% in FVD, but also achieves a new record on the NAVSIM planning benchmark.

Motivation: 扩散模型在生成任务中表现优异，但在输出与用户意图的对齐和保持一致的审美质量方面存在挑战。现有的基于偏好的训练方法依赖高成本且可能噪声较大的人工标注数据。

Method: DDSPO 通过对比预训练参考模型在原始提示和语义降级变体条件下的输出，自动生成偏好信号，提供密集的去噪轨迹级监督。

Result: 实验结果表明，DDSPO 在文本-图像对齐和视觉质量上优于或匹配现有基于偏好的方法，同时需要更少的监督。

Conclusion: DDSPO 通过直接从可用的策略中获取时间步监督信号，避免了依赖昂贵且可能噪声较大的人工标注数据集，显著提升了文本-图像对齐和视觉质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generative tasks such as text-to-image synthesis, yet they often struggle to fully align outputs with nuanced user intent and maintain consistent aesthetic quality. Existing preference-based training methods like Diffusion Direct Preference Optimization help address these issues but rely on costly and potentially noisy human-labeled datasets. In this work, we introduce Direct Diffusion Score Preference Optimization (DDSPO), which directly derives per-timestep supervision from winning and losing policies when such policies are available. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on final samples, DDSPO provides dense, transition-level signals across the denoising trajectory. In practice, we avoid reliance on labeled data by automatically generating preference signals using a pretrained reference model: we contrast its outputs when conditioned on original prompts versus semantically degraded variants. This practical strategy enables effective score-space preference supervision without explicit reward modeling or manual annotations. Empirical results demonstrate that DDSPO improves text-image alignment and visual quality, outperforming or matching existing preference-based methods while requiring significantly less supervision.

Conclusion: Incorporating uncertainty quantification into分割模型如SAM可以增强其在挑战性条件下的泛化能力，特别是在领域无关的情境中。

Abstract: Foundation models for segmentation such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) family exhibit strong zero-shot performance, but remain vulnerable in shifted or limited-knowledge domains. This work investigates whether uncertainty quantification can mitigate such challenges and enhance model generalisability in a domain-agnostic manner. To this end, we (1) curate UncertSAM, a benchmark comprising eight datasets designed to stress-test SAM under challenging segmentation conditions including shadows, transparency, and camouflage; (2) evaluate a suite of lightweight, post-hoc uncertainty estimation methods; and (3) assess a preliminary uncertainty-guided prediction refinement step. Among evaluated approaches, a last-layer Laplace approximation yields uncertainty estimates that correlate well with segmentation errors, indicating a meaningful signal. While refinement benefits are preliminary, our findings underscore the potential of incorporating uncertainty into segmentation models to support robust, domain-agnostic performance. Our benchmark and code are made publicly available.

Conclusion: RealX3D作为一个真实捕获的基准测试，揭示了当前多视角视觉恢复和3D重建方法在多样化物理退化条件下的脆弱性，强调了在现实挑战性环境中改进现有管道的必要性。

Abstract: We introduce RealX3D, a real-capture benchmark for multi-view visual restoration and 3D reconstruction under diverse physical degradations. RealX3D groups corruptions into four families, including illumination, scattering, occlusion, and blurring, and captures each at multiple severity levels using a unified acquisition protocol that yields pixel-aligned LQ/GT views. Each scene includes high-resolution capture, RAW images, and dense laser scans, from which we derive world-scale meshes and metric depth. Benchmarking a broad range of optimization-based and feed-forward methods shows substantial degradation in reconstruction quality under physical corruptions, underscoring the fragility of current multi-view pipelines in real-world challenging environments.

Abstract: Accurate and continuous monitoring of river water levels is essential for flood forecasting, water resource management, and ecological protection. Traditional hydrological observation methods are often limited by manual measurement errors and environmental constraints. This study presents a hybrid framework integrating vision based waterline detection, YOLOv8 pose scale extraction, and large multimodal language models (GPT 4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash) for automated river gauge plate reading. The methodology involves sequential stages of image preprocessing, annotation, waterline detection, scale gap estimation, and numeric reading extraction. Experiments demonstrate that waterline detection achieved high precision of 94.24 percent and an F1 score of 83.64 percent, while scale gap detection provided accurate geometric calibration for subsequent reading extraction. Incorporating scale gap metadata substantially improved the predictive performance of LLMs, with Gemini Stage 2 achieving the highest accuracy, with a mean absolute error of 5.43 cm, root mean square error of 8.58 cm, and R squared of 0.84 under optimal image conditions. Results highlight the sensitivity of LLMs to image quality, with degraded images producing higher errors, and underscore the importance of combining geometric metadata with multimodal artificial intelligence for robust water level estimation. Overall, the proposed approach offers a scalable, efficient, and reliable solution for automated hydrological monitoring, demonstrating potential for real time river gauge digitization and improved water resource management.

Conclusion: Dual-approx Bridge模型在图像到图像转换任务中表现出色，尤其在图像质量和忠实度方面优于现有随机和确定性基线方法。

Abstract: Image-to-Image (I2I) translation involves converting an image from one domain to another. Deterministic I2I translation, such as in image super-resolution, extends this concept by guaranteeing that each input generates a consistent and predictable output, closely matching the ground truth (GT) with high fidelity. In this paper, we propose a denoising Brownian bridge model with dual approximators (Dual-approx Bridge), a novel generative model that exploits the Brownian bridge dynamics and two neural network-based approximators (one for forward and one for reverse process) to produce faithful output with negligible variance and high image quality in I2I translations. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including image generation and super-resolution demonstrate the consistent and superior performance of Dual-approx Bridge in terms of image quality and faithfulness to GT when compared to both stochastic and deterministic baselines.

Abstract: Robust and discriminative feature learning is critical for high-quality point cloud registration. However, existing deep learning-based methods typically rely on Euclidean neighborhood-based strategies for feature extraction, which struggle to effectively capture the implicit semantics and structural consistency in point clouds. To address these issues, we propose a multi-domain context integration network (MCI-Net) that improves feature representation and registration performance by aggregating contextual cues from diverse domains. Specifically, we propose a graph neighborhood aggregation module, which constructs a global graph to capture the overall structural relationships within point clouds. We then propose a progressive context interaction module to enhance feature discriminability by performing intra-domain feature decoupling and inter-domain context interaction. Finally, we design a dynamic inlier selection method that optimizes inlier weights using residual information from multiple iterations of pose estimation, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of registration. Extensive experiments on indoor RGB-D and outdoor LiDAR datasets show that the proposed MCI-Net significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving the highest registration recall of 96.4\% on 3DMatch.

Conclusion: SC-Net通过AFR、BFA和PAR模块的创新设计，有效解决了CNN在全局上下文聚合和大视差场景下的运动场过平滑问题，显著提升了姿态估计和异常值去除的性能。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as the backbones in two-view correspondence learning, demonstrating significant superiority over methods based on multilayer perceptrons. However, CNN backbones that are not tailored to specific tasks may fail to effectively aggregate global context and oversmooth dense motion fields in scenes with large disparity. To address these problems, we propose a novel network named SC-Net, which effectively integrates bilateral context from both spatial and channel perspectives. Specifically, we design an adaptive focused regularization module (AFR) to enhance the model's position-awareness and robustness against spurious motion samples, thereby facilitating the generation of a more accurate motion field. We then propose a bilateral field adjustment module (BFA) to refine the motion field by simultaneously modeling long-range relationships and facilitating interaction across spatial and channel dimensions. Finally, we recover the motion vectors from the refined field using a position-aware recovery module (PAR) that ensures consistency and precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SC-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in relative pose estimation and outlier removal tasks on YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets.

Motivation: 现有大型视频语言模型（LVLMs）在长视频处理中存在时间窗口狭窄和语义细粒度变化捕捉不足的问题，且主流检索方法忽略了多模态通道的时序依赖性。

Method: TV-RAG提出两种机制：时间衰减检索模块和熵加权关键帧采样器，结合时间和语义信号实现双级推理。

Conclusion: TV-RAG通过结合时间对齐和熵引导语义，无需重新训练即可提升长视频推理能力，在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: Large Video Language Models (LVLMs) have rapidly emerged as the focus of multimedia AI research. Nonetheless, when confronted with lengthy videos, these models struggle: their temporal windows are narrow, and they fail to notice fine-grained semantic shifts that unfold over extended durations. Moreover, mainstream text-based retrieval pipelines, which rely chiefly on surface-level lexical overlap, ignore the rich temporal interdependence among visual, audio, and subtitle channels. To mitigate these limitations, we propose TV-RAG, a training-free architecture that couples temporal alignment with entropy-guided semantics to improve long-video reasoning. The framework contributes two main mechanisms: \emph{(i)} a time-decay retrieval module that injects explicit temporal offsets into the similarity computation, thereby ranking text queries according to their true multimedia context; and \emph{(ii)} an entropy-weighted key-frame sampler that selects evenly spaced, information-dense frames, reducing redundancy while preserving representativeness. By weaving these temporal and semantic signals together, TV-RAG realises a dual-level reasoning routine that can be grafted onto any LVLM without re-training or fine-tuning. The resulting system offers a lightweight, budget-friendly upgrade path and consistently surpasses most leading baselines across established long-video benchmarks such as Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench, confirming the effectiveness of our model.

Abstract: Context modeling is crucial for visual recognition, enabling highly discriminative image representations by integrating both intrinsic and extrinsic relationships between objects and labels in images. A limitation in current approaches is their focus on basic geometric relationships or localized features, often neglecting cross-scale contextual interactions between objects. This paper introduces the Deep Panoptic Context Aggregation Network (PanCAN), a novel approach that hierarchically integrates multi-order geometric contexts through cross-scale feature aggregation in a high-dimensional Hilbert space. Specifically, PanCAN learns multi-order neighborhood relationships at each scale by combining random walks with an attention mechanism. Modules from different scales are cascaded, where salient anchors at a finer scale are selected and their neighborhood features are dynamically fused via attention. This enables effective cross-scale modeling that significantly enhances complex scene understanding by combining multi-order and cross-scale context-aware features. Extensive multi-label classification experiments on NUS-WIDE, PASCAL VOC2007, and MS-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that PanCAN consistently achieves competitive results, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, thereby substantially improving multi-label classification performance.

Abstract: Recent visual generative models enable story generation with consistent characters from text, but human-centric story generation faces additional challenges, such as maintaining detailed and diverse human face consistency and coordinating multiple characters across different images. This paper presents IdentityStory, a framework for human-centric story generation that ensures consistent character identity across multiple sequential images. By taming identity-preserving generators, the framework features two key components: Iterative Identity Discovery, which extracts cohesive character identities, and Re-denoising Identity Injection, which re-denoises images to inject identities while preserving desired context. Experiments on the ConsiStory-Human benchmark demonstrate that IdentityStory outperforms existing methods, particularly in face consistency, and supports multi-character combinations. The framework also shows strong potential for applications such as infinite-length story generation and dynamic character composition.

Conclusion: IAFS框架有效解决了感知质量与结构保真度之间的冲突，在多个基于扩散的超分辨率模型中表现优异，超越了现有的推理时间缩放方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become a leading paradigm for image super-resolution (SR), but existing methods struggle to guarantee both the high-frequency perceptual quality and the low-frequency structural fidelity of generated images. Although inference-time scaling can theoretically improve this trade-off by allocating more computation, existing strategies remain suboptimal: reward-driven particle optimization often causes perceptual over-smoothing, while optimal-path search tends to lose structural consistency. To overcome these difficulties, we propose Iterative Diffusion Inference-Time Scaling with Adaptive Frequency Steering (IAFS), a training-free framework that jointly leverages iterative refinement and frequency-aware particle fusion. IAFS addresses the challenge of balancing perceptual quality and structural fidelity by progressively refining the generated image through iterative correction of structural deviations. Simultaneously, it ensures effective frequency fusion by adaptively integrating high-frequency perceptual cues with low-frequency structural information, allowing for a more accurate and balanced reconstruction across different image details. Extensive experiments across multiple diffusion-based SR models show that IAFS effectively resolves the perception-fidelity conflict, yielding consistently improved perceptual detail and structural accuracy, and outperforming existing inference-time scaling methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have notably enhanced text-to-image (T2I) generation quality, but they also raise the risk of generating unsafe content. Traditional safety methods like text blacklisting or harmful content classification have significant drawbacks: they can be easily circumvented or require extensive datasets and extra training. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PurifyGen, a novel, training-free approach for safe T2I generation that retains the model's original weights. PurifyGen introduces a dual-stage strategy for prompt purification. First, we evaluate the safety of each token in a prompt by computing its complementary semantic distance, which measures the semantic proximity between the prompt tokens and concept embeddings from predefined toxic and clean lists. This enables fine-grained prompt classification without explicit keyword matching or retraining. Tokens closer to toxic concepts are flagged as risky. Second, for risky prompts, we apply a dual-space transformation: we project toxic-aligned embeddings into the null space of the toxic concept matrix, effectively removing harmful semantic components, and simultaneously align them into the range space of clean concepts. This dual alignment purifies risky prompts by both subtracting unsafe semantics and reinforcing safe ones, while retaining the original intent and coherence. We further define a token-wise strategy to selectively replace only risky token embeddings, ensuring minimal disruption to safe content. PurifyGen offers a plug-and-play solution with theoretical grounding and strong generalization to unseen prompts and models. Extensive testing shows that PurifyGen surpasses current methods in reducing unsafe content across five datasets and competes well with training-dependent approaches.

Conclusion: ThinkGen通过解耦架构和SepGRPO训练范式，实现了在多生成场景下的高效CoT推理，展现了强大的生成能力和泛化性。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrates that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enables systematic solutions to complex understanding tasks. However, its extension to generation tasks remains nascent and limited by scenario-specific mechanisms that hinder generalization and adaptation. In this work, we present ThinkGen, the first think-driven visual generation framework that explicitly leverages MLLM's CoT reasoning in various generation scenarios. ThinkGen employs a decoupled architecture comprising a pretrained MLLM and a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), wherein the MLLM generates tailored instructions based on user intent, and DiT produces high-quality images guided by these instructions. We further propose a separable GRPO-based training paradigm (SepGRPO), alternating reinforcement learning between the MLLM and DiT modules. This flexible design enables joint training across diverse datasets, facilitating effective CoT reasoning for a wide range of generative scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ThinkGen achieves robust, state-of-the-art performance across multiple generation benchmarks. Code is available: https://github.com/jiaosiyuu/ThinkGen

Conclusion: 论文提出的Haar-tSVD方法在图像去噪中实现了速度与性能的平衡，并通过实验验证了其高效性和有效性。

Abstract: The proliferation of imaging devices and countless image data generated every day impose an increasingly high demand on efficient and effective image denoising. In this paper, we establish a theoretical connection between principal component analysis (PCA) and the Haar transform under circulant representation, and present a computationally simple denoising algorithm. The proposed method, termed Haar-tSVD, exploits a unified tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) projection combined with Haar transform to efficiently capture global and local patch correlations. Haar-tSVD operates as a one-step, parallelizable plug-and-play denoiser that eliminates the need for learning local bases, thereby striking a balance between denoising speed and performance. Besides, an adaptive noise estimation scheme is introduced to improve robustness according to eigenvalue analysis of the circulant structure. To further enhance the performance under severe noise conditions, we integrate deep neural networks with Haar-tSVD based on the established Haar-PCA relationship. Experimental results on various denoising datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of proposed method for noise removal.

Motivation: 生成模型的快速发展带来了多模态安全风险，现有防御方法存在局限性，需要一种无需模型调整的主动防护方法。

Method: 构建了一个模态平衡的87K样本数据集，并通过纯强化学习训练视觉语言基础模型，引入OOD安全类别推理任务和基于同义词库的相似性奖励。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative models has led to a continuous emergence of multimodal safety risks, exposing the limitations of existing defense methods. To address these challenges, we propose ProGuard, a vision-language proactive guard that identifies and describes out-of-distribution (OOD) safety risks without the need for model adjustments required by traditional reactive approaches. We first construct a modality-balanced dataset of 87K samples, each annotated with both binary safety labels and risk categories under a hierarchical multimodal safety taxonomy, effectively mitigating modality bias and ensuring consistent moderation across text, image, and text-image inputs. Based on this dataset, we train our vision-language base model purely through reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve efficient and concise reasoning. To approximate proactive safety scenarios in a controlled setting, we further introduce an OOD safety category inference task and augment the RL objective with a synonym-bank-based similarity reward that encourages the model to generate concise descriptions for unseen unsafe categories. Experimental results show that ProGuard achieves performance comparable to closed-source large models on binary safety classification, substantially outperforms existing open-source guard models on unsafe content categorization. Most notably, ProGuard delivers a strong proactive moderation ability, improving OOD risk detection by 52.6% and OOD risk description by 64.8%.

Abstract: Real-time video generation via diffusion is essential for building general-purpose multimodal interactive AI systems. However, the simultaneous denoising of all video frames with bidirectional attention via an iterative process in diffusion models prevents real-time interaction. While existing distillation methods can make the model autoregressive and reduce sampling steps to mitigate this, they focus primarily on text-to-video generation, leaving the human-AI interaction unnatural and less efficient. This paper targets real-time interactive video diffusion conditioned on a multimodal context, including text, image, and audio, to bridge the gap. Given the observation that the leading on-policy distillation approach Self Forcing encounters challenges (visual artifacts like flickering, black frames, and quality degradation) with multimodal conditioning, we investigate an improved distillation recipe with emphasis on the quality of condition inputs as well as the initialization and schedule for the on-policy optimization. On benchmarks for multimodal-conditioned (audio, image, and text) avatar video generation including HDTF, AVSpeech, and CelebV-HQ, our distilled model matches the visual quality of the full-step, bidirectional baselines of similar or larger size with 20x less inference cost and latency. Further, we integrate our model with audio language models and long-form video inference technique Anchor-Heavy Identity Sinks to build LiveTalk, a real-time multimodal interactive avatar system. System-level evaluation on our curated multi-turn interaction benchmark shows LiveTalk outperforms state-of-the-art models (Sora2, Veo3) in multi-turn video coherence and content quality, while reducing response latency from 1 to 2 minutes to real-time generation, enabling seamless human-AI multimodal interaction.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLM）在细粒度视觉理解上表现不足，现有训练语料库强化了这一局限。

Method: 引入了TWIN数据集和FGVQA基准测试，通过561,000个图像对查询任务增强VLM的感知能力，并量化了其在12,000个查询上的性能提升。

Result: 在TWIN上微调的VLM在FGVQA基准测试中提升了19.3%，且不影响通用VQA性能。

Conclusion: TWIN数据集作为开源VLM训练语料库的补充，有效提升了未来模型的感知精度，且在对象标注规模上表现出良好的扩展性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but remain coarse-grained, exhibit visual biases, and miss subtle visual details. Existing training corpora reinforce this limitation by emphasizing general recognition ("Is it a cat or a dog?") over fine-grained perception. To address this, we introduce a new training corpus and task designed to enhance the perceptual abilities of VLMs. TWIN is a large-scale dataset of 561,000 image-pair queries that task models to determine whether two visually similar images depict the same object, encouraging attention to nuanced visual cues. The dataset spans a diverse range of everyday objects across contexts, viewpoints, and appearances. Fine-tuning VLMs on TWIN yields notable gains in fine-grained recognition, even on unseen domains such as art, animals, plants, and landmarks. To quantify these gains, we introduce FGVQA, a benchmark suite of 12,000 queries that repurposes fine-grained recognition and retrieval datasets from multiple domains. While existing VLMs struggle on FGVQA, when fine-tuned on TWIN they improve by up to 19.3%, without compromising performance on general VQA benchmarks. Finally, our TWIN dataset scales favorably with object annotations, and our analysis shows that scale is key to performance. We envision TWIN as a drop-in addition to open-source VLM training corpora, advancing perceptual precision of future models. Project webpage: https://glab-caltech.github.io/twin/

Abstract: Improving the accuracy of fire detection using infrared night vision cameras remains a challenging task. Previous studies have reported strong performance with popular detection models. For example, YOLOv7 achieved an mAP50-95 of 0.51 using an input image size of 640 x 1280, RT-DETR reached an mAP50-95 of 0.65 with an image size of 640 x 640, and YOLOv9 obtained an mAP50-95 of 0.598 at the same resolution. Despite these results, limitations in dataset construction continue to cause issues, particularly the frequent misclassification of bright artificial lights as fire.
  This report presents three main contributions: an additional NIR dataset, a two-stage detection model, and Patched-YOLO. First, to address data scarcity, we explore and apply various data augmentation strategies for both the NIR dataset and the classification dataset. Second, to improve night-time fire detection accuracy while reducing false positives caused by artificial lights, we propose a two-stage pipeline combining YOLOv11 and EfficientNetV2-B0. The proposed approach achieves higher detection accuracy compared to previous methods, particularly for night-time fire detection. Third, to improve fire detection in RGB images, especially for small and distant objects, we introduce Patched-YOLO, which enhances the model's detection capability through patch-based processing. Further details of these contributions are discussed in the following sections.

Abstract: The early detection of pancreatic neoplasm is a major clinical dilemma, and it is predominantly so because tumors are likely to occur with minimal contrast margins and a large spread anatomy-wide variation amongst patients on a CT scan. These complexities require to be addressed with an effective and scalable system that can assist in enhancing the salience of the subtle visual cues and provide a high level of the generalization on the multimodal imaging data. A Scalable Residual Feature Aggregation (SRFA) framework is proposed to be used to meet these conditions in this study. The framework integrates a pipeline of preprocessing followed by the segmentation using the MAGRes-UNet that is effective in making the pancreatic structures and isolating regions of interest more visible. DenseNet-121 performed with residual feature storage is used to extract features to allow deep hierarchical features to be aggregated without properties loss. To go further, hybrid HHO-BA metaheuristic feature selection strategy is used, which guarantees the best feature subset refinement. To be classified, the system is trained based on a new hybrid model that integrates the ability to pay attention on the world, which is the Vision Transformer (ViT) with the high representational efficiency of EfficientNet-B3. A dual optimization mechanism incorporating SSA and GWO is used to fine-tune hyperparameters to enhance greater robustness and less overfitting. Experimental results support the significant improvement in performance, with the suggested model reaching 96.23% accuracy, 95.58% F1-score and 94.83% specificity, the model is significantly better than the traditional CNNs and contemporary transformer-based models. Such results highlight the possibility of the SRFA framework as a useful instrument in the early detection of pancreatic tumors.

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly used in 3D vision to synthesize novel shapes, yet it remains unclear whether their generation relies on memorizing training shapes. Understanding their memorization could help prevent training data leakage and improve the diversity of generated results. In this paper, we design an evaluation framework to quantify memorization in 3D generative models and study the influence of different data and modeling designs on memorization. We first apply our framework to quantify memorization in existing methods. Next, through controlled experiments with a latent vector-set (Vecset) diffusion model, we find that, on the data side, memorization depends on data modality, and increases with data diversity and finer-grained conditioning; on the modeling side, it peaks at a moderate guidance scale and can be mitigated by longer Vecsets and simple rotation augmentation. Together, our framework and analysis provide an empirical understanding of memorization in 3D generative models and suggest simple yet effective strategies to reduce it without degrading generation quality.

Conclusion: HAT模块通过自适应解码多假设对齐提案，显著提升了自动驾驶中的时空对齐性能，增强了感知和规划的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal alignment is crucial for temporal modeling of end-to-end (E2E) perception in autonomous driving (AD), providing valuable structural and textural prior information. Existing methods typically rely on the attention mechanism to align objects across frames, simplifying the motion model with a unified explicit physical model (constant velocity, etc.). These approaches prefer semantic features for implicit alignment, challenging the importance of explicit motion modeling in the traditional perception paradigm. However, variations in motion states and object features across categories and frames render this alignment suboptimal. To address this, we propose HAT, a spatio-temporal alignment module that allows each object to adaptively decode the optimal alignment proposal from multiple hypotheses without direct supervision. Specifically, HAT first utilizes multiple explicit motion models to generate spatial anchors and motion-aware feature proposals for historical instances. It then performs multi-hypothesis decoding by incorporating semantic and motion cues embedded in cached object queries, ultimately providing the optimal alignment proposal for the target frame. On nuScenes, HAT consistently improves 3D temporal detectors and trackers across diverse baselines. It achieves state-of-the-art tracking results with 46.0% AMOTA on the test set when paired with the DETR3D detector. In an object-centric E2E AD method, HAT enhances perception accuracy (+1.3% mAP, +3.1% AMOTA) and reduces the collision rate by 32%. When semantics are corrupted (nuScenes-C), the enhancement of motion modeling by HAT enables more robust perception and planning in the E2E AD.

Abstract: Omnimodal large language models have made significant strides in unifying audio and visual modalities; however, they often lack the fine-grained cross-modal understanding and have difficulty with multimodal alignment. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniAgent, a fully audio-guided active perception agent that dynamically orchestrates specialized tools to achieve more fine-grained audio-visual reasoning. Unlike previous works that rely on rigid, static workflows and dense frame-captioning, this paper demonstrates a paradigm shift from passive response generation to active multimodal inquiry. OmniAgent employs dynamic planning to autonomously orchestrate tool invocation on demand, strategically concentrating perceptual attention on task-relevant cues. Central to our approach is a novel coarse-to-fine audio-guided perception paradigm, which leverages audio cues to localize temporal events and guide subsequent reasoning. Extensive empirical evaluations on three audio-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that OmniAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source and proprietary models by substantial margins of 10% - 20% accuracy.

Conclusion: IDT通过基于transformer的注意力机制，在多视图内禀图像分解中实现了视图一致性和物理基础的分解，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Intrinsic image decomposition is fundamental for visual understanding, as RGB images entangle material properties, illumination, and view-dependent effects. Recent diffusion-based methods have achieved strong results for single-view intrinsic decomposition; however, extending these approaches to multi-view settings remains challenging, often leading to severe view inconsistency. We propose \textbf{Intrinsic Decomposition Transformer (IDT)}, a feed-forward framework for multi-view intrinsic image decomposition. By leveraging transformer-based attention to jointly reason over multiple input images, IDT produces view-consistent intrinsic factors in a single forward pass, without iterative generative sampling. IDT adopts a physically grounded image formation model that explicitly decomposes images into diffuse reflectance, diffuse shading, and specular shading. This structured factorization separates Lambertian and non-Lambertian light transport, enabling interpretable and controllable decomposition of material and illumination effects across views. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IDT achieves cleaner diffuse reflectance, more coherent diffuse shading, and better-isolated specular components, while substantially improving multi-view consistency compared to prior intrinsic decomposition methods.

<details>

Motivation: 透明物体对感知系统极具挑战性，折射、反射和透射破坏了立体、ToF和纯判别性单目深度的假设，导致空洞和时间不稳定的估计。现代视频扩散模型已能合成逼真的透明现象，表明它们已内化了光学规则。

Conclusion: 扩散模型（Diffusion）能够理解透明物体的光学特性，生成式视频先验可以高效、无标签地转化为鲁棒且时间一致的感知能力，适用于具有挑战性的现实世界操作任务。

Abstract: Transparent objects remain notoriously hard for perception systems: refraction, reflection and transmission break the assumptions behind stereo, ToF and purely discriminative monocular depth, causing holes and temporally unstable estimates. Our key observation is that modern video diffusion models already synthesize convincing transparent phenomena, suggesting they have internalized the optical rules. We build TransPhy3D, a synthetic video corpus of transparent/reflective scenes: 11k sequences rendered with Blender/Cycles. Scenes are assembled from a curated bank of category-rich static assets and shape-rich procedural assets paired with glass/plastic/metal materials. We render RGB + depth + normals with physically based ray tracing and OptiX denoising. Starting from a large video diffusion model, we learn a video-to-video translator for depth (and normals) via lightweight LoRA adapters. During training we concatenate RGB and (noisy) depth latents in the DiT backbone and co-train on TransPhy3D and existing frame-wise synthetic datasets, yielding temporally consistent predictions for arbitrary-length input videos. The resulting model, DKT, achieves zero-shot SOTA on real and synthetic video benchmarks involving transparency: ClearPose, DREDS (CatKnown/CatNovel), and TransPhy3D-Test. It improves accuracy and temporal consistency over strong image/video baselines, and a normal variant sets the best video normal estimation results on ClearPose. A compact 1.3B version runs at ~0.17 s/frame. Integrated into a grasping stack, DKT's depth boosts success rates across translucent, reflective and diffuse surfaces, outperforming prior estimators. Together, these results support a broader claim: "Diffusion knows transparency." Generative video priors can be repurposed, efficiently and label-free, into robust, temporally coherent perception for challenging real-world manipulation.

Operating strictly on past frames, it combines a four-step distilled denoiser for fast inference, an Auto-regressive Temporal Guidance (ARTG) module that injects motion-aligned cues during latent denoising, and a lightweight temporal-aware decoder with a Temporal Processor Module (TPM) that enhances detail and temporal coherence. Stream-DiffVSR processes 720p frames in 0.328 seconds on an RTX4090 GPU and significantly outperforms prior diffusion-based methods. Compared with the online SOTA TMP, it boosts perceptual quality (LPIPS +0.095) while reducing latency by over 130x. Stream-DiffVSR achieves the lowest latency reported for diffusion-based VSR, reducing initial delay from over 4600 seconds to 0.328 seconds, thereby making it the first diffusion VSR method suitable for low-latency online deployment.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 小型Transformer模型在语法正确性上表现良好，但实际修复效果差，且语法正确性不等于语义正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨小型Transformer模型是否能有效修复真实世界的Java漏洞，并验证语法正确性是否可作为语义正确性的可靠代理。

Method: 研究通过微调CodeT5-small模型（60.5M参数）在CodeXGLUE的52,364个Java漏洞修复对上，并使用AST解析评估了标记级性能和语法有效性。

Result: 模型在语法正确性方面表现良好（约94%的情况下生成语法有效的Java代码），但在精确匹配评估中未能生成正确修复（零精确匹配），且约80%的情况下直接复制了漏洞输入。

Conclusion: 研究表明，尽管小型Transformer模型在语法正确性方面表现良好，但在实际修复Java漏洞时效果有限，且语法正确性并不能可靠地代表语义正确性。

Abstract: Automated program repair using neural models has shown promising results on benchmark datasets, yet practical deployment remains limited. In this study, we examine whether a small transformer model can meaningfully repair real-world Java bugs and whether syntactic correctness is a reliable proxy for semantic correctness.
  We fine-tune CodeT5-small (60.5M parameters) on 52,364 Java bug-fix pairs from CodeXGLUE and evaluate both token-level performance and syntactic validity using AST parsing. While the model converges cleanly and achieves high grammatical correctness, producing syntactically valid Java code in approximately ninety-four percent of cases, it fails to generate correct repairs under exact-match evaluation, achieving zero exact matches. In approximately eighty percent of cases, the model reproduces the buggy input verbatim.

*Daniyal Ganiuly,Nurzhau Bolatbek,Assel Smaiyl*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文通过高保真仿真分析LiDAR攻击对自动驾驶安全控制器的影响，发现攻击可导致不安全制动和控制失效，揭示了感知与控制安全间的差距，并提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管先前研究表明LiDAR感知可通过基于目标的欺骗和注入攻击被操纵，但这些攻击对车辆安全控制器的影响仍未充分理解。本文旨在系统分析高速公路驾驶场景中基于目标的LiDAR攻击对纵向安全控制器的失效影响。

Method: 研究使用了一个高保真仿真框架，集成了LiDAR感知、目标跟踪和闭环车辆控制，评估虚假和位移目标检测在感知、规划和控制系统中的传播影响。

Result: 结果表明，即使短时间的LiDAR诱导目标幻觉也可能触发不安全制动、对真实危险的延迟响应和不稳定的控制行为。在切入场景中，与良性条件相比，观察到不安全减速事件和碰撞时间违规明显增加。

Conclusion: 研究发现揭示了自动驾驶系统中感知鲁棒性与控制层安全保证之间的关键差距，为设计具有攻击感知能力的安全机制和更稳健的控制策略提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on LiDAR based perception to support safety critical control functions such as adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking. While previous research has shown that LiDAR perception can be manipulated through object based spoofing and injection attacks, the impact of such attacks on vehicle safety controllers is still not well understood. This paper presents a systematic failure analysis of longitudinal safety controllers under object based LiDAR attacks in highway driving scenarios. The study focuses on realistic cut in and car following situations in which adversarial objects introduce persistent perception errors without directly modifying vehicle control software. A high fidelity simulation framework integrating LiDAR perception, object tracking, and closed loop vehicle control is used to evaluate how false and displaced object detections propagate through the perception planning and control pipeline. The results demonstrate that even short duration LiDAR induced object hallucinations can trigger unsafe braking, delayed responses to real hazards, and unstable control behavior. In cut in scenarios, a clear increase in unsafe deceleration events and time to collision violations is observed when compared to benign conditions, despite identical controller parameters. The analysis further shows that controller failures are more strongly influenced by the temporal consistency of spoofed objects than by spatial inaccuracies alone. These findings reveal a critical gap between perception robustness and control level safety guarantees in autonomous driving systems. By explicitly characterizing safety controller failure modes under adversarial perception, this work provides practical insights for the design of attack aware safety mechanisms and more resilient control strategies for LiDAR dependent autonomous vehicles.

TL;DR: SQLHD 通过蜕变测试分阶段检测 Text-to-SQL 中的幻觉，无需标准答案，实验表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对大型语言模型（LLMs）在 Text-to-SQL 生成中产生的幻觉问题，现有方法因缺乏真实数据而受限，需提出无需标准答案的检测方法。

Method: SQLHD 将检测任务分为两个阶段：通过结构感知的蜕变关系检测模式链接幻觉，以及通过逻辑感知的蜕变关系检测逻辑合成幻觉。

Result: 实验结果表明，SQLHD 的 F1 分数在 69.36% 到 82.76% 之间，优于 LLM 自评估方法。

Conclusion: SQLHD 是一种基于蜕变测试的新型幻觉检测方法，无需标准答案即可有效检测 Text-to-SQL 任务中的幻觉，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: In Text-to-SQL generation, large language models (LLMs) have shown strong generalization and adaptability. However, LLMs sometimes generate hallucinations, i.e.,unrealistic or illogical content, which leads to incorrect SQL queries and negatively impacts downstream applications. Detecting these hallucinations is particularly challenging. Existing Text-to-SQL error detection methods, which are tailored for traditional deep learning models, face significant limitations when applied to LLMs. This is primarily due to the scarcity of ground-truth data. To address this challenge, we propose SQLHD, a novel hallucination detection method based on metamorphic testing (MT) that does not require standard answers. SQLHD splits the detection task into two sequentiial stages: schema-linking hallucination detection via eight structure-aware Metamorphic Relations (MRs) that perturb comparative words, entities, sentence structure or database schema, and logical-synthesis hallucination detection via nine logic-aware MRs that mutate prefix words, extremum expressions, comparison ranges or the entire database. In each stage the LLM is invoked separately to generate schema mappings or SQL artefacts; the follow-up outputs are cross-checked against their source counterparts through the corresponding MRs, and any violation is flagged as a hallucination without requiring ground-truth SQL. The experimental results demonstrate our method's superior performance in terms of the F1-score, which ranges from 69.36\% to 82.76\%. Additionally, SQLHD demonstrates superior performance over LLM Self-Evaluation methods, effectively identifying hallucinations in Text-to-SQL tasks.

Abstract: Software issue resolution aims to address real-world issues in software repositories (e.g., bug fixing and efficiency optimization) based on natural language descriptions provided by users, representing a key aspect of software maintenance. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) in reasoning and generative capabilities, LLM-based approaches have made significant progress in automated software issue resolution. However, real-world software issue resolution is inherently complex and requires long-horizon reasoning, iterative exploration, and feedback-driven decision making, which demand agentic capabilities beyond conventional single-step approaches. Recently, LLM-based agentic systems have become mainstream for software issue resolution. Advancements in agentic software issue resolution not only greatly enhance software maintenance efficiency and quality but also provide a realistic environment for validating agentic systems' reasoning, planning, and execution capabilities, bridging artificial intelligence and software engineering.
  This work presents a systematic survey of 126 recent studies at the forefront of LLM-based agentic software issue resolution research. It outlines the general workflow of the task and establishes a taxonomy across three dimensions: benchmarks, techniques, and empirical studies. Furthermore, it highlights how the emergence of agentic reinforcement learning has brought a paradigm shift in the design and training of agentic systems for software engineering. Finally, it summarizes key challenges and outlines promising directions for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM作为编码代理生成的代码在仅使用OS包和模型指定依赖的干净环境中的执行成功率，填补了该领域的研究空白。

Method: 通过评估三种先进的LLM编码代理（Claude Code、OpenAI Codex和Gemini）在Python、JavaScript和Java中的300个项目，采用三层依赖框架（声明依赖、工作依赖和运行时依赖）量化执行可重复性。

Result: 结果显示，仅有68.3%的项目可直接运行，语言间差异显著（Python 89.2%，Java 44.0%），且实际运行时依赖平均是声明依赖的13.5倍。

Conclusion: 研究发现，LLM生成的代码在干净环境中执行的可靠性有限，仅有68.3%的项目可直接运行，且存在大量未声明的依赖关系。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) as coding agents promises to accelerate software development, but their impact on generated code reproducibility remains largely unexplored. This paper presents an empirical study investigating whether LLM-generated code can be executed successfully in a clean environment with only OS packages and using only the dependencies that the model specifies. We evaluate three state-of-the-art LLM coding agents (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and Gemini) across 300 projects generated from 100 standardized prompts in Python, JavaScript, and Java. We introduce a three-layer dependency framework (distinguishing between claimed, working, and runtime dependencies) to quantify execution reproducibility. Our results show that only 68.3% of projects execute out-of-the-box, with substantial variation across languages (Python 89.2%, Java 44.0%). We also find a 13.5 times average expansion from declared to actual runtime dependencies, revealing significant hidden dependencies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究开发者如何在实际中定义和参与'氛围编码'实践，以了解这一新兴现象。

Method: 通过扎根理论研究分析了20个氛围编码视频，包括7个直播编码会话（约16小时，254个提示）和13个观点视频（约5小时），并辅以活动持续时间和提示意图的额外分析。

Result: 发现行为谱系：一些氛围编码者几乎完全依赖AI而不检查代码，而另一些则检查并调整生成的输出。所有方法都必须应对生成的随机性，调试和优化常被描述为'掷骰子'。不同的心智模型影响了提示策略、评估实践和信任水平。

Conclusion: 这项研究揭示了AI驱动的'氛围编码'实践中的行为谱系，为软件工程的未来研究开辟了新方向，并指出了工具设计和教育的实际机会。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are reshaping software engineering by enabling "vibe coding," in which developers build software primarily through prompts rather than writing code. Although widely publicized as a productivity breakthrough, little is known about how practitioners actually define and engage in these practices. To shed light on this emerging phenomenon, we conducted a grounded theory study of 20 vibe-coding videos, including 7 live-streamed coding sessions (about 16 hours, 254 prompts) and 13 opinion videos (about 5 hours), supported by additional analysis of activity durations and prompt intents. Our findings reveal a spectrum of behaviors: some vibe coders rely almost entirely on AI without inspecting code, while others examine and adapt generated outputs. Across approaches, all must contend with the stochastic nature of generation, with debugging and refinement often described as "rolling the dice." Further, divergent mental models, shaped by vibe coders' expertise and reliance on AI, influence prompting strategies, evaluation practices, and levels of trust. These findings open new directions for research on the future of software engineering and point to practical opportunities for tool design and education.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: GraphLocator通过因果问题图（CIG）解决软件问题定位中的语义鸿沟，显著提升定位准确性和下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 问题定位任务在自动化软件工程中至关重要，但由于问题描述与源代码实现之间的语义鸿沟（表现为症状-原因不匹配和一对多不匹配），该任务极具挑战性。

Method: GraphLocator采用两阶段工作流程：首先在仓库图中定位症状顶点，然后通过迭代推理动态扩展CIG。关键创新是CIG，其中顶点代表发现的子问题及其关联代码实体，边编码它们之间的因果依赖关系。

Result: 实验表明，GraphLocator在三个真实数据集上表现优异：函数级召回率和精确度平均提升+19.49%和+11.89%；在症状-原因和一对多不匹配场景中，召回率分别提升+16.44%和+19.18%，精确度提升+7.78%和+13.23%；CIG在下游任务中带来28.74%的性能提升。

Conclusion: GraphLocator通过因果问题图（CIG）有效解决了问题定位任务中的症状-原因不匹配和一对多不匹配问题，显著提升了定位准确性和下游任务性能。

Abstract: The issue localization task aims to identify the locations in a software repository that requires modification given a natural language issue description. This task is fundamental yet challenging in automated software engineering due to the semantic gap between issue description and source code implementation. This gap manifests as two mismatches:(1) symptom-to-cause mismatches, where descriptions do not explicitly reveal underlying root causes; (2) one-to-many mismatches, where a single issue corresponds to multiple interdependent code entities. To address these two mismatches, we propose GraphLocator, an approach that mitigates symptom-to-cause mismatches through causal structure discovering and resolves one-to-many mismatches via dynamic issue disentangling. The key artifact is the causal issue graph (CIG), in which vertices represent discovered sub-issues along with their associated code entities, and edges encode the causal dependencies between them. The workflow of GraphLocator consists of two phases: symptom vertices locating and dynamic CIG discovering; it first identifies symptom locations on the repository graph, then dynamically expands the CIG by iteratively reasoning over neighboring vertices. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of GraphLocator: (1) Compared with baselines, GraphLocator achieves more accurate localization with average improvements of +19.49% in function-level recall and +11.89% in precision. (2) GraphLocator outperforms baselines on both symptom-to-cause and one-to-many mismatch scenarios, achieving recall improvement of +16.44% and +19.18%, precision improvement of +7.78% and +13.23%, respectively. (3) The CIG generated by GraphLocator yields the highest relative improvement, resulting in a 28.74% increase in performance on downstream resolving task.

*Qingyang Li,Yibiao Yang,Maolin Sun,Jiangchang Wu,Qingkai Shi,Yuming Zhou*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MultiConf is a novel method for compiler fault localization using adversarial configuration pairs and SBFL, outperforming existing techniques on GCC bugs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying and resolving compiler faults is essential but challenging due to the complexity and scale of modern compiler infrastructures.

Method: MultiConf constructs adversarial compilation configuration pairs (failing and passing) by selectively disabling bug-related fine-grained options, then uses SBFL and weighted voting for fault localization.

Result: MultiConf localizes 27 out of 60 GCC bugs at Top-1, outperforming Odfl(20) and Basic(21) by 35.0% and 28.6%, respectively.

Conclusion: MultiConf significantly outperforms existing compiler fault localization techniques, successfully localizing 27 out of 60 GCC bugs at the Top-1 file level, with improvements of 35.0% and 28.6% over state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Compilers are fundamental to modern software development, making the effective identification and resolution of compiler faults essential. However, localizing these faults to specific source files remains highly challenging due to the complexity and scale of modern compiler infrastructures. In this study, we propose MultiConf, a novel approach that automatically isolates compiler faults by constructing multiple pairs of adversarial compilation configurations. Each adversarial compilation configuration pair consists of a failing configuration and its corresponding passing configuration, which differ in only a small number of fine-grained options. MultiConf generates failing configurations through a lightweight construction process and derives the corresponding passing configurations by selectively disabling bug-related fine-grained options. We then employ a Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) formula to rank the suspiciousness of compiler source files. Each adversarial configuration pair independently produces a ranking, which is subsequently aggregated using a weighted voting scheme to derive a final suspiciousness ranking, enabling more accurate and robust fault localization. We evaluate MultiConf on a benchmark of 60 real-world GCC compiler bugs. The results demonstrate that MultiConf significantly outperforms existing compiler fault localization techniques in both effectiveness and efficiency. In particular, MultiConf successfully localizes 27 out of 60 bugs at the Top-1 file level, representing improvements of 35.0% and 28.6% over the two state-of-the-art approaches, Odfl(20) and Basic(21), respectively.

Abstract: Learning-based automated vulnerability repair (AVR) techniques that utilize fine-tuned language models have shown promise in generating vulnerability patches. However, questions remain about their ability to repair unseen vulnerabilities. Our empirical study reveals that state-of-the-art models often overfit to the training set and are evaluated using training, validation, and test sets that are not mutually exclusive. Furthermore, relying on match-based metrics that compare generated patches to reference fixes at the token level has some limitations, failing to account for the possibility of various valid ways to patch the vulnerability. In this paper, we examine the capabilities of state-of-the-art fine-tuned AVR models and the adequacy of match-based evaluation metrics in three ways. First, we apply semantic-preserving transformations to test sets in order to determine whether models truly learn robust vulnerability-repair patterns or simply rely on spurious features. Second, we re-split the training, validation, and test sets to be mutually exclusive and evaluate the models on the revised test set to assess their generalization capabilities. Third, we introduce L-AVRBench, a test-based benchmark tailored for learning-based AVR, to overcome the limitations of match-based metrics and examine the AVR models' true repair capabilities.

Motivation: 由于可见性不匹配、类型不一致和意外行为故障，编译器基础的CFI在大型C/C++软件中部署困难。

Method: CFIghter集成了全程序分析和引导式运行时监控，迭代应用最小必要的CFI调整，直到所有测试通过或剩余问题无法解决。

Result: 在四个GNU项目中，CFIghter解决了所有与可见性相关的构建错误，自动修复了95.8%的意外CFI违规，并在89%的间接控制流站点保持了严格执行。

Conclusion: CFIghter通过自动检测、分类和修复测试套件暴露的策略违规，实现了严格类型化的CFI在实际项目中的部署，无需手动修改源代码。

Abstract: Compiler-based Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) offers strong forward-edge protection but remains challenging to deploy in large C/C++ software due to visibility mismatches, type inconsistencies, and unintended behavioral failures. We present CFIghter, the first fully automated system that enables strict, type-based CFI in real-world projects by detecting, classifying, and repairing unintended policy violations exposed by the test suite. CFIghter integrates whole-program analysis with guided runtime monitoring and iteratively applies the minimal necessary adjustments to CFI enforcement only where required, stopping once all tests pass or remaining failures are deemed unresolvable. We evaluate CFIghter on four GNU projects. It resolves all visibility-related build errors and automatically repairs 95.8% of unintended CFI violations in the large, multi-library util-linux codebase, while retaining strict enforcement at over 89% of indirect control-flow sites. Across all subjects, CFIghter preserves strict type-based CFI for the majority of the codebase without requiring manual source-code changes, relying only on automatically generated visibility adjustments and localized enforcement scopes where necessary. These results show that automated compatibility repair makes strict compiler CFI practically deployable in mature, modular C software.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs如何降低攻击门槛，挑战传统安全假设，即利用漏洞需要技术专业知识。

Method: 提出了RSA（角色分配、场景预设和行动诱导）策略，通过社会工程手段操纵LLMs生成有效漏洞利用代码，测试了五种主流LLMs在Odoo平台上的表现。

Result: 在测试的CVE中，所有五种LLMs均能在3-4轮提示内生成至少一个有效漏洞利用代码，成功率100%。

Conclusion: LLMs的普及颠覆了传统软件工程的安全假设，使得非技术人员也能轻易发动攻击，这要求重新设计安全实践以适应新的威胁模型。

Abstract: LLMs democratize software engineering by enabling non-programmers to create applications, but this same accessibility fundamentally undermines security assumptions that have guided software engineering for decades. We show in this work how publicly available LLMs can be socially engineered to transform novices into capable attackers, challenging the foundational principle that exploitation requires technical expertise. To that end, we propose RSA (Role-assignment, Scenario-pretexting, and Action-solicitation), a pretexting strategy that manipulates LLMs into generating functional exploits despite their safety mechanisms. Testing against Odoo -- a widely used ERP platform, we evaluated five mainstream LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude, Microsoft Copilot, and DeepSeek) and achieved a 100% success rate: tested CVE yielded at least one working exploit within 3-4 prompting rounds. While prior work [13] found LLM-assisted attacks difficult and requiring manual effort, we demonstrate that this overhead can be eliminated entirely.
  Our findings invalidate core software engineering security principles: the distinction between technical and non-technical actors no longer provides valid threat models; technical complexity of vulnerability descriptions offers no protection when LLMs can abstract it away; and traditional security boundaries dissolve when the same tools that build software can be manipulated to break it. This represents a paradigm shift in software engineering -- we must redesign security practices for an era where exploitation requires only the ability to craft prompts, not understand code.

Conclusion: FasterPy是一个高效、低成本的框架，利用LLMs优化Python代码执行效率，结合RAG和LoRA技术，在PIE基准测试中表现优于现有模型。

Abstract: Code often suffers from performance bugs. These bugs necessitate the research and practice of code optimization. Traditional rule-based methods rely on manually designing and maintaining rules for specific performance bugs (e.g., redundant loops, repeated computations), making them labor-intensive and limited in applicability. In recent years, machine learning and deep learning-based methods have emerged as promising alternatives by learning optimization heuristics from annotated code corpora and performance measurements. However, these approaches usually depend on specific program representations and meticulously crafted training datasets, making them costly to develop and difficult to scale. With the booming of Large Language Models (LLMs), their remarkable capabilities in code generation have opened new avenues for automated code optimization. In this work, we proposed FasterPy, a low-cost and efficient framework that adapts LLMs to optimize the execution efficiency of Python code. FasterPy combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), supported by a knowledge base constructed from existing performance-improving code pairs and corresponding performance measurements, with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enhance code optimization performance. Our experimental results on the Performance Improving Code Edits (PIE) benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms existing models on multiple metrics. The FasterPy tool and the experimental results are available at https://github.com/WuYue22/fasterpy.

Abstract: Grey literature is essential to software engineering research as it captures practices and decisions that rarely appear in academic venues. However, collecting and assessing it at scale remains difficult because of their heterogeneous sources, formats, and APIs that impede reproducible, large-scale synthesis. To address this issue, we present GLiSE, a prompt-driven tool that turns a research topic prompt into platform-specific queries, gathers results from common software-engineering web sources (GitHub, Stack Overflow) and Google Search, and uses embedding-based semantic classifiers to filter and rank results according to their relevance. GLiSE is designed for reproducibility with all settings being configuration-based, and every generated query being accessible. In this paper, (i) we present the GLiSE tool, (ii) provide a curated dataset of software engineering grey-literature search results classified by semantic relevance to their originating search intent, and (iii) conduct an empirical study on the usability of our tool.

Conclusion: GenAI工具在软件工程中的广泛采用正在重新定义而非取代从业者的角色，尽管存在对就业市场收缩和技能转变的担忧。

Abstract: Context. GenAI tools are being increasingly adopted by practitioners in SE, promising support for several SE activities. Despite increasing adoption, we still lack empirical evidence on how GenAI is used in practice, the benefits it provides, the challenges it introduces, and its broader organizational and societal implications. Objective. This study aims to provide an overview of the status of GenAI adoption in SE. It investigates the status of GenAI adoption, associated benefits and challenges, institutionalization of tools and techniques, and anticipated long term impacts on SE professionals and the community. Results. The results indicate a wide adoption of GenAI tools and how they are deeply integrated into daily SE work, particularly for implementation, verification and validation, personal assistance, and maintenance-related tasks. Practitioners report substantial benefits, most notably reduction in cycle time, quality improvements, enhanced support in knowledge work, and productivity gains. However, objective measurement of productivity and quality remains limited in practice. Significant challenges persist, including incorrect or unreliable outputs, prompt engineering difficulties, validation overhead, security and privacy concerns, and risks of overreliance. Institutionalization of tools and techniques seems to be common, but it varies considerably, with a strong focus on tool access and less emphasis on training and governance. Practitioners expect GenAI to redefine rather than replace their roles, while expressing moderate concern about job market contraction and skill shifts.

Motivation: AI模型的快速增长带来了复杂的安全挑战，但缺乏对常见安全问题和解决方案的了解。

Method: 结合关键词匹配和优化的distilBERT分类器构建管道，分析了312,868条安全讨论，并对753条帖子进行了主题分析。

Conclusion: 研究通过实证调查揭示了AI供应链中的安全问题和解决方案，为开发者和研究人员提供了基于证据的指导。

Abstract: The rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models and applications has led to an increasingly complex security landscape. Developers of AI projects must contend not only with traditional software supply chain issues but also with novel, AI-specific security threats. However, little is known about what security issues are commonly encountered and how they are resolved in practice. This gap hinders the development of effective security measures for each component of the AI supply chain. We bridge this gap by conducting an empirical investigation of developer-reported issues and solutions, based on discussions from Hugging Face and GitHub. To identify security-related discussions, we develop a pipeline that combines keyword matching with an optimal fine-tuned distilBERT classifier, which achieved the best performance in our extensive comparison of various deep learning and large language models. This pipeline produces a dataset of 312,868 security discussions, providing insights into the security reporting practices of AI applications and projects. We conduct a thematic analysis of 753 posts sampled from our dataset and uncover a fine-grained taxonomy of 32 security issues and 24 solutions across four themes: (1) System and Software, (2) External Tools and Ecosystem, (3) Model, and (4) Data. We reveal that many security issues arise from the complex dependencies and black-box nature of AI components. Notably, challenges related to Models and Data often lack concrete solutions. Our insights can offer evidence-based guidance for developers and researchers to address real-world security threats across the AI supply chain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生产环境中经常因反应式扩展行为、有限的应用级信号使用和不透明的控制逻辑导致SLO违规和成本效率低下。

Method: 提出了一个安全且可解释的多信号自动扩展框架，整合了SLO感知和成本意识的控制与轻量级需求预测。

Result: 实验评估显示，与默认和调优的Kubernetes自动扩展基线相比，该方法将SLO违规持续时间减少了31%，扩展响应时间提高了24%，基础设施成本降低了18%。

Conclusion: AIOps驱动的、以SLO优先的自动扩展可以显著提高基于Kubernetes的云平台的可靠性、效率和操作可信度。

Abstract: Kubernetes provides native autoscaling mechanisms, including the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, Vertical Pod Autoscaler, and node-level autoscalers, to enable elastic resource management for cloud-native applications. However, production environments frequently experience Service Level Objective violations and cost inefficiencies due to reactive scaling behavior, limited use of application-level signals, and opaque control logic. This paper investigates how Kubernetes autoscaling can be enhanced using AIOps principles to jointly satisfy SLO and cost constraints under diverse workload patterns without compromising safety or operational transparency. We present a gap-driven analysis of existing autoscaling approaches and propose a safe and explainable multi-signal autoscaling framework that integrates SLO-aware and cost-conscious control with lightweight demand forecasting. Experimental evaluation using representative microservice and event-driven workloads shows that the proposed approach reduces SLO violation duration by up to 31 percent, improves scaling response time by 24 percent, and lowers infrastructure cost by 18 percent compared to default and tuned Kubernetes autoscaling baselines, while maintaining stable and auditable control behavior. These results demonstrate that AIOps-driven, SLO-first autoscaling can significantly improve the reliability, efficiency, and operational trustworthiness of Kubernetes-based cloud platforms.

TL;DR: EnCoMSAS工具能有效监测自适应系统的能耗，对整体系统能耗影响小，验证了动态适应中能耗监测的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据中心能耗持续增长，动态适应方法可减少运行时能耗，但缺乏有效的能耗监测工具以实现能耗感知。

Method: 引入EnCoMSAS工具，通过Adaptable TeaStore案例研究进行实证分析，模拟不同工作负载条件下的用户交互。

Result: EnCoMSAS能有效收集能耗数据，CPU使用率与能耗相关性验证了数据有效性，能耗受算法复杂度和部署环境影响，工具本身对整体能耗影响较小。

Conclusion: EnCoMSAS工具在运行时有效收集软件应用的能耗数据，支持动态适应，且对SAS生态系统的整体能耗影响较小。

Abstract: [Context and Motivation] Global energy consumption has been steadily increasing in recent years, with data centers emerging as major contributors. This growth is largely driven by the widespread migration of applications to the Cloud, alongside a rising number of users consuming digital content. Dynamic adaptation (or self-adaptive) approaches appear as a way to reduce, at runtime and under certain constraints, the energy consumption of software applications.
  [Question/Problem] Despite efforts to make energy-efficiency a primary goal in the dynamic adaptation of software applications, there is still a gap in understanding how to equip these self-adaptive software systems (SAS), which are dynamically adapted at runtime, with effective energy consumption monitoring tools that enable energy-awareness. Furthermore, the extent to which such an energy consumption monitoring tool impacts the overall energy consumption of the SAS ecosystem has not yet been thoroughly explored.
  [Methodology] To address this gap, we introduce the EnCoMSAS (Energy Consumption Monitoring for Self-Adaptive Systems) tool that allows to gather the energy consumed by distributed software applications deployed, for instance, in the Cloud. EnCoMSAS enables the evaluation of energy consumption of SAS variants at runtime. It allows to integrate energy-efficiency as a main goal in the analysis and execution of new adaptation plans for the SAS. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of EnCoMSAS and investigate its impact on the overall energy consumption of the SAS ecosystem, we conduct an empirical study by using the Adaptable TeaStore case study. Adaptable TeaStore is a self-adaptive extension of the TeaStore application, a microservice benchmarking application. For this study, we focus on the recommender service of Adaptable TeaStore. Regarding the experiments, we first equip Adaptable TeaStore with EnCoMSAS. Next, we execute Adaptable TeaStore by varying workload conditions that simulate users interactions. Finally, we use EnCoMSAS for gathering and assessing the energy consumption of the recommender algorithms of Adaptable TeaStore. To run these experiments, we use nodes of the Grid5000 testbed.
  [Results] The results show that EnCoMSAS is effective in collecting energy consumption of software applications for enabling dynamic adaptation at runtime. The observed correlation between CPU usage and energy consumption collected by EnCoMSAS provides evidence supporting the validity of the collected energy measurements. Moreover, we point out, through EnCoMSAS, that energy consumption is influenced not only by the algorithmic complexity but also by the characteristics of the deployment environment. Finally, the results show that the impact of EnCoMSAS on the overall energy consumption of the SAS ecosystem is comparatively modest with respect to the entire set of the TeaStore applications microservices.

Motivation: 现代云架构需要自适应能力来管理动态操作条件，但现有解决方案通常采用不适合微服务分散性质的集中控制模型。

Method: AdaptiFlow框架利用自主计算的成熟原则，提供专注于MAPE-K循环的监控和执行阶段的抽象层。通过将指标收集和动作执行与适应逻辑解耦，AdaptiFlow使微服务能够通过标准化接口演变为自主元素。

Result: 通过增强的Adaptable TeaStore基准验证，展示了三种适应场景的实际实现，包括自愈（数据库恢复）、自保护（DDoS缓解）和自优化（流量管理），每个服务只需最小代码修改。

Conclusion: 该研究将自主计算理论与云原生实践相结合，为构建弹性分布式系统提供了概念框架和具体工具。未来工作包括与正式协调模型的集成以及应用依赖AI代理的适应技术，以应对复杂的适应场景。

Abstract: Modern cloud architectures demand self-adaptive capabilities to manage dynamic operational conditions. Yet, existing solutions often impose centralized control models ill-suited to microservices decentralized nature. This paper presents AdaptiFlow, a framework that leverages well-established principles of autonomous computing to provide abstraction layers focused on the Monitor and Execute phases of the MAPE-K loop. By decoupling metrics collection and action execution from adaptation logic, AdaptiFlow enables microservices to evolve into autonomous elements through standardized interfaces, preserving their architectural independence while enabling system-wide adaptability. The framework introduces: (1) Metrics Collectors for unified infrastructure/business metric gathering, (2) Adaptation Actions as declarative actuators for runtime adjustments, and (3) a lightweight Event-Driven and rule-based mechanism for adaptation logic specification. Validation through the enhanced Adaptable TeaStore benchmark demonstrates practical implementation of three adaptation scenarios targeting three levels of autonomy self-healing (database recovery), self-protection (DDoS mitigation), and self-optimization (traffic management) with minimal code modification per service. Key innovations include a workflow for service instrumentation and evidence that decentralized adaptation can emerge from localized decisions without global coordination. The work bridges autonomic computing theory with cloud-native practice, providing both a conceptual framework and concrete tools for building resilient distributed systems. Future work includes integration with formal coordination models and application of adaptation techniques relying on AI agents for proactive adaptation to address complex adaptation scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法有效检测多步推理中的复杂逻辑错误，而LLM在关键领域的应用需要更高的逻辑严谨性。

Method: 将自然语言推理转化为一阶逻辑（FOL），并应用自动定理证明器逐步验证逻辑有效性。

Result: 在10,830个推理实例的基准测试中，MATP在推理步骤验证上比基于提示的基线方法高出42个百分点。

Conclusion: MATP框架通过多步自动定理证明显著提升了LLM生成推理的可信度，揭示了模型间的逻辑一致性差异。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, leading to their adoption in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, and scientific research. However, their reasoning often contains subtle logical errors masked by fluent language, posing significant risks for critical applications. While existing approaches like fact-checking, self-consistency methods, and rule-based validation provide partial solutions, they fail to detect complex logical flaws in multi-step reasoning.
  To overcome these challenges, we present MATP, an evaluation framework for systematically verifying LLM reasoning via Multi-step Automatic Theorem Proving. MATP translates natural language reasoning into First-Order Logic (FOL) and applies automated theorem provers to assess step-by-step logical validity. This approach identifies hidden logical errors and provides fine-grained classifications of reasoning correctness. Evaluations on a benchmark comprising 10,830 reasoning instances generated by 10 LLMs across tasks from PrOntoQA-OOD, ProofWriter, and FOLIO show that MATP surpasses prompting-based baselines by over 42 percentage points in reasoning step verification. It further reveals model-level disparities, with reasoning models generating more logically coherent outputs than general models. These results demonstrate MATP's potential to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM-generated reasoning.

Therefore, this paper proposes a parallelization method for autonomous driving software using the Model-Based Development (MBD) process. The proposed method extends the existing Model-Based Parallelizer (MBP) method to facilitate the implementation of complex processing. As a result, execution time was reduced. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method is suitable for the development of autonomous driving software, particularly in achieving real-time performance.

Conclusion: 本文提出的MBD框架成功解决了ROS 2兼容模型在多输入场景下的并行化问题，显著减少了执行时间，验证了并行化的有效性。

Abstract: In recent years, the complexity and scale of embedded systems, especially in the rapidly developing field of autonomous driving systems, have increased significantly. This has led to the adoption of software and hardware approaches such as Robot Operating System (ROS) 2 and multi-core processors. Traditional manual program parallelization faces challenges, including maintaining data integrity and avoiding concurrency issues such as deadlocks. While model-based development (MBD) automates this process, it encounters difficulties with the integration of modern frameworks such as ROS 2 in multi-input scenarios. This paper proposes an MBD framework to overcome these issues, categorizing ROS 2-compatible Simulink models into event-driven and timer-driven types for targeted parallelization. As a result, it extends the conventional parallelization by MBD and supports parallelized code generation for ROS 2-based models with multiple inputs. The evaluation results show that after applying parallelization with the proposed framework, all patterns show a reduction in execution time, confirming the effectiveness of parallelization.

Result: 证明了问题在参数p和代理数量下是计算困难的，但在容忍轻微嫉妒时，可以高效解决。

Conclusion: 研究解决了Envy-Free Incomplete Connected Fair Division问题的计算复杂性，展示了在容忍轻微嫉妒的情况下，问题可以高效解决。

Abstract: We study the problem of Envy-Free Incomplete Connected Fair Division, where exactly p vertices of an undirected graph must be allocated to agents such that each agent receives a connected share and does not envy another agent's share. Focusing on agents with additive valuations, we show that the problem remains computationally hard when parameterized by p and the number of agents. This result holds even for star graphs and with the input numbers given in unary representation, thereby resolving an open problem posed by Gahlawat and Zehavi (FSTTCS 2023).
  In stark contrast, we show that if one is willing to tolerate even the slightest amount of envy, then the problem becomes efficient with respect to the natural parameters. Specifically, we design an Efficient Parameterized Approximation Scheme parameterized by p and the number of agent types. Our algorithm works on general graphs and remains efficient even when the input numbers are provided in binary representation.

Conclusion: 本文证明了在一般图中，使用$n^{1-Ω_\varepsilon(1)}$空间可以实现$(1/2-\varepsilon)$-近似最大有向割值，表明Kapralov和Krachun的下界是紧的，从而解决了这一基本问题的近似复杂性。

Abstract: We study streaming algorithms for the maximum directed cut problem. The edges of an $n$-vertex directed graph arrive one by one in an arbitrary order, and the goal is to estimate the value of the maximum directed cut using a single pass and small space. With $O(n)$ space, a $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximation can be trivially obtained for any fixed $\varepsilon > 0$ using additive cut sparsifiers. The question that has attracted significant attention in the literature is the best approximation achievable by algorithms that use truly sublinear (i.e., $n^{1-Ω(1)}$) space.
  A lower bound of Kapralov and Krachun (STOC'20) implies .5-approximation is the best one can hope for. The current best algorithm for general graphs obtains a .485-approximation due to the work of Saxena, Singer, Sudan, and Velusamy (FOCS'23). The same authors later obtained a $(1/2-\varepsilon)$-approximation, assuming that the graph is constant-degree (SODA'25).
  In this paper, we show that for any $\varepsilon > 0$, a $(1/2-\varepsilon)$-approximation of maximum dicut value can be obtained with $n^{1-Ω_\varepsilon(1)}$ space in *general graphs*. This shows that the lower bound of Kapralov and Krachun is generally tight, settling the approximation complexity of this fundamental problem. The key to our result is a careful analysis of how correlation propagates among high- and low-degree vertices, when simulating a suitable local algorithm.

Conclusion: 本文提出了针对图参数化问题的线性核和FPT算法，并指出在某些参数下不存在多项式核。

Abstract: Recently, Lafond and Luo [MFCS 2023] defined the $\mathcal{G}$-modular cardinality of a graph $G$ as the minimum size of a partition of $V(G)$ into modules that belong to a graph class $\mathcal{G}$. We analyze the complexity of calculating parameters that generalize interval graphs when parameterized by the $\mathcal{G}$-modular cardinality, where $\mathcal{G}$ corresponds either to the class of interval graphs or to the union of complete graphs. Namely, we analyze the complexity of computing the thinness and the simultaneous interval number of a graph.
  We present a linear kernel for the Thinness problem parameterized by the interval-modular cardinality and an FPT algorithm for Simultaneous Interval Number when parameterized by the cluster-modular cardinality plus the solution size. The interval-modular cardinality of a graph is not greater than the cluster-modular cardinality, which in turn generalizes the neighborhood diversity and the twin-cover number. Thus, our results imply a linear kernel for Thinness when parameterized by the neighborhood diversity of the input graph, FPT algorithms for Thinness when parameterized by the twin-cover number and vertex cover number, and FPT algorithms for Simultaneous Interval Number when parameterized by the neighborhood diversity plus the solution size, twin-cover number, and vertex cover number. To the best of our knowledge, prior to our work no parameterized algorithms (FPT or XP) for computing the thinness or the simultaneous interval number were known.
  On the negative side, we observe that Thinness and Simultaneous Interval Number parameterized by treewidth, pathwidth, bandwidth, (linear) mim-width, clique-width, modular-width, or even the thinness or simultaneous interval number themselves, admit no polynomial kernels assuming NP $\not\subseteq$ coNP/poly.

Abstract: The block tree [Belazzougui et al., J. Comput. Syst. Sci. '21] is a compressed representation of a length-$n$ text that supports access, rank, and select queries while requiring only $O(z\log\frac{n}{z})$ words of space, where $z$ is the number of Lempel-Ziv factors of the text. In other words, its space-requirements are asymptotically similar to those of the compressed text. In practice, block trees offer comparable query performance to state-of-the-art compressed rank and select indices. However, their construction is significantly slower. Additionally, the fastest construction algorithms require a significant amount of working memory. To address this issue, we propose fast and lightweight parallel algorithms for the efficient construction of block trees. Our algorithm achieves similar speed than the currently fastest construction algorithm on one core and is up to four times faster using 64 cores. It achieves all that while requiring an order of magnitude less memory. As result of independent interest, we present a data parallel algorithm for Karp-Rabin fingerprint computation.

Conclusion: 本文提出了首个针对并行计算环境（PRAM）的距离敏感预言机（DSO）算法，能够在预处理后以O(1)时间回答查询，并解决了其他几个图问题的工作最优PRAM算法。

Abstract: The distance sensitivity oracle (DSO) problem asks us to preprocess a given graph $G=(V,E)$ in order to answer queries of the form $d(x,y,e)$, which denotes the shortest path distance in $G$ from vertex $x$ to vertex $y$ when edge $e$ is removed. This is an important problem for network communication, and it has been extensively studied in the sequential settingand recently in the distributed CONGEST model. However, no prior DSO results tailored to the parallel setting were known.
  We present the first PRAM algorithms to construct DSOs in directed weighted graphs, that can answer a query in $O(1)$ time with a single processor after preprocessing. We also present the first work-optimal PRAM algorithms for other graph problems that belong to the sequential $\tilde{O}(mn)$ fine-grained complexity class: Replacement Paths, Second Simple Shortest Path, All Pairs Second Simple Shortest Paths and Minimum Weight Cycle.

Abstract: Subgraph complementation is an operation that toggles all adjacencies inside a selected vertex set. Given a graph \(G\) and a target class \(\mathcal{C}\), the Minimum Subgraph Complementation problem asks for a minimum-size vertex set \(S\) such that complementing the subgraph induced by \(S\) transforms \(G\) into a graph belonging to \(\mathcal{C}\). While the decision version of Subgraph Complementation has been extensively studied and is NP-complete for many graph classes, the algorithmic complexity of its optimization variant has remained largely unexplored.
  In this paper, we study MSC from an algorithmic perspective. We present polynomial-time algorithms for MSC in several nontrivial settings. Our results include polynomial-time solvability for transforming graphs between bipartite, co-bipartite, and split graphs, as well as for complementing bipartite regular graphs into chordal graphs. We also show that MSC to the class of graphs of fixed degeneracy can be solved in polynomial time when the input graph is a forest. Moreover, we investigate MSC with respect to connectivity and prove that MSC to the class of disconnected graphs and to the class of 2-connected graphs can be solved in polynomial time for arbitrary inputs.

Conclusion: GPU-Virt-Bench框架为多租户环境中GPU资源部署提供了系统化的评估工具，揭示了不同虚拟化方案的性能特性，为生产部署决策提供了关键见解。

Abstract: The proliferation of GPU-accelerated workloads, particularly in artificial intelligence and large language model (LLM) inference, has created unprecedented demand for efficient GPU resource sharing in cloud and container environments. While NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) technology provides hardware-level isolation, its availability is limited to high-end datacenter GPUs. Software-based virtualization solutions such as HAMi-core and BUD-FCSP offer alternatives for broader GPU families but lack standardized evaluation methodologies. We present GPU-Virt-Bench, a comprehensive benchmarking framework that evaluates GPU virtualization systems across 56 performance metrics organized into 10 categories. Our framework measures overhead, isolation quality, LLM-specific performance, memory bandwidth, cache behavior, PCIe throughput, multi-GPU communication, scheduling efficiency, memory fragmentation, and error recovery. GPU-Virt-Bench enables systematic comparison between software virtualization approaches and ideal MIG behavior, providing actionable insights for practitioners deploying GPU resources in multi-tenant environments. We demonstrate the framework's utility through evaluation of HAMi-core, BUD-FCSP, and simulated MIG baselines, revealing performance characteristics critical for production deployment decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从注意力经济到Agentic Web时代的数据锁定和认知过载问题，实现从‘消磨时间’到‘节省时间’的根本转变。

Method: 通过解耦存储、计算和交互的正交设计，结合基于A2A协议的Intent-Permission Handshake机制，实现数据作为持久资产、模型作为临时工具的架构原则。

Result: 实证评估显示，该范式在跨平台服务迁移和复杂任务执行中减少了约27-35%的token消耗，多模态复杂任务编排中用户认知负载比标准RAG架构减少72%，比手动工作流减少88%，同时显著提升了信息信噪比（SNR）。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的Sovereign Digital Avatar（SoDA）范式是实现高效、低摩擦和去中心化Agentic Web的关键交互基础设施。

Abstract: As the internet evolves from the mobile App-dominated Attention Economy to the Intent-Interconnection of the Agentic Web era, existing interaction modes fail to address the escalating challenges of data lock-in and cognitive overload. Addressing this, we defines a future-oriented user sovereignty interaction paradigm, aiming to realize a fundamental shift from killing time to saving time. Specifically, we argue that decoupling memory from application logic eliminates the structural basis of data lock-in, while shifting from explicit manual instruction to implicit intent alignment resolves cognitive overload by offloading execution complexity. This paradigm is implemented via the Sovereign Digital Avatar (SoDA), which employs an orthogonal decoupling design of storage, computation, and interaction. This establishes the architectural principle of data as a persistent asset, model as a transient tool, fundamentally breaking the platform monopoly on user memory. To support the operation of this new paradigm in zero-trust environments, we design an Intent-Permission Handshake Mechanism based on A2A protocols, utilizing dual-factor (Sensitivity Coefficient and Strictness Parameter) adaptive routing to achieve active risk governance. Empirical evaluation with a high-fidelity simulation environment indicates that this paradigm reduces token consumption by approximately 27-35\% during cross-platform service migration and complex task execution. Furthermore, in the orchestration of multi-modal complex tasks, it reduces user cognitive load by 72\% compared to standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures, by 88\% relative to manual workflows, while significantly boosting the Information Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). These results demonstrate that the SoDA is the essential interaction infrastructure for building an efficient, low-friction, and decentralized Agentic Web.

Abstract: Deep distributed networks (DNNs) have become central to modern computer vision, yet their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices remains hindered by substantial parameter counts and computational demands. Here, we present an approach to the efficient deployment of distributed DNNs that jointly respects hardware limitations and preserves task performance. Our method integrates a structured model pruning with a multi-objective optimization to tailor network capacity to heterogeneous device constraints. We demonstrate this framework using Multi-View Convolutional Neural Network (MVCNN), a state-of-the-art architecture for 3D object recognition, by quantifying the contribution of individual views to classification accuracy and allocating pruning budgets, respectively. Experimental results show that the resulting models satisfy user-specified bounds on accuracy and memory footprint while reducing inference latency by factors ranging from 1.2x to 5.0x across diverse hardware platforms. These findings suggest that performance-aware, view-adaptive compression provides a viable pathway for deploying complex vision models in distributed edge environments.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: HybridFlow是一个资源自适应的推理框架，通过动态任务分解和智能路由，优化边缘-云协作中的LLM推理效率和资源利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有边缘-云协作方法采用粗粒度任务分配策略，无法利用细粒度推理并行性，导致冗余计算和资源利用效率低下。

Method: HybridFlow采用两阶段方法：1）任务分解与并行执行，动态拆分复杂查询为可并行执行的子任务；2）资源感知子任务路由，根据预测效用增益和实时预算状态自适应分配子任务到边缘或云端模型。

Result: 在GPQA、MMLU-Pro、AIME和LiveBench-Reasoning上的综合评估表明，HybridFlow显著减少了推理时间和token使用，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: HybridFlow通过动态任务分解和资源感知的子任务路由，有效减少了端到端推理时间和总体token使用，同时保持了竞争力准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive reasoning and problem-solving abilities, yet their substantial inference latency and token consumption pose major challenges for real-time deployment on resource-limited edge devices. Recent efforts toward edge-cloud collaboration have attempted to mitigate this issue, but most existing methods adopt coarse-grained task allocation strategies-assigning entire queries either to the edge or the cloud. Such rigid partitioning fails to exploit fine-grained reasoning parallelism and often leads to redundant computation and inefficient resource utilization. To this end, we propose HybridFlow, a resource-adaptive inference framework that enables fast and token-efficient collaborative reasoning between edge and cloud LLMs. HybridFlow operates in two stages: (1) task decomposition and parallel execution, which dynamically splits a complex query into interdependent subtasks that can execute as soon as their dependencies are resolved; and (2) resource-aware subtask routing, where a learned router adaptively assigns each subtask to the edge or cloud model according to predicted utility gains and real-time budget states. Comprehensive evaluations on GPQA, MMLU-Pro, AIME, and LiveBench-Reasoning demonstrate that HybridFlow effectively reduces end-to-end inference time and overall token usage while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: HLS4PC框架通过FPGA加速和硬件优化技术，显著提升了3D点云模型的实时性能，为安全关键应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Point-based 3D point cloud models employ computation and memory intensive mapping functions alongside NN layers for classification/segmentation, and are executed on server-grade GPUs. The sparse, and unstructured nature of 3D point cloud data leads to high memory and computational demand, hindering real-time performance in safety critical applications due to GPU under-utilization. To address this challenge, we present HLS4PC, a parameterizable HLS framework for FPGA acceleration. Our approach leverages FPGA parallelization and algorithmic optimizations to enable efficient fixed-point implementations of both mapping and NN functions. We explore several hardware-aware compression techniques on a state-of-the-art PointMLP-Elite model, including replacing FPS with URS, parameter quantization, layer fusion, and input-points pruning, yielding PointMLP-Lite, a 4x less complex variant with only 2% accuracy drop on ModelNet40. Secondly, we demonstrate that the FPGA acceleration of the PointMLP-Lite results in 3.56x higher throughput than previous works. Furthermore, our implementation achieves 2.3x and 22x higher throughput compared to the GPU and CPU implementations, respectively.

Motivation: 当前基础模型训练高度依赖大型云数据中心，成本高昂且集中化。边缘设备训练虽然具有潜力，但现有方法在性能、可扩展性和设备异构性处理上存在不足。

Method: 通过选择性混合张量并行方法和参数服务器中心化训练框架，Cleave 解决了设备内存限制和通信瓶颈问题。

Conclusion: Cleave 提供了一种高效的边缘设备训练范式，能够与云端 GPU 训练相媲美，并在设备故障处理上显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: The ecosystem behind foundation model development today is highly centralized and limited to large-scale cloud data center operators: training foundation models is costly, needing immense compute resources. Decentralized foundation model training across edge devices, leveraging their spare compute, promises a democratized alternative. However, existing edge-training approaches fall short: they struggle to match cloud-based training performance, exhibit limited scalability with model size, exceed device memory capacity, and have prohibitive communication overhead. They also fail to satisfactorily handle device heterogeneity and dynamism.
  We introduce a new paradigm, Cleave, which finely partitions training operations through a novel selective hybrid tensor parallelism method. Together with a parameter server centric training framework, Cleave copes with device memory limits and avoids communication bottlenecks, thereby enabling efficient training of large models on par with the cloud. Further, with a cost optimization model to guide device selection and training workload distribution, Cleave effectively accounts for device heterogeneity and churn.
  Our evaluations show that Cleave matches cloud-based GPU training by scaling efficiently to larger models and thousands of devices, supporting up to 8x more devices than baseline edge-training approaches. It outperforms state-of-the-art edge training methods by up to a factor of 10 in per-batch training time and efficiently handles device failures, achieving at least 100x faster recovery than prior methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需完整构建的LLM框架，通过性能反馈和自动修复优化GPU内核，实现跨平台高效加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高性能计算中，热点GPU内核是主要瓶颈，专家手动调优成本高且难以移植。现有大语言模型方法通常假设内核可以廉价编译和执行，但在大型应用中，完整构建和运行成本高昂。

Method: 提出了一个端到端的LLM框架，通过性能反馈优化内核，无需构建完整应用程序。框架自动将独立提取的热点内核代码补全为最小可执行程序（MEP），并在完整应用程序外进行多轮迭代优化和评估。集成了自动错误修复和性能模式继承，以修复错误、保持正确性、重用有效的分块/内存/同步策略，并降低搜索成本。

Result: 在NVIDIA GPU和Haiguang DCU平台上评估，使用PolyBench、AMD APP SDK和大型超级计算应用的热点内核，平均加速比分别为5.05倍（PolyBench on NVIDIA）、7.77倍（PolyBench on DCU）、1.77倍（AMD APP SDK）和1.25倍（三个热点内核），优于直接LLM优化。

Conclusion: 该方法无需完整源代码依赖，具有跨平台可移植性，实现了实用且低成本的GPU内核优化。

Abstract: In high-performance computing, hotspot GPU kernels are primary bottlenecks, and expert manual tuning is costly and hard to port. Large language model methods often assume kernels can be compiled and executed cheaply, which fails in large applications where full builds and runs are expensive. We present an end-to-end LLM framework with performance feedback that optimizes kernels without building the full application. From independently extracted hotspot kernels, it automatically completes code into a Minimal Executable Program (MEP), then performs multi-round iterative optimization and evaluation outside the full application. The framework integrates Automatic Error Repair and Performance Pattern Inheritance to fix faults, preserve correctness, reuse effective tiling/memory/synchronization strategies, and reduce search cost. Optimized variants are reintegrated into the original application for validation. We evaluate on NVIDIA GPUs and the Haiguang Deep Computing Unit (DCU) platform (AMD-licensed architecture) using PolyBench, the AMD APP SDK, and hotspot kernels from large-scale supercomputing applications. The method achieves average speedups of 5.05x (PolyBench on NVIDIA), 7.77x (PolyBench on DCU), 1.77x (AMD APP SDK), and 1.25x on three hotspot kernels, surpassing direct LLM optimization. The approach requires no full-source dependencies, offers cross-platform portability, and enables practical, low-cost GPU kernel optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式机器学习工作负载在高速互连的GPU集群中运行时，集体通信的尾部延迟成为主要瓶颈，传统RDMA传输的严格可靠性和有序交付机制在此场景下表现不佳。

Method: OptiNIC摒弃了传统的重传和有序交付机制，采用最佳努力和无序传输模型，并引入自适应超时机制以触发进度推进。

Result: OptiNIC在公共云环境中实现了时间到准确度（TTA）提升2倍，吞吐量提升1.6倍，99%尾部延迟降低3.5倍，BRAM使用减少2.7倍，并显著提升了NIC的容错能力。

Conclusion: OptiNIC通过重新定义RDMA传输的可靠性保证，针对分布式机器学习工作负载进行了优化，显著提升了性能和弹性。

Abstract: As distributed machine learning (ML) workloads scale to thousands of GPUs connected by high-speed interconnects, tail latency in collective communication has become a major bottleneck. Existing RDMA transports, such as RoCE, IRN, SRNIC, and Falcon, enforce strict reliability and in-order delivery, relying on retransmissions and packet sequencing to ensure correctness. While these approaches work well for general-purpose workloads, they introduce complexity and latency that scale poorly in ML, where even rare packet delays can stall entire model pipelines.
  We present OptiNIC, a domain-specific RDMA transport that revisits traditional reliability guarantees based on ML's tolerance for partial or missing data. OptiNIC eliminates retransmissions and in-order delivery from the NIC, enabling a best-effort, out-of-order transport model for RDMA. Unlike traditional RDMA, which signals completion only after complete data delivery, OptiNIC introduces adaptive timeouts to trigger forward progress when data may be lost or delayed. OptiNIC retains standard congestion control mechanisms (e.g., DCQCN, EQDS, or Swift) while shifting loss recovery to the ML pipeline itself (e.g., via the Hadamard Transform and Erasure Coding).
  Our evaluation shows that OptiNIC improves time-to-accuracy (TTA) by 2x and increases throughput by 1.6x for training and inference, respectively, across two public clouds (i.e., Hyperstack and CloudLab). OptiNIC also lowers 99th-percentile latency by 3.5x, cuts BRAM usage by 2.7x, and nearly doubles NIC resilience to faults-delivering a resilient, tail-optimized RDMA transport purpose-built for distributed ML workloads.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by large language models have emerged as a promising paradigm for solving complex reasoning tasks through collaborative intelligence. However, efficiently deploying these systems on serverless GPU platforms presents significant resource allocation challenges due to heterogeneous agent workloads, varying computational demands, and the need for cost-effective scaling. This paper presents an adaptive GPU resource allocation framework that achieves 85\% latency reduction compared to round-robin scheduling while maintaining comparable throughput to static allocation, using an $O(N)$ complexity algorithm for real-time adaptation. Our approach dynamically allocates GPU resources based on workload characteristics, agent priorities, and minimum resource requirements, enabling efficient utilization while maintaining quality of service. The framework addresses three key challenges: (1) heterogeneous computational demands across lightweight coordinators and heavyweight specialists, (2) dynamic workload fluctuations requiring millisecond-scale reallocation, and (3) capacity constraints in serverless environments. Through comprehensive simulations modeling realistic multi-agent workflows with four heterogeneous agents, we demonstrate that adaptive allocation outperforms static equal and round-robin strategies across latency, cost, and GPU utilization metrics. The framework provides a practical solution for deploying cost-efficient multi-agent AI systems on serverless GPU infrastructure.

Conclusion: Local Rendezvous Hashing (LRH) 在保持令牌环的同时，通过限制候选节点数量，显著提高了负载均衡性和性能，接近多探针一致性哈希的平衡性，同时大幅提升了速度。

Abstract: Consistent hashing is fundamental to distributed systems, but ring-based schemes can exhibit high peak-to-average load ratios unless they use many virtual nodes, while multi-probe methods improve balance at the cost of scattered memory accesses. This paper introduces Local Rendezvous Hashing (LRH), which preserves a token ring but restricts Highest Random Weight (HRW) selection to a cache-local window of C distinct neighboring physical nodes. LRH locates a key by one binary search, enumerates exactly C distinct candidates using precomputed next-distinct offsets, and chooses the HRW winner (optionally weighted). Lookup cost is O(log|R| + C). Under fixed-topology liveness changes, fixed-candidate filtering remaps only keys whose original winner is down, yielding zero excess churn. In a benchmark with N=5000, V=256 (|R|=1.28M), K=50M and C=8, LRH reduces Max/Avg load from 1.2785 to 1.0947 and achieves 60.05 Mkeys/s, about 6.8x faster than multi-probe consistent hashing with 8 probes (8.80 Mkeys/s) while approaching its balance (Max/Avg 1.0697). A microbenchmark indicates multi-probe assignment is dominated by repeated ring searches and memory traffic rather than probe-generation arithmetic.

TL;DR: TL是一个端到端框架，编译基于瓦片的程序到空间数据流加速器，解决了可编程性限制，优化了数据重用和通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间数据流加速器虽具有高性能和能效潜力，但可编程性有限，阻碍了其广泛应用。TL框架旨在解决这一问题，提供端到端的编译框架。

Method: TL框架利用MLIR生态系统，定义了通用的前端入口点和后端出口点，提出了硬件表示方法，优化了瓦片实例在空间分布核心上的分配，并利用片上网络和分布式内存增加数据重用和减少通信。

Result: TL框架能够有效编译基于瓦片的程序到空间数据流架构，优化了瓦片实例的分布和通信，提高了数据重用和性能。

Conclusion: TL框架通过其硬件表示和优化策略，显著提高了空间数据流加速器的可编程性和性能，为更广泛的采用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Spatial dataflow accelerators are a promising direction for next-generation computer systems because they can reduce the memory bottlenecks of traditional von Neumann machines such as CPUs and GPUs. They do so by organizing computation around explicit, compiler-managed data movement over the on-chip network, allowing operands to be directly forwarded between processing elements and reducing reliance on high-latency, bandwidth-limited global shared memory. Such localized communications can provide higher throughput and efficiency compared to repeated off-chip memory accesses. However, their end-to-end performance depends strongly on how workloads are mapped to the hardware. Naive mappings can perform very poorly, and most users rely on hand-tuned vendor libraries. In practice, although existing spatial-dataflow accelerators have strong potential for high performance, energy- and cost-efficiency, their limited programmability remains a major barrier to their wider adoption. This paper presents TL, an end-to-end framework that compiles tile-based programs (such as Triton kernels) onto spatial dataflow architectures. Unlike most existing compiler frameworks that focus on optimizing code generation within a single tile, TL addresses the central challenge of distributing tile instances across spatially distributed cores and exploiting the on-chip network and distributed memories to increase data reuse and reduce communications. TL proposes a hardware representation that captures interconnect topology, memory hierarchy, and compute capabilities, enabling both specialized architecture-specific optimizations and support for diverse spatial dataflow targets. TL is built on the MLIR ecosystem and defines a generic entry point for different front-ends and an end point for different back-ends.

Motivation: 解决大规模计算工作流执行中的技术门槛问题，使科学家能专注于研究而非计算细节。

Method: 开发了AiiDAlab平台，提供基于浏览器的用户界面，简化计算工作流的设置和执行，同时利用AiiDA引擎自动跟踪模拟来源。

Conclusion: AiiDAlab平台通过其直观的用户界面和自动化工作流，显著降低了科学研究的计算复杂性，并促进了跨学科的科研合作与教育应用。

Abstract: With the availability of ever-increasing computational capabilities, robust and automated research workflows are essential to enable and facilitate the execution and orchestration of large numbers of interdependent simulations in supercomputer facilities. However, the execution of these workflows still typically requires technical expertise in setting up calculation inputs, interpreting outputs, and handling the complexity of parallel code execution on remote machines. To address these challenges, the AiiDAlab platform was developed, making complex computational workflows accessible through an intuitive user interface that runs in a web browser. Here, we discuss how AiiDAlab has matured over the past few years, shifting its focus from computational materials science to become a powerful platform that accelerates scientific discovery across multiple disciplines. Thanks to its design, AiiDAlab allows scientists to focus on their research rather than on computational details and challenges, while keeping automatically track of the full simulation provenance via the underlying AiiDA engine and thus ensuring reproducibility. In particular, we discuss its adoption into quantum chemistry, atmospheric modeling, battery research, and even experimental data analysis at large-scale facilities, while also being actively used in educational settings. Driven by user feedback, significant effort has been made to simplify user onboarding, streamline access to computational resources, and provide robust mechanisms to work with large datasets. Furthermore, AiiDAlab is being integrated with electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs), reinforcing adherence to the FAIR principles and supporting researchers in data-centric scientific disciplines in easily generating reproducible Open Research Data (ORD).

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: BitFlipScope 是一个用于定位和恢复 LLM 中位翻转故障的框架，支持有或无参考模型的两种场景，提升模型在易损硬件和对抗环境中的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在安全和关键应用中部署时，易受硬件退化、宇宙辐射或故意故障注入攻击（如 Rowhammer）导致的位翻转故障影响。这些故障会无声地破坏内部参数，导致不可预测或危险的行为。定位这些损坏对于诊断、修复和恢复模型功能至关重要。

Method: BitFlipScope 是一个可扩展的、基于软件的框架，用于在两种部署场景下识别变压器架构中的故障影响区域。在有清洁参考模型的情况下，它通过差分分析输出、隐藏状态和内部激活来检测异常行为；在没有参考模型的情况下，它使用残差路径扰动和损失敏感性分析来直接从损坏模型中推断故障影响区域。

Result: BitFlipScope 不仅能有效诊断故障，还支持无需微调的轻量级性能恢复，为恢复损坏模型提供了实用路径。

Conclusion: BitFlipScope 为在硬件易损和对抗环境中部署可信赖、具有故障弹性的 LLM 提供了重要的一步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in practical and safety-critical settings are increasingly susceptible to bit-flip faults caused by hardware degradation, cosmic radiation, or deliberate fault-injection attacks such as Rowhammer. These faults silently corrupt internal parameters and can lead to unpredictable or dangerous model behavior. Localizing these corruptions is essential: without identifying the affected region, it is impossible to diagnose the source of degradation, apply targeted corrective measures, or restore model functionality without resorting to costly fine-tuning or full retraining. This work introduces BitFlipScope, a scalable, software-based framework for identifying fault-affected regions within transformer architectures under two deployment scenarios. When a clean reference model is available, BitFlipScope performs differential analysis of outputs, hidden states, and internal activations for detecting anomalous behavior indicative of corruption to pinpoint or localize faults. When no reference model exists, it uses residual-path perturbation and loss-sensitivity profiling to infer the fault-impacted region directly from the corrupted model. In both settings, the framework not only enables effective fault diagnosis but also supports lightweight performance recovery without fine-tuning, offering a practical path to restoring corrupted models. Together, these capabilities make BitFlipScope an important step toward trustworthy, fault-resilient LLM deployment in hardware-prone and adversarial environments.

Conclusion: 本文强调了利用常见移动设备为机器学习做出更大贡献的潜力。

Abstract: Practical utilization of large-scale machine learning requires a powerful compute setup, a necessity which poses a significant barrier to engagement with such artificial intelligence in more restricted system environments. While cloud computing offers a solution to weaker local environments, certain situations like training involving private or sensitive data, physical environments not available through the cloud, or higher anticipated usage costs, necessitate computing locally. We explore the potential to improve weaker local compute systems at zero additional cost by taking advantage of ubiquitous yet underutilized resources: mobile phones. Specifically, recent iOS phones are equipped with surprisingly powerful processors, but they also face limitations like memory constraints, thermal throttling, and OS sandboxing. We present a proof-of-concept system demonstrating a novel approach to harness an iOS device via distributed pipeline parallelism, achieving significant benefits in a lesser compute environment by accelerating modest model training, batch inference, and agentic LRM tool-usage. We discuss practical use-cases, limitations, and directions for future work. The findings of this paper highlight the potential for the improving commonplace mobile devices to provide greater contributions to machine learning.

TL;DR: MatKV通过预存储键值向量优化RAG推理，显著降低时间和能耗，提升硬件适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在RAG处理长输入时，预填充阶段的键值向量计算能耗高且耗时，亟需提升其效率。

Method: 提出MatKV方案，预计算RAG对象的键值向量并将其存储在快速且能效高的闪存中，推理时直接复用而非重新计算。

Result: 实验表明，MatKV将推理时间和能耗降低一半，且不影响问答任务准确性，同时支持GPU并行解码和低端GPU使用。

Conclusion: MatKV方案通过预计算和存储RAG对象的键值向量，显著提升了推理效率和能效，同时保持了任务准确性，为大规模生成式AI应用提供了更经济、高效和广泛的硬件适应性。

Abstract: We observe two major trends in LLM-based generative AI: (1) inference is becoming the dominant factor in terms of cost and power consumption, surpassing training, and (2) retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is becoming prevalent. When processing long inputs in RAG, the prefill phase of computing the key-value vectors of input text is energy-intensive and time-consuming even with high-end GPUs. Thus, it is crucial to make the prefill phase in RAG inference efficient. To address this issue, we propose MatKV, a scheme that precomputes the key-value vectors (KVs) of RAG objects (e.g., documents), materializes them in inexpensive but fast and power-efficient flash storage, and reuses them at inference time instead of recomputing the KVs using costly and power-inefficient GPU. Experimental results using Hugging Face's Transformers library across state-of-the-art GPUs and flash memory SSDs confirm that, compared to full KV computation on GPUs, MatKV reduces both inference time and power consumption by half for RAG workloads, without severely impacting accuracy in the question-answering task. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MatKV enables additional optimizations in two ways. First, a GPU can decode text while simultaneously loading the materialized KVs for the next instance, reducing load latency. Second, since decoding speed is less sensitive to GPU performance than KV computation, low-end GPUs can be leveraged for decoding without significantly compromising speed once the materialized KVs are loaded into GPU memory. These findings underscore MatKV's potential to make large-scale generative AI applications more cost-effective, power-efficient, and accessible across a wider range of tasks and hardware environments.

Conclusion: SPUMA在LUMI和Leonardo集群上展示了高效的GPU利用率和显著的能源节省，证明了其在混合集群上的高性能计算潜力。

Abstract: High Performance Computing (HPC) on hybrid clusters represents a significant opportunity for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), especially when modern accelerators are utilized effectively. However, despite the widespread adoption of GPUs, programmability remains a challenge, particularly in open-source contexts. In this paper, we present SPUMA, a full GPU porting of OPENFOAM targeting NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. The implementation strategy is based on a portable programming model and the adoption of a memory pool manager that leverages the unified memory feature of modern GPUs. This approach is discussed alongside several numerical tests conducted on two pre-exascale clusters in Europe, LUMI and Leonardo, which host AMD MI250X and NVIDIA A100 GPUs, respectively. In the performance analysis section, we present results related to memory usage profiling and kernel wall-time, the impact of the memory pool, and energy consumption obtained by simulating the well-known DrivAer industrial test case. GPU utilization strongly affects strong scalability results, reaching 65% efficiency on both LUMI and Leonardo when approaching a load of 8 million cells per GPU. Weak scalability results, obtained on 20 GPUs with the OpenFOAM native multigrid solver, range from 75% on Leonardo to 85% on LUMI. Notably, efficiency is no lower than 90% when switching to the NVIDIA AmgX linear algebra solver. Our tests also reveal that one A100 GPU on Leonardo is equivalent 200-300 Intel Sapphire Rapids cores, provided the GPUs are sufficiently oversubscribed (more than 10 million of cells per GPU). Finally, energy consumption is reduced by up to 82% compared to analogous simulations executed on CPUs.

Motivation: 为了解决多GPU模型推理中的性能瓶颈，MPK旨在通过自动转换和优化，实现高性能的巨型内核。

Method: MPK编译器将张量程序转换为优化的SM级别任务图，并生成优化的CUDA实现，同时MPK内核并行运行时在单个巨型内核中执行这些任务。

Result: MPK显著优于现有的按操作符内核的LLM服务系统，将端到端推理延迟降低了1.7倍。

Conclusion: MPK通过引入SM级别的图表示和优化的CUDA实现，显著提升了多GPU模型推理的性能，将推理延迟降低了1.7倍，接近硬件极限。

Abstract: We introduce Mirage Persistent Kernel (MPK), the first compiler and runtime system that automatically transforms multi-GPU model inference into a single high-performance megakernel. MPK introduces an SM-level graph representation that captures data dependencies at the granularity of individual streaming multiprocessors (SMs), enabling cross-operator software pipelining, fine-grained kernel overlap, and other previously infeasible GPU optimizations. The MPK compiler lowers tensor programs into highly optimized SM-level task graphs and generates optimized CUDA implementations for all tasks, while the MPK in-kernel parallel runtime executes these tasks within a single mega-kernel using decentralized scheduling across SMs. Together, these components provide end-to-end kernel fusion with minimal developer effort, while preserving the flexibility of existing programming models. Our evaluation shows that MPK significantly outperforms existing kernel-per-operator LLM serving systems by reducing end-to-end inference latency by up to 1.7x, pushing LLM inference performance close to hardware limits. MPK is publicly available at https://github.com/mirage-project/mirage.

Conclusion: 提出的云原生架构为下一代智能电网分析提供了稳健且灵活的基础，能够满足大规模PMU部署的需求。

Abstract: Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) generate high-frequency, time-synchronized data essential for real-time power grid monitoring, yet the growing scale of PMU deployments creates significant challenges in latency, scalability, and reliability. Conventional centralized processing architectures are increasingly unable to handle the volume and velocity of PMU data, particularly in modern grids with dynamic operating conditions. This paper presents a scalable cloud-native architecture for intelligent PMU data processing that integrates artificial intelligence with edge and cloud computing. The proposed framework employs distributed stream processing, containerized microservices, and elastic resource orchestration to enable low-latency ingestion, real-time anomaly detection, and advanced analytics. Machine learning models for time-series analysis are incorporated to enhance grid observability and predictive capabilities. Analytical models are developed to evaluate system latency, throughput, and reliability, showing that the architecture can achieve sub-second response times while scaling to large PMU deployments. Security and privacy mechanisms are embedded to support deployment in critical infrastructure environments. The proposed approach provides a robust and flexible foundation for next-generation smart grid analytics.

Motivation: 传统推测解码方法使用固定推测长度，无法适应动态请求率，导致在高负载环境下性能下降。

Result: 实验显示，Nightjar相比标准推测解码，吞吐量最高提升14.8%，延迟降低20.2%。

Conclusion: Nightjar通过动态调整推测长度，显著提升了实时服务中的吞吐量和延迟性能，相比传统推测解码方法有显著优势。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates LLM inference by verifying draft tokens in parallel. However, this method presents a critical trade-off: it improves throughput in low-load, memory-bound systems but degrades performance in high-load, compute-bound environments due to verification overhead. Current SD implementations use a fixed speculative length, failing to adapt to dynamic request rates and creating a significant performance bottleneck in real-world serving scenarios. To overcome this, we propose Nightjar, a novel learning-based algorithm for adaptive speculative inference that adjusts to request load by dynamically selecting the optimal speculative length for different batch sizes and even disabling speculative decoding when it provides no benefit. Experiments show that Nightjar achieves up to 14.8% higher throughput and 20.2% lower latency compared to standard speculative decoding, demonstrating robust efficiency for real-time serving.

Motivation: 现有LLM容错框架仅针对训练或推理，未充分利用RL后训练中异步执行的优化潜力。角色隔离可避免单机故障影响全局。

Method: 1. 角色感知监控（Detect）；2. 非中断式恢复（Restart）：训练器通过热备快速恢复，rollout通过隔离机器替换；3. 动态点对点通信（Reconnect）：基于UCX实现权重同步。

Conclusion: RobustRL通过角色隔离和动态恢复机制显著提升了RL后训练的有效训练时间比例（ETTR），在256-GPU集群中实现了80%以上的ETTR，优于现有方案的60%。

Abstract: RL post-training for LLMs has been widely scaled to enhance reasoning and tool-using capabilities. However, RL post-training interleaves training and inference workloads, exposing the system to faults from both sides. Existing fault tolerance frameworks for LLMs target either training or inference, leaving the optimization potential in the asynchronous execution unexplored for RL. Our key insight is role-based fault isolation so the failure in one machine does not affect the others. We treat trainer, rollout, and other management roles in RL training as distinct distributed sub-tasks. Instead of restarting the entire RL task in ByteRobust, we recover only the failed role and reconnect it to living ones, thereby eliminating the full-restart overhead including rollout replay and initialization delay.
  We present RobustRL, the first comprehensive robust system to handle GPU machine errors for RL post-training Effective Training Time Ratio improvement. (1) \textit{Detect}. We implement role-aware monitoring to distinguish actual failures from role-specific behaviors to avoid the false positive and delayed detection. (2) \textit{Restart}. For trainers, we implement a non-disruptive recovery where rollouts persist state and continue trajectory generation, while the trainer is rapidly restored via rollout warm standbys. For rollout, we perform isolated machine replacement without interrupting the RL task. (3) \textit{Reconnect}. We replace static collective communication with dynamic, UCX-based (Unified Communication X) point-to-point communication, enabling immediate weight synchronization between recovered roles. In an RL training task on a 256-GPU cluster with Qwen3-8B-Math workload under 10\% failure injection frequency, RobustRL can achieve an ETTR of over 80\% compared with the 60\% in ByteRobust and achieves 8.4\%-17.4\% faster in end-to-end training time.

Abstract: Cloud computing has fundamentally transformed application development, yet a gap remains between the serverless promise of simplified deployment and its practical realization due to fragmentation across function runtimes, state management, and orchestration. This dissertation addresses this gap through empirical validation and technical innovation, establishing the Object-as-a-Service (OaaS) paradigm as a unified approach to cloud-native development. Grounded in evidence from three studies - practitioner interviews (21 participants), a human study on developer experience (39 participants), and NSF I-Corps customer discovery (101 interviews across 86 organizations) - this work demonstrates that infrastructure complexity taxes productivity, with practitioners prioritizing automation and maintainability over cost optimization. The dissertation makes five major contributions: (1) the OaaS paradigm unifies resource, state, and workflow management via the Oparaca prototype, demonstrating negligible overhead and state-of-the-art scalability; (2) SLA-driven OaaS enables declarative management of non-functional requirements like availability, consistency, and latency; (3) OaaS-IoT with EdgeWeaver extends the paradigm to the edge-cloud continuum, achieving 31% faster task completion and a 44.5% reduction in lines of code compared to traditional FaaS; (4) commercialization validation establishes a pathway targeting technology SMEs and startups; and (5) an empirical methodology for grounding technical research in validated practitioner needs. By consolidating fragmented abstractions and automating performance optimization, OaaS establishes a foundation for cloud-native platforms that hide infrastructure complexity and empower developers to focus on innovation.

Abstract: Agentic Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform autonomous decision-making and long-term planning. Unlike standard LLM post-training, agentic RL workloads are highly heterogeneous, combining compute-intensive prefill phases, bandwidth-bound decoding, and stateful, CPU-heavy environment simulations. We argue that efficient agentic RL training requires disaggregated infrastructure to leverage specialized, best-fit hardware. However, naive disaggregation introduces substantial synchronization overhead and resource underutilization due to the complex dependencies between stages.
  We present RollArc, a distributed system designed to maximize throughput for multi-task agentic RL on disaggregated infrastructure. RollArc is built on three core principles: (1) hardware-affinity workload mapping, which routes compute-bound and bandwidth-bound tasks to bestfit GPU devices, (2) fine-grained asynchrony, which manages execution at the trajectory level to mitigate resource bubbles, and (3) statefulness-aware computation, which offloads stateless components (e.g., reward models) to serverless infrastructure for elastic scaling. Our results demonstrate that RollArc effectively improves training throughput and achieves 1.35-2.05\(\times\) end-to-end training time reduction compared to monolithic and synchronous baselines. We also evaluate RollArc by training a hundreds-of-billions-parameter MoE model for Qoder product on an Alibaba cluster with more than 3,000 GPUs, further demonstrating RollArc scalability and robustness.

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型（MLLM）因引入额外模态而增加能耗，研究通过阶段级分析揭示能源瓶颈并提出优化建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨多模态输入如何通过额外的编码阶段和扩展的令牌序列增加推理工作量，从而引入能源效率问题。

Method: 通过将MLLM推理管道分解为视觉编码、预填充和解码阶段，对四种代表性MLLM在NVIDIA A100 GPU上的能耗进行了详细分析。

Result: 多模态推理相比纯文本基准的额外能耗在17%至94%之间，且能源瓶颈因模型架构而异。GPU在模态执行期间利用率不足，输入复杂性导致模型间能源缩放行为显著不同。阶段级动态电压和频率调整（DVFS）是一种有效的优化方法。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计更节能的多模态LLM服务系统提供了实用见解和具体指导。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are built on text-only LLMs by incorporating additional modalities, enabling multimodal understanding and a broader range of applications. However, these additions introduce a previously unexplored energy trade-off across modalities that remains poorly understood, as most prior work focuses on text-only models. In this paper, we examine modality inflation, a key source of inefficiency in which multimodal inputs increase inference workloads through extra encoding stages and expanded token sequences. We provide the first detailed, stage-level analysis of energy consumption in MLLM inference by breaking the pipeline into vision encoding, prefill, and decoding stages. Using four representative MLLMs evaluated on NVIDIA A100 GPU, we quantify the additional energy required for multimodal inference compared to text-only baselines, observing overheads ranging from 17% to 94% across models for identical inputs. Our results show that energy bottlenecks differ widely across model architectures, stemming either from compute-heavy vision encoders or from the downstream impact of large visual token sequences during prefill. By examining GPU power traces, we further uncover substantial GPU underutilization during multimodal execution and show that input complexity leads to markedly different energy scaling behaviors across models. Finally, we demonstrate that stage-wise dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is an effective optimization, allowing energy savings with only modest performance impact. Together, these findings offer practical insights and concrete guidance for designing more energy-efficient multimodal LLM serving systems.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型(LLMs)在异构边缘-云系统中推理时间可变性问题，现有方案忽视动态、随机和异构环境的特性。

Method: Argus采用Length-Aware Semantics (LAS)模块预测输出令牌长度，并结合Lyapunov-guided Offloading Optimization (LOO)模块进行长期QoE优化，使用IODCC算法解决整数非线性规划问题。

Conclusion: Argus框架在高度动态和异构的边缘-云系统中展示了稳健的性能和卓越的效率，通过其创新的令牌感知分布式推理和优化卸载策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being integrated into real-world applications, yet their autoregressive architectures introduce significant inference time variability, especially when deployed across heterogeneous edge-cloud systems. Existing solutions largely neglect the dynamic, stochastic, and heterogeneous nature of such environments, often ignoring the impact of variable output token lengths and device diversity. In this work, we present Argus, the first token-aware distributed edge-cloud LLM inference framework that conducts efficient task offloading. Argus features a Length-Aware Semantics (LAS) module, which predicts output token lengths for incoming prompts using a fine-tuned language model with token-length-sensitive feature modulation, enabling precise estimation. Building on this, our Lyapunov-guided Offloading Optimization (LOO) module formulates long-term Quality-of-Experience optimization that explicitly considers both LLM prefilling and decoding costs. We introduce a novel Iterative Offloading Algorithm with Damping and Congestion Control (IODCC) to effectively solve the resulting integer nonlinear programming problem under time-varying constraints. Extensive theoretical and empirical evaluations demonstrate that Argus achieves robust performance and superior efficiency in highly dynamic, heterogeneous settings.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been accompanied by a reliance on cloud-based, proprietary systems, raising significant concerns regarding data privacy, operational sovereignty, and escalating costs. This paper investigates the feasibility of deploying a high-performance, private LLM inference server at a cost accessible to Small and Medium Businesses (SMBs). We present a comprehensive benchmarking analysis of a locally hosted, quantized 30-billion parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model based on Qwen3, running on a consumer-grade server equipped with a next-generation NVIDIA GPU. Unlike cloud-based offerings, which are expensive and complex to integrate, our approach provides an affordable and private solution for SMBs. We evaluate two dimensions: the model's intrinsic capabilities and the server's performance under load. Model performance is benchmarked against academic and industry standards to quantify reasoning and knowledge relative to cloud services. Concurrently, we measure server efficiency through latency, tokens per second, and time to first token, analyzing scalability under increasing concurrent users. Our findings demonstrate that a carefully configured on-premises setup with emerging consumer hardware and a quantized open-source model can achieve performance comparable to cloud-based services, offering SMBs a viable pathway to deploy powerful LLMs without prohibitive costs or privacy compromises.

Motivation: 为微服务实现自适应控制循环提供一个案例研究，强调系统一致性、规划和模块化等关键属性。

Method: 探讨了软件架构方法、云原生Operator模式及传统编程语言技术如何解耦自适应控制逻辑与TeaStore应用。

Result: 分析了不同方法在细粒度表达适应与系统范围控制之间的权衡，并指出适应策略重用的最佳时机。

Conclusion: 不同方法（软件架构、云原生Operator模式和传统编程语言技术）可以结合使用，构建一个多层次的自适应微服务架构。

Abstract: The Adaptable TeaStore specification provides a microservice-based case study for implementing self-adaptation through a control loop.  We argue that implementations of this specification should be informed by key properties of self-adaptation: system-wide consistency (coordinated adaptations across replicas), planning (executing an adaptation until appropriate conditions are met),  and modularity (clean integration of adaptation logic).  In this implementation discussion paper, we examine how software architectural methods, the cloud-native Operator pattern, and legacy programming language techniques can decouple self-adaptive control logic from the TeaStore application. We analyze the trade-offs that these different approaches make between fine-grained expressive adaptation and system-wide control, and highlight when reuse of adaptation strategies is most effective. Our analysis suggests that these approaches are not mutually exclusive but can be combined into a multi-tiered architecture for self-adaptive microservices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决比特币作为通用交换媒介（MoE）的可扩展性问题，提升交易吞吐量并降低交易成本。

Method: 设计了一个基于比特币SegWit机制的软件栈和协议，支持无许可创建以L1 BTC为质押的PoS Layer-2子网，利用比特币L1进行关键信息通信、结算和安全性保障。

Result: 相比原生比特币L1交易，虚拟字节成本降低23倍，交易吞吐量从7 tps提升至超过160 tps。

Conclusion: Bitcoin-IPC通过引入可编程的PoS Layer-2链（子网），显著提升了比特币的交易吞吐量和效率，同时保持了与比特币L1的安全性和兼容性。

Abstract: We introduce Bitcoin-IPC, a software stack and protocol that scales Bitcoin towards helping it become the universal Medium of Exchange (MoE) by enabling the permissionless creation of fully programmable Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Layer-2 chains, called subnets, whose stake is denominated in L1 BTC. Bitcoin-IPC subnets rely on Bitcoin L1 for the communication of critical information, settlement, and security.
  Our design, inspired by SWIFT messaging and embedded within Bitcoin's SegWit mechanism, enables seamless value transfer across L2 subnets, routed through Bitcoin L1. Uniquely, this mechanism reduces the virtual-byte cost per transaction (vB per tx) by up to 23x, compared to transacting natively on Bitcoin L1, effectively increasing monetary transaction throughput from 7 tps to over 160 tps, without requiring any modifications to Bitcoin L1.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了在DevOps发布阶段优化微服务资源分配的方法，发现前置筛选在预算有限时有效，而贝叶斯优化更适合寻找接近最优的配置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数研究集中在DevOps周期中Ops阶段的智能调度和自动扩展，而发布阶段的资源分配优化问题尚未得到充分探索。未经前期调优的容器水平自动扩展可能导致内存分配不当。

Method: 使用TeaStore微服务应用评估性能优化框架，并统计比较不同优化算法，以权衡采样成本与最优资源配置的距离。

Result: 前置因素筛选在有限预算下有助于找到最优配置；比较算法时筛选是必要的；而直接运行贝叶斯优化更适合寻找接近最优的配置。

Conclusion: 在发布阶段对微服务应用的CPU和内存资源分配配置进行优化是一个未被充分探索的问题。研究表明，在有限的采样预算下，前置因素筛选有助于找到最优资源配置；而在比较不同算法时，筛选也是必要的。然而，若目标是找到接近最优的配置，则无需筛选直接运行贝叶斯优化更为有效。

Abstract: This paper presents how an existing framework for offline performance optimization can be applied to microservice applications during the Release phase of the DevOps life cycle. Optimization of resource allocation configuration parameters for CPU and memory during the Release phase remains a largely unexplored problem as most research has focused on intelligent scheduling and autoscaling of microservices during the Ops stage of the DevOps cycle. Yet horizontal auto-scaling of containers, based on CPU usage for instance, may still leave these containers with an inappropriately allocated amount of memory, if no upfront fine-tuning of both resources is applied before the Deployment phase. We evaluate the performance optimization framework using the TeaStore microservice application and statistically compare different optimization algorithms, supporting informed decisions about their trade-offs between sampling cost and distance to the optimal resource configuration. This shows that upfront factor screening, for reducing the search space, is helpful when the goal is to find the optimal resource configuration with an affordable sampling budget. When the goal is to statistically compare different algorithms, screening must also be applied to make data collection of all data points in the search space feasible.  If the goal is to find a near-optimal configuration, however, it is better to run bayesian optimization without screening.

Result: 在四个数据集上进行的 12 次实验中，Bidirectional RAG 的平均覆盖率达到 40.58%，几乎是标准 RAG（20.33%）的两倍，同时比简单回写方法少添加 72% 的文档（140 vs 500）。

Motivation: 探讨在何种情况下，大型语言模型（LLMs）会在未被明确提示的情况下进行说服，以评估此类新兴说服风险的实际关注程度。

Method: 研究通过两种场景探讨未被提示的说服行为：(i) 通过内部激活引导（internal activation steering）调整模型人格特质，(ii) 通过监督微调（SFT）使模型展现相同特质。

Result: 研究发现，通过人格特质引导（无论是否与说服相关）并不能可靠增加模型的未被提示说服倾向，但监督微调（SFT）可以。此外，SFT在仅包含良性话题的通用说服数据集上训练的模型，在争议和有害话题上表现出更高的说服倾向。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过监督微调（SFT）可以显著增加模型在未被明确提示情况下的说服倾向，尤其是在有争议和有害话题上，这提示我们需要进一步研究这种潜在的有害说服风险。

Abstract: With the wide-scale adoption of conversational AI systems, AI are now able to exert unprecedented influence on human opinion and beliefs. Recent work has shown that many Large Language Models (LLMs) comply with requests to persuade users into harmful beliefs or actions when prompted and that model persuasiveness increases with model scale. However, this prior work looked at persuasion from the threat model of $\textit{misuse}$ (i.e., a bad actor asking an LLM to persuade). In this paper, we instead aim to answer the following question: Under what circumstances would models persuade $\textit{without being explicitly prompted}$, which would shape how concerned we should be about such emergent persuasion risks. To achieve this, we study unprompted persuasion under two scenarios: (i) when the model is steered (through internal activation steering) along persona traits, and (ii) when the model is supervised-finetuned (SFT) to exhibit the same traits. We showed that steering towards traits, both related to persuasion and unrelated, does not reliably increase models' tendency to persuade unprompted, however, SFT does. Moreover, SFT on general persuasion datasets containing solely benign topics admits a model that has a higher propensity to persuade on controversial and harmful topics--showing that emergent harmful persuasion can arise and should be studied further.

Motivation: 现有的基准测试大多关注静态图像或最终输出，未能考虑空间推理的序列性和视角依赖性，因此需要一个新的评估工具。

Method: 通过折纸启发的折叠任务，设计了包含186个常规和186个不可能2D折痕模式及其对应3D折叠形状的GamiBench基准测试，涵盖三个VQA任务。

Result: 实验表明，即使是领先的模型如GPT-5和Gemini-2.5-Pro在单步空间理解上也表现不佳。

Conclusion: GamiBench提供了一个标准化框架，用于评估MLLMs在几何理解和空间推理方面的能力，填补了现有基准测试的不足。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are proficient in perception and instruction-following, but they still struggle with spatial reasoning: the ability to mentally track and manipulate objects across multiple views and over time. Spatial reasoning is a key component of human intelligence, but most existing benchmarks focus on static images or final outputs, failing to account for the sequential and viewpoint-dependent nature of this skill. To close this gap, we introduce GamiBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial reasoning and 2D-to-3D planning in MLLMs through origami-inspired folding tasks. GamiBench includes 186 regular and 186 impossible 2D crease patterns paired with their corresponding 3D folded shapes, produced from six distinct viewpoints across three visual question-answering (VQA) tasks: predicting 3D fold configurations, distinguishing valid viewpoints, and detecting impossible patterns. Unlike previous benchmarks that assess only final predictions, GamiBench holistically evaluates the entire reasoning process--measuring cross-view consistency, physical feasibility through impossible-fold detection, and interpretation of intermediate folding steps. It further introduces new diagnostic metrics--viewpoint consistency (VC) and impossible fold selection rate (IFSR)--to measure how well models handle folds of varying complexity. Our experiments show that even leading models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro struggle on single-step spatial understanding. These contributions establish a standardized framework for evaluating geometric understanding and spatial reasoning in MLLMs. Dataset and code: https://github.com/stvngo/GamiBench.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address systematic biases in post-disaster aid allocation that disadvantage vulnerable regions in developing nations like Bangladesh.

Method: The paper presents a fairness-aware AI framework using adversarial debiasing and gradient reversal layers to predict flood vulnerability while removing biases.

Result: The framework reduces statistical parity difference by 41.6%, decreases regional fairness gaps by 43.2%, and maintains strong predictive accuracy (R-squared=0.784).

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the effective application of algorithmic fairness techniques in humanitarian contexts, offering tools for more equitable disaster recovery strategies.

Abstract: Post-disaster aid allocation in developing nations often suffers from systematic biases that disadvantage vulnerable regions, perpetuating historical inequities. This paper presents a fairness-aware artificial intelligence framework for prioritizing post-flood aid distribution in Bangladesh, a country highly susceptible to recurring flood disasters. Using real data from the 2022 Bangladesh floods that affected 7.2 million people and caused 405.5 million US dollars in damages, we develop an adversarial debiasing model that predicts flood vulnerability while actively removing biases against marginalized districts and rural areas. Our approach adapts fairness-aware representation learning techniques from healthcare AI to disaster management, employing a gradient reversal layer that forces the model to learn bias-invariant representations. Experimental results on 87 upazilas across 11 districts demonstrate that our framework reduces statistical parity difference by 41.6 percent, decreases regional fairness gaps by 43.2 percent, and maintains strong predictive accuracy (R-squared=0.784 vs baseline 0.811). The model generates actionable priority rankings ensuring aid reaches the most vulnerable populations based on genuine need rather than historical allocation patterns. This work demonstrates how algorithmic fairness techniques can be effectively applied to humanitarian contexts, providing decision-makers with tools to implement more equitable disaster recovery strategies.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems present both significant opportunities and novel risks due to their capacity for autonomous action, encompassing tasks such as code execution, internet interaction, and file modification. This poses considerable challenges for effective organizational governance, particularly in comprehensively identifying, assessing, and mitigating diverse and evolving risks. To tackle this, we introduce the Agentic Risk \& Capability (ARC) Framework, a technical governance framework designed to help organizations identify, assess, and mitigate risks arising from agentic AI systems. The framework's core contributions are: (1) it develops a novel capability-centric perspective to analyze a wide range of agentic AI systems; (2) it distills three primary sources of risk intrinsic to agentic AI systems - components, design, and capabilities; (3) it establishes a clear nexus between each risk source, specific materialized risks, and corresponding technical controls; and (4) it provides a structured and practical approach to help organizations implement the framework. This framework provides a robust and adaptable methodology for organizations to navigate the complexities of agentic AI, enabling rapid and effective innovation while ensuring the safe, secure, and responsible deployment of agentic AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI生成的图像在网络上无处不在，但许多人认为可以轻松区分它们与真实照片。本研究旨在验证这一假设。

Method: 通过一个交互式网络实验，参与者对20张图像进行分类，判断它们是真实的还是AI生成的。数据集包含120个难以区分的案例：真实图像来自CC12M，AI生成图像则通过MidJourney精心制作。

Result: 165名用户完成了233次实验，平均准确率为54%，仅略高于随机猜测，且重复尝试后改进有限。平均响应时间为7.3秒，某些图像比其他图像更具欺骗性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，即使在相对简单的肖像图像上，人类也难以可靠地识别AI生成的内容。随着合成媒体的不断改进，仅依靠人类判断已不足以区分真实与人工数据。这些发现强调了在AI生成媒体与真实内容越来越难以区分的情况下，提高意识和制定伦理准则的必要性。

Abstract: AI-generated images are now pervasive online, yet many people believe they can easily tell them apart from real photographs. We test this assumption through an interactive web experiment where participants classify 20 images as real or AI-generated. Our dataset contains 120 difficult cases: real images sampled from CC12M, and carefully curated AI-generated counterparts produced with MidJourney. In total, 165 users completed 233 sessions. Their average accuracy was 54%, only slightly above random guessing, with limited improvement across repeated attempts. Response times averaged 7.3 seconds, and some images were consistently more deceptive than others. These results indicate that, even on relatively simple portrait images, humans struggle to reliably detect AI-generated content. As synthetic media continues to improve, human judgment alone is becoming insufficient for distinguishing real from artificial data. These findings highlight the need for greater awareness and ethical guidelines as AI-generated media becomes increasingly indistinguishable from reality.

Conclusion: SANet通过语义感知的AgentNet架构和MoPS框架，在无线网络中实现了高效的多代理协作，显著提升了性能并降低了计算资源需求。

Abstract: Agentic AI networking (AgentNet) is a novel AI-native networking paradigm in which a large number of specialized AI agents collaborate to perform autonomous decision-making, dynamic environmental adaptation, and complex missions. It has the potential to facilitate real-time network management and optimization functions, including self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-adaptation across diverse and complex environments. This paper proposes SANet, a novel semantic-aware AgentNet architecture for wireless networks that can infer the semantic goal of the user and automatically assign agents associated with different layers of the network to fulfill the inferred goal. Motivated by the fact that AgentNet is a decentralized framework in which collaborating agents may generally have different and even conflicting objectives, we formulate the decentralized optimization of SANet as a multi-agent multi-objective problem, and focus on finding the Pareto-optimal solution for agents with distinct and potentially conflicting objectives. We propose three novel metrics for evaluating SANet. Furthermore, we develop a model partition and sharing (MoPS) framework in which large models, e.g., deep learning models, of different agents can be partitioned into shared and agent-specific parts that are jointly constructed and deployed according to agents' local computational resources. Two decentralized optimization algorithms are proposed. We derive theoretical bounds and prove that there exists a three-way tradeoff among optimization, generalization, and conflicting errors. We develop an open-source RAN and core network-based hardware prototype that implements agents to interact with three different layers of the network. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieved performance gains of up to 14.61% while requiring only 44.37% of FLOPs required by state-of-the-art algorithms.

Our experiments show this approach can yield better performance on reasoning tasks than training on human-annotated datasets. We hypothesize that two key factors explain this phenomenon: first, the distribution of synthetic data is inherently closer to the language model's own distribution, making it more amenable to learning. Second, these `incorrect' traces are often only partially flawed and contain valid reasoning steps from which the model can learn. To further test the first hypothesis, we use a language model to paraphrase human-annotated traces -- shifting their distribution closer to the model's own distribution -- and show that this improves performance. For the second hypothesis, we introduce increasingly flawed CoT traces and study to what extent models are tolerant to these flaws. We demonstrate our findings across various reasoning domains like math, algorithmic reasoning and code generation using MATH, GSM8K, Countdown and MBPP datasets on various language models ranging from 1.5B to 9B across Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models. Our study shows that curating datasets that are closer to the model's distribution is a critical aspect to consider. We also show that a correct final answer is not always a reliable indicator of a faithful reasoning process.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在自然语言推理方面表现出色，但在需要严格规则遵循、确定性和可审计性的任务中仍不可靠。

Method: LSP是一个轻量级提示框架，引入了类型变量、确定性条件评估器和基于规则的验证器，生成可追踪和可重复的输出。研究通过两个药理学逻辑合规任务，在Gemma 2、Mistral和Llama 3三个开放权重模型上对LSP进行了基准测试。

Result: 在所有模型和任务中，LSP的准确率（0.83至0.89）和F1分数（0.83至0.89）均显著高于零样本提示（0.24至0.60）、简洁提示（0.16至0.30）和思维链提示（0.56至0.75）。McNemar检验显示LSP在几乎所有比较中均有统计学显著提升（p < 0.01）。

Conclusion: LSP（Logic Sketch Prompting）显著提升了大型语言模型在需要严格规则遵循、确定性和可审计性任务中的表现，支持其在临床、受监管和安全关键决策支持系统中的应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language reasoning but remain unreliable on tasks requiring strict rule adherence, determinism, and auditability. Logic Sketch Prompting (LSP) is a lightweight prompting framework that introduces typed variables, deterministic condition evaluators, and a rule based validator that produces traceable and repeatable outputs. Using two pharmacologic logic compliance tasks, we benchmark LSP against zero shot prompting, chain of thought prompting, and concise prompting across three open weight models: Gemma 2, Mistral, and Llama 3. Across both tasks and all models, LSP consistently achieves the highest accuracy (0.83 to 0.89) and F1 score (0.83 to 0.89), substantially outperforming zero shot prompting (0.24 to 0.60), concise prompts (0.16 to 0.30), and chain of thought prompting (0.56 to 0.75). McNemar tests show statistically significant gains for LSP across nearly all comparisons (p < 0.01). These results demonstrate that LSP improves determinism, interpretability, and consistency without sacrificing performance, supporting its use in clinical, regulated, and safety critical decision support systems.

TL;DR: Agent2World通过多智能体框架和交互反馈，显著提升了世界模型生成的性能，平均增益30.95%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于静态验证的方法无法捕捉交互执行中的行为级错误，缺乏大规模可验证监督限制了LLMs生成符号世界模型的能力。

Method: Agent2World采用三阶段流程：深度研究代理进行知识合成，模型开发代理实现可执行世界模型，测试团队进行自适应单元测试和模拟验证。

Result: Agent2World在PDDL和可执行代码表示的三项基准测试中均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: Agent2World通过多智能体框架实现了高效的世界模型生成，并通过交互式反馈显著提升了模型性能，平均相对增益达30.95%。

Abstract: Symbolic world models (e.g., PDDL domains or executable simulators) are central to model-based planning, but training LLMs to generate such world models is limited by the lack of large-scale verifiable supervision. Current approaches rely primarily on static validation methods that fail to catch behavior-level errors arising from interactive execution. In this paper, we propose Agent2World, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that achieves strong inference-time world-model generation and also serves as a data engine for supervised fine-tuning, by grounding generation in multi-agent feedback. Agent2World follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) A Deep Researcher agent performs knowledge synthesis by web searching to address specification gaps; (ii) A Model Developer agent implements executable world models; And (iii) a specialized Testing Team conducts adaptive unit testing and simulation-based validation. Agent2World demonstrates superior inference-time performance across three benchmarks spanning both Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and executable code representations, achieving consistent state-of-the-art results. Beyond inference, Testing Team serves as an interactive environment for the Model Developer, providing behavior-aware adaptive feedback that yields multi-turn training trajectories. The model fine-tuned on these trajectories substantially improves world-model generation, yielding an average relative gain of 30.95% over the same model before training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准数值规划模型中的动作参数作为自由数值变量引入时，会导致状态中可能有无限数量的适用动作，这使得现有的数值启发式方法不可行。

Method: 通过将控制依赖的表达式抽象为有界常量效应和宽松前提条件，提出了一种乐观编译方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法是一种有效且计算可行的方式，能够在涉及控制参数的数值规划问题中应用传统数值启发式方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种乐观编译方法，将可控的简单数值问题转化为简单数值任务，有效扩展了传统数值启发式方法在无限动作空间中的应用。

Abstract: Numeric planning with control parameters extends the standard numeric planning model by introducing action parameters as free numeric variables that must be instantiated during planning. This results in a potentially infinite number of applicable actions in a state. In this setting, off-the-shelf numeric heuristics that leverage the action structure are not feasible. In this paper, we identify a tractable subset of these problems--namely, controllable, simple numeric problems--and propose an optimistic compilation approach that transforms them into simple numeric tasks. To do so, we abstract control-dependent expressions into bounded constant effects and relaxed preconditions. The proposed compilation makes it possible to effectively use subgoaling heuristics to estimate goal distance in numeric planning problems involving control parameters. Our results demonstrate that this approach is an effective and computationally feasible way of applying traditional numeric heuristics to settings with an infinite number of possible actions, pushing the boundaries of the current state of the art.

Conclusion: 通过HalluMatDetector框架和PHCS评分，研究显著降低了LLM在材料科学领域的幻觉率，并提供了量化模型可靠性的新方法。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), is transforming scientific discovery, enabling rapid knowledge generation and hypothesis formulation. However, a critical challenge is hallucination, where LLMs generate factually incorrect or misleading information, compromising research integrity. To address this, we introduce HalluMatData, a benchmark dataset for evaluating hallucination detection methods, factual consistency, and response robustness in AI-generated materials science content. Alongside this, we propose HalluMatDetector, a multi-stage hallucination detection framework that integrates intrinsic verification, multi-source retrieval, contradiction graph analysis, and metric-based assessment to detect and mitigate LLM hallucinations. Our findings reveal that hallucination levels vary significantly across materials science subdomains, with high-entropy queries exhibiting greater factual inconsistencies. By utilizing HalluMatDetector verification pipeline, we reduce hallucination rates by 30% compared to standard LLM outputs. Furthermore, we introduce the Paraphrased Hallucination Consistency Score (PHCS) to quantify inconsistencies in LLM responses across semantically equivalent queries, offering deeper insights into model reliability.

Motivation: 解决知识图谱基础模型在链接预测中虽表现优异但无法捕捉个体用户偏好的问题，弥合通用关系推理与个性化排名之间的关键差距。

Method: GatedBias采用结构门控适应方法，结合特定于用户档案的特征和图导出的二元门，生成可解释的、针对每个实体的偏置，仅需约300个可训练参数。

Result: 在Amazon-Book和Last-FM两个基准数据集上，GatedBias在保持群体性能的同时，显著提高了对齐指标。反事实扰动实验验证了因果响应性，受益于特定偏好信号的实体在信号增强时排名提升了6-30倍。

Conclusion: GatedBias成功地在不牺牲全局准确性的情况下，通过轻量级的个性化框架将知识图谱嵌入适配到个体用户上下文，实现了参数高效且因果可验证的个性化适应。

Abstract: Foundation models for knowledge graphs (KGs) achieve strong cohort-level performance in link prediction, yet fail to capture individual user preferences; a key disconnect between general relational reasoning and personalized ranking. We propose GatedBias, a lightweight inference-time personalization framework that adapts frozen KG embeddings to individual user contexts without retraining or compromising global accuracy. Our approach introduces structure-gated adaptation: profile-specific features combine with graph-derived binary gates to produce interpretable, per-entity biases, requiring only ${\sim}300$ trainable parameters. We evaluate GatedBias on two benchmark datasets (Amazon-Book and Last-FM), demonstrating statistically significant improvements in alignment metrics while preserving cohort performance. Counterfactual perturbation experiments validate causal responsiveness; entities benefiting from specific preference signals show 6--30$\times$ greater rank improvements when those signals are boosted. These results show that personalized adaptation of foundation models can be both parameter-efficient and causally verifiable, bridging general knowledge representations with individual user needs.

Conclusion: Monadic Context Engineering (MCE) 提供了一种基于代数结构的正式框架，用于设计稳健、高效且可组合的自主代理。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed a shift towards autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use. However, current agent architectures are frequently constructed using imperative, ad hoc patterns. This results in brittle systems plagued by difficulties in state management, error handling, and concurrency. This paper introduces Monadic Context Engineering (MCE), a novel architectural paradigm leveraging the algebraic structures of Functors, Applicative Functors, and Monads to provide a formal foundation for agent design. MCE treats agent workflows as computational contexts where cross-cutting concerns, such as state propagation, short-circuiting error handling, and asynchronous execution, are managed intrinsically by the algebraic properties of the abstraction. We demonstrate how Monads enable robust sequential composition, how Applicatives provide a principled structure for parallel execution, and crucially, how Monad Transformers allow for the systematic composition of these capabilities. This layered approach enables developers to construct complex, resilient, and efficient AI agents from simple, independently verifiable components. We further extend this framework to describe Meta-Agents, which leverage MCE for generative orchestration, dynamically creating and managing sub-agent workflows through metaprogramming.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的普及加剧了对其操纵性或欺骗性行为的担忧，现有安全基准主要依赖粗粒度的二元标签，无法捕捉构成操纵的微妙心理和社会机制。

Method: 研究提出了一个四层分析管道，包括多粒度检测（MGD）、多尺度意图分析（MSIAN）、威胁协调协议（THP）和深度上下文风险对齐（DCRA）。数据集包含401个精心筛选的示例，配有指令-响应对和专家标注。

Conclusion: DarkPatterns-LLM建立了首个标准化、多维度的LLM操纵检测基准，为构建更可信的AI系统提供了可操作的诊断工具。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified concerns about manipulative or deceptive behaviors that can undermine user autonomy, trust, and well-being. Existing safety benchmarks predominantly rely on coarse binary labels and fail to capture the nuanced psychological and social mechanisms constituting manipulation. We introduce \textbf{DarkPatterns-LLM}, a comprehensive benchmark dataset and diagnostic framework for fine-grained assessment of manipulative content in LLM outputs across seven harm categories: Legal/Power, Psychological, Emotional, Physical, Autonomy, Economic, and Societal Harm. Our framework implements a four-layer analytical pipeline comprising Multi-Granular Detection (MGD), Multi-Scale Intent Analysis (MSIAN), Threat Harmonization Protocol (THP), and Deep Contextual Risk Alignment (DCRA). The dataset contains 401 meticulously curated examples with instruction-response pairs and expert annotations. Through evaluation of state-of-the-art models including GPT-4, Claude 3.5, and LLaMA-3-70B, we observe significant performance disparities (65.2\%--89.7\%) and consistent weaknesses in detecting autonomy-undermining patterns. DarkPatterns-LLM establishes the first standardized, multi-dimensional benchmark for manipulation detection in LLMs, offering actionable diagnostics toward more trustworthy AI systems.

Motivation: 铝纳米颗粒（ANPs）作为高能固体燃料，其从钝化颗粒到爆炸反应物的原子机制尚不明确，传统计算方法在精度和规模上存在局限。

Method: 采用‘人在循环’的闭环框架，利用自审计AI代理验证机器学习势（MLP）的演化，确保量子力学精度同时实现百万原子系统的近线性扩展和纳秒时间尺度的模拟。

Result: 揭示了温度调控的双模式氧化机制：中温下氧化物壳层通过‘呼吸模式’动态调控氧化；超过临界温度则触发‘破裂模式’导致爆炸性燃烧。同时证实铝阳离子向外扩散在所有温度范围内主导质量传输。

Conclusion: 该研究建立了一个统一的原子尺度框架，用于设计高能纳米材料，通过智能计算设计精确调控点火敏感性和能量释放速率。

Abstract: Aluminum nanoparticles (ANPs) are among the most energy-dense solid fuels, yet the atomic mechanisms governing their transition from passivated particles to explosive reactants remain elusive. This stems from a fundamental computational bottleneck: ab initio methods offer quantum accuracy but are restricted to small spatiotemporal scales (< 500 atoms, picoseconds), while empirical force fields lack the reactive fidelity required for complex combustion environments. Herein, we bridge this gap by employing a "human-in-the-loop" closed-loop framework where self-auditing AI Agents validate the evolution of a machine learning potential (MLP). By acting as scientific sentinels that visualize hidden model artifacts for human decision-making, this collaborative cycle ensures quantum mechanical accuracy while exhibiting near-linear scalability to million-atom systems and accessing nanosecond timescales (energy RMSE: 1.2 meV/atom, force RMSE: 0.126 eV/Angstrom). Strikingly, our simulations reveal a temperature-regulated dual-mode oxidation mechanism: at moderate temperatures, the oxide shell acts as a dynamic "gatekeeper," regulating oxidation through a "breathing mode" of transient nanochannels; above a critical threshold, a "rupture mode" unleashes catastrophic shell failure and explosive combustion. Importantly, we resolve a decades-old controversy by demonstrating that aluminum cation outward diffusion, rather than oxygen transport, dominates mass transfer across all temperature regimes, with diffusion coefficients consistently exceeding those of oxygen by 2-3 orders of magnitude. These discoveries establish a unified atomic-scale framework for energetic nanomaterial design, enabling the precision engineering of ignition sensitivity and energy release rates through intelligent computational design.

Conclusion: 作者主张，重新激发脑科学与AI之间历史上富有成果的交流，将有助于实现安全、可解释的以人为中心的AI。

Abstract: The phenomenal advances in large language models (LLMs) and other foundation models over the past few years have been based on optimizing large-scale transformer models on the surprisingly simple objective of minimizing next-token prediction loss, a form of predictive coding that is also the backbone of an increasingly popular model of brain function in neuroscience and cognitive science. However, current foundation models ignore three other important components of state-of-the-art predictive coding models: tight integration of actions with generative models, hierarchical compositional structure, and episodic memory. We propose that to achieve safe, interpretable, energy-efficient, and human-like AI, foundation models should integrate actions, at multiple scales of abstraction, with a compositional generative architecture and episodic memory. We present recent evidence from neuroscience and cognitive science on the importance of each of these components. We describe how the addition of these missing components to foundation models could help address some of their current deficiencies: hallucinations and superficial understanding of concepts due to lack of grounding, a missing sense of agency/responsibility due to lack of control, threats to safety and trustworthiness due to lack of interpretability, and energy inefficiency. We compare our proposal to current trends, such as adding chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to foundation models, and discuss new ways of augmenting these models with brain-inspired components. We conclude by arguing that a rekindling of the historically fruitful exchange of ideas between brain science and AI will help pave the way towards safe and interpretable human-centered AI.

Motivation: 现有方法在泛化能力上存在局限：单模态方法受数据稀疏性和固有偏差限制，多模态方法则难以有效捕捉静态多模态表示与空间-时间动态之间的语义差距。

Method: 1. 构建统一的空间-时间关系图（STRG），利用LLM增强的空间-时间知识图（STKG）捕捉功能语义和空间-时间知识。2. 设计门控机制融合不同模态的空间-时间图表示，并提出STKG引导的跨模态对齐方法，将动态知识注入静态图像模态。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种名为M$^3$ob的多模态空间-时间知识融合方法，通过构建统一的STRG和设计门控机制，有效提升了位置推荐任务的性能，并在正常和异常场景下均展现出显著的泛化能力。

Abstract: The precise prediction of human mobility has produced significant socioeconomic impacts, such as location recommendations and evacuation suggestions. However, existing methods suffer from limited generalization capability: unimodal approaches are constrained by data sparsity and inherent biases, while multi-modal methods struggle to effectively capture mobility dynamics caused by the semantic gap between static multi-modal representation and spatial-temporal dynamics. Therefore, we leverage multi-modal spatial-temporal knowledge to characterize mobility dynamics for the location recommendation task, dubbed as \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{Mob}ility (\textbf{M}$^3$\textbf{ob}). First, we construct a unified spatial-temporal relational graph (STRG) for multi-modal representation, by leveraging the functional semantics and spatial-temporal knowledge captured by the large language models (LLMs)-enhanced spatial-temporal knowledge graph (STKG). Second, we design a gating mechanism to fuse spatial-temporal graph representations of different modalities, and propose an STKG-guided cross-modal alignment to inject spatial-temporal dynamic knowledge into the static image modality. Extensive experiments on six public datasets show that our proposed method not only achieves consistent improvements in normal scenarios but also exhibits significant generalization ability in abnormal scenarios.

Abstract: Due to the high value and high failure rate of startups, predicting their success has become a critical challenge across interdisciplinary research. Existing approaches typically model success prediction from the perspective of a single decision-maker, overlooking the collective dynamics of investor groups that dominate real-world venture capital (VC) decisions. In this paper, we propose SimVC-CAS, a novel collective agent system that simulates VC decision-making as a multi-agent interaction process. By designing role-playing agents and a GNN-based supervised interaction module, we reformulate startup financing prediction as a group decision-making task, capturing both enterprise fundamentals and the behavioral dynamics of potential investor networks. Each agent embodies an investor with unique traits and preferences, enabling heterogeneous evaluation and realistic information exchange through a graph-structured co-investment network. Using real-world data from PitchBook and under strict data leakage controls, we show that SimVC-CAS significantly improves predictive accuracy while providing interpretable, multiperspective reasoning, for example, approximately 25% relative improvement with respect to average precision@10. SimVC-CAS also sheds light on other complex group decision scenarios.

*Paul Schneider,Amalie Schramm*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，让不同大语言模型互相审议预测可提升准确性，但仅限多样模型共享信息时；同质模型或额外信息无效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索结构化审议（类似人类预测者的干预方法）是否也能提升大语言模型的预测准确性。

Method: 使用202个已解决的二元问题，评估了四种不同情境下（模型多样性及信息分布组合）的预测准确性。

Result: 在模型多样且信息共享的情境下，预测准确性显著提升（Log Loss减少0.020，相对提升约4%，p=0.017）。但在同质模型或提供额外信息时无显著改善。

Conclusion: 研究发现，结构化审议可以作为一种有效策略提升大语言模型的预测准确性，尤其是在模型多样且信息共享的情况下。然而，在模型同质化或提供额外上下文信息时，效果不明显。

Abstract: Structured deliberation has been found to improve the performance of human forecasters. This study investigates whether a similar intervention, i.e. allowing LLMs to review each other's forecasts before updating, can improve accuracy in large language models (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini Pro 2.5). Using 202 resolved binary questions from the Metaculus Q2 2025 AI Forecasting Tournament, accuracy was assessed across four scenarios: (1) diverse models with distributed information, (2) diverse models with shared information, (3) homogeneous models with distributed information, and (4) homogeneous models with shared information. Results show that the intervention significantly improves accuracy in scenario (2), reducing Log Loss by 0.020 or about 4 percent in relative terms (p = 0.017). However, when homogeneous groups (three instances of the same model) engaged in the same process, no benefit was observed. Unexpectedly, providing LLMs with additional contextual information did not improve forecast accuracy, limiting our ability to study information pooling as a mechanism. Our findings suggest that deliberation may be a viable strategy for improving LLM forecasting.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DICE是一种新型RAG评估框架，通过透明、置信度感知的评分和高效计算，显著提升了评估的可解释性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有标量指标在可解释性、不确定性量化和多系统比较的计算效率方面存在不足，阻碍了RAG技术的负责任部署。

Method: DICE采用两阶段、证据耦合的框架，结合深度分析推理与概率评分，通过瑞士系统锦标赛提高计算效率。

Result: 在中文金融QA数据集上，DICE与人类专家的达成85.7%的一致性，显著优于现有基于LLM的指标如RAGAS。

Conclusion: DICE被确立为一种负责任、可解释且高效的范式，用于可信赖的RAG系统评估。

Abstract: As Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems evolve toward more sophisticated architectures, ensuring their trustworthiness through explainable and robust evaluation becomes critical. Existing scalar metrics suffer from limited interpretability, inadequate uncertainty quantification, and computational inefficiency in multi-system comparisons, hindering responsible deployment of RAG technologies. We introduce DICE (Discrete Interpretable Comparative Evaluation), a two-stage, evidence-coupled framework that advances explainability and robustness in RAG evaluation. DICE combines deep analytical reasoning with probabilistic $\{A, B, Tie\}$ scoring to produce transparent, confidence-aware judgments that support accountable system improvement through interpretable reasoning traces, enabling systematic error diagnosis and actionable insights. To address efficiency challenges at scale, DICE employs a Swiss-system tournament that reduces computational complexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N \log N)$, achieving a 42.9% reduction in our eight-system evaluation while preserving ranking fidelity. Validation on a curated Chinese financial QA dataset demonstrates that DICE achieves 85.7% agreement with human experts, substantially outperforming existing LLM-based metrics such as RAGAS. Our results establish DICE as a responsible, explainable, and efficient paradigm for trustworthy RAG system assessment.

TL;DR: TravelBench 是一个多轮交互和工具使用的旅行规划基准，用于全面评估 LLM 代理的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旅行规划是测试 LLM 代理能力的理想场景，因为它需要多步推理、通过交互迭代偏好获取以及在动态约束下调用外部工具。现有研究在领域覆盖和多轮交互方面存在局限，无法全面评估代理能力。

Method: 通过构建包含多轮交互、单轮交互和不可解子集的 TravelBench 基准，并在受控沙盒环境中使用 10 种旅行领域工具进行确定性输出，以评估不同 LLM 的性能。

Result: 评估了多个 LLM 在 TravelBench 上的表现，并分析了它们的行为和性能。

Conclusion: TravelBench 提供了一个实用且可复现的基准，用于推动 LLM 代理在旅行规划中的发展。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in planning and tool use. Travel planning provides a natural and high-impact testbed for these capabilities, as it requires multi-step reasoning, iterative preference elicitation through interaction, and calls to external tools under evolving constraints. Prior work has studied LLMs on travel-planning tasks, but existing settings are limited in domain coverage and multi-turn interaction. As a result, they cannot support dynamic user-agent interaction and therefore fail to comprehensively assess agent capabilities. In this paper, we introduce TravelBench, a real-world travel-planning benchmark featuring multi-turn interaction and tool use. We collect user requests from real-world scenarios and construct three subsets-multi-turn, single-turn, and unsolvable-to evaluate different aspects of agent performance. For stable and reproducible evaluation, we build a controlled sandbox environment with 10 travel-domain tools, providing deterministic tool outputs for reliable reasoning. We evaluate multiple LLMs on TravelBench and conduct an analysis of their behaviors and performance. TravelBench offers a practical and reproducible benchmark for advancing LLM agents in travel planning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合情景记忆与强化学习的理论框架，通过反思机制实现语言模型代理的持续自适应，无需参数更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型代理在持续和体验式学习中需要适应交互而无需反向传播或模型微调的问题，打破传统训练与部署的分离。

Method: 提出了Stateful Reflective Decision Process，将反思学习建模为与情景记忆的两阶段读写交互：写入存储交互结果（策略评估），读取检索相关案例（策略改进）。并利用熵正则化策略迭代实例化框架。

Result: 该框架诱导了一个增强状态记忆表示的等效马尔可夫决策过程，允许使用动态规划和强化学习的经典工具，并建立了收敛保证。

Conclusion: 该论文为无需参数更新的持续自适应语言模型代理提供了一个理论基础，通过将情景记忆与强化学习结合，证明了在记忆覆盖足够状态空间时，策略会收敛到最优解。

Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework for continual and experiential learning in large language model agents that integrates episodic memory with reinforcement learning. The framework identifies reflection as the key mechanism that enables agents to adapt through interaction without back propagation or model fine tuning, thereby relaxing the conventional separation between training and deployment.To formalise this process, we introduce the Stateful Reflective Decision Process, which models reflective learning as a two stage read write interaction with episodic memory. Writing stores interaction outcomes and corresponds to policy evaluation, while reading retrieves relevant past cases and corresponds to policy improvement. We show that this process induces an equivalent Markov decision process over augmented state memory representations, allowing the use of classical tools from dynamic programming and reinforcement learning. We further instantiate the framework using entropy regularised policy iteration and establish convergence guarantees. As episodic memory grows and achieves sufficient coverage of the state space, the resulting policy converges to the optimal solution. This work provides a principled foundation for memory augmented and retrieval based language model agents capable of continual adaptation without parameter updates.

TL;DR: SAMP-HDRL通过分层DRL和动态资产分组，在非平稳市场中实现了优于传统和DRL基准的投资组合优化，具有更高的回报和风险调整收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非平稳市场中的投资组合优化由于制度转变、动态相关性和深度强化学习（DRL）策略的可解释性有限而具有挑战性。

Method: 框架首先应用动态资产分组将市场划分为高质量和普通子集。上层代理提取全局市场信号，而下层代理在掩码约束下执行组内分配。基于效用的资本分配机制整合了风险和无风险资产，确保全局和局部决策的协调一致。

Result: 在三种市场制度（2019-2021）的回测中，SAMP-HDRL在波动和振荡条件下始终优于九种传统基线和九种DRL基准。与最强基线相比，该方法实现了至少5%更高的回报、5%更高的夏普比率、5%更高的索提诺比率和2%更高的欧米茄比率，在动荡市场中观察到更大的收益。

Conclusion: SAMP-HDRL通过将结构性市场约束直接嵌入DRL流程，在复杂金融环境中提供了更好的适应性、鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: Portfolio optimization in non-stationary markets is challenging due to regime shifts, dynamic correlations, and the limited interpretability of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policies. We propose a Segmented Allocation with Momentum-Adjusted Utility for Multi-agent Portfolio Management via Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (SAMP-HDRL). The framework first applies dynamic asset grouping to partition the market into high-quality and ordinary subsets. An upper-level agent extracts global market signals, while lower-level agents perform intra-group allocation under mask constraints. A utility-based capital allocation mechanism integrates risky and risk-free assets, ensuring coherent coordination between global and local decisions. backtests across three market regimes (2019--2021) demonstrate that SAMP-HDRL consistently outperforms nine traditional baselines and nine DRL benchmarks under volatile and oscillating conditions. Compared with the strongest baseline, our method achieves at least 5\% higher Return, 5\% higher Sharpe ratio, 5\% higher Sortino ratio, and 2\% higher Omega ratio, with substantially larger gains observed in turbulent markets. Ablation studies confirm that upper--lower coordination, dynamic clustering, and capital allocation are indispensable to robustness. SHAP-based interpretability further reveals a complementary ``diversified + concentrated'' mechanism across agents, providing transparent insights into decision-making. Overall, SAMP-HDRL embeds structural market constraints directly into the DRL pipeline, offering improved adaptability, robustness, and interpretability in complex financial environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试过于碎片化，未能反映真实科学探究的层次性和多学科性，因此需要开发一个更全面的评估框架。

Method: 引入了一个分层基准 HiSciBench，包含五个层次，涵盖从基础科学素养到科学发现的完整科学工作流程，支持多模态输入和跨语言评估。

Result: 对领先模型的全面评估显示，在基础素养任务上模型准确率可达 69%，但在发现级挑战上表现急剧下降至 25%。

Conclusion: HiSciBench 为评估科学智能提供了一个新的标准，并提供了开发更强大、更可靠模型的可操作见解。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal foundation models has sparked growing interest in their potential for scientific research. However, scientific intelligence encompasses a broad spectrum of abilities ranging from understanding fundamental knowledge to conducting creative discovery, and existing benchmarks remain fragmented. Most focus on narrow tasks and fail to reflect the hierarchical and multi-disciplinary nature of real scientific inquiry. We introduce \textbf{HiSciBench}, a hierarchical benchmark designed to evaluate foundation models across five levels that mirror the complete scientific workflow: \textit{Scientific Literacy} (L1), \textit{Literature Parsing} (L2), \textit{Literature-based Question Answering} (L3), \textit{Literature Review Generation} (L4), and \textit{Scientific Discovery} (L5). HiSciBench contains 8,735 carefully curated instances spanning six major scientific disciplines, including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, and astronomy, and supports multimodal inputs including text, equations, figures, and tables, as well as cross-lingual evaluation. Unlike prior benchmarks that assess isolated abilities, HiSciBench provides an integrated, dependency-aware framework that enables detailed diagnosis of model capabilities across different stages of scientific reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations of leading models, including GPT-5, DeepSeek-R1, and several multimodal systems, reveal substantial performance gaps: while models achieve up to 69\% accuracy on basic literacy tasks, performance declines sharply to 25\% on discovery-level challenges. HiSciBench establishes a new standard for evaluating scientific Intelligence and offers actionable insights for developing models that are not only more capable but also more reliable. The benchmark will be publicly released to facilitate future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如Ultra）仅依赖单一关系变换，限制了表达能力，无法捕捉多样化图谱中的不同关系和结构模式。

Method: 提出Gamma模型，采用多头几何注意力机制，结合实数、复数、分裂复数和双数等多种关系变换，并通过关系条件注意力融合机制自适应地融合这些变换。

Result: 在56个多样化知识图谱上的实验表明，Gamma在零样本归纳链接预测任务中比Ultra平均倒数排名提高了5.5%，在所有基准测试中提高了4.4%。

Conclusion: Gamma模型通过引入多头几何注意力机制和多种关系变换，显著提升了知识图谱推理的表现，特别是在零样本归纳链接预测任务中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Structural knowledge graph foundation models aim to generalize reasoning to completely new graphs with unseen entities and relations. A key limitation of existing approaches like Ultra is their reliance on a single relational transformation (e.g., element-wise multiplication) in message passing, which can constrain expressiveness and fail to capture diverse relational and structural patterns exhibited on diverse graphs. In this paper, we propose Gamma, a novel foundation model that introduces multi-head geometric attention to knowledge graph reasoning. Gamma replaces the single relational transformation with multiple parallel ones, including real, complex, split-complex, and dual number based transformations, each designed to model different relational structures. A relational conditioned attention fusion mechanism then adaptively fuses them at link level via a lightweight gating with entropy regularization, allowing the model to robustly emphasize the most appropriate relational bias for each triple pattern. We present a full formalization of these algebraic message functions and discuss how their combination increases expressiveness beyond any single space. Comprehensive experiments on 56 diverse knowledge graphs demonstrate that Gamma consistently outperforms Ultra in zero-shot inductive link prediction, with a 5.5% improvement in mean reciprocal rank on the inductive benchmarks and a 4.4% improvement across all benchmarks, highlighting benefits from complementary geometric representations.

Result: 实验结果表明，RW-Post和AgentFact的结合在多模态事实核查中取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: RW-Post数据集与AgentFact框架的结合显著提升了多模态事实核查的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation poses a growing challenge for automated fact-checking systems. Existing approaches, including large vision language models (LVLMs) and deep multimodal fusion methods, often fall short due to limited reasoning and shallow evidence utilization. A key bottleneck is the lack of dedicated datasets that provide complete real-world multimodal misinformation instances accompanied by annotated reasoning processes and verifiable evidence. To address this limitation, we introduce RW-Post, a high-quality and explainable dataset for real-world multimodal fact-checking. RW-Post aligns real-world multimodal claims with their original social media posts, preserving the rich contextual information in which the claims are made. In addition, the dataset includes detailed reasoning and explicitly linked evidence, which are derived from human written fact-checking articles via a large language model assisted extraction pipeline, enabling comprehensive verification and explanation. Building upon RW-Post, we propose AgentFact, an agent-based multimodal fact-checking framework designed to emulate the human verification workflow. AgentFact consists of five specialized agents that collaboratively handle key fact-checking subtasks, including strategy planning, high-quality evidence retrieval, visual analysis, reasoning, and explanation generation. These agents are orchestrated through an iterative workflow that alternates between evidence searching and task-aware evidence filtering and reasoning, facilitating strategic decision-making and systematic evidence analysis. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the synergy between RW-Post and AgentFact substantially improves both the accuracy and interpretability of multimodal fact-checking.

TL;DR: 研究发现，LLM在评估学习者知识变化时存在局限性，DKT在性能和稳定性上均优于LLM，表明LLM单独使用难以替代传统智能辅导系统，需结合学习者建模的混合框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对K-12教育中基于LLM的辅导系统可能替代传统学习者建模的误解，尤其是欧盟AI法案将K-12列为高风险领域，本研究旨在探讨LLM在评估学习者知识变化时的局限性。

Method: 本研究通过对比深度知识追踪（DKT）模型与广泛使用的LLM（零样本和微调版本），使用大型开放数据集评估了学习者在时间上的知识变化评估的准确性、可靠性和时间一致性。

Result: 结果显示，DKT在下一步正确性预测上的判别性能最高（AUC = 0.83），且在所有设置中均优于LLM。微调虽使LLM的AUC提高了约8%，但仍比DKT低6%，且早期序列错误更高。时间分析进一步表明，DKT保持了稳定且方向正确的掌握度更新，而LLM变体表现出显著的时间弱点。

Conclusion: 研究结论表明，单纯依赖大型语言模型（LLM）难以达到现有智能辅导系统的效果，负责任的辅导需要结合学习者建模的混合框架。

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language model (LLM)-based tutors in K--12 education has fostered a misconception that generative models can replace traditional learner modelling for adaptive instruction. This is especially problematic in K--12 settings, which the EU AI Act classifies as high-risk domain requiring responsible design. Motivated by these concerns, this study synthesises evidence on limitations of LLM-based tutors and empirically investigates one critical issue: the accuracy, reliability, and temporal coherence of assessing learners' evolving knowledge over time. We compare a deep knowledge tracing (DKT) model with a widely used LLM, evaluated zero-shot and fine-tuned, using a large open-access dataset. Results show that DKT achieves the highest discrimination performance (AUC = 0.83) on next-step correctness prediction and consistently outperforms the LLM across settings. Although fine-tuning improves the LLM's AUC by approximately 8\% over the zero-shot baseline, it remains 6\% below DKT and produces higher early-sequence errors, where incorrect predictions are most harmful for adaptive support. Temporal analyses further reveal that DKT maintains stable, directionally correct mastery updates, whereas LLM variants exhibit substantial temporal weaknesses, including inconsistent and wrong-direction updates. These limitations persist despite the fine-tuned LLM requiring nearly 198 hours of high-compute training, far exceeding the computational demands of DKT. Our qualitative analysis of multi-skill mastery estimation further shows that, even after fine-tuning, the LLM produced inconsistent mastery trajectories, while DKT maintained smooth and coherent updates. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs alone are unlikely to match the effectiveness of established intelligent tutoring systems, and that responsible tutoring requires hybrid frameworks that incorporate learner modelling.

Motivation: 解决奖励模型在部署时无法有效指导生成决策的问题，揭示奖励模型准确性与行为对齐之间的脱节。

Method: 通过系统评估三个数据集，引入策略准确性指标，并开发Pref-LaMP基准测试。

Result: 标准奖励模型准确性作为部署选择标准完全失败，简单上下文学习方法在大型模型中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究表明，当前领域优化的代理指标无法预测实际部署性能，也无法在部署约束下将偏好转化为真实的行为适应。

Abstract: Personalized alignment from preference data has focused primarily on improving reward model (RM) accuracy, with the implicit assumption that better preference ranking translates to better personalized behavior. However, in deployment, computational constraints necessitate inference-time adaptation via reward-guided decoding (RGD) rather than per-user policy fine-tuning. This creates a critical but overlooked requirement: reward models must not only rank preferences accurately but also effectively guide token-level generation decisions. We demonstrate that standard RM accuracy fails catastrophically as a selection criterion for deployment-ready personalized alignment. Through systematic evaluation across three datasets, we introduce policy accuracy, a metric quantifying whether RGD scoring functions correctly discriminate between preferred and dispreferred responses. We show that RM accuracy correlates only weakly with this policy-level discrimination ability (Kendall's tau = 0.08--0.31). More critically, we introduce Pref-LaMP, the first personalized alignment benchmark with ground-truth user completions, enabling direct behavioral evaluation without circular reward-based metrics. On Pref-LaMP, we expose a complete decoupling between discrimination and generation: methods with 20-point RM accuracy differences produce almost identical output quality, and even methods achieving high discrimination fail to generate behaviorally aligned responses. Finally, simple in-context learning (ICL) dominates all reward-guided methods for models > 3B parameters, achieving 3-5 point ROUGE-1 gains over the best reward method at 7B scale. These findings show that the field optimizes proxy metrics that fail to predict deployment performance and do not translate preferences into real behavioral adaptation under deployment constraints.

Motivation: 尽管RL在大型语言模型（LLMs）中的推理任务上取得了进展，但其在资源受限的医学影像应用中的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用R1-style方法（SFT后接GRPO），仅使用2,000个SFT样本、1,000个RL样本和单个A100 GPU训练了ChexReason模型。

Result: GRPO在CheXpert上实现了23%的性能提升（macro-F1 = 0.346），但在NIH数据集上表现下降19%，表明RL范式可能限制了跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: 经过优化的强化学习（RL）方法（如GRPO）在分布内性能上表现优异，但在跨数据集迁移性上表现不佳，这表明在临床部署中，精心设计的监督微调（SFT）可能比激进的RL更适用于需要跨人群鲁棒性的场景。

Abstract: Recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) advances for Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved reasoning tasks, yet their resource-constrained application to medical imaging remains underexplored. We introduce ChexReason, a vision-language model trained via R1-style methodology (SFT followed by GRPO) using only 2,000 SFT samples, 1,000 RL samples, and a single A100 GPU. Evaluations on CheXpert and NIH benchmarks reveal a fundamental tension: GRPO recovers in-distribution performance (23% improvement on CheXpert, macro-F1 = 0.346) but degrades cross-dataset transferability (19% drop on NIH). This mirrors high-resource models like NV-Reason-CXR-3B, suggesting the issue stems from the RL paradigm rather than scale. We identify a generalization paradox where the SFT checkpoint uniquely improves on NIH before optimization, indicating teacher-guided reasoning captures more institution-agnostic features. Furthermore, cross-model comparisons show structured reasoning scaffolds benefit general-purpose VLMs but offer minimal gain for medically pre-trained models. Consequently, curated supervised fine-tuning may outperform aggressive RL for clinical deployment requiring robustness across diverse populations.

Motivation: DPO及其变体存在两个根本性限制：最优策略依赖任意建模选择，且孤立处理响应生成未能利用成对数据中的比较信息。

Method: 提出了Intrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (\q)，通过同时考虑上下文和备选响应，推导出全局最优策略。

Result: 实验显示，\q在胜率和长度控制指标上持续改进，验证了自我反思能产生更稳健、更人类对齐的LLM。

Conclusion: Intrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (\q) 被证明优于DPO/RLHF，且在标量化和参考选择上具有不变性，能有效提升LLM的稳健性和人类对齐性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants have become standard for aligning Large Language Models due to their simplicity and offline stability. However, we identify two fundamental limitations. First, the optimal policy depends on arbitrary modeling choices (scalarization function, reference policy), yielding behavior reflecting parameterization artifacts rather than true preferences. Second, treating response generation in isolation fails to leverage comparative information in pairwise data, leaving the model's capacity for intrinsic self-reflection untapped. To address it, we propose Intrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (\q), deriving a globally optimal policy conditioning on both context and alternative responses. We prove this formulation superior to DPO/RLHF while guaranteeing invariance to scalarization and reference choices. \q~serves as a plug-and-play enhancement without architectural changes or inference overhead. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in win rates and length-controlled metrics, validating that unlocking self-reflection yields more robust, human-aligned LLMs.

Conclusion: 本文提出了改进评估人工智能（AI）系统中情感智能（EI）框架的必要性，并提出了避免现有评估短板的策略。

Abstract: In this paper, we develop the position that current frameworks for evaluating emotional intelligence (EI) in artificial intelligence (AI) systems need refinement because they do not adequately or comprehensively measure the various aspects of EI relevant in AI. Human EI often involves a phenomenological component and a sense of understanding that artificially intelligent systems lack; therefore, some aspects of EI are irrelevant in evaluating AI systems. However, EI also includes an ability to sense an emotional state, explain it, respond appropriately, and adapt to new contexts (e.g., multicultural), and artificially intelligent systems can do such things to greater or lesser degrees. Several benchmark frameworks specialize in evaluating the capacity of different AI models to perform some tasks related to EI, but these often lack a solid foundation regarding the nature of emotion and what it is to be emotionally intelligent. In this project, we begin by reviewing different theories about emotion and general EI, evaluating the extent to which each is applicable to artificial systems. We then critically evaluate the available benchmark frameworks, identifying where each falls short in light of the account of EI developed in the first section. Lastly, we outline some options for improving evaluation strategies to avoid these shortcomings in EI evaluation in AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often falter at complex planning tasks that require exploration and self-correction, as their linear reasoning process struggles to recover from early mistakes. While search algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) can explore alternatives, they are often ineffective when guided by sparse rewards and fail to leverage the rich semantic capabilities of LLMs. We introduce SPIRAL (Symbolic LLM Planning via Grounded and Reflective Search), a novel framework that embeds a cognitive architecture of three specialized LLM agents into an MCTS loop. SPIRAL's key contribution is its integrated planning pipeline where a Planner proposes creative next steps, a Simulator grounds the search by predicting realistic outcomes, and a Critic provides dense reward signals through reflection. This synergy transforms MCTS from a brute-force search into a guided, self-correcting reasoning process. On the DailyLifeAPIs and HuggingFace datasets, SPIRAL consistently outperforms the default Chain-of-Thought planning method and other state-of-the-art agents. More importantly, it substantially surpasses other state-of-the-art agents; for example, SPIRAL achieves 83.6% overall accuracy on DailyLifeAPIs, an improvement of over 16 percentage points against the next-best search framework, while also demonstrating superior token efficiency. Our work demonstrates that structuring LLM reasoning as a guided, reflective, and grounded search process yields more robust and efficient autonomous planners.

*Hongshen Sun,Juanjuan Zhang*

TL;DR: 论文提出‘模型信念’作为LLM生成数据的更高效度量，证明其统计优势并在需求估计研究中验证了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）被广泛用于模拟人类行为，但现有方法对LLM生成数据的利用效率低下。

Method: 作者通过引入并形式化‘模型信念’这一度量，证明了其统计效率更高，方差更低，收敛速度更快。

Result: 在实际应用中，模型信念比模型选择本身更能解释和预测真实模型选择，并将计算需求减少了约20倍。

Conclusion: 论文结论支持将‘模型信念’作为默认度量标准，以从LLM生成的数据中提取更多信息。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate human behavior, but common practices to use LLM-generated data are inefficient. Treating an LLM's output ("model choice") as a single data point underutilizes the information inherent to the probabilistic nature of LLMs. This paper introduces and formalizes "model belief," a measure derived from an LLM's token-level probabilities that captures the model's belief distribution over choice alternatives in a single generation run. The authors prove that model belief is asymptotically equivalent to the mean of model choices (a non-trivial property) but forms a more statistically efficient estimator, with lower variance and a faster convergence rate. Analogous properties are shown to hold for smooth functions of model belief and model choice often used in downstream applications. The authors demonstrate the performance of model belief through a demand estimation study, where an LLM simulates consumer responses to different prices. In practical settings with limited numbers of runs, model belief explains and predicts ground-truth model choice better than model choice itself, and reduces the computation needed to reach sufficiently accurate estimates by roughly a factor of 20. The findings support using model belief as the default measure to extract more information from LLM-generated data.

Motivation: 热舒适作为评估 AI 系统在现实世界中认知能力的理想范式，当前缺乏针对 LLM 的任务特定基准。

Method: 通过初始化具有虚拟个性属性的大型语言模型代理，引导其生成服装绝缘选择和热舒适反馈，并将输出与 ASHRAE 全球数据库和中国热舒适数据库进行验证。

Result: 实验显示，代理反馈与人类数据的精确对齐有限，但在 1 PMV 容忍度下方向一致性显著提高。统计测试表明，LLM 生成的 PMV 分布与人类数据显著不同，代理在离散热舒适分类中表现接近随机。

Conclusion: TCEval 被证实是一种生态有效的认知图灵测试，展示了当前大型语言模型具备基础的跨模态推理能力，但缺乏对热舒适中变量间非线性关系的精确因果理解。

Abstract: A critical gap exists in LLM task-specific benchmarks. Thermal comfort, a sophisticated interplay of environmental factors and personal perceptions involving sensory integration and adaptive decision-making, serves as an ideal paradigm for evaluating real-world cognitive capabilities of AI systems. To address this, we propose TCEval, the first evaluation framework that assesses three core cognitive capacities of AI, cross-modal reasoning, causal association, and adaptive decision-making, by leveraging thermal comfort scenarios and large language model (LLM) agents. The methodology involves initializing LLM agents with virtual personality attributes, guiding them to generate clothing insulation selections and thermal comfort feedback, and validating outputs against the ASHRAE Global Database and Chinese Thermal Comfort Database. Experiments on four LLMs show that while agent feedback has limited exact alignment with humans, directional consistency improves significantly with a 1 PMV tolerance. Statistical tests reveal that LLM-generated PMV distributions diverge markedly from human data, and agents perform near-randomly in discrete thermal comfort classification. These results confirm the feasibility of TCEval as an ecologically valid Cognitive Turing Test for AI, demonstrating that current LLMs possess foundational cross-modal reasoning ability but lack precise causal understanding of the nonlinear relationships between variables in thermal comfort. TCEval complements traditional benchmarks, shifting AI evaluation focus from abstract task proficiency to embodied, context-aware perception and decision-making, offering valuable insights for advancing AI in human-centric applications like smart buildings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前通用基础模型在物理控制任务中表现不佳（仅50-53%准确率），存在输入不忠实问题，这并非规模不足而是结构限制。感知中心架构无法满足安全关键控制的需求。

Method: 研究团队训练了一个3.6亿参数的紧凑语言模型，专注于合成反应器控制场景，并通过从10^3到10^5的样本规模扩展数据集。

Result: 大规模模型表现出方差崩溃（超过500倍减少），执行行为稳定；模型自主拒绝70%训练分布，95%运行时执行集中于单一策略，且学习表示可跨物理领域和输入模态迁移。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新型的领域特定基础模型——Agentic Physical AI，通过物理验证驱动的策略优化，显著提升了物理控制任务的执行稳定性和准确性。

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm in AI for physical systems, scaling general-purpose foundation models toward universal multimodal reasoning, confronts a fundamental barrier at the control interface. Recent benchmarks show that even frontier vision-language models achieve only 50-53% accuracy on basic quantitative physics tasks, behaving as approximate guessers that preserve semantic plausibility while violating physical constraints. This input unfaithfulness is not a scaling deficiency but a structural limitation. Perception-centric architectures optimize parameter-space imitation, whereas safety-critical control demands outcome-space guarantees over executed actions. Here, we present a fundamentally different pathway toward domain-specific foundation models by introducing compact language models operating as Agentic Physical AI, in which policy optimization is driven by physics-based validation rather than perceptual inference. We train a 360-million-parameter model on synthetic reactor control scenarios, scaling the dataset from 10^3 to 10^5 examples. This induces a sharp phase transition absent in general-purpose models. Small-scale systems exhibit high-variance imitation with catastrophic tail risk, while large-scale models undergo variance collapse exceeding 500x reduction, stabilizing execution-level behavior. Despite balanced exposure to four actuation families, the model autonomously rejects approximately 70% of the training distribution and concentrates 95% of runtime execution on a single-bank strategy. Learned representations transfer across distinct physics and continuous input modalities without architectural modification.

Conclusion: 本文揭示了符合性规划和超属性模型检查之间的紧密联系，证明了它们可以相互高效转换。

Abstract: We study the connection of two problems within the planning and verification community: Conformant planning and model-checking of hyperproperties. Conformant planning is the task of finding a sequential plan that achieves a given objective independent of non-deterministic action effects during the plan's execution. Hyperproperties are system properties that relate multiple execution traces of a system and, e.g., capture information-flow and fairness policies. In this paper, we show that model-checking of $\exists^*\forall^*$ hyperproperties is closely related to the problem of computing a conformant plan. Firstly, we show that we can efficiently reduce a hyperproperty model-checking instance to a conformant planning instance, and prove that our encoding is sound and complete. Secondly, we establish the converse direction: Every conformant planning problem is, itself, a hyperproperty model-checking task.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, while proficient in the digital realm, face a significant gap in physical-world deployment due to the challenge of forming and maintaining a robust spatial mental model. We identify three core cognitive challenges hindering this transition: spatial reasoning, long-horizon state tracking via mental simulation, and active exploration under partial observation. To isolate and evaluate these faculties, we introduce CubeBench, a novel generative benchmark centered on the Rubik's Cube. CubeBench uses a three-tiered diagnostic framework that progressively assesses agent capabilities, from foundational state tracking with full symbolic information to active exploration with only partial visual data. Our experiments on leading LLMs reveal critical limitations, including a uniform 0.00% pass rate on all long-horizon tasks, exposing a fundamental failure in long-term planning. We also propose a diagnostic framework to isolate these cognitive bottlenecks by providing external solver tools. By analyzing the failure modes, we provide key insights to guide the development of more physically-grounded intelligent agents.

Abstract: Traditional workflow-based agents exhibit limited intelligence when addressing real-world problems requiring tool invocation. Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) agents capable of autonomous reasoning and tool invocation are rapidly emerging as a powerful approach for complex decision-making tasks involving multi-step interactions with external environments. In this work, we introduce MindWatcher, a TIR agent integrating interleaved thinking and multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. MindWatcher can autonomously decide whether and how to invoke diverse tools and coordinate their use, without relying on human prompts or workflows. The interleaved thinking paradigm enables the model to switch between thinking and tool calling at any intermediate stage, while its multimodal CoT capability allows manipulation of images during reasoning to yield more precise search results. We implement automated data auditing and evaluation pipelines, complemented by manually curated high-quality datasets for training, and we construct a benchmark, called MindWatcher-Evaluate Bench (MWE-Bench), to evaluate its performance. MindWatcher is equipped with a comprehensive suite of auxiliary reasoning tools, enabling it to address broad-domain multimodal problems. A large-scale, high-quality local image retrieval database, covering eight categories including cars, animals, and plants, endows model with robust object recognition despite its small size. Finally, we design a more efficient training infrastructure for MindWatcher, enhancing training speed and hardware utilization. Experiments not only demonstrate that MindWatcher matches or exceeds the performance of larger or more recent models through superior tool invocation, but also uncover critical insights for agent training, such as the genetic inheritance phenomenon in agentic RL.

Conclusion: 深度非线性网络难以维持交互性，而深度线性网络随着容量增加能维持更高的交互性。

Abstract: Continual learning is often motivated by the idea, known as the big world hypothesis, that "the world is bigger" than the agent. Recent problem formulations capture this idea by explicitly constraining an agent relative to the environment. These constraints lead to solutions in which the agent continually adapts to best use its limited capacity, rather than converging to a fixed solution. However, explicit constraints can be ad hoc, difficult to incorporate, and may limit the effectiveness of scaling up the agent's capacity. In this paper, we characterize a problem setting in which an agent, regardless of its capacity, is constrained by being embedded in the environment. In particular, we introduce a computationally-embedded perspective that represents an embedded agent as an automaton simulated within a universal (formal) computer. Such an automaton is always constrained; we prove that it is equivalent to an agent that interacts with a partially observable Markov decision process over a countably infinite state-space. We propose an objective for this setting, which we call interactivity, that measures an agent's ability to continually adapt its behaviour by learning new predictions. We then develop a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm for interactivity-seeking, and use it to construct a synthetic problem to evaluate continual learning capability. Our results show that deep nonlinear networks struggle to sustain interactivity, whereas deep linear networks sustain higher interactivity as capacity increases.

Conclusion: AKG kernel agent通过自动化内核生成、迁移和性能调优，显著加速了现代AI工作负载的内核开发，支持多种DSL和硬件后端，展现了其有效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Modern AI models demand high-performance computation kernels. The growing complexity of LLMs, multimodal architectures, and recommendation systems, combined with techniques like sparsity and quantization, creates significant computational challenges. Moreover, frequent hardware updates and diverse chip architectures further complicate this landscape, requiring tailored kernel implementations for each platform. However, manual optimization cannot keep pace with these demands, creating a critical bottleneck in AI system development. Recent advances in LLM code generation capabilities have opened new possibilities for automating kernel development. In this work, we propose AKG kernel agent (AI-driven Kernel Generator), a multi-agent system that automates kernel generation, migration, and performance tuning. AKG kernel agent is designed to support multiple domain-specific languages (DSLs), including Triton, TileLang, CPP, and CUDA-C, enabling it to target different hardware backends while maintaining correctness and portability. The system's modular design allows rapid integration of new DSLs and hardware targets. When evaluated on KernelBench using Triton DSL across GPU and NPU backends, AKG kernel agent achieves an average speedup of 1.46$\times$ over PyTorch Eager baselines implementations, demonstrating its effectiveness in accelerating kernel development for modern AI workloads.

Method: 提出Hindsight instruction Replay (HiR)，采用select-then-rewrite策略重放失败样本，并结合指令级和响应级的双偏好学习进行优化。

Result: 实验表明HiR在不同指令跟随任务中表现优异，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: HiR框架通过事后重放失败尝试作为成功样本，结合双偏好学习，显著提升了强化学习在复杂指令跟随任务中的效率和性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow instructions with various constraints. Despite the encouraging results, RL improvement inevitably relies on sampling successful, high-quality responses; however, the initial model often struggles to generate responses that satisfy all constraints due to its limited capabilities, yielding sparse or indistinguishable rewards that impede learning. In this work, we propose Hindsight instruction Replay (HiR), a novel sample-efficient RL framework for complex instruction following tasks, which employs a select-then-rewrite strategy to replay failed attempts as successes based on the constraints that have been satisfied in hindsight. We perform RL on these replayed samples as well as the original ones, theoretically framing the objective as dual-preference learning at both the instruction- and response-level to enable efficient optimization using only a binary reward signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed HiR yields promising results across different instruction following tasks, while requiring less computational budget.

Abstract: Most venture capital (VC) investments fail, while a few deliver outsized returns. Accurately predicting startup success requires synthesizing complex relational evidence, including company disclosures, investor track records, and investment network structures, through explicit reasoning to form coherent, interpretable investment theses. Traditional machine learning and graph neural networks both lack this reasoning capability. Large language models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning but face a modality mismatch with graphs. Recent graph-LLM methods target in-graph tasks where answers lie within the graph, whereas VC prediction is off-graph: the target exists outside the network. The core challenge is selecting graph paths that maximize predictor performance on an external objective while enabling step-by-step reasoning. We present MIRAGE-VC, a multi-perspective retrieval-augmented generation framework that addresses two obstacles: path explosion (thousands of candidate paths overwhelm LLM context) and heterogeneous evidence fusion (different startups need different analytical emphasis). Our information-gain-driven path retriever iteratively selects high-value neighbors, distilling investment networks into compact chains for explicit reasoning. A multi-agent architecture integrates three evidence streams via a learnable gating mechanism based on company attributes. Under strict anti-leakage controls, MIRAGE-VC achieves +5.0% F1 and +16.6% PrecisionAt5, and sheds light on other off-graph prediction tasks such as recommendation and risk assessment.

Abstract: How can we ensure that AI systems are aligned with human values and remain safe? We can study this problem through the frameworks of the AI assistance and the AI shutdown games. The AI assistance problem concerns designing an AI agent that helps a human to maximise their utility function(s). However, only the human knows these function(s); the AI assistant must learn them. The shutdown problem instead concerns designing AI agents that: shut down when a shutdown button is pressed; neither try to prevent nor cause the pressing of the shutdown button; and otherwise accomplish their task competently. In this paper, we show that addressing these challenges requires AI agents that can reason under uncertainty and handle both incomplete and non-Archimedean preferences.

Result: CreativeDC在多样性、新颖性和实用性上显著优于基线方法，且随着采样数量增加，生成独特问题的速度更快。

Conclusion: CreativeDC方法通过分阶段提示显著提升了LLM生成问题的多样性和新颖性，同时保持了高实用性，为教育材料生成提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significant potential for generating educational questions and problems, enabling educators to create large-scale learning materials. However, LLMs are fundamentally limited by the ``Artificial Hivemind'' effect, where they generate similar responses within the same model and produce homogeneous outputs across different models. As a consequence, students may be exposed to overly similar and repetitive LLM-generated problems, which harms diversity of thought. Drawing inspiration from Wallas's theory of creativity and Guilford's framework of divergent-convergent thinking, we propose CreativeDC, a two-phase prompting method that explicitly scaffolds the LLM's reasoning into distinct phases. By decoupling creative exploration from constraint satisfaction, our method enables LLMs to explore a broader space of ideas before committing to a final problem. We evaluate CreativeDC for creative problem generation using a comprehensive set of metrics that capture diversity, novelty, and utility. The results show that CreativeDC achieves significantly higher diversity and novelty compared to baselines while maintaining high utility. Moreover, scaling analysis shows that CreativeDC generates a larger effective number of distinct problems as more are sampled, increasing at a faster rate than baseline methods.

Abstract: We present NeuroSPICE, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for device and circuit simulation. Unlike conventional SPICE, which relies on time-discretized numerical solvers, NeuroSPICE leverages PINNs to solve circuit differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) by minimizing the residual of the equations through backpropagation. It models device and circuit waveforms using analytical equations in time domain with exact temporal derivatives. While PINNs do not outperform SPICE in speed or accuracy during training, they offer unique advantages such as surrogate models for design optimization and inverse problems. NeuroSPICE's flexibility enables the simulation of emerging devices, including highly nonlinear systems such as ferroelectric memories.

Abstract: Most causal discovery methods recover a completed partially directed acyclic graph representing a Markov equivalence class from observational data. Recent work has extended these methods to federated settings to address data decentralization and privacy constraints, but often under idealized assumptions that all clients share the same causal model. Such assumptions are unrealistic in practice, as client-specific policies or protocols, for example, across hospitals, naturally induce heterogeneous and unknown interventions. In this work, we address federated causal discovery under unknown client-level interventions. We propose I-PERI, a novel federated algorithm that first recovers the CPDAG of the union of client graphs and then orients additional edges by exploiting structural differences induced by interventions across clients. This yields a tighter equivalence class, which we call the $\mathbfΦ$-Markov Equivalence Class, represented by the $\mathbfΦ$-CPDAG. We provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of I-PERI, as well as on its privacy-preserving properties, and present empirical evaluations on synthetic data demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

TL;DR: WWM结合Web代码和LLM，实现可控且开放的世界模型，适用于多种场景。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在可靠性与无限环境之间的极端对立问题，寻求一种中间方案。

Method: WWM 将世界状态和“物理”实现为普通Web代码以确保逻辑一致性，同时利用大型语言模型生成上下文、叙事和高层决策。

Result: 构建了多种WWM系统，包括基于真实地理的无限旅行地图、虚构星系探索者等，验证了Web堆栈作为世界模型可扩展基质的潜力。

Conclusion: Web World Model (WWM) 提供了一种在可控性和开放性之间取得平衡的方法，通过结合传统Web框架和生成式世界模型，实现了可扩展且结构化的环境。

Abstract: Language agents increasingly require persistent worlds in which they can act, remember, and learn. Existing approaches sit at two extremes: conventional web frameworks provide reliable but fixed contexts backed by databases, while fully generative world models aim for unlimited environments at the expense of controllability and practical engineering. In this work, we introduce the Web World Model (WWM), a middle ground where world state and ``physics'' are implemented in ordinary web code to ensure logical consistency, while large language models generate context, narratives, and high-level decisions on top of this structured latent state. We build a suite of WWMs on a realistic web stack, including an infinite travel atlas grounded in real geography, fictional galaxy explorers, web-scale encyclopedic and narrative worlds, and simulation- and game-like environments. Across these systems, we identify practical design principles for WWMs: separating code-defined rules from model-driven imagination, representing latent state as typed web interfaces, and utilizing deterministic generation to achieve unlimited but structured exploration. Our results suggest that web stacks themselves can serve as a scalable substrate for world models, enabling controllable yet open-ended environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在有限前传和处理能力下，如何动态调整用户设备与接入点集群的匹配，以平衡服务质量（QoS）与能源效率的挑战。

Method: 采用社交匹配游戏理论模型，设计并实现了基于延迟接受（DA）和早期接受（EA）的两种算法，用于优化用户设备（UE）与接入点（AP）集群的动态匹配。

Result: 数值结果表明，用户设备与接入点集群的社交性模式（自私、平等主义、利他）对QoS满意度和能源效率有显著影响，其中平等主义模式表现最佳。

Conclusion: 本文通过引入基于社交性匹配的游戏理论模型，提出了两种新颖的算法（DA和EA），有效平衡了用户服务质量（QoS）与能源效率之间的冲突，其中平等主义（egalitarian）模式表现最佳。

Abstract: The cell-free architecture represents a significant advancement in network design, where each User Equipment (UE) is served by a group of distributed Access Points (APs), aimed at delivering uniformly high data rates to UEs across all locations. To ensure network scalability, user-centric clustering (UCC) has emerged as a practical approach, wherein only a selected subset of preferred APs jointly serves each UE. Forming the optimal cluster of APs for each UE is a challenging task, particularly when limited fronthaul and processing capabilities of both APs and UEs are considered. This challenge is exacerbated by the need for dynamic adjustments to enhance energy efficiency while meeting quality of service (QoS) requirements, which introduces conflicting interests between these entities. In this paper, we investigate the sociality regime of UEs and their clusters of APs, characterizing their intra-team cooperation as either selfish, egalitarian, or altruistic. These sociality regimes are crucial in achieving a balance between QoS and energy efficiency per UE. We address this problem by modeling it as a many-to-many social matching game with externalities, where connections can be established based on the sociality regime of both teams. To solve this, we introduce two novel algorithms based on Deferred Acceptance (DA) and Early Acceptance (EA) matching games. Numerical results show the significant impact of the sociality regime adopted by UEs and their clusters of APs on UE's QoS satisfaction and energy efficiency, with the egalitarian regime adopted by both entities proving the best performance trade-off.

Motivation: 解决6G C-V2X通信中因缺乏动态高保真REM而导致的物理层问题，提升通信稳定性。

Method: 采用Coordinate-Conditioned Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model（CCDDPM），将发射车辆坐标编码为高斯先验，并通过轻量级双通道条件U-Net架构与高斯噪声融合。

Result: 预测的REM在统计和结构上与真实REM高度匹配，且比其他生成式AI方法更稳定。

Conclusion: CCDDPM模型通过轻量级扩散生成方法，能够高效预测任意坐标下的6G V2X无线电环境地图（REM），显著提升6G C-V2X通信效率，减少发射车辆受物理层问题的影响。

Abstract: Transmitter vehicles that broadcast 6G Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X)-based messages, e.g., Basic Safety Messages (BSMs), are prone to be impacted by PHY issues due to the lack of dynamic high-fidelity Radio Environment Map (REM) with dynamic location variation. This paper explores a lightweight diffusion-based generative approach, the Coordinate-Conditioned Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (CCDDPM), that leverages the signal intensity-based 6G V2X Radio Environment Map (REM) from limited historical transmitter vehicles in a specific region, to predict the REMs for a transmitter vehicle with arbitrary coordinates across the same region. The transmitter vehicle coordinate is encoded as a smooth Gaussian prior and fused with the Gaussian noise through a lightweight two-channel conditional U-Net architecture. We demonstrate that the predicted REM closely matches the statistics and structure of ground-truth REM while exhibiting the improved stability and over other widely applied generative AI approaches. The resulting predictor enables rapid and scenario-consistent REM with arbitrary transmitter coordinates, which thereby supports more efficient 6G C-V2X communications where transmitter vehicles are less likely to suffer from the PHY issues.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) technology has become a transformative force in modern healthcare, particularly in elderly patient management. The current elderly care system faces significant challenges, including insufficient long-term care resources and poor communication between healthcare providers. To address this limitation, this study introduces a novel Starlink-assisted IOMT-based elderly healthcare model designed to improve remote patient monitoring and communication reliability. This proposal system focused on a monitoring system of key biomedical parameters such as electrocardiogram (ECG), body temperature, heart attack indicators, and a fall detection alert system. Performance is evaluated using the network simulator (NS-3) to assess its effectiveness in remote and underserved regions. Physiological data collected from patients are transmitted through a local communication hub and forwarded over a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite link to a medical center. Based on Quality of Service (QoS) technology that combines Flow Queuing (FQ) with Controlled Delay (CoDel) with Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) marking. This approach prioritizes critical health data for faster transmission while allocating lower priority to non-urgent information. This architecture is entirely wireless, allowing continuous monitoring, real-time alerts, and secure data storage for medical analysis. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed Starlink-enabled IOMT system outperforms existing solutions in terms of throughput, latency, and reliability. The findings highlight Starlink's potential as a robust and high-performance telehealth communication tool. In addition, this study provides a scalable and reproducible framework for future satellite-assisted healthcare systems that prioritize quality of service (QoS) performance and improved elderly patient care.

Abstract: The evolution of networked systems, driven by innovations in software-defined networking (SDN), network function virtualization (NFV), open radio access networks (O-RAN), and cloud-native architectures, is redefining both the operational landscape and the threat surface of critical infrastructures. This book offers an in-depth, interdisciplinary examination of how resilience must be re-conceptualized and re-engineered to address the multifaceted challenges posed by these transformations.
  Structured across six chapters, this book begins by surveying the contemporary risk landscape, identifying emerging cyber, physical, and AI-driven threats, and analyzing their implications for scalable, heterogeneous network environments. It then establishes rigorous definitions and evaluation frameworks for resilience, going beyond robustness and fault-tolerance to address adaptive, anticipatory, and retrospective mechanisms across diverse application domains.
  The core of the book delves into advanced paradigms and practical strategies for resilience, including zero trust architectures, game-theoretic threat modeling, and self-healing design principles. A significant portion is devoted to the role of artificial intelligence, especially reinforcement learning and large language models (LLMs), in enabling dynamic threat response, autonomous network control, and multi-agent coordination under uncertainty.

Motivation: 现有基于配置或意图驱动的强化学习方法依赖静态映射和SLA转换，缺乏自然语言理解与协调决策的整合。

Method: 采用基于Hierarchical Decision Mamba (HDM)控制器和大型语言模型(LLM)的超级代理框架，协调切片间、切片内及自愈代理。

Result: 与基于Transformer和奖励驱动的基线相比，Agentic AI框架在吞吐量、边缘性能和延迟等关键指标上表现更优。

Conclusion: 论文提出的Agentic AI框架通过结合LLM和HDM控制器，显著提升了6G RAN切片在吞吐量、边缘性能和延迟方面的表现。

Abstract: Radio Access Network (RAN) slicing enables multiple logical networks to exist on top of the same physical infrastructure by allocating resources to distinct service groups, where radio resource scheduling plays a key role in ensuring compliance with slice-specific Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). Existing configuration-based or intent-driven Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches usually rely on static mappings and SLA conversions. The current literature does not integrate natural language understanding with coordinated decision-making. To address these limitations, we propose an Agentic AI framework for 6G RAN slicing, driven by a super agent built using Hierarchical Decision Mamba (HDM) controllers and a Large Language Model (LLM). The super agent interprets operator intents and translates them into actionable goals using the LLM, which are used by HDM to coordinate inter-slice, intra-slice, and self-healing agents. Compared to transformer-based and reward-driven baselines, the proposed Agentic AI framework demonstrates consistent improvements across key performance indicators, including higher throughput, improved cell-edge performance, and reduced latency across different slices.

Motivation: 在灾害影响区域，无人机（UAV）和无人地面车辆（UGV）的联合部署是建立通信的有效方法，但需在保证服务质量（QoS）的同时尽量减少无人机使用，这需要优化其定位和轨迹规划。

Conclusion: 论文提出的Meta-A3C方法在无人机和无人地面车辆联合部署中显著提升了通信质量，相比A3C和DDPG方法，吞吐量提高了13.1%，执行速度加快了49%，同时满足了QoS需求。

Abstract: Joint deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) has been shown to be an effective method to establish communications in areas affected by disasters. However, ensuring good Quality of Services (QoS) while using as few UAVs as possible also requires optimal positioning and trajectory planning for UAVs and UGVs. This paper proposes a joint UAV-UGV-based positioning and trajectory planning framework for UAVs and UGVs deployment that guarantees optimal QoS for ground users. To model the UGVs' mobility, we introduce a road graph, which directs their movement along valid road segments and adheres to the road network constraints. To solve the sum rate optimization problem, we reformulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a novel asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) incorporated with meta-learning for rapid adaptation to new environments and dynamic conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed Meta-A3C approach outperforms A3C and DDPG, delivering 13.1\% higher throughput and 49\% faster execution while meeting the QoS requirements.

Conclusion: VL-LN基准测试和提出的导航模型在对话驱动的导航任务中表现出显著改进，验证了其有效性和可靠性。

Abstract: In most existing embodied navigation tasks, instructions are well-defined and unambiguous, such as instruction following and object searching. Under this idealized setting, agents are required solely to produce effective navigation outputs conditioned on vision and language inputs. However, real-world navigation instructions are often vague and ambiguous, requiring the agent to resolve uncertainty and infer user intent through active dialog. To address this gap, we propose Interactive Instance Object Navigation (IION), a task that requires agents not only to generate navigation actions but also to produce language outputs via active dialog, thereby aligning more closely with practical settings. IION extends Instance Object Navigation (ION) by allowing agents to freely consult an oracle in natural language while navigating. Building on this task, we present the Vision Language-Language Navigation (VL-LN) benchmark, which provides a large-scale, automatically generated dataset and a comprehensive evaluation protocol for training and assessing dialog-enabled navigation models. VL-LN comprises over 41k long-horizon dialog-augmented trajectories for training and an automatic evaluation protocol with an oracle capable of responding to agent queries. Using this benchmark, we train a navigation model equipped with dialog capabilities and show that it achieves significant improvements over the baselines. Extensive experiments and analyses further demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of VL-LN for advancing research on dialog-enabled embodied navigation.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models can enable broad open world generalization, but require large and diverse datasets. It is appealing to consider whether some of this data can come from human videos, which cover diverse real-world situations and are easy to obtain. However, it is difficult to train VLAs with human videos alone, and establishing a mapping between humans and robots requires manual engineering and presents a major research challenge. Drawing inspiration from advances in large language models, where the ability to learn from diverse supervision emerges with scale, we ask whether a similar phenomenon holds for VLAs that incorporate human video data. We introduce a simple co-training recipe, and find that human-to-robot transfer emerges once the VLA is pre-trained on sufficient scenes, tasks, and embodiments. Our analysis suggests that this emergent capability arises because diverse pretraining produces embodiment-agnostic representations for human and robot data. We validate these findings through a series of experiments probing human to robot skill transfer and find that with sufficiently diverse robot pre-training our method can nearly double the performance on generalization settings seen only in human data.

Abstract: In collective motion, perceptually-limited individuals move in an ordered manner, without centralized control. The perception of each individual is highly localized, as is its ability to interact with others. While natural collective motion is robust, most artificial swarms are brittle. This particularly occurs when vision is used as the sensing modality, due to ambiguities and information-loss inherent in visual perception. This paper presents mechanisms for robust collective motion inspired by studies of locusts. First, we develop a robust distance estimation method that combines visually perceived horizontal and vertical sizes of neighbors. Second, we introduce intermittent locomotion as a mechanism that allows robots to reliably detect peers that fail to keep up, and disrupt the motion of the swarm. We show how such faulty robots can be avoided in a manner that is robust to errors in classifying them as faulty. Through extensive physics-based simulation experiments, we show dramatic improvements to swarm resilience when using these techniques. We show these are relevant to both distance-based Avoid-Attract models, as well as to models relying on Alignment, in a wide range of experiment settings.

Abstract: Ball-end milling path planning on multiply connected freeform surfaces is pivotal for high-quality and efficient machining of components in automotive and aerospace manufacturing. Although scalar-field-based optimization provides a unified framework for multi-objective toolpath generation, maintaining boundary conformity while eliminating zero-gradient singularities that cause iso-curve branching or termination and disrupt toolpath continuity remains challenging on multiply connected surfaces. We propose an efficient strategy to robustly enforce these constraints throughout optimization. Conformal slit mapping is employed to construct a feasible, singularity-free initial scalar field. The optimization is reformulated as a topology-preserving mesh deformation governed by boundary-synchronous updates, enabling globally optimized spacing, scallop-height uniformity, and smooth trajectory transitions. Consequently, the toolpaths are continuous, boundary-conforming, and free of self-intersections. Milling experiments demonstrate that, compared with a state-of-the-art conformal slit mapping-based method, the proposed approach increases machining efficiency by 14.24%, improves scallop-height uniformity by 5.70%, and reduces milling impact-induced vibrations by over 10%. The strategy offers broad applicability in high-performance machining scenarios.

Abstract: Geometric mechanics models of locomotion have provided insight into how robots and animals use environmental interactions to convert internal shape changes into displacement through the world, encoding this relationship in a ``motility map''. A key class of such motility maps arises from (possibly anisotropic) linear drag acting on the system's individual body parts, formally described via Riemannian metrics on the motions of the system's individual body parts. The motility map can then be generated by invoking a sub-Riemannian constraint on the aggregate system motion under which the position velocity induced by a given shape velocity is that which minimizes the power dissipated via friction. The locomotion of such systems is ``geometric'' in the sense that the final position reached by the system depends only on the sequence of shapes that the system passes through, but not on the rate with which the shape changes are made.
  In this paper, we consider a far more general class of systems in which the drag may be not only anisotropic (with different coefficients for forward/backward and left/right motions), but also asymmetric (with different coefficients for forward and backward motions). Formally, including asymmetry in the friction replaces the Riemannian metrics on the body parts with Finsler metrics. We demonstrate that the sub-Riemannian approach to constructing the system motility map extends naturally to a sub-Finslerian approach and identify system properties analogous to the constraint curvature of sub-Riemannian systems that allow for the characterization of the system motion capabilities.

Conclusion: 将感知作为显式的、以对象为中心的组件是增强和泛化基于VLA的机器人操作的有效方法。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made impressive progress toward general-purpose robotic manipulation by post-training large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for action prediction. Yet most VLAs entangle perception and control in a monolithic pipeline optimized purely for action, which can erode language-conditioned grounding. In our real-world tabletop tests, policies over-grasp when the target is absent, are distracted by clutter, and overfit to background appearance.
  To address these issues, we propose OBEYED-VLA (OBject-centric and gEometrY groundED VLA), a framework that explicitly disentangles perceptual grounding from action reasoning. Instead of operating directly on raw RGB, OBEYED-VLA augments VLAs with a perception module that grounds multi-view inputs into task-conditioned, object-centric, and geometry-aware observations. This module includes a VLM-based object-centric grounding stage that selects task-relevant object regions across camera views, along with a complementary geometric grounding stage that emphasizes the 3D structure of these objects over their appearance. The resulting grounded views are then fed to a pretrained VLA policy, which we fine-tune exclusively on single-object demonstrations collected without environmental clutter or non-target objects.
  On a real-world UR10e tabletop setup, OBEYED-VLA substantially improves robustness over strong VLA baselines across four challenging regimes and multiple difficulty levels: distractor objects, absent-target rejection, background appearance changes, and cluttered manipulation of unseen objects. Ablation studies confirm that both semantic grounding and geometry-aware grounding are critical to these gains. Overall, the results indicate that making perception an explicit, object-centric component is an effective way to strengthen and generalize VLA-based robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: VLA-Arena基准测试揭示了当前视觉-语言-动作模型的多个关键局限性，包括记忆化倾向、不对称鲁棒性、忽视安全约束以及无法组合技能进行长时程任务。

Abstract: While Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) are rapidly advancing towards generalist robot policies, it remains difficult to quantitatively understand their limits and failure modes. To address this, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark called VLA-Arena. We propose a novel structured task design framework to quantify difficulty across three orthogonal axes: (1) Task Structure, (2) Language Command, and (3) Visual Observation. This allows us to systematically design tasks with fine-grained difficulty levels, enabling a precise measurement of model capability frontiers. For Task Structure, VLA-Arena's 170 tasks are grouped into four dimensions: Safety, Distractor, Extrapolation, and Long Horizon. Each task is designed with three difficulty levels (L0-L2), with fine-tuning performed exclusively on L0 to assess general capability. Orthogonal to this, language (W0-W4) and visual (V0-V4) perturbations can be applied to any task to enable a decoupled analysis of robustness. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art VLAs reveals several critical limitations, including a strong tendency toward memorization over generalization, asymmetric robustness, a lack of consideration for safety constraints, and an inability to compose learned skills for long-horizon tasks. To foster research addressing these challenges and ensure reproducibility, we provide the complete VLA-Arena framework, including an end-to-end toolchain from task definition to automated evaluation and the VLA-Arena-S/M/L datasets for fine-tuning. Our benchmark, data, models, and leaderboard are available at https://vla-arena.github.io.

Abstract: Real-time and collision-free motion planning remains challenging for robotic manipulation in unknown environments due to continuous perception updates and the need for frequent online replanning. To address these challenges, we propose a parallel mapping and motion planning framework that tightly integrates Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT)-based environment representation with a sampling-based model predictive control (SMPC) planner. On the mapping side, a dense distance-field-based representation is constructed using a GPU-based EDT and augmented with a robot-masked update mechanism to prevent false self-collision detections during online perception. On the planning side, motion generation is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem with a unified objective function and efficiently solved by evaluating large batches of candidate rollouts in parallel within a SMPC framework, in which a geometrically consistent pose tracking metric defined on SE(3) is incorporated to ensure fast and accurate convergence to the target pose. The entire mapping and planning pipeline is implemented on the GPU to support high-frequency replanning. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments on a 7-DoF robotic manipulator.

Abstract: One of the main limitations of multirotor UAVs is their short flight time due to battery constraints. A practical solution for continuous operation is to power the drone from the ground via a tether. While this approach has been demonstrated for stationary systems, scenarios with a fast-moving base vehicle or strong wind conditions require modeling the tether forces, including aerodynamic effects. In this work, we propose two complementary approaches for real-time quasi-static tether modeling with aerodynamics. The first is an analytical method based on catenary theory with a uniform drag assumption, achieving very fast solve times below 1ms. The second is a numerical method that discretizes the tether into segments and lumped masses, solving the equilibrium equations using CasADi and IPOPT. By leveraging initialization strategies, such as warm starting and analytical initialization, real-time performance was achieved with a solve time of 5ms, while allowing for flexible force formulations. Both approaches were validated in real-world tests using a load cell to measure the tether force. The results show that the analytical method provides sufficient accuracy for most tethered UAV applications with minimal computational cost, while the numerical method offers higher flexibility and physical accuracy when required. These approaches form a lightweight and extensible framework for real-time tether simulation, applicable to both offline optimization and online tasks such as simulation, control, and trajectory planning.

Abstract: In mobile robotics, coverage navigation refers to the deliberate movement of a robot with the purpose of covering a certain area or volume. Performing this task properly is fundamental for the execution of several activities, for instance, cleaning a facility with a robotic vacuum cleaner. In the mining industry, it is required to perform coverage in several unit processes related with material movement using industrial machinery, for example, in cleaning tasks, in dumps, and in the construction of tailings dam walls. The automation of these processes is fundamental to enhance the security associated with their execution. In this work, a coverage navigation system for a non-holonomic robot is presented. This work is intended to be a proof of concept for the potential automation of various unit processes that require coverage navigation like the ones mentioned before. The developed system includes the calculation of routes that allow a mobile platform to cover a specific area, and incorporates recovery behaviors in case that an unforeseen event occurs, such as the arising of dynamic or previously unmapped obstacles in the terrain to be covered, e.g., other machines or pedestrians passing through the area, being able to perform evasive maneuvers and post-recovery to ensure a complete coverage of the terrain. The system was tested in different simulated and real outdoor environments, obtaining results near 90% of coverage in the majority of experiments. The next step of development is to scale up the utilized robot to a mining machine/vehicle whose operation will be validated in a real environment. The result of one of the tests performed in the real world can be seen in the video available in https://youtu.be/gK7_3bK1P5g.

Abstract: We present an iterative active constraint learning (ACL) algorithm, within the learning from demonstrations (LfD) paradigm, which intelligently solicits informative demonstration trajectories for inferring an unknown constraint in the demonstrator's environment. Our approach iteratively trains a Gaussian process (GP) on the available demonstration dataset to represent the unknown constraints, uses the resulting GP posterior to query start/goal states, and generates informative demonstrations which are added to the dataset. Across simulation and hardware experiments using high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics and unknown nonlinear constraints, our method outperforms a baseline, random-sampling based method at accurately performing constraint inference from an iteratively generated set of sparse but informative demonstrations.

Conclusion: 本文首次完整刻画了两台自主机器人在所有主要模型（OBLOT、FSTA、FCOM、LUMI）下的计算能力，揭示了与一般情况根本不同的计算图景。

Abstract: The computational power of autonomous mobile robots under the Look-Compute-Move (LCM) model has been widely studied through an extensive hierarchy of robot models defined by the presence of memory, communication, and synchrony assumptions. While the general n-robot landscape has been largely established, the exact structure for two robots has remained unresolved. This paper presents the first complete characterization of the computational power of two autonomous robots across all major models, namely OBLOT, FSTA, FCOM, and LUMI, under the full spectrum of schedulers (FSYNCH, SSYNCH, ASYNCH, and their atomic variants). Our results reveal a landscape that fundamentally differs from the general case. Most notably, we prove that FSTA^F and LUMI^F coincide under full synchrony, a surprising collapse indicating that perfect synchrony can substitute both memory and communication when only two robots exist. We also show that FSTA and FCOM are orthogonal: there exists a problem solvable in the weakest communication model but impossible even in the strongest finite-state model, completing the bidirectional incomparability. All equivalence and separation results are derived through a novel simulation-free method, providing a unified and constructive view of the two-robot hierarchy. This yields the first complete and exact computational landscape for two robots, highlighting the intrinsic challenges of coordination at the minimal scale.

Abstract: Traditional geometric inverse kinematics methods for parallel mechanisms rely on specific spatial geometry constraints. However, their application to redundant parallel mechanisms is challenged due to the increased constraint complexity. Moreover, it will output no solutions and cause unpredictable control problems when the target pose lies outside its workspace. To tackle these challenging issues, this work proposes P-FABRIK, a general, intuitive, and robust inverse kinematics method to find one feasible solution for diverse parallel mechanisms based on the FABRIK algorithm. By decomposing the general parallel mechanism into multiple serial sub-chains using a new topological decomposition strategy, the end targets of each sub-chain can be subsequently revised to calculate the inverse kinematics solutions iteratively. Multiple case studies involving planar, standard, and redundant parallel mechanisms demonstrated the proposed method's generality across diverse parallel mechanisms. Furthermore, numerical simulation studies verified its efficacy and computational efficiency, as well as its robustness ability to handle out-of-workspace targets.

Motivation: Precise and robust motion control of aerial manipulators is challenging due to significant dynamic coupling between the multirotor base and robotic arm.

Method: The method combines variable-gain extended state observers (ESOs) for real-time dynamic coupling estimation and a prescribed performance flight control with error trajectory constraints.

Result: Experiments show high tracking performance even under rapid robotic arm motion (end-effector velocity: 1.02 m/s, acceleration: 5.10 m/s²).

Conclusion: The proposed PreGME framework effectively addresses dynamic coupling in aerial manipulators, achieving high-precision control with prescribed performance.

Abstract: An aerial manipulator, comprising a multirotor base and a robotic arm, is subject to significant dynamic coupling between these two components. Therefore, achieving precise and robust motion control is a challenging yet important objective. Here, we propose a novel prescribed performance motion control framework based on variable-gain extended state observers (ESOs), referred to as PreGME. The method includes variable-gain ESOs for real-time estimation of dynamic coupling and a prescribed performance flight control that incorporates error trajectory constraints. Compared with existing methods, the proposed approach exhibits the following two characteristics. First, the adopted variable-gain ESOs can accurately estimate rapidly varying dynamic coupling. This enables the proposed method to handle manipulation tasks that require aggressive motion of the robotic arm. Second, by prescribing the performance, a preset error trajectory is generated to guide the system evolution along this trajectory. This strategy allows the proposed method to ensure the tracking error remains within the prescribed performance envelope, thereby achieving high-precision control. Experiments on a real platform, including aerial staff twirling, aerial mixology, and aerial cart-pulling experiments, are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
  Experimental results demonstrate that even under the dynamic coupling caused by rapid robotic arm motion (end-effector velocity: 1.02 m/s, acceleration: 5.10 m/s$^2$), the proposed method achieves high tracking performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision, language, and multimodal learning have substantially accelerated progress in robotic foundation models, with robot manipulation remaining a central and challenging problem. This survey examines robot manipulation from an algorithmic perspective and organizes recent learning-based approaches within a unified abstraction of high-level planning and low-level control. At the high level, we extend the classical notion of task planning to include reasoning over language, code, motion, affordances, and 3D representations, emphasizing their role in structured and long-horizon decision making. At the low level, we propose a training-paradigm-oriented taxonomy for learning-based control, organizing existing methods along input modeling, latent representation learning, and policy learning. Finally, we identify open challenges and prospective research directions related to scalability, data efficiency, multimodal physical interaction, and safety. Together, these analyses aim to clarify the design space of modern foundation models for robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: MoVLR框架通过结合视觉语言模型（VLM）的反馈，成功地将抽象的运动描述与生理运动控制的隐式原则相结合，为高维肌肉骨骼系统的运动控制提供了有效的奖励函数发现方法。

Abstract: Discovering effective reward functions remains a fundamental challenge in motor control of high-dimensional musculoskeletal systems. While humans can describe movement goals explicitly such as "walking forward with an upright posture," the underlying control strategies that realize these goals are largely implicit, making it difficult to directly design rewards from high-level goals and natural language descriptions. We introduce Motion from Vision-Language Representation (MoVLR), a framework that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to bridge the gap between goal specification and movement control. Rather than relying on handcrafted rewards, MoVLR iteratively explores the reward space through iterative interaction between control optimization and VLM feedback, aligning control policies with physically coordinated behaviors. Our approach transforms language and vision-based assessments into structured guidance for embodied learning, enabling the discovery and refinement of reward functions for high-dimensional musculoskeletal locomotion and manipulation. These results suggest that VLMs can effectively ground abstract motion descriptions in the implicit principles governing physiological motor control.

Motivation: 高质量的视觉化是机器人研究的重要组成部分，但Blender的学习曲线陡峭且缺乏针对机器人的集成，使得研究人员难以高效使用。

Method: 介绍了一个轻量级软件库，提供三种主要功能：1) 从标准化描述（如URDF）直接导入机器人和环境；2) 基于Python的脚本工具，用于关键帧机器人状态和视觉属性；3) 方便生成原始3D形状用于示意图和动画。

Result: 通过一系列概念验证示例展示了该库的功能。

Conclusion: 论文讨论了当前库的局限性及未来扩展的机会。

Abstract: High-quality visualizations are an essential part of robotics research, enabling clear communication of results through figures, animations, and demonstration videos. While Blender is a powerful and freely available 3D graphics platform, its steep learning curve and lack of robotics-focused integrations make it difficult and time-consuming for researchers to use effectively. In this work, we introduce a lightweight software library that bridges this gap by providing simple scripting interfaces for common robotics visualization tasks. The library offers three primary capabilities: (1) importing robots and environments directly from standardized descriptions such as URDF; (2) Python-based scripting tools for keyframing robot states and visual attributes; and (3) convenient generation of primitive 3D shapes for schematic figures and animations. Together, these features allow robotics researchers to rapidly create publication-ready images, animations, and explanatory schematics without needing extensive Blender expertise. We demonstrate the library through a series of proof-of-concept examples and conclude with a discussion of current limitations and opportunities for future extensions.

As a result, downstream applications such as simulation, planning, and control must repeatedly re-derive richer data, leading to redundant computations, fragmented implementations, and limited standardization. In this work, we introduce the Universal Robot Description Directory (URDD), a modular representation that organizes derived robot information into structured, easy-to-parse JSON and YAML modules. Our open-source toolkit automatically generates URDDs from URDFs, with a Rust implementation supporting Bevy-based visualization. Additionally, we provide a JavaScript/Three.js viewer for web-based inspection of URDDs. Experiments on multiple robot platforms show that URDDs can be generated efficiently, encapsulate substantially richer information than standard specification files, and directly enable the construction of core robotics subroutines. URDD provides a unified, extensible resource for reducing redundancy and establishing shared standards across robotics frameworks. We conclude with a discussion on the limitations and implications of our work.

Conclusion: 该论文介绍了一种交互式工具，用于生成和可视化自碰撞矩阵，克服了现有工具的局限性，提高了下游机器人应用的灵活性和重用性。

Abstract: In robotics, it is common to check whether a given robot state results in self-intersection (i.e., a self-collision query) or to assess its distance from such an intersection (i.e., a self-proximity query). These checks are typically performed between pairs of shapes attached to different robot links. However, many of these shape pairs can be excluded in advance, as their configurations are known to always or never result in contact. This information is typically encoded in a self-collision matrix, where each entry (i, j) indicates whether a check should be performed between shape i and shape j. While the MoveIt Setup Assistant is widely used to generate such matrices, current tools are limited by static visualization, lack of proximity support, rigid single-geometry assumptions, and tedious refinement workflows, hindering flexibility and reuse in downstream robotics applications. In this work, we introduce an interactive tool that overcomes these limitations by generating and visualizing self-collision matrices across multiple shape representations, enabling dynamic inspection, filtering, and refinement of shape pairs. Outputs are provided in both JSON and YAML for easy integration. The system is implemented in Rust and uses the Bevy game engine to deliver high-quality visualizations. We demonstrate its effectiveness on multiple robot platforms, showing that matrices generated using diverse shape types yield faster and more accurate self-collision and self-proximity queries.

Abstract: While pole-like structures are widely recognized as stable geometric anchors for long-term robot localization, their identification reliability degrades significantly under Pole-at-Distance (Pad) observations typical of large-scale urban environments. This paper shifts the focus from descriptor design to a systematic investigation of descriptor robustness. Our primary contribution is the establishment of a specialized evaluation framework centered on the Small Pole Landmark (SPL) dataset. This dataset is constructed via an automated tracking-based association pipeline that captures multi-view, multi-distance observations of the same physical landmarks without manual annotation. Using this framework, we present a comparative analysis of Contrastive Learning (CL) and Supervised Learning (SL) paradigms. Our findings reveal that CL induces a more robust feature space for sparse geometry, achieving superior retrieval performance particularly in the 5--10m range. This work provides an empirical foundation and a scalable methodology for evaluating landmark distinctiveness in challenging real-world scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents a feasibility study, including simulations and prototype tests, on the autonomous operation of a multi-limbed intra-vehicular robot (mobile manipulator), shortly MLIVR, designed to assist astronauts with logistical tasks on the International Space Station (ISS). Astronauts spend significant time on tasks such as preparation, close-out, and the collection and transportation of goods, reducing the time available for critical mission activities. Our study explores the potential for a mobile manipulator to support these operations, emphasizing the need for autonomous functionality to minimize crew and ground operator effort while enabling real-time task execution. We focused on the robot's transportation capabilities, simulating its motion planning in 3D space. The actual motion execution was tested with a prototype on a 2D table to mimic a microgravity environment. The results demonstrate the feasibility of performing these tasks with minimal human intervention, offering a promising solution to enhance operational efficiency on the ISS.

Abstract: Lattice-based modular robot systems are envisioned for large-scale construction in extreme environments, such as space. Coupling mechanisms for heterogeneous structural modules should meet all of the following requirements: single-sided coupling and decoupling, flat surfaces when uncoupled, and coupling to passive coupling interfaces as well as coupling behavior between coupling mechanisms. The design requirements for such a coupling mechanism are complex. We propose a novel shape-matching mechanical coupling mechanism that satisfies these design requirements. This mechanism enables controlled, sequential transitions between male and female states. When uncoupled, all mechanisms are in the female state. To enable single-sided coupling, one side of the mechanisms switches to the male state during the coupling process. Single-sided decoupling is possible not only from the male side but also from the female side by forcibly switching the opposite mechanism's male state to the female state. This coupling mechanism can be applied to various modular robot systems and robot arm tool changers.

Conclusion: 通过结合未标记的手术视频和生成世界模型，该方法为自主手术技能获取提供了一条可扩展的路径，显著提升了手术VLA策略的性能。

Abstract: Data scarcity remains a fundamental barrier to achieving fully autonomous surgical robots. While large scale vision language action (VLA) models have shown impressive generalization in household and industrial manipulation by leveraging paired video action data from diverse domains, surgical robotics suffers from the paucity of datasets that include both visual observations and accurate robot kinematics. In contrast, vast corpora of surgical videos exist, but they lack corresponding action labels, preventing direct application of imitation learning or VLA training. In this work, we aim to alleviate this problem by learning policy models from SurgWorld, a world model designed for surgical physical AI. We curated the Surgical Action Text Alignment (SATA) dataset with detailed action description specifically for surgical robots. Then we built SurgeWorld based on the most advanced physical AI world model and SATA. It's able to generate diverse, generalizable and realistic surgery videos. We are also the first to use an inverse dynamics model to infer pseudokinematics from synthetic surgical videos, producing synthetic paired video action data. We demonstrate that a surgical VLA policy trained with these augmented data significantly outperforms models trained only on real demonstrations on a real surgical robot platform. Our approach offers a scalable path toward autonomous surgical skill acquisition by leveraging the abundance of unlabeled surgical video and generative world modeling, thus opening the door to generalizable and data efficient surgical robot policies.

Abstract: Human-vehicle cooperative driving serves as a vital bridge to fully autonomous driving by improving driving flexibility and gradually building driver trust and acceptance of autonomous technology. To establish more natural and effective human-vehicle interaction, we propose a Human-Oriented Cooperative Driving (HOCD) approach that primarily minimizes human-machine conflict by prioritizing driver intention and state. In implementation, we take both tactical and operational levels into account to ensure seamless human-vehicle cooperation. At the tactical level, we design an intention-aware trajectory planning method, using intention consistency cost as the core metric to evaluate the trajectory and align it with driver intention. At the operational level, we develop a control authority allocation strategy based on reinforcement learning, optimizing the policy through a designed reward function to achieve consistency between driver state and authority allocation. The results of simulation and human-in-the-loop experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach not only aligns with driver intention in trajectory planning but also ensures a reasonable authority allocation. Compared to other cooperative driving approaches, the proposed HOCD approach significantly enhances driving performance and mitigates human-machine conflict.The code is available at https://github.com/i-Qin/HOCD.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have revolutionized inspection tasks by offering a safer, more efficient, and flexible alternative to traditional methods. However, battery limitations often constrain their effectiveness, necessitating the development of optimized flight paths and data collection techniques. While existing approaches like coverage path planning (CPP) ensure comprehensive data collection, they can be inefficient, especially when inspecting multiple non connected Regions of Interest (ROIs). This paper introduces the Fast Inspection of Scattered Regions (FISR) problem and proposes a novel solution, the multi UAV Disjoint Areas Inspection (mUDAI) method. The introduced approach implements a two fold optimization procedure, for calculating the best image capturing positions and the most efficient UAV trajectories, balancing data resolution and operational time, minimizing redundant data collection and resource consumption. The mUDAI method is designed to enable rapid, efficient inspections of scattered ROIs, making it ideal for applications such as security infrastructure assessments, agricultural inspections, and emergency site evaluations. A combination of simulated evaluations and real world deployments is used to validate and quantify the method's ability to improve operational efficiency while preserving high quality data capture, demonstrating its effectiveness in real world operations. An open source Python implementation of the mUDAI method can be found on GitHub (https://github.com/soc12/mUDAI) and the collected and processed data from the real world experiments are all hosted on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/13866483). Finally, this online platform (https://sites.google.com/view/mudai-platform/) allows interested readers to interact with the mUDAI method and generate their own multi UAV FISR missions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络的不可解释性与新兴的负责任AI法规对透明度和安全性的要求相矛盾，因此需要开发可解释的AI技术来指导IK系统的设计和部署。

Method: 在原始IKNet基础上，训练了两个轻量级变体——带有残差连接的Improved IKNet和位置-方向解耦的Focused IKNet，并使用SHAP和InterpretML工具包进行全局和局部重要性排名及可视化。

Result: 定性热图显示，在姿态维度上均匀分布重要性的架构倾向于在不影响位置精度的情况下保持更宽的安全裕度。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种以可解释性为中心的工作流程，结合Shapley值归因和基于物理的避障评估，为ROBOTIS OpenManipulator-X提供了可信赖的数据驱动操纵方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have accelerated inverse-kinematics (IK) inference to the point where low cost manipulators can execute complex trajectories in real time, yet the opaque nature of these models contradicts the transparency and safety requirements emerging in responsible AI regulation. This study proposes an explainability centered workflow that integrates Shapley-value attribution with physics-based obstacle avoidance evaluation for the ROBOTIS OpenManipulator-X. Building upon the original IKNet, two lightweight variants-Improved IKNet with residual connections and Focused IKNet with position-orientation decoupling are trained on a large, synthetically generated pose-joint dataset. SHAP is employed to derive both global and local importance rankings, while the InterpretML toolkit visualizes partial-dependence patterns that expose non-linear couplings between Cartesian poses and joint angles. To bridge algorithmic insight and robotic safety, each network is embedded in a simulator that subjects the arm to randomized single and multi-obstacle scenes; forward kinematics, capsule-based collision checks, and trajectory metrics quantify the relationship between attribution balance and physical clearance. Qualitative heat maps reveal that architectures distributing importance more evenly across pose dimensions tend to maintain wider safety margins without compromising positional accuracy. The combined analysis demonstrates that explainable AI(XAI) techniques can illuminate hidden failure modes, guide architectural refinements, and inform obstacle aware deployment strategies for learning based IK. The proposed methodology thus contributes a concrete path toward trustworthy, data-driven manipulation that aligns with emerging responsible-AI standards.

Abstract: Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (vSLAM) systems encounter substantial challenges in dynamic environments where moving objects compromise tracking accuracy and map consistency. This paper introduces PCR-ORB (Point Cloud Refinement ORB), an enhanced ORB-SLAM3 framework that integrates deep learning-based point cloud refinement to mitigate dynamic object interference. Our approach employs YOLOv8 for semantic segmentation combined with CUDA-accelerated processing to achieve real-time performance. The system implements a multi-stage filtering strategy encompassing ground plane estimation, sky region removal, edge filtering, and temporal consistency validation. Comprehensive evaluation on the KITTI dataset (sequences 00-09) demonstrates performance characteristics across different environmental conditions and scene types. Notable improvements are observed in specific sequences, with sequence 04 achieving 25.9% improvement in ATE RMSE and 30.4% improvement in ATE median. However, results show mixed performance across sequences, indicating scenario-dependent effectiveness. The implementation provides insights into dynamic object filtering challenges and opportunities for robust navigation in complex environments.

Abstract: In collective systems, the available agents are a limited resource that must be allocated among tasks to maximize collective performance. Computing the optimal allocation of several agents to numerous tasks through a brute-force approach can be infeasible, especially when each task's performance scales differently with the increase of agents. For example, difficult tasks may require more agents to achieve similar performances compared to simpler tasks, but performance may saturate nonlinearly as the number of allocated agents increases. We propose a computationally efficient algorithm, based on marginal performance gains, for optimally allocating agents to tasks with concave scalability functions, including linear, saturating, and retrograde scaling, to achieve maximum collective performance. We test the algorithm by allocating a simulated robot swarm among collective decision-making tasks, where embodied agents sample their environment and exchange information to reach a consensus on spatially distributed environmental features. We vary task difficulties by different geometrical arrangements of environmental features in space (patchiness). In this scenario, decision performance in each task scales either as a saturating curve (following the Condorcet's Jury Theorem in an interference-free setup) or as a retrograde curve (when physical interference among robots restricts their movement). Using simple robot simulations, we show that our algorithm can be useful in allocating robots among tasks. Our approach aims to advance the deployment of future real-world multi-robot systems.

Conclusion: 将ToM（心智理论）视为XAI（可解释人工智能）的一种形式，并通过VXAI框架评估，可以填补HRI（人机交互）中ToM应用的空白，提升机器人解释与其内部推理的一致性。

Abstract: Within the context of human-robot interaction (HRI), Theory of Mind (ToM) is intended to serve as a user-friendly backend to the interface of robotic systems, enabling robots to infer and respond to human mental states. When integrated into robots, ToM allows them to adapt their internal models to users' behaviors, enhancing the interpretability and predictability of their actions. Similarly, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to make AI systems transparent and interpretable, allowing humans to understand and interact with them effectively. Since ToM in HRI serves related purposes, we propose to consider ToM as a form of XAI and evaluate it through the eValuation XAI (VXAI) framework and its seven desiderata. This paper identifies a critical gap in the application of ToM within HRI, as existing methods rarely assess the extent to which explanations correspond to the robot's actual internal reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose to integrate ToM within XAI frameworks. By embedding ToM principles inside XAI, we argue for a shift in perspective, as current XAI research focuses predominantly on the AI system itself and often lacks user-centered explanations. Incorporating ToM would enable a change in focus, prioritizing the user's informational needs and perspective.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个控制框架，旨在简化电动重型移动机械（HDMMs）的控制设计，并通过模块化和分层控制策略部分整合AI，同时确保安全性能。

Abstract: Today's heavy-duty mobile machines (HDMMs) face two transitions: from diesel-hydraulic actuation to clean electric systems driven by climate goals, and from human supervision toward greater autonomy. Diesel-hydraulic systems have long dominated, so full electrification, via direct replacement or redesign, raises major technical and economic challenges. Although advanced artificial intelligence (AI) could enable higher autonomy, adoption in HDMMs is limited by strict safety requirements, and these machines still rely heavily on human supervision.
  This dissertation develops a control framework that (1) simplifies control design for electrified HDMMs through a generic modular approach that is energy-source independent and supports future modifications, and (2) defines hierarchical control policies that partially integrate AI while guaranteeing safety-defined performance and stability.
  Five research questions align with three lines of investigation: a generic robust control strategy for multi-body HDMMs with strong stability across actuation types and energy sources; control solutions that keep strict performance under uncertainty and faults while balancing robustness and responsiveness; and methods to interpret and trust black-box learning strategies so they can be integrated stably and verified against international safety standards.
  The framework is validated in three case studies spanning different actuators and conditions, covering heavy-duty mobile robots and robotic manipulators. Results appear in five peer-reviewed publications and one unpublished manuscript, advancing nonlinear control and robotics and supporting both transitions.

Conclusion: Act2Goal通过结合目标条件视觉世界模型和多尺度时间控制，显著提高了机器人长时程操作的鲁棒性和成功率，并在零样本泛化和无奖励在线适应方面表现出色。

Abstract: Specifying robotic manipulation tasks in a manner that is both expressive and precise remains a central challenge. While visual goals provide a compact and unambiguous task specification, existing goal-conditioned policies often struggle with long-horizon manipulation due to their reliance on single-step action prediction without explicit modeling of task progress. We propose Act2Goal, a general goal-conditioned manipulation policy that integrates a goal-conditioned visual world model with multi-scale temporal control. Given a current observation and a target visual goal, the world model generates a plausible sequence of intermediate visual states that captures long-horizon structure. To translate this visual plan into robust execution, we introduce Multi-Scale Temporal Hashing (MSTH), which decomposes the imagined trajectory into dense proximal frames for fine-grained closed-loop control and sparse distal frames that anchor global task consistency. The policy couples these representations with motor control through end-to-end cross-attention, enabling coherent long-horizon behavior while remaining reactive to local disturbances. Act2Goal achieves strong zero-shot generalization to novel objects, spatial layouts, and environments. We further enable reward-free online adaptation through hindsight goal relabeling with LoRA-based finetuning, allowing rapid autonomous improvement without external supervision. Real-robot experiments demonstrate that Act2Goal improves success rates from 30% to 90% on challenging out-of-distribution tasks within minutes of autonomous interaction, validating that goal-conditioned world models with multi-scale temporal control provide structured guidance necessary for robust long-horizon manipulation.

Abstract: Emerging wearable robotics demand design approaches that address not only function, but also social meaning. In response, we present Sumbrella, a soft robotic garment developed as a speculative fashion probe. We first detail the design and fabrication of the Sumbrella, including sequenced origami-inspired bistable units, fabric pneumatic actuation chambers, cable driven shape morphing mechanisms, computer vision components, and an integrated wearable system comprising a hat and bolero jacket housing power and control electronics. Through a focus group with twelve creative technologists, we then used Sumbrella as a technological probe to explore how people interpreted, interacted, and imagined future relationships with soft robotic wearables. While Sumbrella allowed our participants to engage in rich discussion around speculative futures and expressive potential, it also surfaced concerns about exploitation, surveillance, and the personal risks and societal ethics of embedding biosensing technologies in public life. We contribute to the Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) field key considerations and recommendations for designing soft robotic garments, including the potential for kinesic communication, the impact of such technologies on social dynamics, and the importance of ethical guidelines. Finally, we provide a reflection on our application of speculative design; proposing that it allows HRI researchers to not only consider functionality, but also how wearable robots influence definitions of what is considered acceptable or desirable in public settings.

Abstract: The detection of rare and hazardous driving scenarios is a critical challenge for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous systems. This research explores an unsupervised learning framework for detecting rare and extreme driving scenarios using naturalistic driving data (NDD). We leverage the recently proposed Deep Isolation Forest (DIF), an anomaly detection algorithm that combines neural network-based feature representations with Isolation Forests (IFs), to identify non-linear and complex anomalies. Data from perception modules, capturing vehicle dynamics and environmental conditions, is preprocessed into structured statistical features extracted from sliding windows. The framework incorporates t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) for dimensionality reduction and visualization, enabling better interpretability of detected anomalies. Evaluation is conducted using a proxy ground truth, combining quantitative metrics with qualitative video frame inspection. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively identifies rare and hazardous driving scenarios, providing a scalable solution for anomaly detection in autonomous driving systems. Given the study's methodology, it was unavoidable to depend on proxy ground truth and manually defined feature combinations, which do not encompass the full range of real-world driving anomalies or their nuanced contextual dependencies.

Abstract: Steer-by-Wire systems replace mechanical linkages, which provide benefits like weight reduction, design flexibility, and compatibility with autonomous driving. However, they are susceptible to high-frequency disturbances from unintentional driver torque, known as driver impedance, which can degrade steering performance. Existing approaches either rely on direct torque sensors, which are costly and impractical, or lack the temporal resolution to capture rapid, high-frequency driver-induced disturbances. We address this limitation by designing a Kalman filter-based disturbance observer that estimates high-frequency driver torque using only motor state measurements. We model the drivers passive torque as an extended state using a PT1-lag approximation and integrate it into both linear and nonlinear Steer-by-Wire system models. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and simulation of this disturbance observer with an evaluation of different Kalman filter variants. Our findings indicate that the proposed disturbance observer accurately reconstructs driver-induced disturbances with only minimal delay 14ms. We show that a nonlinear extended Kalman Filter outperforms its linear counterpart in handling frictional nonlinearities, improving estimation during transitions from static to dynamic friction. Given the study's methodology, it was unavoidable to rely on simulation-based validation rather than real-world experimentation. Further studies are needed to investigate the robustness of the observers under real-world driving conditions.

Abstract: Lengthy setup processes that require robotics expertise remain a major barrier to deploying robots for tasks involving high product variability and small batch sizes. As a result, collaborative robots, despite their advanced sensing and control capabilities, are rarely used for surface finishing in small-scale craft and manufacturing settings. To address this gap, we propose a novel robot programming approach that enables non-experts to intuitively program robots through interactive, task-focused workflows. For that, we developed a new surface segmentation algorithm that incorporates human input to identify and refine workpiece regions for processing. Throughout the programming process, users receive continuous visual feedback on the robot's learned model, enabling them to iteratively refine the segmentation result. Based on the segmented surface model, a robot trajectory is generated to cover the desired processing area. We evaluated multiple interaction designs across two comprehensive user studies to derive an optimal interface that significantly reduces user workload, improves usability and enables effective task programming even for users with limited practical experience.

Result: 研究发现，全局最优解的拓扑结构严格由底盘对称性决定。对于不规则顶点排列，解为离散孤立点；随着底盘几何接近规则性，解空间经历临界相变，最终形成K=N-5个不相连的1D拓扑分支。

Conclusion: 该论文揭示了全向N旋翼飞行器的几何设计中全局最优解的内在拓扑结构，并提出了N-5缩放定律，为任意N的优化相位预测提供了精确方法。

Abstract: The geometric design of fully-actuated and omnidirectional N-rotor aerial vehicles is conventionally formulated as a parametric optimization problem, seeking a single optimal set of N orientations within a fixed architectural family. This work departs from that paradigm to investigate the intrinsic topological structure of the optimization landscape itself. We formulate the design problem on the product manifold of Projective Lines \RP^2^N, fixing the rotor positions to the vertices of polyhedral chassis while varying their lines of action. By minimizing a coordinate-invariant Log-Volume isotropy metric, we reveal that the topology of the global optima is governed strictly by the symmetry of the chassis. For generic (irregular) vertex arrangements, the solutions appear as a discrete set of isolated points. However, as the chassis geometry approaches regularity, the solution space undergoes a critical phase transition, collapsing onto an N-dimensional Torus of the lines tangent at the vertexes to the circumscribing sphere of the chassis, and subsequently reducing to continuous 1-dimensional curves driven by Affine Phase Locking. We synthesize these observations into the N-5 Scaling Law: an empirical relationship holding for all examined regular planar polygons and Platonic solids (N <= 10), where the space of optimal configurations consists of K=N-5 disconnected 1D topological branches. We demonstrate that these locking patterns correspond to a sequence of admissible Star Polygons {N/q}, allowing for the exact prediction of optimal phases for arbitrary N. Crucially, this topology reveals a design redundancy that enables optimality-preserving morphing: the vehicle can continuously reconfigure along these branches while preserving optimal isotropic control authority.

Conclusion: RoboMirror通过将视频理解与动作生成直接结合，成功弥合了视觉理解与控制之间的鸿沟，显著提升了任务成功率和控制效率。

Abstract: Humans learn locomotion through visual observation, interpreting visual content first before imitating actions. However, state-of-the-art humanoid locomotion systems rely on either curated motion capture trajectories or sparse text commands, leaving a critical gap between visual understanding and control. Text-to-motion methods suffer from semantic sparsity and staged pipeline errors, while video-based approaches only perform mechanical pose mimicry without genuine visual understanding. We propose RoboMirror, the first retargeting-free video-to-locomotion framework embodying "understand before you imitate". Leveraging VLMs, it distills raw egocentric/third-person videos into visual motion intents, which directly condition a diffusion-based policy to generate physically plausible, semantically aligned locomotion without explicit pose reconstruction or retargeting. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of RoboMirror, it enables telepresence via egocentric videos, drastically reduces third-person control latency by 80%, and achieves a 3.7% higher task success rate than baselines. By reframing humanoid control around video understanding, we bridge the visual understanding and action gap.

Conclusion: RoboPerform成功地将机器人转变为能够对音频做出反应的响应式表演者，实现了物理合理性和音频对齐的显著成果。

Abstract: Humans intuitively move to sound, but current humanoid robots lack expressive improvisational capabilities, confined to predefined motions or sparse commands. Generating motion from audio and then retargeting it to robots relies on explicit motion reconstruction, leading to cascaded errors, high latency, and disjointed acoustic-actuation mapping. We propose RoboPerform, the first unified audio-to-locomotion framework that can directly generate music-driven dance and speech-driven co-speech gestures from audio. Guided by the core principle of "motion = content + style", the framework treats audio as implicit style signals and eliminates the need for explicit motion reconstruction. RoboPerform integrates a ResMoE teacher policy for adapting to diverse motion patterns and a diffusion-based student policy for audio style injection. This retargeting-free design ensures low latency and high fidelity. Experimental validation shows that RoboPerform achieves promising results in physical plausibility and audio alignment, successfully transforming robots into responsive performers capable of reacting to audio.

Abstract: Path planning is a fundamental component in autonomous mobile robotics, enabling a robot to navigate from its current location to a desired goal while avoiding obstacles. Among the various techniques, Artificial Potential Field (APF) methods have gained popularity due to their simplicity, real-time responsiveness, and low computational requirements. However, a major limitation of conventional APF approaches is the local minima trap problem, where the robot becomes stuck in a position with no clear direction toward the goal. This paper proposes a novel path planning technique, termed the Bulldozer, which addresses the local minima issue while preserving the inherent advantages of APF. The Bulldozer technique introduces a backfilling mechanism that systematically identifies and eliminates local minima regions by increasing their potential values, analogous to a bulldozer filling potholes in a road. Additionally, a ramp-based enhancement is incorporated to assist the robot in escaping trap areas when starting within a local minimum. The proposed technique is experimentally validated using a physical mobile robot across various maps with increasing complexity. Comparative analyses are conducted against standard APF, adaptive APF, and well-established planning algorithms such as A*, PRM, and RRT. Results demonstrate that the Bulldozer technique effectively resolves the local minima problem while achieving superior execution speed and competitive path quality. Furthermore, a kinematic tracking controller is employed to assess the smoothness and traceability of the planned paths, confirming their suitability for real-world execution.

Abstract: The primary obstacle for applying reinforcement learning (RL) to real-world robotics is the design of effective reward functions. While recently learning-based Process Reward Models (PRMs) are a promising direction, they are often hindered by two fundamental limitations: their reward models lack step-aware understanding and rely on single-view perception, leading to unreliable assessments of fine-grained manipulation progress; and their reward shaping procedures are theoretically unsound, often inducing a semantic trap that misguides policy optimization. To address these, we introduce Dopamine-Reward, a novel reward modeling method for learning a general-purpose, step-aware process reward model from multi-view inputs. At its core is our General Reward Model (GRM), trained on a vast 3,400+ hour dataset, which leverages Step-wise Reward Discretization for structural understanding and Multi-Perspective Reward Fusion to overcome perceptual limitations. Building upon Dopamine-Reward, we propose Dopamine-RL, a robust policy learning framework that employs a theoretically-sound Policy-Invariant Reward Shaping method, which enables the agent to leverage dense rewards for efficient self-improvement without altering the optimal policy, thereby fundamentally avoiding the semantic trap. Extensive experiments across diverse simulated and real-world tasks validate our approach. GRM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in reward assessment, and Dopamine-RL built on GRM significantly improves policy learning efficiency. For instance, after GRM is adapted to a new task in a one-shot manner from a single expert trajectory, the resulting reward model enables Dopamine-RL to improve the policy from near-zero to 95% success with only 150 online rollouts (approximately 1 hour of real robot interaction), while retaining strong generalization across tasks.
