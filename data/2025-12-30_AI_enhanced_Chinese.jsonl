However, ensuring good Quality of Services (QoS) while using as few UAVs as possible also requires optimal positioning and trajectory planning for UAVs and UGVs. This paper proposes a joint UAV-UGV-based positioning and trajectory planning framework for UAVs and UGVs deployment that guarantees optimal QoS for ground users. To model the UGVs' mobility, we introduce a road graph, which directs their movement along valid road segments and adheres to the road network constraints. To solve the sum rate optimization problem, we reformulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a novel asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) incorporated with meta-learning for rapid adaptation to new environments and dynamic conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed Meta-A3C approach outperforms A3C and DDPG, delivering 13.1\\% higher throughput and 49\\% faster execution while meeting the QoS requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7684Meta-A3C\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u5730\u9762\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u8054\u5408\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u707e\u5bb3\u5f71\u54cd\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\uff08UAV\uff09\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u5730\u9762\u8f66\u8f86\uff08UGV\uff09\u7684\u8054\u5408\u90e8\u7f72\u662f\u5efa\u7acb\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\uff08QoS\uff09\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5c3d\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u8fd9\u9700\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9053\u8def\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u5bfcUGV\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08MDP\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u4f18\u52bf\u6f14\u5458\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\uff08Meta-A3C\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMeta-A3C\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u6267\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eA3C\u548cDDPG\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Meta-A3C\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u5730\u9762\u8f66\u8f86\u8054\u5408\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4A3C\u548cDDPG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8613.1%\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u52a0\u5feb\u4e8649%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e86QoS\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Under this idealized setting, agents are required solely to produce effective navigation outputs conditioned on vision and language inputs. However, real-world navigation instructions are often vague and ambiguous, requiring the agent to resolve uncertainty and infer user intent through active dialog. To address this gap, we propose Interactive Instance Object Navigation (IION), a task that requires agents not only to generate navigation actions but also to produce language outputs via active dialog, thereby aligning more closely with practical settings. IION extends Instance Object Navigation (ION) by allowing agents to freely consult an oracle in natural language while navigating. Building on this task, we present the Vision Language-Language Navigation (VL-LN) benchmark, which provides a large-scale, automatically generated dataset and a comprehensive evaluation protocol for training and assessing dialog-enabled navigation models. VL-LN comprises over 41k long-horizon dialog-augmented trajectories for training and an automatic evaluation protocol with an oracle capable of responding to agent queries. Using this benchmark, we train a navigation model equipped with dialog capabilities and show that it achieves significant improvements over the baselines. Extensive experiments and analyses further demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of VL-LN for advancing research on dialog-enabled embodied navigation.

It is appealing to consider whether some of this data can come from human videos, which cover diverse real-world situations and are easy to obtain. However, it is difficult to train VLAs with human videos alone, and establishing a mapping between humans and robots requires manual engineering and presents a major research challenge. Drawing inspiration from advances in large language models, where the ability to learn from diverse supervision emerges with scale, we ask whether a similar phenomenon holds for VLAs that incorporate human video data. We introduce a simple co-training recipe, and find that human-to-robot transfer emerges once the VLA is pre-trained on sufficient scenes, tasks, and embodiments. Our analysis suggests that this emergent capability arises because diverse pretraining produces embodiment-agnostic representations for human and robot data. We validate these findings through a series of experiments probing human to robot skill transfer and find that with sufficiently diverse robot pre-training our method can nearly double the performance on generalization settings seen only in human data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6837\u5316\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0cVLA\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6d8c\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u5230\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u8f6c\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8fd1\u4e00\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u9891\u8986\u76d6\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u4f46\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u9891\u8bad\u7ec3VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4e14\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u9700\u8981\u624b\u52a8\u5de5\u7a0b\u3002\u53d7\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u591a\u6837\u5316\u76d1\u7763\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u7c7b\u4f3c\u73b0\u8c61\u662f\u5426\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4eba\u7c7b\u5230\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u80fd\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u8db3\u591f\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4ec5\u89c1\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8fd1\u4e00\u500d\u3002\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6d8c\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\u6e90\u4e8e\u591a\u6837\u5316\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8db3\u591f\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5230\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u8f6c\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u4f1a\u81ea\u7136\u6d8c\u73b0\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u3002"}}

To ensure network scalability, user-centric clustering (UCC) has emerged as a practical approach, wherein only a selected subset of preferred APs jointly serves each UE. Forming the optimal cluster of APs for each UE is a challenging task, particularly when limited fronthaul and processing capabilities of both APs and UEs are considered. This challenge is exacerbated by the need for dynamic adjustments to enhance energy efficiency while meeting quality of service (QoS) requirements, which introduces conflicting interests between these entities. In this paper, we investigate the sociality regime of UEs and their clusters of APs, characterizing their intra-team cooperation as either selfish, egalitarian, or altruistic. These sociality regimes are crucial in achieving a balance between QoS and energy efficiency per UE. We address this problem by modeling it as a many-to-many social matching game with externalities, where connections can be established based on the sociality regime of both teams. To solve this, we introduce two novel algorithms based on Deferred Acceptance (DA) and Early Acceptance (EA) matching games. Numerical results show the significant impact of the sociality regime adopted by UEs and their clusters of APs on UE's QoS satisfaction and energy efficiency, with the egalitarian regime adopted by both entities proving the best performance trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u7528\u6237\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0e\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\u96c6\u7fa4\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08DA\u548cEA\uff09\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5e73\u7b49\u4e3b\u4e49\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u5e73\u8861QoS\u4e0e\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u6709\u9650\u524d\u4f20\u548c\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7528\u6237\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0e\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\u96c6\u7fa4\u7684\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\uff08QoS\uff09\u4e0e\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u793e\u4ea4\u5339\u914d\u6e38\u620f\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63a5\u53d7\uff08DA\uff09\u548c\u65e9\u671f\u63a5\u53d7\uff08EA\uff09\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7528\u6237\u8bbe\u5907\uff08UE\uff09\u4e0e\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\uff08AP\uff09\u96c6\u7fa4\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0e\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\u96c6\u7fa4\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u81ea\u79c1\u3001\u5e73\u7b49\u4e3b\u4e49\u3001\u5229\u4ed6\uff09\u5bf9QoS\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5e73\u7b49\u4e3b\u4e49\u6a21\u5f0f\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u793e\u4ea4\u6027\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08DA\u548cEA\uff09\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\uff08QoS\uff09\u4e0e\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5e73\u7b49\u4e3b\u4e49\uff08egalitarian\uff09\u6a21\u5f0f\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002"}}

In approximately eighty percent of cases, the model reproduces the buggy input verbatim.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c0f\u578bTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4fee\u590d\u6548\u679c\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u8bed\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0d\u7b49\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5c0f\u578bTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fee\u590d\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684Java\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bed\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03CodeT5-small\u6a21\u578b\uff0860.5M\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u5728CodeXGLUE\u768452,364\u4e2aJava\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4fee\u590d\u5bf9\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528AST\u89e3\u6790\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8bed\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff08\u7ea694%\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u7684Java\u4ee3\u7801\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u672a\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u6b63\u786e\u4fee\u590d\uff08\u96f6\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914d\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u7ea680%\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u76f4\u63a5\u590d\u5236\u4e86\u6f0f\u6d1e\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5c0f\u578bTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4fee\u590dJava\u6f0f\u6d1e\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u8bed\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u4ee3\u8868\u8bed\u4e49\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Practitioners often exploit the empirical heuristic that early timesteps mainly shape motion and layout while later ones refine appearance, but this behavior has not been systematically characterized. In this work, we proxy motion encoding in video diffusion timesteps by the trade-off between appearance editing and motion preservation induced when injecting new conditions over specified timestep ranges, and characterize this proxy through a large-scale quantitative study. This protocol allows us to factor motion from appearance by quantitatively mapping how they compete along the denoising trajectory. Across diverse architectures, we consistently identify an early, motion-dominant regime and a later, appearance-dominant regime, yielding an operational motion-appearance boundary in timestep space. Building on this characterization, we simplify current one-shot motion customization paradigm by restricting training and inference to the motion-dominant regime, achieving strong motion transfer without auxiliary debiasing modules or specialized objectives. Our analysis turns a widely used heuristic into a spatiotemporal disentanglement principle, and our timestep-constrained recipe can serve as ready integration into existing motion transfer and editing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5916\u89c2\u5728\u540e\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f6c\u79fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8fd0\u52a8\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u4e2d\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u5916\u89c2\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u5165\u65b0\u6761\u4ef6\u5728\u6307\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9a\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u8fd9\u4e00\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u65e9\u671f\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e3b\u5bfc\u548c\u540e\u671f\u5916\u89c2\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8-\u5916\u89c2\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u914d\u65b9\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u4e00\u955c\u5934\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b9a\u5236\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8f85\u52a9\u53bb\u504f\u6a21\u5757\u6216\u4e13\u95e8\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

Kaminka"], "title": "Bugs with Features: Vision-Based Fault-Tolerant Collective Motion Inspired by Nature", "comment": null, "summary": "In collective motion, perceptually-limited individuals move in an ordered manner, without centralized control. The perception of each individual is highly localized, as is its ability to interact with others. While natural collective motion is robust, most artificial swarms are brittle. This particularly occurs when vision is used as the sensing modality, due to ambiguities and information-loss inherent in visual perception. This paper presents mechanisms for robust collective motion inspired by studies of locusts. First, we develop a robust distance estimation method that combines visually perceived horizontal and vertical sizes of neighbors. Second, we introduce intermittent locomotion as a mechanism that allows robots to reliably detect peers that fail to keep up, and disrupt the motion of the swarm.

This paper explores a lightweight diffusion-based generative approach, the Coordinate-Conditioned Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (CCDDPM), that leverages the signal intensity-based 6G V2X Radio Environment Map (REM) from limited historical transmitter vehicles in a specific region, to predict the REMs for a transmitter vehicle with arbitrary coordinates across the same region.

We demonstrate that the predicted REM closely matches the statistics and structure of ground-truth REM while exhibiting the improved stability and over other widely applied generative AI approaches.

Addressing this, we defines a future-oriented user sovereignty interaction paradigm, aiming to realize a fundamental shift from killing time to saving time. Specifically, we argue that decoupling memory from application logic eliminates the structural basis of data lock-in, while shifting from explicit manual instruction to implicit intent alignment resolves cognitive overload by offloading execution complexity. This paradigm is implemented via the Sovereign Digital Avatar (SoDA), which employs an orthogonal decoupling design of storage, computation, and interaction. This establishes the architectural principle of data as a persistent asset, model as a transient tool, fundamentally breaking the platform monopoly on user memory. To support the operation of this new paradigm in zero-trust environments, we design an Intent-Permission Handshake Mechanism based on A2A protocols, utilizing dual-factor (Sensitivity Coefficient and Strictness Parameter) adaptive routing to achieve active risk governance. Empirical evaluation with a high-fidelity simulation environment indicates that this paradigm reduces token consumption by approximately 27-35\\% during cross-platform service migration and complex task execution. Furthermore, in the orchestration of multi-modal complex tasks, it reduces user cognitive load by 72\\% compared to standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures, by 88\\% relative to manual workflows, while significantly boosting the Information Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).

While previous research has shown that LiDAR perception can be manipulated through object based spoofing and injection attacks, the impact of such attacks on vehicle safety controllers is still not well understood. This paper presents a systematic failure analysis of longitudinal safety controllers under object based LiDAR attacks in highway driving scenarios. The study focuses on realistic cut in and car following situations in which adversarial objects introduce persistent perception errors without directly modifying vehicle control software. A high fidelity simulation framework integrating LiDAR perception, object tracking, and closed loop vehicle control is used to evaluate how false and displaced object detections propagate through the perception planning and control pipeline. The results demonstrate that even short duration LiDAR induced object hallucinations can trigger unsafe braking, delayed responses to real hazards, and unstable control behavior. In cut in scenarios, a clear increase in unsafe deceleration events and time to collision violations is observed when compared to benign conditions, despite identical controller parameters. The analysis further shows that controller failures are more strongly influenced by the temporal consistency of spoofed objects than by spatial inaccuracies alone. These findings reveal a critical gap between perception robustness and control level safety guarantees in autonomous driving systems. By explicitly characterizing safety controller failure modes under adversarial perception, this work provides practical insights for the design of attack aware safety mechanisms and more resilient control strategies for LiDAR dependent autonomous vehicles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4eff\u771f\u5206\u6790LiDAR\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u653b\u51fb\u53ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u5236\u52a8\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u5b89\u5168\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eLiDAR\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6b3a\u9a97\u548c\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u88ab\u64cd\u7eb5\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u8f66\u8f86\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4ecd\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u7684LiDAR\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u7eb5\u5411\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u5931\u6548\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e86LiDAR\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u95ed\u73af\u8f66\u8f86\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u865a\u5047\u548c\u4f4d\u79fb\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u7684LiDAR\u8bf1\u5bfc\u76ee\u6807\u5e7b\u89c9\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u89e6\u53d1\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u5236\u52a8\u3001\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u5371\u9669\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5728\u5207\u5165\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0e\u826f\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u51cf\u901f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u548c\u78b0\u649e\u65f6\u95f4\u8fdd\u89c4\u660e\u663e\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u611f\u77e5\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u5c42\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u653b\u51fb\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u548c\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Although scalar-field-based optimization provides a unified framework for multi-objective toolpath generation, maintaining boundary conformity while eliminating zero-gradient singularities that cause iso-curve branching or termination and disrupt toolpath continuity remains challenging on multiply connected surfaces. We propose an efficient strategy to robustly enforce these constraints throughout optimization. Conformal slit mapping is employed to construct a feasible, singularity-free initial scalar field. The optimization is reformulated as a topology-preserving mesh deformation governed by boundary-synchronous updates, enabling globally optimized spacing, scallop-height uniformity, and smooth trajectory transitions. Consequently, the toolpaths are continuous, boundary-conforming, and free of self-intersections. Milling experiments demonstrate that, compared with a state-of-the-art conformal slit mapping-based method, the proposed approach increases machining efficiency by 14.24%, improves scallop-height uniformity by 5.70%, and reduces milling impact-induced vibrations by over 10%.

Recent work has shown that many Large Language Models (LLMs) comply with requests to persuade users into harmful beliefs or actions when prompted and that model persuasiveness increases with model scale. However, this prior work looked at persuasion from the threat model of $\\textit{misuse}$ (i.e., a bad actor asking an LLM to persuade). In this paper, we instead aim to answer the following question: Under what circumstances would models persuade $\\textit{without being explicitly prompted}$, which would shape how concerned we should be about such emergent persuasion risks. To achieve this, we study unprompted persuasion under two scenarios: (i) when the model is steered (through internal activation steering) along persona traits, and (ii) when the model is supervised-finetuned (SFT) to exhibit the same traits. We showed that steering towards traits, both related to persuasion and unrelated, does not reliably increase models' tendency to persuade unprompted, however, SFT does. Moreover, SFT on general persuasion datasets containing solely benign topics admits a model that has a higher propensity to persuade on controversial and harmful topics--showing that emergent harmful persuasion can arise and should be studied further.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u88ab\u63d0\u793a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e89\u8bae\u548c\u6709\u5bb3\u8bdd\u9898\u4e0a\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728\u4f55\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4f1a\u5728\u672a\u88ab\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bf4\u670d\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b64\u7c7b\u65b0\u5174\u8bf4\u670d\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5173\u6ce8\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u63a2\u8ba8\u672a\u88ab\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u884c\u4e3a\uff1a(i) \u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u90e8\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08internal activation steering\uff09\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\uff0c(ii) \u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u76f8\u540c\u7279\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u8bf4\u670d\u76f8\u5173\uff09\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u672a\u88ab\u63d0\u793a\u8bf4\u670d\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u4f46\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cSFT\u5728\u4ec5\u5305\u542b\u826f\u6027\u8bdd\u9898\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8bf4\u670d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4e89\u8bae\u548c\u6709\u5bb3\u8bdd\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u503e\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u88ab\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u793a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6709\u4e89\u8bae\u548c\u6709\u5bb3\u8bdd\u9898\u4e0a\uff0c\u8fd9\u63d0\u793a\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u79cd\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u8bf4\u670d\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

Hatton", "Yousef Salaman", "Shai Revzen"], "title": "Asymmetric Friction in Geometric Locomotion", "comment": "23 pages, 15 figures", "summary": "Geometric mechanics models of locomotion have provided insight into how robots and animals use environmental interactions to convert internal shape changes into displacement through the world, encoding this relationship in a ``motility map''. A key class of such motility maps arises from (possibly anisotropic) linear drag acting on the system's individual body parts, formally described via Riemannian metrics on the motions of the system's individual body parts. The motility map can then be generated by invoking a sub-Riemannian constraint on the aggregate system motion under which the position velocity induced by a given shape velocity is that which minimizes the power dissipated via friction. The locomotion of such systems is ``geometric'' in the sense that the final position reached by the system depends only on the sequence of shapes that the system passes through, but not on the rate with which the shape changes are made.\n  In this paper, we consider a far more general class of systems in which the drag may be not only anisotropic (with different coefficients for forward/backward and left/right motions), but also asymmetric (with different coefficients for forward and backward motions). Formally, including asymmetry in the friction replaces the Riemannian metrics on the body parts with Finsler metrics. We demonstrate that the sub-Riemannian approach to constructing the system motility map extends naturally to a sub-Finslerian approach and identify system properties analogous to the constraint curvature of sub-Riemannian systems that allow for the characterization of the system motion capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165Finsler\u5ea6\u91cf\u5904\u7406\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6469\u64e6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b50Finsler\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6469\u64e6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u51e0\u4f55\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53ca\u52a8\u7269\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5b50Finsler\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5b50Riemannian\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6469\u64e6\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5b50Finsler\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6784\u5efa\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6469\u64e6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e0e\u5b50Riemannian\u7cfb\u7edf\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165Finsler\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5c06\u51e0\u4f55\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6469\u64e6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50Finsler\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u6620\u5c04\u3002"}}

The current elderly care system faces significant challenges, including insufficient long-term care resources and poor communication between healthcare providers. To address this limitation, this study introduces a novel Starlink-assisted IOMT-based elderly healthcare model designed to improve remote patient monitoring and communication reliability. This proposal system focused on a monitoring system of key biomedical parameters such as electrocardiogram (ECG), body temperature, heart attack indicators, and a fall detection alert system. Performance is evaluated using the network simulator (NS-3) to assess its effectiveness in remote and underserved regions. Physiological data collected from patients are transmitted through a local communication hub and forwarded over a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite link to a medical center. Based on Quality of Service (QoS) technology that combines Flow Queuing (FQ) with Controlled Delay (CoDel) with Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) marking. This approach prioritizes critical health data for faster transmission while allocating lower priority to non-urgent information. This architecture is entirely wireless, allowing continuous monitoring, real-time alerts, and secure data storage for medical analysis. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed Starlink-enabled IOMT system outperforms existing solutions in terms of throughput, latency, and reliability. The findings highlight Starlink's potential as a robust and high-performance telehealth communication tool. In addition, this study provides a scalable and reproducible framework for future satellite-assisted healthcare systems that prioritize quality of service (QoS) performance and improved elderly patient care.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eStarlink\u7684IoMT\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u533b\u7597\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u536b\u661f\u94fe\u8def\u548cQoS\u6280\u672f\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8fdc\u7a0b\u76d1\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u62a4\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u957f\u671f\u62a4\u7406\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u533b\u7597\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u95f4\u6c9f\u901a\u4e0d\u7545\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u6280\u672f\u624b\u6bb5\u6539\u5584\u8fdc\u7a0b\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7NS-3\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408FQ\u3001CoDel\u548cDSCP\u6807\u8bb0\u7684QoS\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u4f20\u8f93\u5173\u952e\u5065\u5eb7\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Starlink\u8f85\u52a9IoMT\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86Starlink\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8fdc\u7a0b\u533b\u7597\u901a\u4fe1\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eStarlink\u7684IoMT\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u533b\u7597\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LEO\u536b\u661f\u94fe\u8def\u548cQoS\u6280\u672f\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8fdc\u7a0b\u533b\u7597\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u536b\u661f\u8f85\u52a9\u533b\u7597\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, LLMs sometimes generate hallucinations, i.e.,unrealistic or illogical content, which leads to incorrect SQL queries and negatively impacts downstream applications. Detecting these hallucinations is particularly challenging. Existing Text-to-SQL error detection methods, which are tailored for traditional deep learning models, face significant limitations when applied to LLMs. This is primarily due to the scarcity of ground-truth data. To address this challenge, we propose SQLHD, a novel hallucination detection method based on metamorphic testing (MT) that does not require standard answers. SQLHD splits the detection task into two sequentiial stages: schema-linking hallucination detection via eight structure-aware Metamorphic Relations (MRs) that perturb comparative words, entities, sentence structure or database schema, and logical-synthesis hallucination detection via nine logic-aware MRs that mutate prefix words, extremum expressions, comparison ranges or the entire database. In each stage the LLM is invoked separately to generate schema mappings or SQL artefacts; the follow-up outputs are cross-checked against their source counterparts through the corresponding MRs, and any violation is flagged as a hallucination without requiring ground-truth SQL.

However, existing methods face two critical limitations: (1) a lack of effective mechanisms to inject multi-view information of the object into the model, leading to poor cross-view consistency, and (2) heavy reliance on fine-grained hand mesh annotations for modeling interaction occlusions. To address these challenges, we introduce ByteLoom, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework that generates realistic HOI videos with geometrically consistent object illustration, using simplified human conditioning and 3D object inputs. We first propose an RCM-cache mechanism that leverages Relative Coordinate Maps (RCM) as a universal representation to maintain object's geometry consistency and precisely control 6-DoF object transformations in the meantime. To compensate HOI dataset scarcity and leverage existing datasets, we further design a training curriculum that enhances model capabilities in a progressive style and relaxes the demand of hand mesh. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method faithfully preserves human identity and the object's multi-view geometry, while maintaining smooth motion and object manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "ByteLoom\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eDiT\u7684HOI\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RCM-cache\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u8bad\u7ec3\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u624b\u90e8\u6807\u6ce8\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709HOI\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4fe1\u606f\u6ce8\u5165\u548c\u624b\u90e8\u7f51\u683c\u6807\u6ce8\u4f9d\u8d56\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5dee\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eDiffusion Transformer (DiT)\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408RCM-cache\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\u5e76\u5229\u75283D\u5bf9\u8c61\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cByteLoom\u80fd\u5fe0\u5b9e\u4fdd\u6301\u4eba\u7c7b\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u64cd\u63a7\u3002", "conclusion": "ByteLoom\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165RCM-cache\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86HOI\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u624b\u90e8\u7f51\u683c\u6807\u6ce8\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

Spatial reasoning is a key component of human intelligence, but most existing benchmarks focus on static images or final outputs, failing to account for the sequential and viewpoint-dependent nature of this skill. To close this gap, we introduce GamiBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial reasoning and 2D-to-3D planning in MLLMs through origami-inspired folding tasks. GamiBench includes 186 regular and 186 impossible 2D crease patterns paired with their corresponding 3D folded shapes, produced from six distinct viewpoints across three visual question-answering (VQA) tasks: predicting 3D fold configurations, distinguishing valid viewpoints, and detecting impossible patterns. Unlike previous benchmarks that assess only final predictions, GamiBench holistically evaluates the entire reasoning process--measuring cross-view consistency, physical feasibility through impossible-fold detection, and interpretation of intermediate folding steps. It further introduces new diagnostic metrics--viewpoint consistency (VC) and impossible fold selection rate (IFSR)--to measure how well models handle folds of varying complexity. Our experiments show that even leading models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro struggle on single-step spatial understanding.

It then establishes rigorous definitions and evaluation frameworks for resilience, going beyond robustness and fault-tolerance to address adaptive, anticipatory, and retrospective mechanisms across diverse application domains.\n  The core of the book delves into advanced paradigms and practical strategies for resilience, including zero trust architectures, game-theoretic threat modeling, and self-healing design principles. A significant portion is devoted to the role of artificial intelligence, especially reinforcement learning and large language models (LLMs), in enabling dynamic threat response, autonomous network control, and multi-agent coordination under uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u4e66\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u65b0\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5a01\u80c1\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4e49\u7f51\u7edc\uff08SDN\uff09\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u529f\u80fd\u865a\u62df\u5316\uff08NFV\uff09\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u65e0\u7ebf\u63a5\u5165\u7f51\u7edc\uff08O-RAN\uff09\u548c\u4e91\u539f\u751f\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\u548c\u5a01\u80c1\u8868\u9762\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f39\u6027\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u4e66\u91c7\u7528\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u516d\u7ae0\u7ed3\u6784\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u666f\u89c2\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5f39\u6027\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5305\u62ec\u96f6\u4fe1\u4efb\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u5a01\u80c1\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u81ea\u6108\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u5728\u5185\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u4e66\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5a01\u80c1\u54cd\u5e94\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u7f51\u7edc\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u4e66\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u65b0\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u4e0b\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f39\u6027\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u96f6\u4fe1\u4efb\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u5a01\u80c1\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u81ea\u6108\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5a01\u80c1\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u7f51\u7edc\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Recent efforts toward edge-cloud collaboration have attempted to mitigate this issue, but most existing methods adopt coarse-grained task allocation strategies-assigning entire queries either to the edge or the cloud. Such rigid partitioning fails to exploit fine-grained reasoning parallelism and often leads to redundant computation and inefficient resource utilization. To this end, we propose HybridFlow, a resource-adaptive inference framework that enables fast and token-efficient collaborative reasoning between edge and cloud LLMs. HybridFlow operates in two stages: (1) task decomposition and parallel execution, which dynamically splits a complex query into interdependent subtasks that can execute as soon as their dependencies are resolved; and (2) resource-aware subtask routing, where a learned router adaptively assigns each subtask to the edge or cloud model according to predicted utility gains and real-time budget states. Comprehensive evaluations on GPQA, MMLU-Pro, AIME, and LiveBench-Reasoning demonstrate that HybridFlow effectively reduces end-to-end inference time and overall token usage while maintaining competitive accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "HybridFlow\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d44\u6e90\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8fb9\u7f18-\u4e91\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684LLM\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8fb9\u7f18-\u4e91\u534f\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "HybridFlow\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u5e76\u884c\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u62c6\u5206\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u4e3a\u53ef\u5e76\u884c\u6267\u884c\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b2\uff09\u8d44\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7528\u589e\u76ca\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u9884\u7b97\u72b6\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914d\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u5230\u8fb9\u7f18\u6216\u4e91\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728GPQA\u3001MMLU-Pro\u3001AIME\u548cLiveBench-Reasoning\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cHybridFlow\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u548ctoken\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HybridFlow\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u603b\u4f53token\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

In other words, its space-requirements are asymptotically similar to those of the compressed text. In practice, block trees offer comparable query performance to state-of-the-art compressed rank and select indices. However, their construction is significantly slower. Additionally, the fastest construction algorithms require a significant amount of working memory. To address this issue, we propose fast and lightweight parallel algorithms for the efficient construction of block trees. Our algorithm achieves similar speed than the currently fastest construction algorithm on one core and is up to four times faster using 64 cores. It achieves all that while requiring an order of magnitude less memory.

With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) in reasoning and generative capabilities, LLM-based approaches have made significant progress in automated software issue resolution. However, real-world software issue resolution is inherently complex and requires long-horizon reasoning, iterative exploration, and feedback-driven decision making, which demand agentic capabilities beyond conventional single-step approaches. Recently, LLM-based agentic systems have become mainstream for software issue resolution. Advancements in agentic software issue resolution not only greatly enhance software maintenance efficiency and quality but also provide a realistic environment for validating agentic systems' reasoning, planning, and execution capabilities, bridging artificial intelligence and software engineering.\n  This work presents a systematic survey of 126 recent studies at the forefront of LLM-based agentic software issue resolution research. It outlines the general workflow of the task and establishes a taxonomy across three dimensions: benchmarks, techniques, and empirical studies.

This paper presents a fairness-aware artificial intelligence framework for prioritizing post-flood aid distribution in Bangladesh, a country highly susceptible to recurring flood disasters. Using real data from the 2022 Bangladesh floods that affected 7.2 million people and caused 405.5 million US dollars in damages, we develop an adversarial debiasing model that predicts flood vulnerability while actively removing biases against marginalized districts and rural areas. Our approach adapts fairness-aware representation learning techniques from healthcare AI to disaster management, employing a gradient reversal layer that forces the model to learn bias-invariant representations. Experimental results on 87 upazilas across 11 districts demonstrate that our framework reduces statistical parity difference by 41.6 percent, decreases regional fairness gaps by 43.2 percent, and maintains strong predictive accuracy (R-squared=0.784 vs baseline 0.811). The model generates actionable priority rankings ensuring aid reaches the most vulnerable populations based on genuine need rather than historical allocation patterns.

Project website: https://uark-aicv.github.io/OBEYED_VLA", "summary": "Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made impressive progress toward general-purpose robotic manipulation by post-training large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for action prediction. Yet most VLAs entangle perception and control in a monolithic pipeline optimized purely for action, which can erode language-conditioned grounding. In our real-world tabletop tests, policies over-grasp when the target is absent, are distracted by clutter, and overfit to background appearance.\n  To address these issues, we propose OBEYED-VLA (OBject-centric and gEometrY groundED VLA), a framework that explicitly disentangles perceptual grounding from action reasoning. Instead of operating directly on raw RGB, OBEYED-VLA augments VLAs with a perception module that grounds multi-view inputs into task-conditioned, object-centric, and geometry-aware observations. This module includes a VLM-based object-centric grounding stage that selects task-relevant object regions across camera views, along with a complementary geometric grounding stage that emphasizes the 3D structure of these objects over their appearance. The resulting grounded views are then fed to a pretrained VLA policy, which we fine-tune exclusively on single-object demonstrations collected without environmental clutter or non-target objects.\n  On a real-world UR10e tabletop setup, OBEYED-VLA substantially improves robustness over strong VLA baselines across four challenging regimes and multiple difficulty levels: distractor objects, absent-target rejection, background appearance changes, and cluttered manipulation of unseen objects. Ablation studies confirm that both semantic grounding and geometry-aware grounding are critical to these gains. Overall, the results indicate that making perception an explicit, object-centric component is an effective way to strengthen and generalize VLA-based robotic manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "OBEYED-VLA\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u8a00\u6761\u4ef6\u63a5\u5730\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5982\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6293\u53d6\u3001\u53d7\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "OBEYED-VLA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\u660e\u786e\u89e3\u8026\u611f\u77e5\u63a5\u5730\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8eVLM\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u63a5\u5730\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u63a5\u5730\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684UR10e\u684c\u9762\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0cOBEYED-VLA\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u6027\u573a\u666f\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u96be\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u611f\u77e5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u3001\u4ee5\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u662f\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u57fa\u4e8eVLA\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Contents may change at any time without notice", "summary": "Radio Access Network (RAN) slicing enables multiple logical networks to exist on top of the same physical infrastructure by allocating resources to distinct service groups, where radio resource scheduling plays a key role in ensuring compliance with slice-specific Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). Existing configuration-based or intent-driven Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches usually rely on static mappings and SLA conversions. The current literature does not integrate natural language understanding with coordinated decision-making. To address these limitations, we propose an Agentic AI framework for 6G RAN slicing, driven by a super agent built using Hierarchical Decision Mamba (HDM) controllers and a Large Language Model (LLM). The super agent interprets operator intents and translates them into actionable goals using the LLM, which are used by HDM to coordinate inter-slice, intra-slice, and self-healing agents. Compared to transformer-based and reward-driven baselines, the proposed Agentic AI framework demonstrates consistent improvements across key performance indicators, including higher throughput, improved cell-edge performance, and reduced latency across different slices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u548cHDM\u7684Agentic AI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e6G RAN\u5207\u7247\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u914d\u7f6e\u6216\u610f\u56fe\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u6620\u5c04\u548cSLA\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u534f\u8c03\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6574\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eHierarchical Decision Mamba (HDM)\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLM)\u7684\u8d85\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u534f\u8c03\u5207\u7247\u95f4\u3001\u5207\u7247\u5185\u53ca\u81ea\u6108\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cAgentic AI\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Agentic AI\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u548cHDM\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e866G RAN\u5207\u7247\u5728\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

We introduce SAMM2D, a dual-encoder framework that achieves an AUC of 0.686 on the RSNA intracranial aneurysm dataset; an improvement of 32% over the clinical baseline. In a comprehensive ablation across six augmentation regimes, we made a striking discovery: any form of data augmentation degraded performance when coupled with a strong pretrained backbone. Our unaugmented baseline model outperformed all augmented variants by 1.75--2.23 percentage points (p < 0.01), overturning the assumption that \"more augmentation is always better\" in low-data medical settings. We hypothesize that ImageNet-pretrained features already capture robust invariances, rendering additional augmentations both redundant and disruptive to the learned feature manifold. By calibrating the decision threshold, SAMM2D reaches 95% sensitivity, surpassing average radiologist performance, and translates to a projected \\$13.9M in savings per 1,000 patients in screening applications.

The framework's core contributions are: (1) it develops a novel capability-centric perspective to analyze a wide range of agentic AI systems; (2) it distills three primary sources of risk intrinsic to agentic AI systems - components, design, and capabilities; (3) it establishes a clear nexus between each risk source, specific materialized risks, and corresponding technical controls; and (4) it provides a structured and practical approach to help organizations implement the framework. This framework provides a robust and adaptable methodology for organizations to navigate the complexities of agentic AI, enabling rapid and effective innovation while ensuring the safe, secure, and responsible deployment of agentic AI systems.

To address this, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark called VLA-Arena. We propose a novel structured task design framework to quantify difficulty across three orthogonal axes: (1) Task Structure, (2) Language Command, and (3) Visual Observation. This allows us to systematically design tasks with fine-grained difficulty levels, enabling a precise measurement of model capability frontiers. For Task Structure, VLA-Arena's 170 tasks are grouped into four dimensions: Safety, Distractor, Extrapolation, and Long Horizon. Each task is designed with three difficulty levels (L0-L2), with fine-tuning performed exclusively on L0 to assess general capability. Orthogonal to this, language (W0-W4) and visual (V0-V4) perturbations can be applied to any task to enable a decoupled analysis of robustness. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art VLAs reveals several critical limitations, including a strong tendency toward memorization over generalization, asymmetric robustness, a lack of consideration for safety constraints, and an inability to compose learned skills for long-horizon tasks. To foster research addressing these challenges and ensure reproducibility, we provide the complete VLA-Arena framework, including an end-to-end toolchain from task definition to automated evaluation and the VLA-Arena-S/M/L datasets for fine-tuning.

Decentralized foundation model training across edge devices, leveraging their spare compute, promises a democratized alternative. However, existing edge-training approaches fall short: they struggle to match cloud-based training performance, exhibit limited scalability with model size, exceed device memory capacity, and have prohibitive communication overhead. They also fail to satisfactorily handle device heterogeneity and dynamism.\n  We introduce a new paradigm, Cleave, which finely partitions training operations through a novel selective hybrid tensor parallelism method. Together with a parameter server centric training framework, Cleave copes with device memory limits and avoids communication bottlenecks, thereby enabling efficient training of large models on par with the cloud. Further, with a cost optimization model to guide device selection and training workload distribution, Cleave effectively accounts for device heterogeneity and churn.\n  Our evaluations show that Cleave matches cloud-based GPU training by scaling efficiently to larger models and thousands of devices, supporting up to 8x more devices than baseline edge-training approaches. It outperforms state-of-the-art edge training methods by up to a factor of 10 in per-batch training time and efficiently handles device failures, achieving at least 100x faster recovery than prior methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Cleave \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u4e91\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u578b\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u96c6\u4e2d\u5316\u3002\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u8bad\u7ec3\u867d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6df7\u5408\u5f20\u91cf\u5e76\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0cCleave \u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bbe\u5907\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "Cleave \u5728\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u6570\u91cf\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a 8 \u500d\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u6bcf\u6279\u6b21\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb 10 \u500d\uff0c\u6545\u969c\u6062\u590d\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u5c11 100 \u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "Cleave \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e0e\u4e91\u7aef GPU \u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8bbe\u5907\u6545\u969c\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Although widely publicized as a productivity breakthrough, little is known about how practitioners actually define and engage in these practices. To shed light on this emerging phenomenon, we conducted a grounded theory study of 20 vibe-coding videos, including 7 live-streamed coding sessions (about 16 hours, 254 prompts) and 13 opinion videos (about 5 hours), supported by additional analysis of activity durations and prompt intents. Our findings reveal a spectrum of behaviors: some vibe coders rely almost entirely on AI without inspecting code, while others examine and adapt generated outputs. Across approaches, all must contend with the stochastic nature of generation, with debugging and refinement often described as \"rolling the dice.\" Further, divergent mental models, shaped by vibe coders' expertise and reliance on AI, influence prompting strategies, evaluation practices, and levels of trust.

However, traditional MIL approaches often lose crucial contextual information, while transformer-based variants, though more expressive, suffer from quadratic complexity and redundant computations. To address these limitations, we propose HookMIL, a context-aware and computationally efficient MIL framework that leverages compact, learnable hook tokens for structured contextual aggregation. These tokens can be initialized from (i) key-patch visual features, (ii) text embeddings from vision-language pathology models, and (iii) spatially grounded features from spatial transcriptomics-vision models. This multimodal initialization enables Hook Tokens to incorporate rich textual and spatial priors, accelerating convergence and enhancing representation quality. During training, Hook tokens interact with instances through bidirectional attention with linear complexity. To further promote specialization, we introduce a Hook Diversity Loss that encourages each token to focus on distinct histopathological patterns. Additionally, a hook-to-hook communication mechanism refines contextual interactions while minimizing redundancy. Extensive experiments on four public pathology datasets demonstrate that HookMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improved computational efficiency and interpretability.

We test this assumption through an interactive web experiment where participants classify 20 images as real or AI-generated. Our dataset contains 120 difficult cases: real images sampled from CC12M, and carefully curated AI-generated counterparts produced with MidJourney. In total, 165 users completed 233 sessions. Their average accuracy was 54%, only slightly above random guessing, with limited improvement across repeated attempts. Response times averaged 7.3 seconds, and some images were consistently more deceptive than others.

To address these challenges, we propose a parallel mapping and motion planning framework that tightly integrates Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT)-based environment representation with a sampling-based model predictive control (SMPC) planner. On the mapping side, a dense distance-field-based representation is constructed using a GPU-based EDT and augmented with a robot-masked update mechanism to prevent false self-collision detections during online perception. On the planning side, motion generation is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem with a unified objective function and efficiently solved by evaluating large batches of candidate rollouts in parallel within a SMPC framework, in which a geometrically consistent pose tracking metric defined on SE(3) is incorporated to ensure fast and accurate convergence to the target pose. The entire mapping and planning pipeline is implemented on the GPU to support high-frequency replanning. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments on a 7-DoF robotic manipulator.

It has the potential to facilitate real-time network management and optimization functions, including self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-adaptation across diverse and complex environments. This paper proposes SANet, a novel semantic-aware AgentNet architecture for wireless networks that can infer the semantic goal of the user and automatically assign agents associated with different layers of the network to fulfill the inferred goal. Motivated by the fact that AgentNet is a decentralized framework in which collaborating agents may generally have different and even conflicting objectives, we formulate the decentralized optimization of SANet as a multi-agent multi-objective problem, and focus on finding the Pareto-optimal solution for agents with distinct and potentially conflicting objectives. We propose three novel metrics for evaluating SANet. Furthermore, we develop a model partition and sharing (MoPS) framework in which large models, e.g., deep learning models, of different agents can be partitioned into shared and agent-specific parts that are jointly constructed and deployed according to agents' local computational resources. Two decentralized optimization algorithms are proposed. We derive theoretical bounds and prove that there exists a three-way tradeoff among optimization, generalization, and conflicting errors. We develop an open-source RAN and core network-based hardware prototype that implements agents to interact with three different layers of the network. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieved performance gains of up to 14.61% while requiring only 44.37% of FLOPs required by state-of-the-art algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "SANet\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684AgentNet\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7MoPS\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\u4e14\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "AgentNet\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u95f4\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u9700\u5bfb\u627e\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SANet\u67b6\u6784\u3001MoPS\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u5206\u6563\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u539f\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe14.61%\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u4ec5\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u768444.37%\u3002", "conclusion": "SANet\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684AgentNet\u67b6\u6784\u548cMoPS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Large language model methods often assume kernels can be compiled and executed cheaply, which fails in large applications where full builds and runs are expensive. We present an end-to-end LLM framework with performance feedback that optimizes kernels without building the full application. From independently extracted hotspot kernels, it automatically completes code into a Minimal Executable Program (MEP), then performs multi-round iterative optimization and evaluation outside the full application. The framework integrates Automatic Error Repair and Performance Pattern Inheritance to fix faults, preserve correctness, reuse effective tiling/memory/synchronization strategies, and reduce search cost. Optimized variants are reintegrated into the original application for validation. We evaluate on NVIDIA GPUs and the Haiguang Deep Computing Unit (DCU) platform (AMD-licensed architecture) using PolyBench, the AMD APP SDK, and hotspot kernels from large-scale supercomputing applications. The method achieves average speedups of 5.05x (PolyBench on NVIDIA), 7.77x (PolyBench on DCU), 1.77x (AMD APP SDK), and 1.25x on three hotspot kernels, surpassing direct LLM optimization.

This task is fundamental yet challenging in automated software engineering due to the semantic gap between issue description and source code implementation. This gap manifests as two mismatches:(1) symptom-to-cause mismatches, where descriptions do not explicitly reveal underlying root causes; (2) one-to-many mismatches, where a single issue corresponds to multiple interdependent code entities. To address these two mismatches, we propose GraphLocator, an approach that mitigates symptom-to-cause mismatches through causal structure discovering and resolves one-to-many mismatches via dynamic issue disentangling. The key artifact is the causal issue graph (CIG), in which vertices represent discovered sub-issues along with their associated code entities, and edges encode the causal dependencies between them. The workflow of GraphLocator consists of two phases: symptom vertices locating and dynamic CIG discovering; it first identifies symptom locations on the repository graph, then dynamically expands the CIG by iteratively reasoning over neighboring vertices. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of GraphLocator: (1) Compared with baselines, GraphLocator achieves more accurate localization with average improvements of +19.49% in function-level recall and +11.89% in precision. (2) GraphLocator outperforms baselines on both symptom-to-cause and one-to-many mismatch scenarios, achieving recall improvement of +16.44% and +19.18%, precision improvement of +7.78% and +13.23%, respectively.

TinySAM is a lightweight, distilled SAM variant that preserves strong zero-shot mask quality, yet its \"segment-everything\" mode still requires hundreds of prompts and remains slow in practice. We first replicate TinySAM on COCO val2017 using official checkpoints, matching the reported AP within 0.03%, establishing a reliable experimental baseline. Building on this, we propose Tiny-YOLOSAM, a fast hybrid pipeline that uses a recent YOLO detector (YOLOv12) to generate box prompts for TinySAM on salient foreground objects, and supplements uncovered regions with sparse point prompts sampled only where YOLO-guided masks provide no coverage. On COCO val2017, the hybrid system substantially improves class-agnostic coverage (AR from 16.4% to 77.1%, mIoU from 19.2% to 67.8%) while reducing end-to-end runtime from 49.20s/image to 10.39s/image (4.7x) on an Apple M1 Pro CPU.

Our experiments show this approach can yield better performance on reasoning tasks than training on human-annotated datasets. We hypothesize that two key factors explain this phenomenon: first, the distribution of synthetic data is inherently closer to the language model's own distribution, making it more amenable to learning. Second, these `incorrect' traces are often only partially flawed and contain valid reasoning steps from which the model can learn. To further test the first hypothesis, we use a language model to paraphrase human-annotated traces -- shifting their distribution closer to the model's own distribution -- and show that this improves performance. For the second hypothesis, we introduce increasingly flawed CoT traces and study to what extent models are tolerant to these flaws. We demonstrate our findings across various reasoning domains like math, algorithmic reasoning and code generation using MATH, GSM8K, Countdown and MBPP datasets on various language models ranging from 1.5B to 9B across Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models.

A practical solution for continuous operation is to power the drone from the ground via a tether. While this approach has been demonstrated for stationary systems, scenarios with a fast-moving base vehicle or strong wind conditions require modeling the tether forces, including aerodynamic effects. In this work, we propose two complementary approaches for real-time quasi-static tether modeling with aerodynamics. The first is an analytical method based on catenary theory with a uniform drag assumption, achieving very fast solve times below 1ms. The second is a numerical method that discretizes the tether into segments and lumped masses, solving the equilibrium equations using CasADi and IPOPT. By leveraging initialization strategies, such as warm starting and analytical initialization, real-time performance was achieved with a solve time of 5ms, while allowing for flexible force formulations. Both approaches were validated in real-world tests using a load cell to measure the tether force. The results show that the analytical method provides sufficient accuracy for most tethered UAV applications with minimal computational cost, while the numerical method offers higher flexibility and physical accuracy when required. These approaches form a lightweight and extensible framework for real-time tether simulation, applicable to both offline optimization and online tasks such as simulation, control, and trajectory planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u5b9e\u65f6\u7cfb\u7ef3\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u89e3\u6790\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\uff09\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u6301\u7eed\u4f9b\u7535\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u65cb\u7ffc\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u56e0\u7535\u6c60\u9650\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u77ed\u98de\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5730\u9762\u4f9b\u7535\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u79fb\u52a8\u57fa\u5ea7\u6216\u5f3a\u98ce\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5efa\u6a21\u7cfb\u7ef3\u529b\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u7a7a\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6548\u5e94\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u60ac\u94fe\u7ebf\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5747\u5300\u963b\u529b\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6c42\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\u4f4e\u4e8e1ms\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u79cd\u662f\u5c06\u7cfb\u7ef3\u79bb\u6563\u4e3a\u5206\u6bb5\u548c\u96c6\u4e2d\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528CasADi\u548cIPOPT\u6c42\u89e3\u5e73\u8861\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b05ms\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u89e3\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u8db3\u591f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5219\u5728\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5b9e\u65f6\u51c6\u9759\u6001\u7cfb\u7ef3\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u9700\u6c42\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7ef3\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Existing RDMA transports, such as RoCE, IRN, SRNIC, and Falcon, enforce strict reliability and in-order delivery, relying on retransmissions and packet sequencing to ensure correctness. While these approaches work well for general-purpose workloads, they introduce complexity and latency that scale poorly in ML, where even rare packet delays can stall entire model pipelines.\n  We present OptiNIC, a domain-specific RDMA transport that revisits traditional reliability guarantees based on ML's tolerance for partial or missing data. OptiNIC eliminates retransmissions and in-order delivery from the NIC, enabling a best-effort, out-of-order transport model for RDMA. Unlike traditional RDMA, which signals completion only after complete data delivery, OptiNIC introduces adaptive timeouts to trigger forward progress when data may be lost or delayed. OptiNIC retains standard congestion control mechanisms (e.g., DCQCN, EQDS, or Swift) while shifting loss recovery to the ML pipeline itself (e.g., via the Hadamard Transform and Erasure Coding).\n  Our evaluation shows that OptiNIC improves time-to-accuracy (TTA) by 2x and increases throughput by 1.6x for training and inference, respectively, across two public clouds (i.e., Hyperstack and CloudLab).

Our approach dynamically allocates GPU resources based on workload characteristics, agent priorities, and minimum resource requirements, enabling efficient utilization while maintaining quality of service. The framework addresses three key challenges: (1) heterogeneous computational demands across lightweight coordinators and heavyweight specialists, (2) dynamic workload fluctuations requiring millisecond-scale reallocation, and (3) capacity constraints in serverless environments. Through comprehensive simulations modeling realistic multi-agent workflows with four heterogeneous agents, we demonstrate that adaptive allocation outperforms static equal and round-robin strategies across latency, cost, and GPU utilization metrics.

However, localizing these faults to specific source files remains highly challenging due to the complexity and scale of modern compiler infrastructures. In this study, we propose MultiConf, a novel approach that automatically isolates compiler faults by constructing multiple pairs of adversarial compilation configurations. Each adversarial compilation configuration pair consists of a failing configuration and its corresponding passing configuration, which differ in only a small number of fine-grained options. MultiConf generates failing configurations through a lightweight construction process and derives the corresponding passing configurations by selectively disabling bug-related fine-grained options. We then employ a Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) formula to rank the suspiciousness of compiler source files. Each adversarial configuration pair independently produces a ranking, which is subsequently aggregated using a weighted voting scheme to derive a final suspiciousness ranking, enabling more accurate and robust fault localization. We evaluate MultiConf on a benchmark of 60 real-world GCC compiler bugs. The results demonstrate that MultiConf significantly outperforms existing compiler fault localization techniques in both effectiveness and efficiency. In particular, MultiConf successfully localizes 27 out of 60 bugs at the Top-1 file level, representing improvements of 35.0% and 28.6% over the two state-of-the-art approaches, Odfl(20) and Basic(21), respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "MultiConf is a novel method for compiler fault localization using adversarial configuration pairs and SBFL, outperforming existing techniques on GCC bugs.", "motivation": "Identifying and resolving compiler faults is essential but challenging due to the complexity and scale of modern compiler infrastructures.", "method": "MultiConf constructs adversarial compilation configuration pairs (failing and passing) by selectively disabling bug-related fine-grained options, then uses SBFL and weighted voting for fault localization.", "result": "MultiConf localizes 27 out of 60 GCC bugs at Top-1, outperforming Odfl(20) and Basic(21) by 35.0% and 28.6%, respectively.", "conclusion": "MultiConf significantly outperforms existing compiler fault localization techniques, successfully localizing 27 out of 60 GCC bugs at the Top-1 file level, with improvements of 35.0% and 28.6% over state-of-the-art approaches."}}

Limited access to physicians often leaves DR undiagnosed. To address this, AI models utilize lesion segmentation for interpretability; however, manually annotating lesions is impractical for clinicians. Physicians require a model that explains the reasoning for classifications rather than just highlighting lesion locations. Furthermore, current models are one-dimensional, relying on a single imaging modality for explainability and achieving limited effectiveness. In contrast, a quantitative-detection system that identifies individual DR lesions in natural language would overcome these limitations, enabling diverse applications in screening, treatment, and research settings. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel multimodal explainability model utilizing a VLM with few-shot learning, which mimics an ophthalmologist's reasoning by analyzing lesion distributions within retinal quadrants for fundus images. The model generates paired Grad-CAM heatmaps, showcasing individual neuron weights across both OCT and fundus images, which visually highlight the regions contributing to DR severity classification.

Performing this task properly is fundamental for the execution of several activities, for instance, cleaning a facility with a robotic vacuum cleaner. In the mining industry, it is required to perform coverage in several unit processes related with material movement using industrial machinery, for example, in cleaning tasks, in dumps, and in the construction of tailings dam walls. The automation of these processes is fundamental to enhance the security associated with their execution. In this work, a coverage navigation system for a non-holonomic robot is presented. This work is intended to be a proof of concept for the potential automation of various unit processes that require coverage navigation like the ones mentioned before. The developed system includes the calculation of routes that allow a mobile platform to cover a specific area, and incorporates recovery behaviors in case that an unforeseen event occurs, such as the arising of dynamic or previously unmapped obstacles in the terrain to be covered, e.g., other machines or pedestrians passing through the area, being able to perform evasive maneuvers and post-recovery to ensure a complete coverage of the terrain. The system was tested in different simulated and real outdoor environments, obtaining results near 90% of coverage in the majority of experiments. The next step of development is to scale up the utilized robot to a mining machine/vehicle whose operation will be validated in a real environment.

Includes appendices", "summary": "Consistent hashing is fundamental to distributed systems, but ring-based schemes can exhibit high peak-to-average load ratios unless they use many virtual nodes, while multi-probe methods improve balance at the cost of scattered memory accesses. This paper introduces Local Rendezvous Hashing (LRH), which preserves a token ring but restricts Highest Random Weight (HRW) selection to a cache-local window of C distinct neighboring physical nodes. LRH locates a key by one binary search, enumerates exactly C distinct candidates using precomputed next-distinct offsets, and chooses the HRW winner (optionally weighted). Lookup cost is O(log|R| + C). Under fixed-topology liveness changes, fixed-candidate filtering remaps only keys whose original winner is down, yielding zero excess churn. In a benchmark with N=5000, V=256 (|R|=1.28M), K=50M and C=8, LRH reduces Max/Avg load from 1.2785 to 1.0947 and achieves 60.05 Mkeys/s, about 6.8x faster than multi-probe consistent hashing with 8 probes (8.80 Mkeys/s) while approaching its balance (Max/Avg 1.0697).

They do so by organizing computation around explicit, compiler-managed data movement over the on-chip network, allowing operands to be directly forwarded between processing elements and reducing reliance on high-latency, bandwidth-limited global shared memory. Such localized communications can provide higher throughput and efficiency compared to repeated off-chip memory accesses. However, their end-to-end performance depends strongly on how workloads are mapped to the hardware. Naive mappings can perform very poorly, and most users rely on hand-tuned vendor libraries. In practice, although existing spatial-dataflow accelerators have strong potential for high performance, energy- and cost-efficiency, their limited programmability remains a major barrier to their wider adoption. This paper presents TL, an end-to-end framework that compiles tile-based programs (such as Triton kernels) onto spatial dataflow architectures. Unlike most existing compiler frameworks that focus on optimizing code generation within a single tile, TL addresses the central challenge of distributing tile instances across spatially distributed cores and exploiting the on-chip network and distributed memories to increase data reuse and reduce communications. TL proposes a hardware representation that captures interconnect topology, memory hierarchy, and compute capabilities, enabling both specialized architecture-specific optimizations and support for diverse spatial dataflow targets.

Given a graph \\(G\\) and a target class \\(\\mathcal{C}\\), the Minimum Subgraph Complementation problem asks for a minimum-size vertex set \\(S\\) such that complementing the subgraph induced by \\(S\\) transforms \\(G\\) into a graph belonging to \\(\\mathcal{C}\\). While the decision version of Subgraph Complementation has been extensively studied and is NP-complete for many graph classes, the algorithmic complexity of its optimization variant has remained largely unexplored.\n  In this paper, we study MSC from an algorithmic perspective. We present polynomial-time algorithms for MSC in several nontrivial settings. Our results include polynomial-time solvability for transforming graphs between bipartite, co-bipartite, and split graphs, as well as for complementing bipartite regular graphs into chordal graphs. We also show that MSC to the class of graphs of fixed degeneracy can be solved in polynomial time when the input graph is a forest. Moreover, we investigate MSC with respect to connectivity and prove that MSC to the class of disconnected graphs and to the class of 2-connected graphs can be solved in polynomial time for arbitrary inputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6700\u5c0f\u5b50\u56fe\u8865\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff08MSC\uff09\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\u3001\u5171\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\u3001\u5206\u88c2\u56fe\u7b49\u56fe\u7c7b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b50\u56fe\u8865\u5168\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u7248\u672c\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u8bb8\u591a\u56fe\u7c7b\u662fNP\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4f18\u5316\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4ecd\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22MSC\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u56fe\u7c7b\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u53ef\u89e3\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6700\u5c0f\u5b50\u56fe\u8865\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff08MSC\uff09\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u56fe\u7c7b\uff08\u5982\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\u3001\u5171\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\u3001\u5206\u88c2\u56fe\u3001\u5f26\u56fe\u7b49\uff09\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u8f93\u5165\u4e3a\u68ee\u6797\u6216\u56fa\u5b9a\u9000\u5316\u5ea6\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86MSC\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u56fe\u7c7b\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\u3001\u5171\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\u3001\u5206\u88c2\u56fe\u3001\u5f26\u56fe\u3001\u56fa\u5b9a\u9000\u5316\u5ea6\u56fe\uff08\u8f93\u5165\u4e3a\u68ee\u6797\u65f6\uff09\u3001\u4e0d\u8fde\u901a\u56fe\u548c2-\u8fde\u901a\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5b50\u56fe\u8865\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff08MSC\uff09\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5c06\u56fe\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\u3001\u5171\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\u548c\u5206\u88c2\u56fe\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c06\u4e8c\u5206\u6b63\u5219\u56fe\u8865\u5168\u4e3a\u5f26\u56fe\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u9000\u5316\u5ea6\u7684\u56fe\u7c7b\uff0c\u5f53\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u4e3a\u68ee\u6797\u65f6\uff0cMSC\u4e5f\u53ef\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u6c42\u89e3\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86MSC\u4e0e\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5c06\u56fe\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4e0d\u8fde\u901a\u56fe\u62162-\u8fde\u901a\u56fe\u7684MSC\u95ee\u9898\u540c\u6837\u53ef\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u89e3\u51b3\u3002"}}

However, questions remain about their ability to repair unseen vulnerabilities. Our empirical study reveals that state-of-the-art models often overfit to the training set and are evaluated using training, validation, and test sets that are not mutually exclusive. Furthermore, relying on match-based metrics that compare generated patches to reference fixes at the token level has some limitations, failing to account for the possibility of various valid ways to patch the vulnerability. In this paper, we examine the capabilities of state-of-the-art fine-tuned AVR models and the adequacy of match-based evaluation metrics in three ways. First, we apply semantic-preserving transformations to test sets in order to determine whether models truly learn robust vulnerability-repair patterns or simply rely on spurious features. Second, we re-split the training, validation, and test sets to be mutually exclusive and evaluate the models on the revised test set to assess their generalization capabilities. Third, we introduce L-AVRBench, a test-based benchmark tailored for learning-based AVR, to overcome the limitations of match-based metrics and examine the AVR models' true repair capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4fee\u590d\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u6362\u3001\u4e92\u65a5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cL-AVRBench\u4e09\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4fee\u590d\u6280\u672f\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4fee\u590d\u672a\u89c1\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5339\u914d\u5f0f\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u5bf9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u5e94\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u53d8\u6362\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u4f9d\u8d56\u865a\u5047\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2) \u91cd\u65b0\u5212\u5206\u4e92\u65a5\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b3) \u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684L-AVRBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u5339\u914d\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u4e14\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5584\uff0cL-AVRBench\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u6a21\u578b\u771f\u5b9e\u4fee\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4fee\u590d\uff08AVR\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u53d8\u6362\u3001\u4e92\u65a5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5212\u5206\u548cL-AVRBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u771f\u5b9e\u4fee\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, this paper proposes the TCFormer, a tiny, ultra-lightweight, weakly-supervised transformer-based crowd counting framework with only 5 million parameters that achieves competitive performance. Firstly, a powerful yet efficient vision transformer is adopted as the feature extractor, the global context-aware capabilities of which provides semantic meaningful crowd features with a minimal memory footprint. Secondly, to compensate for the lack of spatial supervision, we design a feature aggregation mechanism termed the Learnable Density-Weighted Averaging module. This module dynamically re-weights local tokens according to predicted density scores, enabling the network to adaptively modulate regional features based on their specific density characteristics without the need for additional annotations. Furthermore, this paper introduces a density-level classification loss, which discretizes crowd density into distinct grades, thereby regularizing the training process and enhancing the model's classification power across varying levels of crowd density. Therefore, although TCformer is trained under a weakly-supervised paradigm utilizing only image-level global counts, the joint optimization of count and density-level losses enables the framework to achieve high estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks including ShanghaiTech A/B, UCF-QNRF, and NWPU datasets demonstrate that our approach strikes a superior trade-off between parameter efficiency and counting accuracy and can be a good solution for crowd counting tasks in edge devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "TCFormer\uff1a\u8d85\u8f7b\u91cf\u5f31\u76d1\u7763Transformer\u4eba\u7fa4\u8ba1\u6570\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ec55M\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u635f\u5931\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u8ba1\u6570\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u7fa4\u8ba1\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bc6\u96c6\u70b9\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u5747\u6a21\u5757\uff08Learnable Density-Weighted Averaging\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u533a\u57df\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\u5206\u7c7b\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728ShanghaiTech A/B\u3001UCF-QNRF\u548cNWPU\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86TCFormer\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8ba1\u6570\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "TCFormer \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u4ec5500\u4e07\u7684\u8d85\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u4eba\u7fa4\u8ba1\u6570\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8ba1\u6570\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, the AiiDAlab platform was developed, making complex computational workflows accessible through an intuitive user interface that runs in a web browser. Here, we discuss how AiiDAlab has matured over the past few years, shifting its focus from computational materials science to become a powerful platform that accelerates scientific discovery across multiple disciplines. Thanks to its design, AiiDAlab allows scientists to focus on their research rather than on computational details and challenges, while keeping automatically track of the full simulation provenance via the underlying AiiDA engine and thus ensuring reproducibility. In particular, we discuss its adoption into quantum chemistry, atmospheric modeling, battery research, and even experimental data analysis at large-scale facilities, while also being actively used in educational settings. Driven by user feedback, significant effort has been made to simplify user onboarding, streamline access to computational resources, and provide robust mechanisms to work with large datasets.

CFIghter integrates whole-program analysis with guided runtime monitoring and iteratively applies the minimal necessary adjustments to CFI enforcement only where required, stopping once all tests pass or remaining failures are deemed unresolvable. We evaluate CFIghter on four GNU projects. It resolves all visibility-related build errors and automatically repairs 95.8% of unintended CFI violations in the large, multi-library util-linux codebase, while retaining strict enforcement at over 89% of indirect control-flow sites. Across all subjects, CFIghter preserves strict type-based CFI for the majority of the codebase without requiring manual source-code changes, relying only on automatically generated visibility adjustments and localized enforcement scopes where necessary.

Ismiel Hossen Abir", "Awolad Hossain"], "title": "A CNN-Based Malaria Diagnosis from Blood Cell Images with SHAP and LIME Explainability", "comment": null, "summary": "Malaria remains a prevalent health concern in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. The cause of malaria is the Plasmodium parasite, which is transmitted through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as microscopic blood smear analysis, are low in sensitivity, depend on expert judgment, and require resources that may not be available in remote settings. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a deep learning-based approach utilizing a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically classify blood cell images as parasitized or uninfected. The model achieves an accuracy of 96%, with precision and recall scores exceeding 0.95 for both classes.

Current approaches rely primarily on static validation methods that fail to catch behavior-level errors arising from interactive execution. In this paper, we propose Agent2World, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that achieves strong inference-time world-model generation and also serves as a data engine for supervised fine-tuning, by grounding generation in multi-agent feedback. Agent2World follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) A Deep Researcher agent performs knowledge synthesis by web searching to address specification gaps; (ii) A Model Developer agent implements executable world models; And (iii) a specialized Testing Team conducts adaptive unit testing and simulation-based validation. Agent2World demonstrates superior inference-time performance across three benchmarks spanning both Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and executable code representations, achieving consistent state-of-the-art results. Beyond inference, Testing Team serves as an interactive environment for the Model Developer, providing behavior-aware adaptive feedback that yields multi-turn training trajectories. The model fine-tuned on these trajectories substantially improves world-model generation, yielding an average relative gain of 30.95% over the same model before training.

While the general n-robot landscape has been largely established, the exact structure for two robots has remained unresolved. This paper presents the first complete characterization of the computational power of two autonomous robots across all major models, namely OBLOT, FSTA, FCOM, and LUMI, under the full spectrum of schedulers (FSYNCH, SSYNCH, ASYNCH, and their atomic variants). Our results reveal a landscape that fundamentally differs from the general case. Most notably, we prove that FSTA^F and LUMI^F coincide under full synchrony, a surprising collapse indicating that perfect synchrony can substitute both memory and communication when only two robots exist. We also show that FSTA and FCOM are orthogonal: there exists a problem solvable in the weakest communication model but impossible even in the strongest finite-state model, completing the bidirectional incomparability. All equivalence and separation results are derived through a novel simulation-free method, providing a unified and constructive view of the two-robot hierarchy. This yields the first complete and exact computational landscape for two robots, highlighting the intrinsic challenges of coordination at the minimal scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5b8c\u6574\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u4e24\u53f0\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4e3b\u8981\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0e\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u573a\u666f\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u56fe\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u540c\u6b65\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u4e24\u53f0\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u786e\u5207\u7ed3\u6784\u4ecd\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65e0\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u7b49\u4ef7\u548c\u5206\u79bb\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e24\u53f0\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u548c\u6784\u9020\u6027\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFSTA^F\u548cLUMI^F\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u540c\u6b65\u4e0b\u91cd\u5408\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u540c\u6b65\u53ef\u4ee5\u66ff\u4ee3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cFSTA\u548cFCOM\u662f\u6b63\u4ea4\u7684\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5728\u6700\u5f31\u901a\u4fe1\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u53ef\u89e3\u4f46\u5728\u6700\u5f3a\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5b8c\u6574\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u4e24\u53f0\u81ea\u4e3b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4e3b\u8981\u6a21\u578b\uff08OBLOT\u3001FSTA\u3001FCOM\u3001LUMI\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0e\u4e00\u822c\u60c5\u51b5\u6839\u672c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u56fe\u666f\u3002"}}

These faults silently corrupt internal parameters and can lead to unpredictable or dangerous model behavior. Localizing these corruptions is essential: without identifying the affected region, it is impossible to diagnose the source of degradation, apply targeted corrective measures, or restore model functionality without resorting to costly fine-tuning or full retraining. This work introduces BitFlipScope, a scalable, software-based framework for identifying fault-affected regions within transformer architectures under two deployment scenarios. When a clean reference model is available, BitFlipScope performs differential analysis of outputs, hidden states, and internal activations for detecting anomalous behavior indicative of corruption to pinpoint or localize faults.

We show in this work how publicly available LLMs can be socially engineered to transform novices into capable attackers, challenging the foundational principle that exploitation requires technical expertise. To that end, we propose RSA (Role-assignment, Scenario-pretexting, and Action-solicitation), a pretexting strategy that manipulates LLMs into generating functional exploits despite their safety mechanisms. Testing against Odoo -- a widely used ERP platform, we evaluated five mainstream LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude, Microsoft Copilot, and DeepSeek) and achieved a 100% success rate: tested CVE yielded at least one working exploit within 3-4 prompting rounds. While prior work [13] found LLM-assisted attacks difficult and requiring manual effort, we demonstrate that this overhead can be eliminated entirely.\n  Our findings invalidate core software engineering security principles: the distinction between technical and non-technical actors no longer provides valid threat models; technical complexity of vulnerability descriptions offers no protection when LLMs can abstract it away; and traditional security boundaries dissolve when the same tools that build software can be manipulated to break it. This represents a paradigm shift in software engineering -- we must redesign security practices for an era where exploitation requires only the ability to craft prompts, not understand code.\n  Artifacts available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/From-Rookie-to-Attacker-D8B3.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u4f7f\u975e\u6280\u672f\u4eba\u5458\u4e5f\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u793e\u4f1a\u5de5\u7a0b\u624b\u6bb5\u751f\u6210\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5229\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u98a0\u8986\u4f20\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b89\u5168\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u5982\u4f55\u964d\u4f4e\u653b\u51fb\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4f20\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5373\u5229\u7528\u6f0f\u6d1e\u9700\u8981\u6280\u672f\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RSA\uff08\u89d2\u8272\u5206\u914d\u3001\u573a\u666f\u9884\u8bbe\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u8bf1\u5bfc\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u793e\u4f1a\u5de5\u7a0b\u624b\u6bb5\u64cd\u7eb5LLMs\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5229\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41LLMs\u5728Odoo\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684CVE\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u4e94\u79cdLLMs\u5747\u80fd\u57283-4\u8f6e\u63d0\u793a\u5185\u751f\u6210\u81f3\u5c11\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5229\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387100%\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u98a0\u8986\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u975e\u6280\u672f\u4eba\u5458\u4e5f\u80fd\u8f7b\u6613\u53d1\u52a8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u8fd9\u8981\u6c42\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b89\u5168\u5b9e\u8df5\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), characterized by event-driven and sparse activation, offer energy efficiency but remain limited in capturing coupled temporal-frequency and topological dependencies of human motion. To bridge this gap, this article proposes Signal-SGN++, a topology-aware spiking graph framework that integrates structural adaptivity with time-frequency spiking dynamics. The network employs a backbone composed of 1D Spiking Graph Convolution (1D-SGC) and Frequency Spiking Convolution (FSC) for joint spatiotemporal and spectral feature extraction. Within this backbone, a Topology-Shift Self-Attention (TSSA) mechanism is embedded to adaptively route attention across learned skeletal topologies, enhancing graph-level sensitivity without increasing computational complexity. Moreover, an auxiliary Multi-Scale Wavelet Transform Fusion (MWTF) branch decomposes spiking features into multi-resolution temporal-frequency representations, wherein a Topology-Aware Time-Frequency Fusion (TATF) unit incorporates structural priors to preserve topology-consistent spectral fusion.

In this paper, we identify a tractable subset of these problems--namely, controllable, simple numeric problems--and propose an optimistic compilation approach that transforms them into simple numeric tasks. To do so, we abstract control-dependent expressions into bounded constant effects and relaxed preconditions.

While cloud computing offers a solution to weaker local environments, certain situations like training involving private or sensitive data, physical environments not available through the cloud, or higher anticipated usage costs, necessitate computing locally. We explore the potential to improve weaker local compute systems at zero additional cost by taking advantage of ubiquitous yet underutilized resources: mobile phones. Specifically, recent iOS phones are equipped with surprisingly powerful processors, but they also face limitations like memory constraints, thermal throttling, and OS sandboxing. We present a proof-of-concept system demonstrating a novel approach to harness an iOS device via distributed pipeline parallelism, achieving significant benefits in a lesser compute environment by accelerating modest model training, batch inference, and agentic LRM tool-usage.

These bugs necessitate the research and practice of code optimization. Traditional rule-based methods rely on manually designing and maintaining rules for specific performance bugs (e.g., redundant loops, repeated computations), making them labor-intensive and limited in applicability. In recent years, machine learning and deep learning-based methods have emerged as promising alternatives by learning optimization heuristics from annotated code corpora and performance measurements. However, these approaches usually depend on specific program representations and meticulously crafted training datasets, making them costly to develop and difficult to scale. With the booming of Large Language Models (LLMs), their remarkable capabilities in code generation have opened new avenues for automated code optimization. In this work, we proposed FasterPy, a low-cost and efficient framework that adapts LLMs to optimize the execution efficiency of Python code. FasterPy combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), supported by a knowledge base constructed from existing performance-improving code pairs and corresponding performance measurements, with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enhance code optimization performance.

However, a critical challenge is hallucination, where LLMs generate factually incorrect or misleading information, compromising research integrity. To address this, we introduce HalluMatData, a benchmark dataset for evaluating hallucination detection methods, factual consistency, and response robustness in AI-generated materials science content. Alongside this, we propose HalluMatDetector, a multi-stage hallucination detection framework that integrates intrinsic verification, multi-source retrieval, contradiction graph analysis, and metric-based assessment to detect and mitigate LLM hallucinations.

However, their application to redundant parallel mechanisms is challenged due to the increased constraint complexity. Moreover, it will output no solutions and cause unpredictable control problems when the target pose lies outside its workspace. To tackle these challenging issues, this work proposes P-FABRIK, a general, intuitive, and robust inverse kinematics method to find one feasible solution for diverse parallel mechanisms based on the FABRIK algorithm. By decomposing the general parallel mechanism into multiple serial sub-chains using a new topological decomposition strategy, the end targets of each sub-chain can be subsequently revised to calculate the inverse kinematics solutions iteratively. Multiple case studies involving planar, standard, and redundant parallel mechanisms demonstrated the proposed method's generality across diverse parallel mechanisms.

Park", "Moonwook Oh", "Yohan Jo", "Jaeyoung Do", "Sang-Won Lee"], "title": "MatKV: Trading Compute for Flash Storage in LLM Inference", "comment": "Accepted for publication in ICDE 2026", "summary": "We observe two major trends in LLM-based generative AI: (1) inference is becoming the dominant factor in terms of cost and power consumption, surpassing training, and (2) retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is becoming prevalent. When processing long inputs in RAG, the prefill phase of computing the key-value vectors of input text is energy-intensive and time-consuming even with high-end GPUs. Thus, it is crucial to make the prefill phase in RAG inference efficient. To address this issue, we propose MatKV, a scheme that precomputes the key-value vectors (KVs) of RAG objects (e.g., documents), materializes them in inexpensive but fast and power-efficient flash storage, and reuses them at inference time instead of recomputing the KVs using costly and power-inefficient GPU. Experimental results using Hugging Face's Transformers library across state-of-the-art GPUs and flash memory SSDs confirm that, compared to full KV computation on GPUs, MatKV reduces both inference time and power consumption by half for RAG workloads, without severely impacting accuracy in the question-answering task. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MatKV enables additional optimizations in two ways. First, a GPU can decode text while simultaneously loading the materialized KVs for the next instance, reducing load latency. Second, since decoding speed is less sensitive to GPU performance than KV computation, low-end GPUs can be leveraged for decoding without significantly compromising speed once the materialized KVs are loaded into GPU memory. These findings underscore MatKV's potential to make large-scale generative AI applications more cost-effective, power-efficient, and accessible across a wider range of tasks and hardware environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "MatKV\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5b58\u50a8\u952e\u503c\u5411\u91cf\u4f18\u5316RAG\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u786c\u4ef6\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728RAG\u5904\u7406\u957f\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\uff0c\u9884\u586b\u5145\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u952e\u503c\u5411\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMatKV\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97RAG\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u952e\u503c\u5411\u91cf\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5b58\u50a8\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u80fd\u6548\u9ad8\u7684\u95ea\u5b58\u4e2d\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u76f4\u63a5\u590d\u7528\u800c\u975e\u91cd\u65b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMatKV\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u4e00\u534a\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301GPU\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u4f4e\u7aefGPU\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "MatKV\u65b9\u6848\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5b58\u50a8RAG\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u952e\u503c\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u80fd\u6548\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7ecf\u6d4e\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

We introduce ViSignVQA, the first large-scale Vietnamese dataset designed for signboard-oriented VQA, which comprises 10,762 images and 25,573 question-answer pairs. The dataset captures the diverse linguistic, cultural, and visual characteristics of Vietnamese signboards, including bilingual text, informal phrasing, and visual elements such as color and layout. To benchmark this task, we adapted state-of-the-art VQA models (e.g., BLIP-2, LaTr, PreSTU, and SaL) by integrating a Vietnamese OCR model (SwinTextSpotter) and a Vietnamese pretrained language model (ViT5). The experimental results highlight the significant role of the OCR-enhanced context, with F1-score improvements of up to 209% when the OCR text is appended to questions. Additionally, we propose a multi-agent VQA framework combining perception and reasoning agents with GPT-4, achieving 75.98% accuracy via majority voting.

Therefore, achieving precise and robust motion control is a challenging yet important objective. Here, we propose a novel prescribed performance motion control framework based on variable-gain extended state observers (ESOs), referred to as PreGME. The method includes variable-gain ESOs for real-time estimation of dynamic coupling and a prescribed performance flight control that incorporates error trajectory constraints. Compared with existing methods, the proposed approach exhibits the following two characteristics. First, the adopted variable-gain ESOs can accurately estimate rapidly varying dynamic coupling. This enables the proposed method to handle manipulation tasks that require aggressive motion of the robotic arm. Second, by prescribing the performance, a preset error trajectory is generated to guide the system evolution along this trajectory. This strategy allows the proposed method to ensure the tracking error remains within the prescribed performance envelope, thereby achieving high-precision control. Experiments on a real platform, including aerial staff twirling, aerial mixology, and aerial cart-pulling experiments, are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that even under the dynamic coupling caused by rapid robotic arm motion (end-effector velocity: 1.02 m/s, acceleration: 5.10 m/s$^2$), the proposed method achieves high tracking performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "PreGME\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u53d8\u589e\u76caESO\u548c\u9884\u8bbe\u6027\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7a7a\u4e2d\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8026\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "motivation": "Precise and robust motion control of aerial manipulators is challenging due to significant dynamic coupling between the multirotor base and robotic arm.", "method": "The method combines variable-gain extended state observers (ESOs) for real-time dynamic coupling estimation and a prescribed performance flight control with error trajectory constraints.", "result": "Experiments show high tracking performance even under rapid robotic arm motion (end-effector velocity: 1.02 m/s, acceleration: 5.10 m/s\u00b2).", "conclusion": "The proposed PreGME framework effectively addresses dynamic coupling in aerial manipulators, achieving high-precision control with prescribed performance."}}

However, despite the widespread adoption of GPUs, programmability remains a challenge, particularly in open-source contexts. In this paper, we present SPUMA, a full GPU porting of OPENFOAM targeting NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. The implementation strategy is based on a portable programming model and the adoption of a memory pool manager that leverages the unified memory feature of modern GPUs. This approach is discussed alongside several numerical tests conducted on two pre-exascale clusters in Europe, LUMI and Leonardo, which host AMD MI250X and NVIDIA A100 GPUs, respectively. In the performance analysis section, we present results related to memory usage profiling and kernel wall-time, the impact of the memory pool, and energy consumption obtained by simulating the well-known DrivAer industrial test case. GPU utilization strongly affects strong scalability results, reaching 65% efficiency on both LUMI and Leonardo when approaching a load of 8 million cells per GPU. Weak scalability results, obtained on 20 GPUs with the OpenFOAM native multigrid solver, range from 75% on Leonardo to 85% on LUMI. Notably, efficiency is no lower than 90% when switching to the NVIDIA AmgX linear algebra solver. Our tests also reveal that one A100 GPU on Leonardo is equivalent 200-300 Intel Sapphire Rapids cores, provided the GPUs are sufficiently oversubscribed (more than 10 million of cells per GPU).

This process of localizing hidden objects is a form of unstructured search that can be performed more efficiently using historical data of where an object is frequently placed. Our model can accurately identify the complete 3D location of a hidden object on the first try significantly faster than a naive random search.

However, current agent architectures are frequently constructed using imperative, ad hoc patterns. This results in brittle systems plagued by difficulties in state management, error handling, and concurrency. This paper introduces Monadic Context Engineering (MCE), a novel architectural paradigm leveraging the algebraic structures of Functors, Applicative Functors, and Monads to provide a formal foundation for agent design. MCE treats agent workflows as computational contexts where cross-cutting concerns, such as state propagation, short-circuiting error handling, and asynchronous execution, are managed intrinsically by the algebraic properties of the abstraction. We demonstrate how Monads enable robust sequential composition, how Applicatives provide a principled structure for parallel execution, and crucially, how Monad Transformers allow for the systematic composition of these capabilities. This layered approach enables developers to construct complex, resilient, and efficient AI agents from simple, independently verifiable components. We further extend this framework to describe Meta-Agents, which leverage MCE for generative orchestration, dynamically creating and managing sub-agent workflows through metaprogramming.

MPK introduces an SM-level graph representation that captures data dependencies at the granularity of individual streaming multiprocessors (SMs), enabling cross-operator software pipelining, fine-grained kernel overlap, and other previously infeasible GPU optimizations. The MPK compiler lowers tensor programs into highly optimized SM-level task graphs and generates optimized CUDA implementations for all tasks, while the MPK in-kernel parallel runtime executes these tasks within a single mega-kernel using decentralized scheduling across SMs. Together, these components provide end-to-end kernel fusion with minimal developer effort, while preserving the flexibility of existing programming models. Our evaluation shows that MPK significantly outperforms existing kernel-per-operator LLM serving systems by reducing end-to-end inference latency by up to 1.7x, pushing LLM inference performance close to hardware limits.

Existing static strategies, such as sparse sampling, frame compression, and clustering, are optimized for offline settings and often produce fragmented or over-compressed outputs when applied to continuous video streams. We present VideoScaffold, a dynamic representation framework designed for streaming video understanding. It adaptively adjusts event granularity according to video duration while preserving fine-grained visual semantics. VideoScaffold introduces two key components: Elastic-Scale Event Segmentation (EES), which performs prediction-guided segmentation to dynamically refine event boundaries, and Hierarchical Event Consolidation (HEC), which progressively aggregates semantically related segments into multi-level abstractions. Working in concert, EES and HEC enable VideoScaffold to transition smoothly from fine-grained frame understanding to abstract event reasoning as the video stream unfolds. Extensive experiments across both offline and streaming video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that VideoScaffold achieves state-of-the-art performance.

While humans can describe movement goals explicitly such as \"walking forward with an upright posture,\" the underlying control strategies that realize these goals are largely implicit, making it difficult to directly design rewards from high-level goals and natural language descriptions. We introduce Motion from Vision-Language Representation (MoVLR), a framework that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to bridge the gap between goal specification and movement control. Rather than relying on handcrafted rewards, MoVLR iteratively explores the reward space through iterative interaction between control optimization and VLM feedback, aligning control policies with physically coordinated behaviors. Our approach transforms language and vision-based assessments into structured guidance for embodied learning, enabling the discovery and refinement of reward functions for high-dimensional musculoskeletal locomotion and manipulation. These results suggest that VLMs can effectively ground abstract motion descriptions in the implicit principles governing physiological motor control.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoVLR\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7684\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u808c\u8089\u9aa8\u9abc\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u4ee5\u660e\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u8fd0\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u201c\u76f4\u7acb\u884c\u8d70\u201d\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u9690\u5f0f\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u9ad8\u7ea7\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "MoVLR\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u4e0eVLM\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5956\u52b1\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "MoVLR\u80fd\u591f\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u9ad8\u7ef4\u808c\u8089\u9aa8\u9abc\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u534f\u8c03\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MoVLR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7684\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0e\u751f\u7406\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u539f\u5219\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u808c\u8089\u9aa8\u9abc\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

GenAI tools are being increasingly adopted by practitioners in SE, promising support for several SE activities. Despite increasing adoption, we still lack empirical evidence on how GenAI is used in practice, the benefits it provides, the challenges it introduces, and its broader organizational and societal implications. Objective. This study aims to provide an overview of the status of GenAI adoption in SE. It investigates the status of GenAI adoption, associated benefits and challenges, institutionalization of tools and techniques, and anticipated long term impacts on SE professionals and the community. Results. The results indicate a wide adoption of GenAI tools and how they are deeply integrated into daily SE work, particularly for implementation, verification and validation, personal assistance, and maintenance-related tasks. Practitioners report substantial benefits, most notably reduction in cycle time, quality improvements, enhanced support in knowledge work, and productivity gains. However, objective measurement of productivity and quality remains limited in practice. Significant challenges persist, including incorrect or unreliable outputs, prompt engineering difficulties, validation overhead, security and privacy concerns, and risks of overreliance. Institutionalization of tools and techniques seems to be common, but it varies considerably, with a strong focus on tool access and less emphasis on training and governance.

However, their performance is frequently constrained by the overly simplistic front-end designs employed in models like ViTPose. This naive patchification mechanism struggles to effectively handle multi-scale variations and results in irreversible information loss during the initial feature extraction phase. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel KAN-enhanced FPN-Stem architecture. Through rigorous ablation studies, we first identified that the true bottleneck for performance improvement lies not in plug-and-play attention modules (e.g., CBAM), but in the post-fusion non-linear smoothing step within the FPN. Guided by this insight, our core innovation is to retain the classic \"upsample-and-add\" fusion stream of the FPN, but replace its terminal, standard linear 3x3 smoothing convolution with a powerful KAN-based convolutional layer. Leveraging its superior non-linear modeling capabilities, this KAN-based layer adaptively learns and rectifies the \"artifacts\" generated during the multi-scale fusion process. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset demonstrate that our KAN-FPN-Stem achieves a significant performance boost of up to +2.0 AP over the lightweight ViTPose-S baseline. This work not only delivers a plug-and-play, high-performance module but, more importantly, reveals that: the performance bottleneck in ViT front-end often lies not in 'feature refinement' (Attention), but in the quality of 'feature fusion' (Fusion).

This stems from a fundamental computational bottleneck: ab initio methods offer quantum accuracy but are restricted to small spatiotemporal scales (< 500 atoms, picoseconds), while empirical force fields lack the reactive fidelity required for complex combustion environments. Herein, we bridge this gap by employing a \"human-in-the-loop\" closed-loop framework where self-auditing AI Agents validate the evolution of a machine learning potential (MLP). By acting as scientific sentinels that visualize hidden model artifacts for human decision-making, this collaborative cycle ensures quantum mechanical accuracy while exhibiting near-linear scalability to million-atom systems and accessing nanosecond timescales (energy RMSE: 1.2 meV/atom, force RMSE: 0.126 eV/Angstrom). Strikingly, our simulations reveal a temperature-regulated dual-mode oxidation mechanism: at moderate temperatures, the oxide shell acts as a dynamic \"gatekeeper,\" regulating oxidation through a \"breathing mode\" of transient nanochannels; above a critical threshold, a \"rupture mode\" unleashes catastrophic shell failure and explosive combustion. Importantly, we resolve a decades-old controversy by demonstrating that aluminum cation outward diffusion, rather than oxygen transport, dominates mass transfer across all temperature regimes, with diffusion coefficients consistently exceeding those of oxygen by 2-3 orders of magnitude. These discoveries establish a unified atomic-scale framework for energetic nanomaterial design, enabling the precision engineering of ignition sensitivity and energy release rates through intelligent computational design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7AI\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u52bf\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u94dd\u7eb3\u7c73\u9897\u7c92\u6c27\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u80fd\u7eb3\u7c73\u6750\u6599\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u94dd\u7eb3\u7c73\u9897\u7c92\uff08ANPs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u80fd\u56fa\u4f53\u71c3\u6599\uff0c\u5176\u4ece\u949d\u5316\u9897\u7c92\u5230\u7206\u70b8\u53cd\u5e94\u7269\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u2018\u4eba\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u2019\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u5ba1\u8ba1AI\u4ee3\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u52bf\uff08MLP\uff09\u7684\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7cbe\u5ea6\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u767e\u4e07\u539f\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u7eb3\u79d2\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6e29\u5ea6\u8c03\u63a7\u7684\u53cc\u6a21\u5f0f\u6c27\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u4e2d\u6e29\u4e0b\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u58f3\u5c42\u901a\u8fc7\u2018\u547c\u5438\u6a21\u5f0f\u2019\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u63a7\u6c27\u5316\uff1b\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e34\u754c\u6e29\u5ea6\u5219\u89e6\u53d1\u2018\u7834\u88c2\u6a21\u5f0f\u2019\u5bfc\u81f4\u7206\u70b8\u6027\u71c3\u70e7\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u8bc1\u5b9e\u94dd\u9633\u79bb\u5b50\u5411\u5916\u6269\u6563\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6e29\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8d28\u91cf\u4f20\u8f93\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u80fd\u7eb3\u7c73\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7cbe\u786e\u8c03\u63a7\u70b9\u706b\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u91ca\u653e\u901f\u7387\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce a lightweight software library that bridges this gap by providing simple scripting interfaces for common robotics visualization tasks.

Together, these features allow robotics researchers to rapidly create publication-ready images, animations, and explanatory schematics without needing extensive Blender expertise.

Developers of AI projects must contend not only with traditional software supply chain issues but also with novel, AI-specific security threats. However, little is known about what security issues are commonly encountered and how they are resolved in practice. This gap hinders the development of effective security measures for each component of the AI supply chain. We bridge this gap by conducting an empirical investigation of developer-reported issues and solutions, based on discussions from Hugging Face and GitHub. To identify security-related discussions, we develop a pipeline that combines keyword matching with an optimal fine-tuned distilBERT classifier, which achieved the best performance in our extensive comparison of various deep learning and large language models. This pipeline produces a dataset of 312,868 security discussions, providing insights into the security reporting practices of AI applications and projects. We conduct a thematic analysis of 753 posts sampled from our dataset and uncover a fine-grained taxonomy of 32 security issues and 24 solutions across four themes: (1) System and Software, (2) External Tools and Ecosystem, (3) Model, and (4) Data. We reveal that many security issues arise from the complex dependencies and black-box nature of AI components. Notably, challenges related to Models and Data often lack concrete solutions.

In this study, we introduce a meta-information guided cross-domain synergistic diffusion model (MiG-DM) that integrates comprehensive cross-modal priors to generate high-quality PET images. Specifically, a meta-information encoding module transforms clinical parameters into semantic prompts by considering patient characteristics, dose-related information, and semi-quantitative parameters, enabling cross-modal alignment between textual meta-information and image reconstruction. Additionally, the cross-domain architecture combines projection-domain and image-domain processing. In the projection domain, a specialized sinogram adapter captures global physical structures through convolution operations equivalent to global image-domain filtering.

However, current foundation models ignore three other important components of state-of-the-art predictive coding models: tight integration of actions with generative models, hierarchical compositional structure, and episodic memory. We propose that to achieve safe, interpretable, energy-efficient, and human-like AI, foundation models should integrate actions, at multiple scales of abstraction, with a compositional generative architecture and episodic memory. We present recent evidence from neuroscience and cognitive science on the importance of each of these components. We describe how the addition of these missing components to foundation models could help address some of their current deficiencies: hallucinations and superficial understanding of concepts due to lack of grounding, a missing sense of agency/responsibility due to lack of control, threats to safety and trustworthiness due to lack of interpretability, and energy inefficiency. We compare our proposal to current trends, such as adding chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to foundation models, and discuss new ways of augmenting these models with brain-inspired components.

In this work, we introduce the Universal Robot Description Directory (URDD), a modular representation that organizes derived robot information into structured, easy-to-parse JSON and YAML modules. Our open-source toolkit automatically generates URDDs from URDFs, with a Rust implementation supporting Bevy-based visualization. Additionally, we provide a JavaScript/Three.js viewer for web-based inspection of URDDs. Experiments on multiple robot platforms show that URDDs can be generated efficiently, encapsulate substantially richer information than standard specification files, and directly enable the construction of core robotics subroutines.

However, this method presents a critical trade-off: it improves throughput in low-load, memory-bound systems but degrades performance in high-load, compute-bound environments due to verification overhead. Current SD implementations use a fixed speculative length, failing to adapt to dynamic request rates and creating a significant performance bottleneck in real-world serving scenarios. To overcome this, we propose Nightjar, a novel learning-based algorithm for adaptive speculative inference that adjusts to request load by dynamically selecting the optimal speculative length for different batch sizes and even disabling speculative decoding when it provides no benefit.

However, production environments frequently experience Service Level Objective violations and cost inefficiencies due to reactive scaling behavior, limited use of application-level signals, and opaque control logic. This paper investigates how Kubernetes autoscaling can be enhanced using AIOps principles to jointly satisfy SLO and cost constraints under diverse workload patterns without compromising safety or operational transparency. We present a gap-driven analysis of existing autoscaling approaches and propose a safe and explainable multi-signal autoscaling framework that integrates SLO-aware and cost-conscious control with lightweight demand forecasting. Experimental evaluation using representative microservice and event-driven workloads shows that the proposed approach reduces SLO violation duration by up to 31 percent, improves scaling response time by 24 percent, and lowers infrastructure cost by 18 percent compared to default and tuned Kubernetes autoscaling baselines, while maintaining stable and auditable control behavior.

To address this challenge, this study proposes a hybrid knowledge distillation framework for developing a lightweight yet high-performance convolutional neural network. The proposed approach designs a customized student model that combines inverted residual blocks with dense connectivity and trains it under the guidance of a ResNet18 teacher network using a multi-objective strategy that integrates hard-label supervision, feature-level distillation, response-level distillation, and self-distillation. Experiments are conducted on a rice seed variety identification dataset containing nine varieties and further extended to four plant leaf disease datasets, including rice, potato, coffee, and corn, to evaluate generalization capability. On the rice seed variety classification task, the distilled student model achieves an accuracy of 98.56%, which is only 0.09% lower than the teacher model (98.65%), while requiring only 0.68 GFLOPs and approximately 1.07 million parameters. This corresponds to a reduction of about 2.7 times in computational cost and more than 10 times in model size compared with the ResNet18 teacher model. In addition, compared with representative pretrained models, the proposed student reduces the number of parameters by more than 6 times relative to DenseNet121 and by over 80 times compared with the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, while maintaining comparable or superior classification accuracy. Consistent performance gains across multiple plant leaf disease datasets further demonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and strong deployment potential of the proposed framework for hardware-limited smart agriculture systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e14\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684CNN\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u519c\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u519c\u4e1a\u4e2d\uff0c\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u5012\u7f6e\u6b8b\u5dee\u5757\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728ResNet18\u6559\u5e08\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u786c\u6807\u7b7e\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u84b8\u998f\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u7ea7\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7a3b\u79cd\u54c1\u79cd\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8698.56%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a98.65%\uff09\uff0c\u4ec5\u97000.68 GFLOPs\u548c\u7ea6107\u4e07\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea62.7\u500d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u51cf\u5c11\u8d8510\u500d\u3002\u5728\u690d\u7269\u53f6\u7247\u75c5\u5bb3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e14\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u519c\u4e1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u90e8\u7f72\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

These checks are typically performed between pairs of shapes attached to different robot links. However, many of these shape pairs can be excluded in advance, as their configurations are known to always or never result in contact. This information is typically encoded in a self-collision matrix, where each entry (i, j) indicates whether a check should be performed between shape i and shape j. While the MoveIt Setup Assistant is widely used to generate such matrices, current tools are limited by static visualization, lack of proximity support, rigid single-geometry assumptions, and tedious refinement workflows, hindering flexibility and reuse in downstream robotics applications. In this work, we introduce an interactive tool that overcomes these limitations by generating and visualizing self-collision matrices across multiple shape representations, enabling dynamic inspection, filtering, and refinement of shape pairs. Outputs are provided in both JSON and YAML for easy integration. The system is implemented in Rust and uses the Bevy game engine to deliver high-quality visualizations. We demonstrate its effectiveness on multiple robot platforms, showing that matrices generated using diverse shape types yield faster and more accurate self-collision and self-proximity queries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u81ea\u78b0\u649e\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u9759\u6001\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u63a5\u8fd1\u5ea6\u652f\u6301\u3001\u5355\u4e00\u51e0\u4f55\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u7e41\u7410\u7684\u7ec6\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u91cd\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f7f\u7528Rust\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528Bevy\u6e38\u620f\u5f15\u64ce\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u5f62\u72b6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u52a8\u6001\u68c0\u67e5\u3001\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u7ec6\u5316\u5f62\u72b6\u5bf9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6837\u5f62\u72b6\u7c7b\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u80fd\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u78b0\u649e\u548c\u81ea\u63a5\u8fd1\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u81ea\u78b0\u649e\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u91cd\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

However, RL post-training interleaves training and inference workloads, exposing the system to faults from both sides. Existing fault tolerance frameworks for LLMs target either training or inference, leaving the optimization potential in the asynchronous execution unexplored for RL. Our key insight is role-based fault isolation so the failure in one machine does not affect the others. We treat trainer, rollout, and other management roles in RL training as distinct distributed sub-tasks. Instead of restarting the entire RL task in ByteRobust, we recover only the failed role and reconnect it to living ones, thereby eliminating the full-restart overhead including rollout replay and initialization delay.\n  We present RobustRL, the first comprehensive robust system to handle GPU machine errors for RL post-training Effective Training Time Ratio improvement. (1) \\textit{Detect}. We implement role-aware monitoring to distinguish actual failures from role-specific behaviors to avoid the false positive and delayed detection. (2) \\textit{Restart}. For trainers, we implement a non-disruptive recovery where rollouts persist state and continue trajectory generation, while the trainer is rapidly restored via rollout warm standbys. For rollout, we perform isolated machine replacement without interrupting the RL task. (3) \\textit{Reconnect}. We replace static collective communication with dynamic, UCX-based (Unified Communication X) point-to-point communication, enabling immediate weight synchronization between recovered roles. In an RL training task on a 256-GPU cluster with Qwen3-8B-Math workload under 10\\% failure injection frequency, RobustRL can achieve an ETTR of over 80\\% compared with the 60\\% in ByteRobust and achieves 8.4\\%-17.4\\% faster in end-to-end training time.", "AI": {"tldr": "RobustRL\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u8272\u9694\u79bb\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6062\u590d\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347RL\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5bb9\u9519\u6027\uff0cETTR\u8fbe80%+\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed8.4%-17.4%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5bb9\u9519\u6846\u67b6\u4ec5\u9488\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528RL\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5f02\u6b65\u6267\u884c\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u89d2\u8272\u9694\u79bb\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u5355\u673a\u6545\u969c\u5f71\u54cd\u5168\u5c40\u3002", "method": "1. \u89d2\u8272\u611f\u77e5\u76d1\u63a7\uff08Detect\uff09\uff1b2. \u975e\u4e2d\u65ad\u5f0f\u6062\u590d\uff08Restart\uff09\uff1a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u70ed\u5907\u5feb\u901f\u6062\u590d\uff0crollout\u901a\u8fc7\u9694\u79bb\u673a\u5668\u66ff\u6362\uff1b3. \u52a8\u6001\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u901a\u4fe1\uff08Reconnect\uff09\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eUCX\u5b9e\u73b0\u6743\u91cd\u540c\u6b65\u3002", "result": "\u5728Qwen3-8B-Math\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cRobustRL\u7684ETTR\u8fbe80%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u5feb8.4%-17.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "RobustRL\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u8272\u9694\u79bb\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6062\u590d\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86RL\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff08ETTR\uff09\uff0c\u5728256-GPU\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8680%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684ETTR\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u768460%\u3002"}}

However, traditional red-green-blue (RGB) detection pipelines struggle in low-light environments, and thermal-based systems lack color and texture information. To overcome these limitations, we present an adaptive framework that fuses RGB and long-wave infrared (LWIR) video streams at multiple fusion ratios and dynamically selects the optimal detection model for each illumination condition. We trained 33 You Only Look Once (YOLO) models on over 22,000 annotated images spanning three light levels: no-light (<10 lux), dim-light (10-1000 lux), and full-light (>1000 lux). To integrate both modalities, fusion was performed by blending aligned RGB and LWIR frames at eleven ratios, from full RGB (100/0) to full LWIR (0/100) in 10% increments. Evaluation showed that the best full-light model (80/20 RGB-LWIR) and dim-light model (90/10 fusion) achieved 92.8% and 92.0% mean confidence; both significantly outperformed the YOLOv5 nano (YOLOv5n) and YOLOv11 nano (YOLOv11n) baselines.

This growth is largely driven by the widespread migration of applications to the Cloud, alongside a rising number of users consuming digital content. Dynamic adaptation (or self-adaptive) approaches appear as a way to reduce, at runtime and under certain constraints, the energy consumption of software applications.\n  [Question/Problem] Despite efforts to make energy-efficiency a primary goal in the dynamic adaptation of software applications, there is still a gap in understanding how to equip these self-adaptive software systems (SAS), which are dynamically adapted at runtime, with effective energy consumption monitoring tools that enable energy-awareness. Furthermore, the extent to which such an energy consumption monitoring tool impacts the overall energy consumption of the SAS ecosystem has not yet been thoroughly explored.\n  [Methodology] To address this gap, we introduce the EnCoMSAS (Energy Consumption Monitoring for Self-Adaptive Systems) tool that allows to gather the energy consumed by distributed software applications deployed, for instance, in the Cloud. EnCoMSAS enables the evaluation of energy consumption of SAS variants at runtime. It allows to integrate energy-efficiency as a main goal in the analysis and execution of new adaptation plans for the SAS. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of EnCoMSAS and investigate its impact on the overall energy consumption of the SAS ecosystem, we conduct an empirical study by using the Adaptable TeaStore case study. Adaptable TeaStore is a self-adaptive extension of the TeaStore application, a microservice benchmarking application. For this study, we focus on the recommender service of Adaptable TeaStore. Regarding the experiments, we first equip Adaptable TeaStore with EnCoMSAS. Next, we execute Adaptable TeaStore by varying workload conditions that simulate users interactions. Finally, we use EnCoMSAS for gathering and assessing the energy consumption of the recommender algorithms of Adaptable TeaStore. To run these experiments, we use nodes of the Grid5000 testbed.\n  [Results] The results show that EnCoMSAS is effective in collecting energy consumption of software applications for enabling dynamic adaptation at runtime. The observed correlation between CPU usage and energy consumption collected by EnCoMSAS provides evidence supporting the validity of the collected energy measurements. Moreover, we point out, through EnCoMSAS, that energy consumption is influenced not only by the algorithmic complexity but also by the characteristics of the deployment environment. Finally, the results show that the impact of EnCoMSAS on the overall energy consumption of the SAS ecosystem is comparatively modest with respect to the entire set of the TeaStore applications microservices.", "AI": {"tldr": "EnCoMSAS\u5de5\u5177\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u76d1\u6d4b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u5bf9\u6574\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u8017\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u80fd\u8017\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u80fd\u8017\u6301\u7eed\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u76d1\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u80fd\u8017\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165EnCoMSAS\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Adaptable TeaStore\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "EnCoMSAS\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6536\u96c6\u80fd\u8017\u6570\u636e\uff0cCPU\u4f7f\u7528\u7387\u4e0e\u80fd\u8017\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u53d7\u7b97\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5de5\u5177\u672c\u8eab\u5bf9\u6574\u4f53\u80fd\u8017\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "EnCoMSAS\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u6536\u96c6\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9SAS\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u80fd\u8017\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002"}}

By injecting gradients from this teacher into the latent diffusion process, we show that geometry and style can be separated in a controllable manner. We evaluate this approach across three architectures: Stable Diffusion v1.5 with a U-Net backbone, the flow-matching model SiT-XL/2, and the diffusion transformer PixArt-\u03a3. Our experiments reveal that flow models tend to drift back toward their default trajectories without continuous guidance, and we demonstrate zero-shot transfer of complex three-dimensional shapes, such as an Eames chair, onto conflicting materials such as pink metal. This guided generation improves semantic alignment by about 80 percent compared to unguided baselines. Overall, our results show that small teacher models can reliably guide large generative systems, enabling stronger geometric control and broadening the creative range of text-to-image synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7HPE\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u6ce8\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u9762\u5916\u89c2\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u73b0\u6210\u7684\u9274\u522b\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5916\u90e8\u6307\u5bfc\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63d0\u51faHuman Perception Embedding (HPE)\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u5165\u68af\u5ea6\u5230\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\uff08Stable Diffusion v1.5\u3001SiT-XL/2\u3001PixArt-\u03a3\uff09\u4e2d\u5747\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u63d0\u5347\u7ea680%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c0f\u578b\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u6307\u5bfc\u5927\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u51e0\u4f55\u63a7\u5236\u5e76\u62d3\u5bbd\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u7684\u521b\u610f\u8303\u56f4\u3002"}}

Unlike standard LLM post-training, agentic RL workloads are highly heterogeneous, combining compute-intensive prefill phases, bandwidth-bound decoding, and stateful, CPU-heavy environment simulations. We argue that efficient agentic RL training requires disaggregated infrastructure to leverage specialized, best-fit hardware. However, naive disaggregation introduces substantial synchronization overhead and resource underutilization due to the complex dependencies between stages.\n  We present RollArc, a distributed system designed to maximize throughput for multi-task agentic RL on disaggregated infrastructure. RollArc is built on three core principles: (1) hardware-affinity workload mapping, which routes compute-bound and bandwidth-bound tasks to bestfit GPU devices, (2) fine-grained asynchrony, which manages execution at the trajectory level to mitigate resource bubbles, and (3) statefulness-aware computation, which offloads stateless components (e.g., reward models) to serverless infrastructure for elastic scaling.

Yet, existing solutions often impose centralized control models ill-suited to microservices decentralized nature. This paper presents AdaptiFlow, a framework that leverages well-established principles of autonomous computing to provide abstraction layers focused on the Monitor and Execute phases of the MAPE-K loop. By decoupling metrics collection and action execution from adaptation logic, AdaptiFlow enables microservices to evolve into autonomous elements through standardized interfaces, preserving their architectural independence while enabling system-wide adaptability. The framework introduces: (1) Metrics Collectors for unified infrastructure/business metric gathering, (2) Adaptation Actions as declarative actuators for runtime adjustments, and (3) a lightweight Event-Driven and rule-based mechanism for adaptation logic specification. Validation through the enhanced Adaptable TeaStore benchmark demonstrates practical implementation of three adaptation scenarios targeting three levels of autonomy self-healing (database recovery), self-protection (DDoS mitigation), and self-optimization (traffic management) with minimal code modification per service.

In this paper, we propose SimVC-CAS, a novel collective agent system that simulates VC decision-making as a multi-agent interaction process. By designing role-playing agents and a GNN-based supervised interaction module, we reformulate startup financing prediction as a group decision-making task, capturing both enterprise fundamentals and the behavioral dynamics of potential investor networks. Each agent embodies an investor with unique traits and preferences, enabling heterogeneous evaluation and realistic information exchange through a graph-structured co-investment network. Using real-world data from PitchBook and under strict data leakage controls, we show that SimVC-CAS significantly improves predictive accuracy while providing interpretable, multiperspective reasoning, for example, approximately 25% relative improvement with respect to average precision@10.

Coupling mechanisms for heterogeneous structural modules should meet all of the following requirements: single-sided coupling and decoupling, flat surfaces when uncoupled, and coupling to passive coupling interfaces as well as coupling behavior between coupling mechanisms. The design requirements for such a coupling mechanism are complex. We propose a novel shape-matching mechanical coupling mechanism that satisfies these design requirements. This mechanism enables controlled, sequential transitions between male and female states. When uncoupled, all mechanisms are in the female state. To enable single-sided coupling, one side of the mechanisms switches to the male state during the coupling process. Single-sided decoupling is possible not only from the male side but also from the female side by forcibly switching the opposite mechanism's male state to the female state. This coupling mechanism can be applied to various modular robot systems and robot arm tool changers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6ee1\u8db3\u590d\u6742\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u5339\u914d\u673a\u68b0\u8026\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5355\u4fa7\u64cd\u4f5c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u8868\u9762\u5e73\u6574\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5f02\u6784\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u73af\u5883\uff08\u5982\u592a\u7a7a\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5efa\u8bbe\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6ee1\u8db3\u5355\u4fa7\u8026\u5408\u548c\u89e3\u8026\u3001\u89e3\u8026\u65f6\u8868\u9762\u5e73\u6574\u3001\u80fd\u4e0e\u88ab\u52a8\u8026\u5408\u63a5\u53e3\u8026\u5408\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u5339\u914d\u673a\u68b0\u8026\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u7537\u6027\u548c\u5973\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5355\u4fa7\u8026\u5408\u548c\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u4e14\u89e3\u8026\u65f6\u8868\u9762\u4fdd\u6301\u5e73\u6574\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u4e0e\u88ab\u52a8\u8026\u5408\u63a5\u53e3\u8026\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u5339\u914d\u673a\u68b0\u8026\u5408\u673a\u5236\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u81c2\u5de5\u5177\u66f4\u6362\u5668\u3002"}}

Nikolopoulos"], "title": "Modality Inflation: Energy Characterization and Optimization Opportunities for MLLM Inference", "comment": null, "summary": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are built on text-only LLMs by incorporating additional modalities, enabling multimodal understanding and a broader range of applications. However, these additions introduce a previously unexplored energy trade-off across modalities that remains poorly understood, as most prior work focuses on text-only models. In this paper, we examine modality inflation, a key source of inefficiency in which multimodal inputs increase inference workloads through extra encoding stages and expanded token sequences. We provide the first detailed, stage-level analysis of energy consumption in MLLM inference by breaking the pipeline into vision encoding, prefill, and decoding stages. Using four representative MLLMs evaluated on NVIDIA A100 GPU, we quantify the additional energy required for multimodal inference compared to text-only baselines, observing overheads ranging from 17% to 94% across models for identical inputs. Our results show that energy bottlenecks differ widely across model architectures, stemming either from compute-heavy vision encoders or from the downstream impact of large visual token sequences during prefill. By examining GPU power traces, we further uncover substantial GPU underutilization during multimodal execution and show that input complexity leads to markedly different energy scaling behaviors across models. Finally, we demonstrate that stage-wise dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is an effective optimization, allowing energy savings with only modest performance impact.

However, their reasoning often contains subtle logical errors masked by fluent language, posing significant risks for critical applications. While existing approaches like fact-checking, self-consistency methods, and rule-based validation provide partial solutions, they fail to detect complex logical flaws in multi-step reasoning.\n  To overcome these challenges, we present MATP, an evaluation framework for systematically verifying LLM reasoning via Multi-step Automatic Theorem Proving. MATP translates natural language reasoning into First-Order Logic (FOL) and applies automated theorem provers to assess step-by-step logical validity. This approach identifies hidden logical errors and provides fine-grained classifications of reasoning correctness. Evaluations on a benchmark comprising 10,830 reasoning instances generated by 10 LLMs across tasks from PrOntoQA-OOD, ProofWriter, and FOLIO show that MATP surpasses prompting-based baselines by over 42 percentage points in reasoning step verification. It further reveals model-level disparities, with reasoning models generating more logically coherent outputs than general models.

Current benchmarks, typically based on medical licensing exams or curated vignettes, fail to capture the integrated, multimodal reasoning essential for real-world patient care. Methods: We developed the Bones and Joints (B&J) Benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation framework comprising 1,245 questions derived from real-world patient cases in orthopedics and sports medicine. This benchmark assesses models across 7 tasks that mirror the clinical reasoning pathway, including knowledge recall, text and image interpretation, diagnosis generation, treatment planning, and rationale provision. We evaluated eleven vision-language models (VLMs) and six large language models (LLMs), comparing their performance against expert-derived ground truth. Results: Our results demonstrate a pronounced performance gap between task types. While state-of-the-art models achieved high accuracy, exceeding 90%, on structured multiple-choice questions, their performance markedly declined on open-ended tasks requiring multimodal integration, with accuracy scarcely reaching 60%. VLMs demonstrated substantial limitations in interpreting medical images and frequently exhibited severe text-driven hallucinations, often ignoring contradictory visual evidence. Notably, models specifically fine-tuned for medical applications showed no consistent advantage over general-purpose counterparts. Conclusions: Current artificial intelligence models are not yet clinically competent for complex, multimodal reasoning. Their safe deployment should currently be limited to supportive, text-based roles.

While large scale vision language action (VLA) models have shown impressive generalization in household and industrial manipulation by leveraging paired video action data from diverse domains, surgical robotics suffers from the paucity of datasets that include both visual observations and accurate robot kinematics. In contrast, vast corpora of surgical videos exist, but they lack corresponding action labels, preventing direct application of imitation learning or VLA training. In this work, we aim to alleviate this problem by learning policy models from SurgWorld, a world model designed for surgical physical AI. We curated the Surgical Action Text Alignment (SATA) dataset with detailed action description specifically for surgical robots. Then we built SurgeWorld based on the most advanced physical AI world model and SATA. It's able to generate diverse, generalizable and realistic surgery videos.

Deep learning has the potential to enhance sonographers' efficiency and support the training of new practitioners. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are particularly promising for ultrasound interpretation, as they can jointly process images and text to perform multiple clinical tasks within a single framework. However, despite the expansion of VLMs, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate their performance in fetal ultrasound imaging. This gap is primarily due to the modality's challenging nature, operator dependency, and the limited public availability of datasets. To address this gap, we present Fetal-Gauge, the first and largest visual question answering benchmark specifically designed to evaluate VLMs across various fetal ultrasound tasks. Our benchmark comprises over 42,000 images and 93,000 question-answer pairs, spanning anatomical plane identification, visual grounding of anatomical structures, fetal orientation assessment, clinical view conformity, and clinical diagnosis. We systematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLMs, including general-purpose and medical-specific models, and reveal a substantial performance gap: the best-performing model achieves only 55\\% accuracy, far below clinical requirements. Our analysis identifies critical limitations of current VLMs in fetal ultrasound interpretation, highlighting the urgent need for domain-adapted architectures and specialized training approaches. Fetal-Gauge establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing multimodal deep learning in prenatal care and provides a pathway toward addressing global healthcare accessibility challenges.

To establish more natural and effective human-vehicle interaction, we propose a Human-Oriented Cooperative Driving (HOCD) approach that primarily minimizes human-machine conflict by prioritizing driver intention and state. In implementation, we take both tactical and operational levels into account to ensure seamless human-vehicle cooperation. At the tactical level, we design an intention-aware trajectory planning method, using intention consistency cost as the core metric to evaluate the trajectory and align it with driver intention. At the operational level, we develop a control authority allocation strategy based on reinforcement learning, optimizing the policy through a designed reward function to achieve consistency between driver state and authority allocation. The results of simulation and human-in-the-loop experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach not only aligns with driver intention in trajectory planning but also ensures a reasonable authority allocation. Compared to other cooperative driving approaches, the proposed HOCD approach significantly enhances driving performance and mitigates human-machine conflict.The code is available at https://github.com/i-Qin/HOCD.", "AI": {"tldr": "HOCD\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u610f\u56fe\u611f\u77e5\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u6743\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u673a\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4eba\u8f66\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u5efa\u7acb\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6280\u672f\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6218\u672f\u5c42\u9762\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u610f\u56fe\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u64cd\u4f5c\u5c42\u9762\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6743\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHOCD\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u4e0e\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u610f\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5408\u7406\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6743\u5206\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u534f\u540c\u9a7e\u9a76\uff08HOCD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4eba\u673a\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing solutions largely neglect the dynamic, stochastic, and heterogeneous nature of such environments, often ignoring the impact of variable output token lengths and device diversity. In this work, we present Argus, the first token-aware distributed edge-cloud LLM inference framework that conducts efficient task offloading. Argus features a Length-Aware Semantics (LAS) module, which predicts output token lengths for incoming prompts using a fine-tuned language model with token-length-sensitive feature modulation, enabling precise estimation. Building on this, our Lyapunov-guided Offloading Optimization (LOO) module formulates long-term Quality-of-Experience optimization that explicitly considers both LLM prefilling and decoding costs. We introduce a novel Iterative Offloading Algorithm with Damping and Congestion Control (IODCC) to effectively solve the resulting integer nonlinear programming problem under time-varying constraints.

This has led to the adoption of software and hardware approaches such as Robot Operating System (ROS) 2 and multi-core processors. Traditional manual program parallelization faces challenges, including maintaining data integrity and avoiding concurrency issues such as deadlocks. While model-based development (MBD) automates this process, it encounters difficulties with the integration of modern frameworks such as ROS 2 in multi-input scenarios. This paper proposes an MBD framework to overcome these issues, categorizing ROS 2-compatible Simulink models into event-driven and timer-driven types for targeted parallelization. As a result, it extends the conventional parallelization by MBD and supports parallelized code generation for ROS 2-based models with multiple inputs. The evaluation results show that after applying parallelization with the proposed framework, all patterns show a reduction in execution time, confirming the effectiveness of parallelization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdMBD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3ROS 2\u517c\u5bb9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5904\u7406\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u624b\u52a8\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u5e76\u53d1\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684MBD\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u96c6\u6210\u73b0\u4ee3\u6846\u67b6\u5982ROS 2\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06ROS 2\u517c\u5bb9\u7684Simulink\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u4e3a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u5b9a\u65f6\u9a71\u52a8\u4e24\u7c7b\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u540e\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5747\u6709\u6240\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MBD\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86ROS 2\u517c\u5bb9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, battery limitations often constrain their effectiveness, necessitating the development of optimized flight paths and data collection techniques. While existing approaches like coverage path planning (CPP) ensure comprehensive data collection, they can be inefficient, especially when inspecting multiple non connected Regions of Interest (ROIs). This paper introduces the Fast Inspection of Scattered Regions (FISR) problem and proposes a novel solution, the multi UAV Disjoint Areas Inspection (mUDAI) method. The introduced approach implements a two fold optimization procedure, for calculating the best image capturing positions and the most efficient UAV trajectories, balancing data resolution and operational time, minimizing redundant data collection and resource consumption. The mUDAI method is designed to enable rapid, efficient inspections of scattered ROIs, making it ideal for applications such as security infrastructure assessments, agricultural inspections, and emergency site evaluations. A combination of simulated evaluations and real world deployments is used to validate and quantify the method's ability to improve operational efficiency while preserving high quality data capture, demonstrating its effectiveness in real world operations. An open source Python implementation of the mUDAI method can be found on GitHub (https://github.com/soc12/mUDAI) and the collected and processed data from the real world experiments are all hosted on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/13866483).

This paper investigates the feasibility of deploying a high-performance, private LLM inference server at a cost accessible to Small and Medium Businesses (SMBs). We present a comprehensive benchmarking analysis of a locally hosted, quantized 30-billion parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model based on Qwen3, running on a consumer-grade server equipped with a next-generation NVIDIA GPU. Unlike cloud-based offerings, which are expensive and complex to integrate, our approach provides an affordable and private solution for SMBs. We evaluate two dimensions: the model's intrinsic capabilities and the server's performance under load. Model performance is benchmarked against academic and industry standards to quantify reasoning and knowledge relative to cloud services. Concurrently, we measure server efficiency through latency, tokens per second, and time to first token, analyzing scalability under increasing concurrent users. Our findings demonstrate that a carefully configured on-premises setup with emerging consumer hardware and a quantized open-source model can achieve performance comparable to cloud-based services, offering SMBs a viable pathway to deploy powerful LLMs without prohibitive costs or privacy compromises.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u672c\u5730LLM\u90e8\u7f72\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u4e91\u670d\u52a1\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u969c\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u4f01\u4e1a\u5bf9\u4e91\u670d\u52a1\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e3b\u6743\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u5347\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4e2d\u5c0f\u578b\u4f01\u4e1a\u80fd\u5426\u4ee5\u53ef\u627f\u53d7\u7684\u6210\u672c\u90e8\u7f72\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u79c1\u6709\u7684LLM\u63a8\u7406\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8eQwen3\u768430\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08MoE\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u5728\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5728\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u5982\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u6bcf\u79d2\u751f\u6210\u4ee4\u724c\u6570\u548c\u9996\u6b21\u4ee4\u724c\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\uff09\u4e0a\u5747\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e91\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u591a\u7528\u6237\u5e76\u53d1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65b0\u5174\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u4e91\u670d\u52a1\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5c0f\u578b\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u7684LLM\u90e8\u7f72\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u65e2\u65e0\u9700\u9ad8\u6602\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e5f\u65e0\u9700\u727a\u7272\u9690\u79c1\u3002"}}

The system samples video frames, prompts a VLM to detect visible people and generate pixel-space bounding boxes with prompt-conditioned attributes (emotion by default), validates output structure using a predefined schema, and optionally renders an annotated video. We first summarize the shared multimodal foundation (visual tokenization, Transformer attention, and instruction following), then describe each architecture at a level sufficient to justify engineering choices without speculative internals. Finally, we connect model behavior to system constraints: structured outputs can be syntactically valid while semantically incorrect, schema validation is structural (not geometric correctness), person identifiers are frame-local in the current prompting contract, and interactive single-frame analysis returns free-form text rather than schema-enforced JSON.

The framework identifies reflection as the key mechanism that enables agents to adapt through interaction without back propagation or model fine tuning, thereby relaxing the conventional separation between training and deployment.To formalise this process, we introduce the Stateful Reflective Decision Process, which models reflective learning as a two stage read write interaction with episodic memory. Writing stores interaction outcomes and corresponds to policy evaluation, while reading retrieves relevant past cases and corresponds to policy improvement. We show that this process induces an equivalent Markov decision process over augmented state memory representations, allowing the use of classical tools from dynamic programming and reinforcement learning. We further instantiate the framework using entropy regularised policy iteration and establish convergence guarantees. As episodic memory grows and achieves sufficient coverage of the state space, the resulting policy converges to the optimal solution.

This study proposes an explainability centered workflow that integrates Shapley-value attribution with physics-based obstacle avoidance evaluation for the ROBOTIS OpenManipulator-X. Building upon the original IKNet, two lightweight variants-Improved IKNet with residual connections and Focused IKNet with position-orientation decoupling are trained on a large, synthetically generated pose-joint dataset. SHAP is employed to derive both global and local importance rankings, while the InterpretML toolkit visualizes partial-dependence patterns that expose non-linear couplings between Cartesian poses and joint angles. To bridge algorithmic insight and robotic safety, each network is embedded in a simulator that subjects the arm to randomized single and multi-obstacle scenes; forward kinematics, capsule-based collision checks, and trajectory metrics quantify the relationship between attribution balance and physical clearance. Qualitative heat maps reveal that architectures distributing importance more evenly across pose dimensions tend to maintain wider safety margins without compromising positional accuracy. The combined analysis demonstrates that explainable AI(XAI) techniques can illuminate hidden failure modes, guide architectural refinements, and inform obstacle aware deployment strategies for learning based IK.

We argue that implementations of this specification should be informed by key properties of self-adaptation: system-wide consistency (coordinated adaptations across replicas), planning (executing an adaptation until appropriate conditions are met),  and modularity (clean integration of adaptation logic).  In this implementation discussion paper, we examine how software architectural methods, the cloud-native Operator pattern, and legacy programming language techniques can decouple self-adaptive control logic from the TeaStore application. We analyze the trade-offs that these different approaches make between fine-grained expressive adaptation and system-wide control, and highlight when reuse of adaptation strategies is most effective.

Training and evaluation use licensed datasets spanning diverse drivers, vehicles, and lighting conditions (details in Section 6), and we further validate runtime behavior in real in-vehicle tests. The optimized deployments achieve about 16 FPS on Raspberry Pi 5 with INT8 inference (per-frame latency under 60 ms) and about 25 FPS on Coral Edge TPU, enabling real-time monitoring and stable alert generation on inexpensive hardware.

We propose a Segmented Allocation with Momentum-Adjusted Utility for Multi-agent Portfolio Management via Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (SAMP-HDRL). The framework first applies dynamic asset grouping to partition the market into high-quality and ordinary subsets. An upper-level agent extracts global market signals, while lower-level agents perform intra-group allocation under mask constraints. A utility-based capital allocation mechanism integrates risky and risk-free assets, ensuring coherent coordination between global and local decisions. backtests across three market regimes (2019--2021) demonstrate that SAMP-HDRL consistently outperforms nine traditional baselines and nine DRL benchmarks under volatile and oscillating conditions. Compared with the strongest baseline, our method achieves at least 5\\% higher Return, 5\\% higher Sharpe ratio, 5\\% higher Sortino ratio, and 2\\% higher Omega ratio, with substantially larger gains observed in turbulent markets. Ablation studies confirm that upper--lower coordination, dynamic clustering, and capital allocation are indispensable to robustness. SHAP-based interpretability further reveals a complementary ``diversified + concentrated'' mechanism across agents, providing transparent insights into decision-making.

Our approach employs YOLOv8 for semantic segmentation combined with CUDA-accelerated processing to achieve real-time performance. The system implements a multi-stage filtering strategy encompassing ground plane estimation, sky region removal, edge filtering, and temporal consistency validation. Comprehensive evaluation on the KITTI dataset (sequences 00-09) demonstrates performance characteristics across different environmental conditions and scene types.

Red-team training applies worst-of-K counter-forensics per batch, including JPEG realign and recompress, resampling warps, denoise-to-regrain operations, seam smoothing, small color and gamma shifts, and social-app transcodes, while test-time defense injects low-cost jitters such as resize and crop phase changes, mild gamma variation, and JPEG phase shifts with aggregated predictions. Heatmaps are guided to concentrate within face regions using face-box masks without strict pixel-level annotations. Evaluation on existing benchmarks, including standard deepfake datasets and a surveillance-style split with low light and heavy compression, reports clean and attacked performance, AUC, worst-case accuracy, reliability, abstention quality, and weak-localization scores.

Computing the optimal allocation of several agents to numerous tasks through a brute-force approach can be infeasible, especially when each task's performance scales differently with the increase of agents. For example, difficult tasks may require more agents to achieve similar performances compared to simpler tasks, but performance may saturate nonlinearly as the number of allocated agents increases. We propose a computationally efficient algorithm, based on marginal performance gains, for optimally allocating agents to tasks with concave scalability functions, including linear, saturating, and retrograde scaling, to achieve maximum collective performance. We test the algorithm by allocating a simulated robot swarm among collective decision-making tasks, where embodied agents sample their environment and exchange information to reach a consensus on spatially distributed environmental features. We vary task difficulties by different geometrical arrangements of environmental features in space (patchiness). In this scenario, decision performance in each task scales either as a saturating curve (following the Condorcet's Jury Theorem in an interference-free setup) or as a retrograde curve (when physical interference among robots restricts their movement). Using simple robot simulations, we show that our algorithm can be useful in allocating robots among tasks.

Optimization of resource allocation configuration parameters for CPU and memory during the Release phase remains a largely unexplored problem as most research has focused on intelligent scheduling and autoscaling of microservices during the Ops stage of the DevOps cycle. Yet horizontal auto-scaling of containers, based on CPU usage for instance, may still leave these containers with an inappropriately allocated amount of memory, if no upfront fine-tuning of both resources is applied before the Deployment phase. We evaluate the performance optimization framework using the TeaStore microservice application and statistically compare different optimization algorithms, supporting informed decisions about their trade-offs between sampling cost and distance to the optimal resource configuration. This shows that upfront factor screening, for reducing the search space, is helpful when the goal is to find the optimal resource configuration with an affordable sampling budget. When the goal is to statistically compare different algorithms, screening must also be applied to make data collection of all data points in the search space feasible.  If the goal is to find a near-optimal configuration, however, it is better to run bayesian optimization without screening.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728DevOps\u53d1\u5e03\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u524d\u7f6e\u7b5b\u9009\u5728\u9884\u7b97\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u800c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u5bfb\u627e\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7814\u7a76\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728DevOps\u5468\u671f\u4e2dOps\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u800c\u53d1\u5e03\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u672a\u7ecf\u524d\u671f\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u5bb9\u5668\u6c34\u5e73\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5b58\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u5f53\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528TeaStore\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u5e94\u7528\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u7edf\u8ba1\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u6743\u8861\u91c7\u6837\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u8d44\u6e90\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u524d\u7f6e\u56e0\u7d20\u7b5b\u9009\u5728\u6709\u9650\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u627e\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u914d\u7f6e\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u7b97\u6cd5\u65f6\u7b5b\u9009\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\uff1b\u800c\u76f4\u63a5\u8fd0\u884c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u5bfb\u627e\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u53d1\u5e03\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u5e94\u7528\u7684CPU\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u914d\u7f6e\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u524d\u7f6e\u56e0\u7d20\u7b5b\u9009\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u627e\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u8d44\u6e90\u914d\u7f6e\uff1b\u800c\u5728\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u7b97\u6cd5\u65f6\uff0c\u7b5b\u9009\u4e5f\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u82e5\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u627e\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5219\u65e0\u9700\u7b5b\u9009\u76f4\u63a5\u8fd0\u884c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u66f4\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

A key limitation of existing approaches like Ultra is their reliance on a single relational transformation (e.g., element-wise multiplication) in message passing, which can constrain expressiveness and fail to capture diverse relational and structural patterns exhibited on diverse graphs. In this paper, we propose Gamma, a novel foundation model that introduces multi-head geometric attention to knowledge graph reasoning. Gamma replaces the single relational transformation with multiple parallel ones, including real, complex, split-complex, and dual number based transformations, each designed to model different relational structures. A relational conditioned attention fusion mechanism then adaptively fuses them at link level via a lightweight gating with entropy regularization, allowing the model to robustly emphasize the most appropriate relational bias for each triple pattern.

When integrated into robots, ToM allows them to adapt their internal models to users' behaviors, enhancing the interpretability and predictability of their actions. Similarly, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to make AI systems transparent and interpretable, allowing humans to understand and interact with them effectively. Since ToM in HRI serves related purposes, we propose to consider ToM as a form of XAI and evaluate it through the eValuation XAI (VXAI) framework and its seven desiderata. This paper identifies a critical gap in the application of ToM within HRI, as existing methods rarely assess the extent to which explanations correspond to the robot's actual internal reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose to integrate ToM within XAI frameworks. By embedding ToM principles inside XAI, we argue for a shift in perspective, as current XAI research focuses predominantly on the AI system itself and often lacks user-centered explanations.

However, current methods face two challenges: scale inconsistency, where variations in subject size lead to unnatural generation, and permutation sensitivity, where the order of reference inputs causes subject distortion. In this paper, we propose MoFu, a unified framework that tackles both challenges. For scale inconsistency, we introduce Scale-Aware Modulation (SMO), an LLM-guided module that extracts implicit scale cues from the prompt and modulates features to ensure consistent subject sizes. To address permutation sensitivity, we present a simple yet effective Fourier Fusion strategy that processes the frequency information of reference features via the Fast Fourier Transform to produce a unified representation. Besides, we design a Scale-Permutation Stability Loss to jointly encourage scale-consistent and permutation-invariant generation. To further evaluate these challenges, we establish a dedicated benchmark with controlled variations in subject scale and reference permutation.

To address this limitation, we introduce RW-Post, a high-quality and explainable dataset for real-world multimodal fact-checking. RW-Post aligns real-world multimodal claims with their original social media posts, preserving the rich contextual information in which the claims are made. In addition, the dataset includes detailed reasoning and explicitly linked evidence, which are derived from human written fact-checking articles via a large language model assisted extraction pipeline, enabling comprehensive verification and explanation. Building upon RW-Post, we propose AgentFact, an agent-based multimodal fact-checking framework designed to emulate the human verification workflow. AgentFact consists of five specialized agents that collaboratively handle key fact-checking subtasks, including strategy planning, high-quality evidence retrieval, visual analysis, reasoning, and explanation generation. These agents are orchestrated through an iterative workflow that alternates between evidence searching and task-aware evidence filtering and reasoning, facilitating strategic decision-making and systematic evidence analysis.

Diesel-hydraulic systems have long dominated, so full electrification, via direct replacement or redesign, raises major technical and economic challenges. Although advanced artificial intelligence (AI) could enable higher autonomy, adoption in HDMMs is limited by strict safety requirements, and these machines still rely heavily on human supervision.\n  This dissertation develops a control framework that (1) simplifies control design for electrified HDMMs through a generic modular approach that is energy-source independent and supports future modifications, and (2) defines hierarchical control policies that partially integrate AI while guaranteeing safety-defined performance and stability.\n  Five research questions align with three lines of investigation: a generic robust control strategy for multi-body HDMMs with strong stability across actuation types and energy sources; control solutions that keep strict performance under uncertainty and faults while balancing robustness and responsiveness; and methods to interpret and trust black-box learning strategies so they can be integrated stably and verified against international safety standards.\n  The framework is validated in three case studies spanning different actuators and conditions, covering heavy-duty mobile robots and robotic manipulators. Results appear in five peer-reviewed publications and one unpublished manuscript, advancing nonlinear control and robotics and supporting both transitions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u7535\u52a8\u91cd\u578b\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u68b0\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6574\u5408AI\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9762\u5bf9\u91cd\u578b\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u68b0\u4ece\u67f4\u6cb9\u6db2\u538b\u9a71\u52a8\u5411\u6e05\u6d01\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8f6c\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ece\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\u5411\u66f4\u9ad8\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u91cf\u6e90\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49\u5206\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6574\u5408AI\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6267\u884c\u5668\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u76f8\u5173\u6210\u679c\u53d1\u8868\u5728\u4e94\u7bc7\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8bba\u6587\u548c\u4e00\u7bc7\u672a\u53d1\u8868\u7684\u624b\u7a3f\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7b80\u5316\u7535\u52a8\u91cd\u578b\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u68b0\uff08HDMMs\uff09\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u90e8\u5206\u6574\u5408AI\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Consequently, prevailing approaches tend to rely on uniform frame sampling or static pre-selection, which might overlook critical evidence and unable to correct its initial selection error during its reasoning process. To overcome these limitations, we propose VideoZoomer, a novel agentic framework that enables MLLMs to dynamically control their visual focus during reasoning. Starting from a coarse low-frame-rate overview, VideoZoomer invokes a temporal zoom tool to obtain high-frame-rate clips at autonomously chosen moments, thereby progressively gathering fine-grained evidence in a multi-turn interactive manner. Accordingly, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase on a curated dataset of distilled exemplar and reflection trajectories, followed by reinforcement learning to further refine the agentic policy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 7B model delivers diverse and complex reasoning patterns, yielding strong performance across a broad set of long video understanding and reasoning benchmarks.

This is especially problematic in K--12 settings, which the EU AI Act classifies as high-risk domain requiring responsible design. Motivated by these concerns, this study synthesises evidence on limitations of LLM-based tutors and empirically investigates one critical issue: the accuracy, reliability, and temporal coherence of assessing learners' evolving knowledge over time. We compare a deep knowledge tracing (DKT) model with a widely used LLM, evaluated zero-shot and fine-tuned, using a large open-access dataset. Results show that DKT achieves the highest discrimination performance (AUC = 0.83) on next-step correctness prediction and consistently outperforms the LLM across settings. Although fine-tuning improves the LLM's AUC by approximately 8\\% over the zero-shot baseline, it remains 6\\% below DKT and produces higher early-sequence errors, where incorrect predictions are most harmful for adaptive support. Temporal analyses further reveal that DKT maintains stable, directionally correct mastery updates, whereas LLM variants exhibit substantial temporal weaknesses, including inconsistent and wrong-direction updates. These limitations persist despite the fine-tuned LLM requiring nearly 198 hours of high-compute training, far exceeding the computational demands of DKT. Our qualitative analysis of multi-skill mastery estimation further shows that, even after fine-tuning, the LLM produced inconsistent mastery trajectories, while DKT maintained smooth and coherent updates. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs alone are unlikely to match the effectiveness of established intelligent tutoring systems, and that responsible tutoring requires hybrid frameworks that incorporate learner modelling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cLLM\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u77e5\u8bc6\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0cDKT\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eLLM\uff0c\u8868\u660eLLM\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u96be\u4ee5\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9K-12\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u80fd\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u8bef\u89e3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6b27\u76dfAI\u6cd5\u6848\u5c06K-12\u5217\u4e3a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8LLM\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u77e5\u8bc6\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6df1\u5ea6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff08DKT\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684LLM\uff08\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u7248\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u5f00\u653e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u53d8\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cDKT\u5728\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u7684\u5224\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u9ad8\uff08AUC = 0.83\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eLLM\u3002\u5fae\u8c03\u867d\u4f7fLLM\u7684AUC\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ea68%\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u6bd4DKT\u4f4e6%\uff0c\u4e14\u65e9\u671f\u5e8f\u5217\u9519\u8bef\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8868\u660e\uff0cDKT\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u65b9\u5411\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u638c\u63e1\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u800cLLM\u53d8\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5f31\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u8bba\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5355\u7eaf\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u8f85\u5bfc\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

While visual goals provide a compact and unambiguous task specification, existing goal-conditioned policies often struggle with long-horizon manipulation due to their reliance on single-step action prediction without explicit modeling of task progress. We propose Act2Goal, a general goal-conditioned manipulation policy that integrates a goal-conditioned visual world model with multi-scale temporal control. Given a current observation and a target visual goal, the world model generates a plausible sequence of intermediate visual states that captures long-horizon structure. To translate this visual plan into robust execution, we introduce Multi-Scale Temporal Hashing (MSTH), which decomposes the imagined trajectory into dense proximal frames for fine-grained closed-loop control and sparse distal frames that anchor global task consistency. The policy couples these representations with motor control through end-to-end cross-attention, enabling coherent long-horizon behavior while remaining reactive to local disturbances. Act2Goal achieves strong zero-shot generalization to novel objects, spatial layouts, and environments. We further enable reward-free online adaptation through hindsight goal relabeling with LoRA-based finetuning, allowing rapid autonomous improvement without external supervision. Real-robot experiments demonstrate that Act2Goal improves success rates from 30% to 90% on challenging out-of-distribution tasks within minutes of autonomous interaction, validating that goal-conditioned world models with multi-scale temporal control provide structured guidance necessary for robust long-horizon manipulation.

To address this, we propose SpotEdit, a training-free diffusion editing framework that selectively updates only the modified regions. SpotEdit comprises two key components: SpotSelector identifies stable regions via perceptual similarity and skips their computation by reusing conditional image features; SpotFusion adaptively blends these features with edited tokens through a dynamic fusion mechanism, preserving contextual coherence and editing quality.

However, in deployment, computational constraints necessitate inference-time adaptation via reward-guided decoding (RGD) rather than per-user policy fine-tuning. This creates a critical but overlooked requirement: reward models must not only rank preferences accurately but also effectively guide token-level generation decisions. We demonstrate that standard RM accuracy fails catastrophically as a selection criterion for deployment-ready personalized alignment. Through systematic evaluation across three datasets, we introduce policy accuracy, a metric quantifying whether RGD scoring functions correctly discriminate between preferred and dispreferred responses. We show that RM accuracy correlates only weakly with this policy-level discrimination ability (Kendall's tau = 0.08--0.31). More critically, we introduce Pref-LaMP, the first personalized alignment benchmark with ground-truth user completions, enabling direct behavioral evaluation without circular reward-based metrics. On Pref-LaMP, we expose a complete decoupling between discrimination and generation: methods with 20-point RM accuracy differences produce almost identical output quality, and even methods achieving high discrimination fail to generate behaviorally aligned responses. Finally, simple in-context learning (ICL) dominates all reward-guided methods for models > 3B parameters, achieving 3-5 point ROUGE-1 gains over the best reward method at 7B scale. These findings show that the field optimizes proxy metrics that fail to predict deployment performance and do not translate preferences into real behavioral adaptation under deployment constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6307\u5bfc\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6307\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8131\u8282\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7b56\u7565\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1Pref-LaMP\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u6807\u51c6\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u90e8\u7f72\u9009\u62e9\u6807\u51c6\u5b8c\u5168\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u9886\u57df\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5c06\u504f\u597d\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u9002\u5e94\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches primarily focus on forward modeling, e.g., learning holistic mappings from text to motion or composing a complex motion from a set of motion concepts. In this paper, we consider the inverse perspective: decomposing a holistic motion into semantically meaningful sub-components. We propose DeMoGen, a compositional training paradigm for decompositional learning that employs an energy-based diffusion model. This energy formulation directly captures the composed distribution of multiple motion concepts, enabling the model to discover them without relying on ground-truth motions for individual concepts. Within this paradigm, we introduce three training variants to encourage a decompositional understanding of motion: 1. DeMoGen-Exp explicitly trains on decomposed text prompts; 2. DeMoGen-OSS performs orthogonal self-supervised decomposition; 3. DeMoGen-SC enforces semantic consistency between original and decomposed text embeddings.

We introduce ChexReason, a vision-language model trained via R1-style methodology (SFT followed by GRPO) using only 2,000 SFT samples, 1,000 RL samples, and a single A100 GPU. Evaluations on CheXpert and NIH benchmarks reveal a fundamental tension: GRPO recovers in-distribution performance (23% improvement on CheXpert, macro-F1 = 0.346) but degrades cross-dataset transferability (19% drop on NIH). This mirrors high-resource models like NV-Reason-CXR-3B, suggesting the issue stems from the RL paradigm rather than scale. We identify a generalization paradox where the SFT checkpoint uniquely improves on NIH before optimization, indicating teacher-guided reasoning captures more institution-agnostic features.

However, we identify two fundamental limitations. First, the optimal policy depends on arbitrary modeling choices (scalarization function, reference policy), yielding behavior reflecting parameterization artifacts rather than true preferences. Second, treating response generation in isolation fails to leverage comparative information in pairwise data, leaving the model's capacity for intrinsic self-reflection untapped. To address it, we propose Intrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (\\q), deriving a globally optimal policy conditioning on both context and alternative responses. We prove this formulation superior to DPO/RLHF while guaranteeing invariance to scalarization and reference choices. \\q~serves as a plug-and-play enhancement without architectural changes or inference overhead.

However, they are susceptible to high-frequency disturbances from unintentional driver torque, known as driver impedance, which can degrade steering performance. Existing approaches either rely on direct torque sensors, which are costly and impractical, or lack the temporal resolution to capture rapid, high-frequency driver-induced disturbances. We address this limitation by designing a Kalman filter-based disturbance observer that estimates high-frequency driver torque using only motor state measurements. We model the drivers passive torque as an extended state using a PT1-lag approximation and integrate it into both linear and nonlinear Steer-by-Wire system models. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and simulation of this disturbance observer with an evaluation of different Kalman filter variants. Our findings indicate that the proposed disturbance observer accurately reconstructs driver-induced disturbances with only minimal delay 14ms. We show that a nonlinear extended Kalman Filter outperforms its linear counterpart in handling frictional nonlinearities, improving estimation during transitions from static to dynamic friction. Given the study's methodology, it was unavoidable to rely on simulation-based validation rather than real-world experimentation. Further studies are needed to investigate the robustness of the observers under real-world driving conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u7535\u673a\u72b6\u6001\u6d4b\u91cf\u5373\u53ef\u4f30\u8ba1\u9ad8\u9891\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u626d\u77e9\uff0c14ms\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7248\u672c\u5728\u6469\u64e6\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5b9e\u9645\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ebf\u63a7\u8f6c\u5411\u7cfb\u7edf\u6613\u53d7\u9ad8\u9891\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u626d\u77e9\u6270\u52a8\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6216\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7535\u673a\u72b6\u6001\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u9ad8\u9891\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u626d\u77e9\u3002\u91c7\u7528PT1\u6ede\u540e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5bf9\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u88ab\u52a8\u626d\u77e9\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8f6c\u5411\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u6270\u52a8\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u6784\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u5728\u6469\u64e6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u7248\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u9ad8\u9891\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u626d\u77e9\uff0c\u4ec5\u970014\u6beb\u79d2\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u5728\u6469\u64e6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u9a7e\u9a76\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

However, moving such cancer cases forward for treatment requires accurate on the amount of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein expression. Predicting both the lower and higher levels of HER2 can be challenging. Moreover, jointly analyzing H&E and immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained images for HER2 scoring is difficult. Although several deep learning methods have been investigated to address the challenge of HER2 scoring, they suffer from providing a pixel-level localization of HER2 status. In this study, we propose a single end-to-end pipeline using a system of vision transformers with HER2 status scoring on whole slide images of WSIs. The method includes patch-wise processing of H&E WSIs for tumor localization. A novel mapping function is proposed to correspondingly identify correlated IHC WSIs regions with malignant regions on H&E. A clinically inspired HER2 scoring mechanism is embedded in the pipeline and allows for automatic pixel-level annotation of 4-way HER2 scoring (0, 1+, 2+, and 3+). Also, the proposed method accurately returns HER2-negative and HER2-positive. Privately curated datasets were collaboratively extracted from 13 different cases of WSIs of H&E and IHC. A thorough experiment is conducted on the proposed method. Results obtained showed a good classification accuracy during tumor localization. Also, a classification accuracy of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.933 were returned for the prediction of HER2 status, scoring in the 4-way methods. The applicability of the proposed pipeline was investigated using WSIs patches as comparable to human pathologists.

Human EI often involves a phenomenological component and a sense of understanding that artificially intelligent systems lack; therefore, some aspects of EI are irrelevant in evaluating AI systems. However, EI also includes an ability to sense an emotional state, explain it, respond appropriately, and adapt to new contexts (e.g., multicultural), and artificially intelligent systems can do such things to greater or lesser degrees. Several benchmark frameworks specialize in evaluating the capacity of different AI models to perform some tasks related to EI, but these often lack a solid foundation regarding the nature of emotion and what it is to be emotionally intelligent. In this project, we begin by reviewing different theories about emotion and general EI, evaluating the extent to which each is applicable to artificial systems. We then critically evaluate the available benchmark frameworks, identifying where each falls short in light of the account of EI developed in the first section.

As a result, collaborative robots, despite their advanced sensing and control capabilities, are rarely used for surface finishing in small-scale craft and manufacturing settings. To address this gap, we propose a novel robot programming approach that enables non-experts to intuitively program robots through interactive, task-focused workflows. For that, we developed a new surface segmentation algorithm that incorporates human input to identify and refine workpiece regions for processing.

This lack of data efficiency and interpretability constrains their clinical reliability and alignment with human reasoning. Here, we show that a perception-informed pseudo-colouring technique, previously demonstrated to enhance human ECG interpretation, can improve both explainability and few-shot learning in deep neural networks analysing complex physiological data.\n  We focus on acquired, drug-induced long QT syndrome (LQTS) as a challenging case study characterised by heterogeneous signal morphology, variable heart rate, and scarce positive cases associated with life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. This setting provides a stringent test of model generalisation under extreme data scarcity. By encoding clinically salient temporal features, such as QT-interval duration, into structured colour representations, models learn discriminative and interpretable features from as few as one or five training examples. Using prototypical networks and a ResNet-18 architecture, we evaluate one-shot and few-shot learning on ECG images derived from single cardiac cycles and full 10-second rhythms. Explainability analyses show that pseudo-colouring guides attention toward clinically meaningful ECG features while suppressing irrelevant signal components. Aggregating multiple cardiac cycles further improves performance, mirroring human perceptual averaging across heartbeats. Together, these findings demonstrate that human-like perceptual encoding can bridge data efficiency, explainability, and causal reasoning in medical machine intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f2a\u7740\u8272\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u5347ECG\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u7f16\u7801\u5728\u533b\u7597AI\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\u89e3\u6790\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u836f\u7269\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u957fQT\u7efc\u5408\u5f81\uff08LQTS\uff09\u4e3a\u4f8b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u539f\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u548cResNet-18\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5355\u5fc3\u52a8\u5468\u671f\u548c\u5b8c\u657410\u79d2\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u7684\u5355\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u4f2a\u7740\u8272\u6280\u672f\u5e2e\u52a9\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u6781\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5bfc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u4f2a\u7740\u8272\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u7597\u673a\u5668\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While search algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) can explore alternatives, they are often ineffective when guided by sparse rewards and fail to leverage the rich semantic capabilities of LLMs. We introduce SPIRAL (Symbolic LLM Planning via Grounded and Reflective Search), a novel framework that embeds a cognitive architecture of three specialized LLM agents into an MCTS loop. SPIRAL's key contribution is its integrated planning pipeline where a Planner proposes creative next steps, a Simulator grounds the search by predicting realistic outcomes, and a Critic provides dense reward signals through reflection. This synergy transforms MCTS from a brute-force search into a guided, self-correcting reasoning process. On the DailyLifeAPIs and HuggingFace datasets, SPIRAL consistently outperforms the default Chain-of-Thought planning method and other state-of-the-art agents. More importantly, it substantially surpasses other state-of-the-art agents; for example, SPIRAL achieves 83.6% overall accuracy on DailyLifeAPIs, an improvement of over 16 percentage points against the next-best search framework, while also demonstrating superior token efficiency. Our work demonstrates that structuring LLM reasoning as a guided, reflective, and grounded search process yields more robust and efficient autonomous planners.

This work departs from that paradigm to investigate the intrinsic topological structure of the optimization landscape itself. We formulate the design problem on the product manifold of Projective Lines \\RP^2^N, fixing the rotor positions to the vertices of polyhedral chassis while varying their lines of action. By minimizing a coordinate-invariant Log-Volume isotropy metric, we reveal that the topology of the global optima is governed strictly by the symmetry of the chassis. For generic (irregular) vertex arrangements, the solutions appear as a discrete set of isolated points. However, as the chassis geometry approaches regularity, the solution space undergoes a critical phase transition, collapsing onto an N-dimensional Torus of the lines tangent at the vertexes to the circumscribing sphere of the chassis, and subsequently reducing to continuous 1-dimensional curves driven by Affine Phase Locking. We synthesize these observations into the N-5 Scaling Law: an empirical relationship holding for all examined regular planar polygons and Platonic solids (N <= 10), where the space of optimal configurations consists of K=N-5 disconnected 1D topological branches. We demonstrate that these locking patterns correspond to a sequence of admissible Star Polygons {N/q}, allowing for the exact prediction of optimal phases for arbitrary N. Crucially, this topology reveals a design redundancy that enables optimality-preserving morphing: the vehicle can continuously reconfigure along these branches while preserving optimal isotropic control authority.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86N\u65cb\u7ffc\u98de\u884c\u5668\u51e0\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7531\u5e95\u76d8\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86N-5\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5168\u5411N\u65cb\u7ffc\u98de\u884c\u5668\u51e0\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u91c7\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bfb\u6c42\u56fa\u5b9a\u67b6\u6784\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4f18\u5316\u666f\u89c2\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u5185\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4ea7\u54c1\u6d41\u5f62Projective Lines RP^2^N\u4e0a\u56fa\u5b9a\u8f6c\u5b50\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5e76\u53d8\u5316\u5176\u4f5c\u7528\u7ebf\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5750\u6807\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684Log-Volume\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u4e25\u683c\u7531\u5e95\u76d8\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u9876\u70b9\u6392\u5217\uff0c\u89e3\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u5b64\u7acb\u70b9\uff1b\u968f\u7740\u5e95\u76d8\u51e0\u4f55\u63a5\u8fd1\u89c4\u5219\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ecf\u5386\u4e34\u754c\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5f62\u6210K=N-5\u4e2a\u4e0d\u76f8\u8fde\u76841D\u62d3\u6251\u5206\u652f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5168\u5411N\u65cb\u7ffc\u98de\u884c\u5668\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u5185\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86N-5\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4efb\u610fN\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u4f4d\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Second, we augment the MLLM's 3D scene understanding with a suite of specialized visual tools to analyze scene state, gather spatial information, and validate action outcomes. This perceptual feedback loop is critical for closing the gap between language-based updates and precise 3D-aware manipulation. Third, to manage the iterative, error-prone updates, we propose a collaborative multi-agent framework with designated roles for planning, execution, and verification. This decomposition allows the system to robustly handle multi-step instructions and recover from intermediate errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a diverse set of 25 complex object arrangement tasks, where it significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Treating an LLM's output (\"model choice\") as a single data point underutilizes the information inherent to the probabilistic nature of LLMs. This paper introduces and formalizes \"model belief,\" a measure derived from an LLM's token-level probabilities that captures the model's belief distribution over choice alternatives in a single generation run. The authors prove that model belief is asymptotically equivalent to the mean of model choices (a non-trivial property) but forms a more statistically efficient estimator, with lower variance and a faster convergence rate. Analogous properties are shown to hold for smooth functions of model belief and model choice often used in downstream applications. The authors demonstrate the performance of model belief through a demand estimation study, where an LLM simulates consumer responses to different prices. In practical settings with limited numbers of runs, model belief explains and predicts ground-truth model choice better than model choice itself, and reduces the computation needed to reach sufficiently accurate estimates by roughly a factor of 20. The findings support using model belief as the default measure to extract more information from LLM-generated data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u5ff5\u2019\u4f5c\u4e3aLLM\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u7edf\u8ba1\u4f18\u52bf\u5e76\u5728\u9700\u6c42\u4f30\u8ba1\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9LLM\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5e76\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u2018\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u5ff5\u2019\u8fd9\u4e00\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u7edf\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u65b9\u5dee\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u672c\u8eab\u66f4\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u771f\u5b9e\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7ea620\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u7ed3\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u5c06\u2018\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u5ff5\u2019\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ed8\u8ba4\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u4eceLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u66f4\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

Unlike traditional diffusion or flow models, it does not rely solely on local supervision, which typically necessitates many inference steps. Unlike distillation-based approaches, it does not require a pretrained teacher.

Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image benchmarks show that Self-E not only excels in few-step generation, but is also competitive with state-of-the-art Flow Matching models at 50 steps. We further find that its performance improves monotonically as inference steps increase, enabling both ultra-fast few-step generation and high-quality long-trajectory sampling within a single unified model.

Thermal comfort, a sophisticated interplay of environmental factors and personal perceptions involving sensory integration and adaptive decision-making, serves as an ideal paradigm for evaluating real-world cognitive capabilities of AI systems. To address this, we propose TCEval, the first evaluation framework that assesses three core cognitive capacities of AI, cross-modal reasoning, causal association, and adaptive decision-making, by leveraging thermal comfort scenarios and large language model (LLM) agents. The methodology involves initializing LLM agents with virtual personality attributes, guiding them to generate clothing insulation selections and thermal comfort feedback, and validating outputs against the ASHRAE Global Database and Chinese Thermal Comfort Database. Experiments on four LLMs show that while agent feedback has limited exact alignment with humans, directional consistency improves significantly with a 1 PMV tolerance. Statistical tests reveal that LLM-generated PMV distributions diverge markedly from human data, and agents perform near-randomly in discrete thermal comfort classification. These results confirm the feasibility of TCEval as an ecologically valid Cognitive Turing Test for AI, demonstrating that current LLMs possess foundational cross-modal reasoning ability but lack precise causal understanding of the nonlinear relationships between variables in thermal comfort.

Generating motion from audio and then retargeting it to robots relies on explicit motion reconstruction, leading to cascaded errors, high latency, and disjointed acoustic-actuation mapping. We propose RoboPerform, the first unified audio-to-locomotion framework that can directly generate music-driven dance and speech-driven co-speech gestures from audio. Guided by the core principle of \"motion = content + style\", the framework treats audio as implicit style signals and eliminates the need for explicit motion reconstruction. RoboPerform integrates a ResMoE teacher policy for adapting to diverse motion patterns and a diffusion-based student policy for audio style injection. This retargeting-free design ensures low latency and high fidelity.

Recent benchmarks show that even frontier vision-language models achieve only 50-53% accuracy on basic quantitative physics tasks, behaving as approximate guessers that preserve semantic plausibility while violating physical constraints. This input unfaithfulness is not a scaling deficiency but a structural limitation. Perception-centric architectures optimize parameter-space imitation, whereas safety-critical control demands outcome-space guarantees over executed actions. Here, we present a fundamentally different pathway toward domain-specific foundation models by introducing compact language models operating as Agentic Physical AI, in which policy optimization is driven by physics-based validation rather than perceptual inference. We train a 360-million-parameter model on synthetic reactor control scenarios, scaling the dataset from 10^3 to 10^5 examples. This induces a sharp phase transition absent in general-purpose models. Small-scale systems exhibit high-variance imitation with catastrophic tail risk, while large-scale models undergo variance collapse exceeding 500x reduction, stabilizing execution-level behavior. Despite balanced exposure to four actuation families, the model autonomously rejects approximately 70% of the training distribution and concentrates 95% of runtime execution on a single-bank strategy.

Among the various techniques, Artificial Potential Field (APF) methods have gained popularity due to their simplicity, real-time responsiveness, and low computational requirements. However, a major limitation of conventional APF approaches is the local minima trap problem, where the robot becomes stuck in a position with no clear direction toward the goal. This paper proposes a novel path planning technique, termed the Bulldozer, which addresses the local minima issue while preserving the inherent advantages of APF. The Bulldozer technique introduces a backfilling mechanism that systematically identifies and eliminates local minima regions by increasing their potential values, analogous to a bulldozer filling potholes in a road. Additionally, a ramp-based enhancement is incorporated to assist the robot in escaping trap areas when starting within a local minimum. The proposed technique is experimentally validated using a physical mobile robot across various maps with increasing complexity.

While recently learning-based Process Reward Models (PRMs) are a promising direction, they are often hindered by two fundamental limitations: their reward models lack step-aware understanding and rely on single-view perception, leading to unreliable assessments of fine-grained manipulation progress; and their reward shaping procedures are theoretically unsound, often inducing a semantic trap that misguides policy optimization. To address these, we introduce Dopamine-Reward, a novel reward modeling method for learning a general-purpose, step-aware process reward model from multi-view inputs. At its core is our General Reward Model (GRM), trained on a vast 3,400+ hour dataset, which leverages Step-wise Reward Discretization for structural understanding and Multi-Perspective Reward Fusion to overcome perceptual limitations. Building upon Dopamine-Reward, we propose Dopamine-RL, a robust policy learning framework that employs a theoretically-sound Policy-Invariant Reward Shaping method, which enables the agent to leverage dense rewards for efficient self-improvement without altering the optimal policy, thereby fundamentally avoiding the semantic trap. Extensive experiments across diverse simulated and real-world tasks validate our approach. GRM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in reward assessment, and Dopamine-RL built on GRM significantly improves policy learning efficiency. For instance, after GRM is adapted to a new task in a one-shot manner from a single expert trajectory, the resulting reward model enables Dopamine-RL to improve the policy from near-zero to 95% success with only 150 online rollouts (approximately 1 hour of real robot interaction), while retaining strong generalization across tasks.

We address this gap by introducing Bright-4B, a 4 billion parameter foundation model that learns on the unit hypersphere to segment subcellular structures directly from 3D brightfield volumes. Bright-4B combines a hardware-aligned Native Sparse Attention mechanism (capturing local, coarse, and selected global context), depth-width residual HyperConnections that stabilize representation flow, and a soft Mixture-of-Experts for adaptive capacity. A plug-and-play anisotropic patch embed further respects confocal point-spread and axial thinning, enabling geometry-faithful 3D tokenization.

We evaluate the generality of the framework across multiple transformer backbones, including Swin UNETR, UNETR, nnFormer, and MedFormer, using a prostate IMRT dataset.

MindWatcher can autonomously decide whether and how to invoke diverse tools and coordinate their use, without relying on human prompts or workflows. The interleaved thinking paradigm enables the model to switch between thinking and tool calling at any intermediate stage, while its multimodal CoT capability allows manipulation of images during reasoning to yield more precise search results. We implement automated data auditing and evaluation pipelines, complemented by manually curated high-quality datasets for training, and we construct a benchmark, called MindWatcher-Evaluate Bench (MWE-Bench), to evaluate its performance. MindWatcher is equipped with a comprehensive suite of auxiliary reasoning tools, enabling it to address broad-domain multimodal problems. A large-scale, high-quality local image retrieval database, covering eight categories including cars, animals, and plants, endows model with robust object recognition despite its small size. Finally, we design a more efficient training infrastructure for MindWatcher, enhancing training speed and hardware utilization.

We introduce Controllable Emotional Image Content Generation (C-EICG), which aims to generate images that remain faithful to a given content description while expressing a target emotion. Existing text-to-image models ensure content consistency but lack emotional awareness, whereas emotion-driven models generate affective results at the cost of content distortion. To address this gap, we propose EmoCtrl, supported by a dataset annotated with content, emotion, and affective prompts, bridging abstract emotions to visual cues. EmoCtrl incorporates textual and visual emotion enhancement modules that enrich affective expression via descriptive semantics and perceptual cues. The learned emotion tokens exhibit complementary effects, as demonstrated through ablations and visualizations.

A Computationally-Embedded Perspective on the Big World Hypothesis", "comment": "NeurIPS 2025 (spotlight)", "summary": "Continual learning is often motivated by the idea, known as the big world hypothesis, that \"the world is bigger\" than the agent. Recent problem formulations capture this idea by explicitly constraining an agent relative to the environment. These constraints lead to solutions in which the agent continually adapts to best use its limited capacity, rather than converging to a fixed solution. However, explicit constraints can be ad hoc, difficult to incorporate, and may limit the effectiveness of scaling up the agent's capacity. In this paper, we characterize a problem setting in which an agent, regardless of its capacity, is constrained by being embedded in the environment. In particular, we introduce a computationally-embedded perspective that represents an embedded agent as an automaton simulated within a universal (formal) computer. Such an automaton is always constrained; we prove that it is equivalent to an agent that interacts with a partially observable Markov decision process over a countably infinite state-space. We propose an objective for this setting, which we call interactivity, that measures an agent's ability to continually adapt its behaviour by learning new predictions. We then develop a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm for interactivity-seeking, and use it to construct a synthetic problem to evaluate continual learning capability. Our results show that deep nonlinear networks struggle to sustain interactivity, whereas deep linear networks sustain higher interactivity as capacity increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u5d4c\u5165\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u8bbe\u5b9a\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7b49\u6548\u4e8e\u4e0e\u65e0\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7ebf\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5bb9\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "motivation": "\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u5e38\u57fa\u4e8e\u2018\u5927\u4e16\u754c\u5047\u8bbe\u2019\uff0c\u5373\u2018\u4e16\u754c\u6bd4\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u66f4\u5927\u2019\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6765\u4f53\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u80fd\u968f\u610f\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u9650\u5236\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6548\u679c\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u5d4c\u5165\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u5728\u901a\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e2d\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u7b49\u6548\u4e8e\u4e0e\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8ffd\u6c42\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u7ef4\u6301\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7ebf\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u968f\u7740\u5bb9\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7ef4\u6301\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u96be\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7ebf\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u968f\u7740\u5bb9\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u80fd\u7ef4\u6301\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u3002"}}

To evaluate performance, structured beam dropout is simulated by removing every fourth vertical scanning beam. Extensive experiments across diverse KITTI environments, including Person, Road, Campus, and City sequences, demonstrate that SuperiorGAT consistently achieves lower reconstruction error and improved geometric consistency compared to PointNet-based models and deeper GAT baselines.

Pose-code-based frameworks such as CoMo map quantifiable pose attributes into discrete pose codes that support interpretable motion control, but their frame-wise representation struggles to capture subtle temporal dynamics and high-frequency details, often degrading reconstruction fidelity and local controllability. To address this limitation, we introduce pose-guided residual refinement for motion (PGR$^2$M), a hybrid representation that augments interpretable pose codes with residual codes learned via residual vector quantization (RVQ). A pose-guided RVQ tokenizer decomposes motion into pose latents that encode coarse global structure and residual latents that model fine-grained temporal variations.

Current event camera calibration methods typically involve using flashing patterns, reconstructing intensity images, and utilizing the features extracted from events. Existing methods are generally time-consuming and require manually placed calibration objects, which cannot meet the needs of rapidly changing scenarios. In this paper, we propose a line-based event camera calibration framework exploiting the geometric lines of commonly-encountered objects in man-made environments, e.g., doors, windows, boxes, etc. Different from previous methods, our method detects lines directly from event streams and leverages an event-line calibration model to generate the initial guess of camera parameters, which is suitable for both planar and non-planar lines. Then, a non-linear optimization is adopted to refine camera parameters. Both simulation and real-world experiments have demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of our method, with validation performed on monocular and stereo event cameras.

Despite the encouraging results, RL improvement inevitably relies on sampling successful, high-quality responses; however, the initial model often struggles to generate responses that satisfy all constraints due to its limited capabilities, yielding sparse or indistinguishable rewards that impede learning. In this work, we propose Hindsight instruction Replay (HiR), a novel sample-efficient RL framework for complex instruction following tasks, which employs a select-then-rewrite strategy to replay failed attempts as successes based on the constraints that have been satisfied in hindsight. We perform RL on these replayed samples as well as the original ones, theoretically framing the objective as dual-preference learning at both the instruction- and response-level to enable efficient optimization using only a binary reward signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed HiR yields promising results across different instruction following tasks, while requiring less computational budget.

However, practical deployment is severely limited by inherent challenges. Due to distinct imaging mechanisms, temporal asynchrony, and registration difficulties, obtaining well-aligned optical-SAR image pairs remains extremely difficult, frequently resulting in missing or degraded modality data. Although recent approaches have attempted to address this issue, they still suffer from limited robustness to random missing modalities and lack effective mechanisms to ensure consistent performance improvement in fusion-based detection. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Quality-Aware Dynamic Fusion Network (QDFNet) for robust optical-SAR object detection. Our proposed method leverages learnable reference tokens to dynamically assess feature reliability and guide adaptive fusion in the presence of missing modalities. In particular, we design a Dynamic Modality Quality Assessment (DMQA) module that employs learnable reference tokens to iteratively refine feature reliability assessment, enabling precise identification of degraded regions and providing quality guidance for subsequent fusion. Moreover, we develop an Orthogonal Constraint Normalization Fusion (OCNF) module that employs orthogonal constraints to preserve modality independence while dynamically adjusting fusion weights based on reliability scores, effectively suppressing unreliable feature propagation.

Accurately predicting startup success requires synthesizing complex relational evidence, including company disclosures, investor track records, and investment network structures, through explicit reasoning to form coherent, interpretable investment theses. Traditional machine learning and graph neural networks both lack this reasoning capability. Large language models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning but face a modality mismatch with graphs. Recent graph-LLM methods target in-graph tasks where answers lie within the graph, whereas VC prediction is off-graph: the target exists outside the network. The core challenge is selecting graph paths that maximize predictor performance on an external objective while enabling step-by-step reasoning. We present MIRAGE-VC, a multi-perspective retrieval-augmented generation framework that addresses two obstacles: path explosion (thousands of candidate paths overwhelm LLM context) and heterogeneous evidence fusion (different startups need different analytical emphasis). Our information-gain-driven path retriever iteratively selects high-value neighbors, distilling investment networks into compact chains for explicit reasoning. A multi-agent architecture integrates three evidence streams via a learnable gating mechanism based on company attributes. Under strict anti-leakage controls, MIRAGE-VC achieves +5.0% F1 and +16.6% PrecisionAt5, and sheds light on other off-graph prediction tasks such as recommendation and risk assessment.

However, LLMs are fundamentally limited by the ``Artificial Hivemind'' effect, where they generate similar responses within the same model and produce homogeneous outputs across different models. As a consequence, students may be exposed to overly similar and repetitive LLM-generated problems, which harms diversity of thought. Drawing inspiration from Wallas's theory of creativity and Guilford's framework of divergent-convergent thinking, we propose CreativeDC, a two-phase prompting method that explicitly scaffolds the LLM's reasoning into distinct phases. By decoupling creative exploration from constraint satisfaction, our method enables LLMs to explore a broader space of ideas before committing to a final problem. We evaluate CreativeDC for creative problem generation using a comprehensive set of metrics that capture diversity, novelty, and utility. The results show that CreativeDC achieves significantly higher diversity and novelty compared to baselines while maintaining high utility. Moreover, scaling analysis shows that CreativeDC generates a larger effective number of distinct problems as more are sampled, increasing at a faster rate than baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "CreativeDC\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u63d0\u793a\u63d0\u5347LLM\u751f\u6210\u6559\u80b2\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u540c\u8d28\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b66\u751f\u601d\u7ef4\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u53d7Wallas\u521b\u9020\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u548cGuilford\u53d1\u6563-\u6536\u655b\u601d\u7ef4\u6846\u67b6\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u95ee\u9898\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CreativeDC\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u4e3a\u521b\u9020\u6027\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "CreativeDC\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u7740\u91c7\u6837\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u72ec\u7279\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "CreativeDC\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u63d0\u793a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u65b0\u9896\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6559\u80b2\u6750\u6599\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Indeed, the assets at these substations (e.g., transformers) are prone to disruption from many hazards, including hurricanes, flooding, earthquakes, and geomagnetically induced currents (GICs). As electrical grids are considered critical national infrastructure, any failure can have significant economic and public safety implications. To help prevent and mitigate these failures, it is thus essential that we identify key substation components to quantify vulnerability. Unfortunately, traditional manual mapping of substation infrastructure is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, an autonomous solution utilizing computer vision models is preferable, as it allows for greater convenience and efficiency. In this research paper, we train and compare the outputs of 3 models (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, RF-DETR) on a manually labeled dataset of US substation images. Each model is evaluated for detection accuracy, precision, and efficiency. We present the key strengths and limitations of each model, identifying which provides reliable and large-scale substation component mapping.

Assaad"], "title": "Regret-Based Federated Causal Discovery with Unknown Interventions", "comment": null, "summary": "Most causal discovery methods recover a completed partially directed acyclic graph representing a Markov equivalence class from observational data. Recent work has extended these methods to federated settings to address data decentralization and privacy constraints, but often under idealized assumptions that all clients share the same causal model. Such assumptions are unrealistic in practice, as client-specific policies or protocols, for example, across hospitals, naturally induce heterogeneous and unknown interventions. In this work, we address federated causal discovery under unknown client-level interventions.

However, significant challenges are posed by the fast, uneven propagation of shock waves and unstable testing conditions. To address these challenges, a novel framework is proposed that utilizes multiple event cameras to estimate the asymmetry of shock waves, leveraging its high-speed and high-dynamic range capabilities. Initially, a polar coordinate system is established, which encodes events to reveal shock wave propagation patterns, with adaptive region-of-interest (ROI) extraction through event offset calculations. Subsequently, shock wave front events are extracted using iterative slope analysis, exploiting the continuity of velocity changes. Finally, the geometric model of events and shock wave motion parameters is derived according to event-based optical imaging model, along with the 3D reconstruction model. Through the above process, multi-angle shock wave measurement, motion field reconstruction, and explosive equivalence inversion are achieved. The results of the speed measurement are compared with those of the pressure sensors and the empirical formula, revealing a maximum error of 5.20% and a minimum error of 0.06%.

Existing approaches sit at two extremes: conventional web frameworks provide reliable but fixed contexts backed by databases, while fully generative world models aim for unlimited environments at the expense of controllability and practical engineering. In this work, we introduce the Web World Model (WWM), a middle ground where world state and ``physics'' are implemented in ordinary web code to ensure logical consistency, while large language models generate context, narratives, and high-level decisions on top of this structured latent state. We build a suite of WWMs on a realistic web stack, including an infinite travel atlas grounded in real geography, fictional galaxy explorers, web-scale encyclopedic and narrative worlds, and simulation- and game-like environments. Across these systems, we identify practical design principles for WWMs: separating code-defined rules from model-driven imagination, representing latent state as typed web interfaces, and utilizing deterministic generation to achieve unlimited but structured exploration. Our results suggest that web stacks themselves can serve as a scalable substrate for world models, enabling controllable yet open-ended environments.

With negligible increase in parameters and computation, our model achieves 69.7% mAP and 72.1% NDS on the nuScenes validation set, improving the baseline by 5.0% and 2.7%, respectively.

These models rely mainly on text prompts for instruction-based editing and generation, but language often fails to capture users intended edit locations and fine-grained visual details. To this end, we propose two tasks: scribble-based editing and generation, that enables more flexible creation on graphical user interface (GUI) combining user textual, images, and freehand sketches. We introduce DreamOmni3, tackling two challenges: data creation and framework design. Our data synthesis pipeline includes two parts: scribble-based editing and generation. For scribble-based editing, we define four tasks: scribble and instruction-based editing, scribble and multimodal instruction-based editing, image fusion, and doodle editing. Based on DreamOmni2 dataset, we extract editable regions and overlay hand-drawn boxes, circles, doodles or cropped image to construct training data. For scribble-based generation, we define three tasks: scribble and instruction-based generation, scribble and multimodal instruction-based generation, and doodle generation, following similar data creation pipelines. For the framework, instead of using binary masks, which struggle with complex edits involving multiple scribbles, images, and instructions, we propose a joint input scheme that feeds both the original and scribbled source images into the model, using different colors to distinguish regions and simplify processing. By applying the same index and position encodings to both images, the model can precisely localize scribbled regions while maintaining accurate editing. Finally, we establish comprehensive benchmarks for these tasks to promote further research.

We propose CoAgent, a collaborative and closed-loop framework for coherent video generation that formulates the process as a plan-synthesize-verify pipeline. Given a user prompt, style reference, and pacing constraints, a Storyboard Planner decomposes the input into structured shot-level plans with explicit entities, spatial relations, and temporal cues. A Global Context Manager maintains entity-level memory to preserve appearance and identity consistency across shots. Each shot is then generated by a Synthesis Module under the guidance of a Visual Consistency Controller, while a Verifier Agent evaluates intermediate results using vision-language reasoning and triggers selective regeneration when inconsistencies are detected.

Five self-referential cues -- semantic alignment, lexical fidelity, non-redundancy, visual grounding, and step consistency -- are integrated into a normalized, reliability-weighted reward that provides fine-grained process-level guidance.

In this work, we present a novel framework for personalized 3D talking head animation, namely \"PTalker\". This framework preserves speaking style through style disentanglement from audio and facial motion sequences and enhances lip-synchronization accuracy through a three-level alignment mechanism between audio and mesh modalities. Specifically, to effectively disentangle style and content, we design disentanglement constraints that encode driven audio and motion sequences into distinct style and content spaces to enhance speaking style representation. To improve lip-synchronization accuracy, we adopt a modality alignment mechanism incorporating three aspects: spatial alignment using Graph Attention Networks to capture vertex connectivity in the 3D mesh structure, temporal alignment using cross-attention to capture and synchronize temporal dependencies, and feature alignment by top-k bidirectional contrastive losses and KL divergence constraints to ensure consistency between speech and mesh modalities.

Existing methods employ the Jaccard similarity coefficient instead of the cosine distance to enhance the measurement accuracy. However, these methods introduce too many irrelevant nodes, producing Jaccard coefficients with limited discriminative power and adversely affecting clustering performance. To address this issue, we propose a prediction-driven Top-K Jaccard similarity coefficient that enhances the purity of neighboring nodes, thereby improving the reliability of similarity measurements. Nevertheless, accurately predicting the optimal number of neighbors (Top-K) remains challenging, leading to suboptimal clustering results. To overcome this limitation, we develop a Transformer-based prediction model that examines the relationships between the central node and its neighboring nodes near the Top-K to further enhance the reliability of similarity estimation. However, vanilla Transformer, when applied to predict relationships between nodes, often introduces noise due to their overemphasis on irrelevant feature relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a Sparse Differential Transformer (SDT), instead of the vanilla Transformer, to eliminate noise and enhance the model's anti-noise capabilities.

In this work, we investigate the potential of constructing Vision-Language Models upon diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) to overcome these limitations. We introduce Dream-VL, an open diffusion-based VLM (dVLM) that achieves state-of-the-art performance among previous dVLMs. Dream-VL is comparable to top-tier AR-based VLMs trained on open data on various benchmarks but exhibits superior potential when applied to visual planning tasks. Building upon Dream-VL, we introduce Dream-VLA, a dLLM-based Vision-Language-Action model (dVLA) developed through continuous pre-training on open robotic datasets. We demonstrate that the natively bidirectional nature of this diffusion backbone serves as a superior foundation for VLA tasks, inherently suited for action chunking and parallel generation, leading to significantly faster convergence in downstream fine-tuning.

Recent methods built upon Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) have demonstrated strong performance by refining how past observations are stored and reused. However, existing approaches address memory limitations in a method-specific manner, leaving the broader design principles of memory in SAM-based tracking poorly understood. Moreover, it remains unclear how these memory mechanisms transfer to stronger, next-generation foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3). In this work, we present a systematic memory-centric study of SAM-based visual object tracking. We first analyze representative SAM2-based trackers and show that most methods primarily differ in how short-term memory frames are selected, while sharing a common object-centric representation. Building on this insight, we faithfully reimplement these memory mechanisms within the SAM3 framework and conduct large-scale evaluations across ten diverse benchmarks, enabling a controlled analysis of memory design independent of backbone strength. Guided by our empirical findings, we propose a unified hybrid memory framework that explicitly decomposes memory into short-term appearance memory and long-term distractor-resolving memory. This decomposition enables the integration of existing memory policies in a modular and principled manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under long-term occlusion, complex motion, and distractor-heavy scenarios on both SAM2 and SAM3 backbones.

Video diffusion models, through their image-to-video generation capability, provide a promising foundation for such visual imagination. However, existing approaches are largely forward predictive, generating trajectories conditioned on the initial observation without explicit goal modeling, thus often leading to spatial drift and goal misalignment. To address these challenges, we propose Envision, a diffusion-based framework that performs visual planning for embodied agents. By explicitly constraining the generation with a goal image, our method enforces physical plausibility and goal consistency throughout the generated trajectory. Specifically, Envision operates in two stages. First, a Goal Imagery Model identifies task-relevant regions, performs region-aware cross attention between the scene and the instruction, and synthesizes a coherent goal image that captures the desired outcome. Then, an Env-Goal Video Model, built upon a first-and-last-frame-conditioned video diffusion model (FL2V), interpolates between the initial observation and the goal image, producing smooth and physically plausible video trajectories that connect the start and goal states. Experiments on object manipulation and image editing benchmarks demonstrate that Envision achieves superior goal alignment, spatial consistency, and object preservation compared to baselines. The resulting visual plans can directly support downstream robotic planning and control, providing reliable guidance for embodied agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "Envision \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u4e14\u76ee\u6807\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u524d\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7a7a\u95f4\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002Envision \u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "Envision \u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8eFL2V\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u64cd\u7eb5\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cEnvision \u5728\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u4fdd\u6301\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Envision \u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea6\u675f\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u89c4\u5212\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Motivated by this, adapting RLHF for Image Super-Resolution (ISR) tasks has shown promise in optimizing perceptual quality with Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model as reward models. However, the traditional IQA model usually output a single global score, which are exceptionally insensitive to local and fine-grained distortions. This insensitivity allows ISR models to produce perceptually undesirable artifacts that yield spurious high scores, misaligning optimization objectives with perceptual quality and results in reward hacking. To address this, we propose a Fine-grained Perceptual Reward Model (FinPercep-RM) based on an Encoder-Decoder architecture. While providing a global quality score, it also generates a Perceptual Degradation Map that spatially localizes and quantifies local defects. We specifically introduce the FGR-30k dataset to train this model, consisting of diverse and subtle distortions from real-world super-resolution models. Despite the success of the FinPercep-RM model, its complexity introduces significant challenges in generator policy learning, leading to training instability. To address this, we propose a Co-evolutionary Curriculum Learning (CCL) mechanism, where both the reward model and the ISR model undergo synchronized curricula. The reward model progressively increases in complexity, while the ISR model starts with a simpler global reward for rapid convergence, gradually transitioning to the more complex model outputs. This easy-to-hard strategy enables stable training while suppressing reward hacking. Experiments validates the effectiveness of our method across ISR models in both global quality and local realism on RLHF methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFinPercep-RM\u548cCCL\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f18\u5316ISR\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfIQA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5931\u771f\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfIQA\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5931\u771f\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4ISR\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u611f\u77e5\u4e0d\u826f\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u5956\u52b1\u5206\u6570\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u7b26\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eEncoder-Decoder\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08FinPercep-RM\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165FGR-30k\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CCL\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u589e\u52a0\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "FinPercep-RM\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u5168\u5c40\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u6570\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u9000\u5316\u5730\u56fe\uff0cCCL\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8eRLHF\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684ISR\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Echocardiography, as a readily accessible and non-invasive imaging modality, is widely used in clinical practice to estimate LVEF. However, manual assessment of cardiac function from echocardiograms is time-consuming and subject to considerable inter-observer variability. Deep learning approaches offer a promising alternative, with the potential to achieve performance comparable to that of experienced human experts. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of several deep learning architectures for LVEF estimation from echocardiography videos, including 3D Inception, two-stream, and CNN-RNN models. We systematically evaluate architectural modifications and fusion strategies to identify configurations that maximize prediction accuracy. Models were trained and evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, comprising 10,030 echocardiogram videos. Our results demonstrate that modified 3D Inception architectures achieve the best overall performance, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 6.79%. Across architectures, we observe a tendency toward overfitting, with smaller and simpler models generally exhibiting improved generalization. Model performance was also found to be highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, particularly convolutional kernel sizes and normalization strategies. While this study focuses on echocardiography-based LVEF estimation, the insights gained regarding architectural design and training strategies may be applicable to a broader range of medical and non-medical video analysis tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u7528\u4e8e\u8d85\u58f0\u5fc3\u52a8\u56fe\u89c6\u9891\u7684LVEF\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6539\u8fdb\u76843D Inception\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f73\uff08RMSE 6.79%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u4e14\u5bf9\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u7ed3\u8bba\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u666e\u9002\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d85\u58f0\u5fc3\u52a8\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u6210\u50cf\u6280\u672f\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8eLVEF\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f46\u624b\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u671b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e863D Inception\u3001\u53cc\u6d41\u548cCNN-RNN\u7b49\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\u548c\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5305\u542b10,030\u4e2a\u8d85\u58f0\u5fc3\u52a8\u56fe\u89c6\u9891\u7684EchoNet-Dynamic\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6539\u8fdb\u76843D Inception\u67b6\u6784\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff08RMSE 6.79%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u6240\u6709\u67b6\u6784\u5747\u663e\u793a\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u8f83\u5c0f\u4e14\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u5377\u79ef\u6838\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7b49\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6539\u8fdb\u76843D Inception\u67b6\u6784\u5728LVEF\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0cRMSE\u4e3a6.79%\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u53ca\u5bf9\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u5177\u6709\u53c2\u8003\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, numerous downstream tasks in specialized and data-limited scientific domains continue to pose significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel Cluster Attention Adapter (CLAdapter), which refines and adapts the rich representations learned from large-scale data to various data-limited downstream tasks. Specifically, CLAdapter introduces attention mechanisms and cluster centers to personalize the enhancement of transformed features through distribution correlation and transformation matrices. This enables models fine-tuned with CLAdapter to learn distinct representations tailored to different feature sets, facilitating the models' adaptation from rich pre-trained features to various downstream scenarios effectively. In addition, CLAdapter's unified interface design allows for seamless integration with multiple model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers, in both 2D and 3D contexts. Through extensive experiments on 10 datasets spanning domains such as generic, multimedia, biological, medical, industrial, agricultural, environmental, geographical, materials science, out-of-distribution (OOD), and 3D analysis, CLAdapter achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse data-limited scientific domains, demonstrating its effectiveness in unleashing the potential of foundation vision models via adaptive transfer.

Our method exploits the potential of continuous-depth networks in the Neural ODE paradigm with structural descriptors, widely adopted as modality-agnostic metric models which exploit self-similarities on parameterized neighborhood geometries. We propose three different variants that integrate image-based or feature-based structural descriptors and nonstructural image similarities computed by local mutual information.

With better training data that is diverse and covers a wide range of situations, including long-tailed driving scenarios, autonomous driving models can become more robust and safer. This motivates a unified simulation framework that can jointly handle realistic integration of inserted 3D assets and NVS. Recent 3D asset reconstruction methods enable reconstruction of dynamic actors from video, supporting their re-insertion into simulated driving scenes. While the overall structure and appearance can be accurate, it still struggles to capture the realism of 3D assets through lighting or shadows, particularly when inserted into scenes. In parallel, recent advances in NVS methods have demonstrated promising results in synthesizing viewpoints beyond the originally recorded trajectories. However, existing approaches largely treat asset insertion and NVS capabilities in isolation. To allow for interaction with the rest of the scene and to enable more diverse creation of new scenarios for training, realistic 3D asset insertion should be combined with NVS. To address this, we present SCPainter (Street Car Painter), a unified framework which integrates 3D Gaussian Splat (GS) car asset representations and 3D scene point clouds with diffusion-based generation to jointly enable realistic 3D asset insertion and NVS. The 3D GS assets and 3D scene point clouds are projected together into novel views, and these projections are used to condition a diffusion model to generate high quality images.

Automated detection can increase reproducibility and support scalable early screening programs, but supervised deep learning methods are limited by small labelled datasets. This study assesses whether ultrasound-specific self-supervised pretraining can facilitate accurate, robust deep learning detection of cystic hygroma in first-trimester ultrasound images. We fine-tuned the Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), pretrained on over 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images, for binary classification of normal controls and cystic hygroma cases used in this study. Performance was evaluated on the same curated ultrasound dataset, preprocessing pipeline, and 4-fold cross-validation protocol as for the DenseNet-169 baseline, using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). Model interpretability was analyzed qualitatively using Score-CAM visualizations. USF-MAE outperformed the DenseNet-169 baseline on all evaluation metrics. The proposed model yielded a mean accuracy of 0.96, sensitivity of 0.94, specificity of 0.98, and ROC-AUC of 0.98 compared to 0.93, 0.92, 0.94, and 0.94 for the DenseNet-169 baseline, respectively.

Recent methods achieve this by lifting video segmentation results to a 4D representation through differentiable rendering techniques. Therefore, they heavily rely on the quality of video segmentation maps, which are often unstable, leading to unreliable reconstruction results. To overcome this challenge, our key idea is to represent the decomposed 4D scene with the Freetime FeatureGS and design a streaming feature learning strategy to accurately recover it from per-image segmentation maps, eliminating the need for video segmentation. Freetime FeatureGS models the dynamic scene as a set of Gaussian primitives with learnable features and linear motion ability, allowing them to move to neighboring regions over time. We apply a contrastive loss to Freetime FeatureGS, forcing primitive features to be close or far apart based on whether their projections belong to the same instance in the 2D segmentation map. As our Gaussian primitives can move across time, it naturally extends the feature learning to the temporal dimension, achieving 4D segmentation. Furthermore, we sample observations for training in a temporally ordered manner, enabling the streaming propagation of features over time and effectively avoiding local minima during the optimization process. Experimental results on several datasets show that the reconstruction quality of our method outperforms recent methods by a large margin.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFreetime FeatureGS\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u5355\u5e27\u5206\u5272\u56fe\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf4D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u5206\u5272\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6d88\u9664\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u5e27\u5206\u5272\u56fe\u5b9e\u73b04D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFreetime FeatureGS\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u8fd0\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u548c\u6d41\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165Freetime FeatureGS\u548c\u6d41\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e864D\u573a\u666f\u5206\u89e3\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

However, existing methods often overlook scenarios involving long context inputs with multiple images. In this paper, we analyze the challenges of visual token pruning in long context, multi-image settings and introduce an adaptive pruning method tailored for such scenarios. We decompose redundancy into intra-image and inter-image components and quantify them through intra-image diversity and inter-image variation, which jointly guide dynamic budget allocation. Our approach consists of two stages. The intra-image stage allocates each image a content-aware token budget and greedily selects its most representative tokens. The inter-image stage performs global diversity filtering to form a candidate pool and then applies a Pareto selection procedure that balances diversity with text alignment.

Although effective, we observe that such similarity distributions across grades usually exhibit multimodal patterns. For instance, an image embedding may show high similarity to both \"excellent\" and \"poor\" grade descriptions while deviating from the \"good\" one. We refer to this phenomenon as \"semantic drift\", where semantic inconsistencies between text embeddings and their intended descriptions undermine the reliability of text-image shared-space learning. To mitigate this issue, we draw inspiration from psychometrics and propose an improved Graded Response Model (GRM) for AGIQA. The GRM is a classical assessment model that categorizes a subject's ability across grades using test items with various difficulty levels. This paradigm aligns remarkably well with human quality rating, where image quality can be interpreted as an image's ability to meet various quality grades. Building on this philosophy, we design a two-branch quality grading module: one branch estimates image ability while the other constructs multiple difficulty levels. To ensure monotonicity in difficulty levels, we further model difficulty generation in an arithmetic manner, which inherently enforces a unimodal and interpretable quality distribution. Our Arithmetic GRM based Quality Grading (AGQG) module enjoys a plug-and-play advantage, consistently improving performance when integrated into various state-of-the-art AGIQA frameworks.

Existing solver-based acceleration methods often face significant image quality degradation under a low-latency budget, primarily due to accumulated truncation errors arising from the inability to capture high-curvature trajectory segments. In this paper, we propose the Ensemble Parallel Direction solver (dubbed as EPD-Solver), a novel ODE solver that mitigates these errors by incorporating multiple parallel gradient evaluations in each step. Motivated by the geometric insight that sampling trajectories are largely confined to a low-dimensional manifold, EPD-Solver leverages the Mean Value Theorem for vector-valued functions to approximate the integral solution more accurately. Importantly, since the additional gradient computations are independent, they can be fully parallelized, preserving low-latency sampling nature. We introduce a two-stage optimization framework. Initially, EPD-Solver optimizes a small set of learnable parameters via a distillation-based approach. We further propose a parameter-efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning scheme that reformulates the solver as a stochastic Dirichlet policy. Unlike traditional methods that fine-tune the massive backbone, our RL approach operates strictly within the low-dimensional solver space, effectively mitigating reward hacking while enhancing performance in complex text-to-image (T2I) generation tasks.

While global search improves robustness and reduces drift, it also introduces distractions from visually or semantically similar objects. To address this, we propose a location-aware visual prompting mechanism that incorporates spatial priors into the MLLM. Specifically, we construct a region-level prompt based on the target's previous location, enabling the model to prioritize region-level recognition and resort to global inference only when necessary. This design retains the advantages of global tracking while effectively suppressing interference from distracting visual content. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly enhances tracking stability and target disambiguation under challenging scenarios, opening a new avenue for integrating MLLMs into visual tracking.

However, while extensively studied in indoor settings, its zero-shot generalization to open-world domains lags far behind perspective images, which benefit from abundant training data. This disparity makes transferring capabilities from the perspective domain an attractive solution. To bridge this gap, we present Depth Anything in $360^\\circ$ (DA360), a panoramic-adapted version of Depth Anything V2. Our key innovation involves learning a shift parameter from the ViT backbone, transforming the model's scale- and shift-invariant output into a scale-invariant estimate that directly yields well-formed 3D point clouds. This is complemented by integrating circular padding into the DPT decoder to eliminate seam artifacts, ensuring spatially coherent depth maps that respect spherical continuity. Evaluated on standard indoor benchmarks and our newly curated outdoor dataset, Metropolis, DA360 shows substantial gains over its base model, achieving over 50\\% and 10\\% relative depth error reduction on indoor and outdoor benchmarks, respectively.

Existing interpretable SR approaches, whether based on prior learning or deep unfolding optimization frameworks, typically rely on black-box deep networks to model latent variables, which leaves the degradation process largely unknown and uncontrollable. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem (KAT), we for the first time propose a novel interpretable operator, termed Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Operator (KANO), with the application to image SR. KANO provides a transparent and structured representation of the latent degradation fitting process. Specifically, we employ an additive structure composed of a finite number of B-spline functions to approximate continuous spectral curves in a piecewise fashion. By learning and optimizing the shape parameters of these spline functions within defined intervals, our KANO accurately captures key spectral characteristics, such as local linear trends and the peak-valley structures at nonlinear inflection points, thereby endowing SR results with physical interpretability. Furthermore, through theoretical modeling and experimental evaluations across natural images, aerial photographs, and satellite remote sensing data, we systematically compare multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) in handling complex sequence fitting tasks.

The vertical direction of camera views can be obtained by IMU measurements. The relative pose between two cameras is reduced from 5DOF to 3DOF. We propose a new solver to estimate the 3DOF relative pose and focal length. First, we establish constraint equations from two affine correspondences when the vertical direction is known. Then, based on the properties of the equation system with nontrivial solutions, four equations can be derived. These four equations only involve two parameters: the focal length and the relative rotation angle.

However, in medical imaging, the key foundation lies in human anatomy, as these images directly represent the internal structures of the body, reflecting the consistency, coherence, and hierarchy of human anatomy. Yet, existing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often overlook these perspectives, limiting their ability to effectively learn anatomical features. To overcome the limitation, we built Lamps (learning anatomy from multiple perspectives via self-supervision) pre-trained on large-scale chest radiographs by harmoniously utilizing the consistency, coherence, and hierarchy of human anatomy as the supervision signal. Extensive experiments across 10 datasets evaluated through fine-tuning and emergent property analysis demonstrate Lamps' superior robustness, transferability, and clinical potential when compared to 10 baseline models.

Existing methods typically address this issue by annotating potential spurious attributes, or filtering spurious features based on some empirical assumptions (e.g., simplicity of bias). However, these methods may yield unsatisfactory performance due to the intricate and elusive nature of spurious correlations in real-world data. In this paper, we propose a data-oriented approach to mitigate the spurious correlation in deep learning models. We observe that samples that are influenced by spurious features tend to exhibit a dispersed distribution in the learned feature space. This allows us to identify the presence of spurious features. Subsequently, we obtain a bias-invariant representation by neutralizing the spurious features based on a simple grouping strategy. Then, we learn a feature transformation to eliminate the spurious features by aligning with this bias-invariant representation. Finally, we update the classifier by incorporating the learned feature transformation and obtain an unbiased model. By integrating the aforementioned identifying, neutralizing, eliminating and updating procedures, we build an effective pipeline for mitigating spurious correlation.

However, existing approaches primarily focus on erasing concepts from text prompts, overlooking other input modalities that are increasingly critical in real-world applications such as image editing and personalized generation. These modalities can become attack surfaces, where erased concepts re-emerge despite defenses. To bridge this gap, we introduce M-ErasureBench, a novel multimodal evaluation framework that systematically benchmarks concept erasure methods across three input modalities: text prompts, learned embeddings, and inverted latents. For the latter two, we evaluate both white-box and black-box access, yielding five evaluation scenarios. Our analysis shows that existing methods achieve strong erasure performance against text prompts but largely fail under learned embeddings and inverted latents, with Concept Reproduction Rate (CRR) exceeding 90% in the white-box setting. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose IRECE (Inference-time Robustness Enhancement for Concept Erasure), a plug-and-play module that localizes target concepts via cross-attention and perturbs the associated latents during denoising. Experiments demonstrate that IRECE consistently restores robustness, reducing CRR by up to 40% under the most challenging white-box latent inversion scenario, while preserving visual quality. To the best of our knowledge, M-ErasureBench provides the first comprehensive benchmark of concept erasure beyond text prompts.

However, most existing 3D segmentation frameworks rely exclusively on visual learning from large annotated datasets restricting their adaptability to new domains and clinical tasks. The lack of semantic understanding in these models makes them ineffective in addressing flexible, user-defined segmentation objectives. To overcome these limitations, we propose SwinTF3D, a lightweight multimodal fusion approach that unifies visual and linguistic representations for text-guided 3D medical image segmentation. The model employs a transformer-based visual encoder to extract volumetric features and integrates them with a compact text encoder via an efficient fusion mechanism. This design allows the system to understand natural-language prompts and correctly align semantic cues with their corresponding spatial structures in medical volumes, while producing accurate, context-aware segmentation results with low computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the BTCV dataset demonstrate that SwinTF3D achieves competitive Dice and IoU scores across multiple organs, despite its compact architecture. The model generalizes well to unseen data and offers significant efficiency gains compared to conventional transformer-based segmentation networks.

However, their effectiveness is critically limited when combined with standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). We identify a fundamental limitation: CFG's extrapolative nature systematically pushes the sampling path off the data manifold, causing the approximation error to diverge and undermining the refinement process. To address this, we propose Guided Path Sampling (GPS), a new paradigm for iterative refinement. GPS replaces unstable extrapolation with a principled, manifold-constrained interpolation, ensuring the sampling path remains on the data manifold. We theoretically prove that this correction transforms the error series from unbounded amplification to strictly bounded, guaranteeing stability. Furthermore, we devise an optimal scheduling strategy that dynamically adjusts guidance strength, aligning semantic injection with the model's natural coarse-to-fine generation process. Extensive experiments on modern backbones like SDXL and Hunyuan-DiT show that GPS outperforms existing methods in both perceptual quality and complex prompt adherence. For instance, GPS achieves a superior ImageReward of 0.79 and HPS v2 of 0.2995 on SDXL, while improving overall semantic alignment accuracy on GenEval to 57.45%.

This leads to redundant storage and transmission overhead. In this work, we propose a hash grid feature pruning method that identifies and prunes invalid features based on the coordinates of the input Gaussian splats, so that only the valid features are encoded. This approach reduces the storage size of the hash grid without compromising model performance, leading to improved rate-distortion performance.

Traditional modular pipelines separate perception, prediction, and planning, while recent end-to-end (E2E) systems learn them jointly. Vision-language models (VLMs) further enrich this paradigm by introducing cross-modal priors and commonsense reasoning, yet current VLM-based planners face three key challenges: (i) a mismatch between discrete text reasoning and continuous control, (ii) high latency from autoregressive chain-of-thought decoding, and (iii) inefficient or non-causal planners that limit real-time deployment. We propose ColaVLA, a unified vision-language-action framework that transfers reasoning from text to a unified latent space and couples it with a hierarchical, parallel trajectory decoder. The Cognitive Latent Reasoner compresses scene understanding into compact, decision-oriented meta-action embeddings through ego-adaptive selection and only two VLM forward passes.

Existing detection methods typically allocate computational resources uniformly, failing to adaptively focus on these density-concentrated regions, which hinders feature learning effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose the Dense Region Mining Network (DRMNet), which leverages density maps as explicit spatial priors to guide adaptive feature learning. First, we design a Density Generation Branch (DGB) to model object distribution patterns, providing quantifiable priors that guide the network toward dense regions. Second, to address the computational bottleneck of global attention, our Dense Area Focusing Module (DAFM) uses these density maps to identify and focus on dense areas, enabling efficient local-global feature interaction. Finally, to mitigate feature degradation during hierarchical extraction, we introduce a Dual Filter Fusion Module (DFFM). It disentangles multi-scale features into high- and low-frequency components using a discrete cosine transform and then performs density-guided cross-attention to enhance complementarity while suppressing background interference.

In this paper, we first identify three primary types of knowledge conflicts that contribute to catastrophic forgetting in YOLO-based incremental detectors: foreground-background confusion, parameter interference, and misaligned knowledge distillation. Subsequently, we introduce YOLO-IOD, a real-time Incremental Object Detection (IOD) framework that is constructed upon the pretrained YOLO-World model, facilitating incremental learning via a stage-wise parameter-efficient fine-tuning process. Specifically, YOLO-IOD encompasses three principal components: 1) Conflict-Aware Pseudo-Label Refinement (CPR), which mitigates the foreground-background confusion by leveraging the confidence levels of pseudo labels and identifying potential objects relevant to future tasks. 2) Importancebased Kernel Selection (IKS), which identifies and updates the pivotal convolution kernels pertinent to the current task during the current learning stage. 3) Cross-Stage Asymmetric Knowledge Distillation (CAKD), which addresses the misaligned knowledge distillation conflict by transmitting the features of the student target detector through the detection heads of both the previous and current teacher detectors, thereby facilitating asymmetric distillation between existing and newly introduced categories.

To address these limitations, we propose ReamCamo, a unified out-painting based framework for realistic camouflaged image generation. ReamCamo explicitly introduces additional layout controls to regulate global image structure, thereby improving semantic coherence between foreground objects and generated backgrounds. Moreover, we construct a multi-modal textual-visual condition by combining a unified fine-grained textual task description with texture-oriented background retrieval, which jointly guides the generation process to enhance visual fidelity and realism.

Existing methods rely on a pre-defined Object Lookup Table (OLT) to query Visual Language Models (VLMs) for reasoning about object locations, which limits the applications in scenarios with undefined or unforeseen targets. To address this problem, we present OpenGround, a novel zero-shot framework for open-world 3D visual grounding. Central to OpenGround is the Active Cognition-based Reasoning (ACR) module, which is designed to overcome the fundamental limitation of pre-defined OLTs by progressively augmenting the cognitive scope of VLMs. The ACR module performs human-like perception of the target via a cognitive task chain and actively reasons about contextually relevant objects, thereby extending VLM cognition through a dynamically updated OLT. This allows OpenGround to function with both pre-defined and open-world categories. We also propose a new dataset named OpenTarget, which contains over 7000 object-description pairs to evaluate our method in open-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OpenGround achieves competitive performance on Nr3D, state-of-the-art on ScanRefer, and delivers a substantial 17.6% improvement on OpenTarget.

However, current methods have two key bottlenecks. On one hand, they struggle to process diagnostic and descriptive texts simultaneously, making it difficult to identify lesions and establish associations with image regions. On the other hand, existing approaches focus on lesions description and fail to capture positional constraints, leading to critical deviations. Specifically, with the text \"in the left lower lung\", the segmentation results may incorrectly cover both sides of the lung. To address the limitations, we propose the Spatial-aware Symmetric Alignment (SSA) framework to enhance the capacity of referring hybrid medical texts consisting of locational, descriptive, and diagnostic information. Specifically, we propose symmetric optimal transport alignment mechanism to strengthen the associations between image regions and multiple relevant expressions, which establishes bi-directional fine-grained multimodal correspondences. In addition, we devise a composite directional guidance strategy that explicitly introduces spatial constraints in the text by constructing region-level guidance masks.

However, existing prompt-based methods for removing or modifying identity-specific features rely either on the subject being well-represented in the pre-trained model or require model fine-tuning for specific identities. In this work, we analyze the identity generation process and introduce a reverse personalization framework for face anonymization. Our approach leverages conditional diffusion inversion, allowing direct manipulation of images without using text prompts. To generalize beyond subjects in the model's training data, we incorporate an identity-guided conditioning branch. Unlike prior anonymization methods, which lack control over facial attributes, our framework supports attribute-controllable anonymization. We demonstrate that our method achieves a state-of-the-art balance between identity removal, attribute preservation, and image quality.

Foundation models for medical image segmentation (MedSAM) provide an opportunity to introduce anatomically grounded priors that may improve robustness and interpretability in CXR analysis. We propose a segmentation-guided CXR classification pipeline that integrates MedSAM as a lung region extraction module prior to multi-label abnormality classification. MedSAM is fine-tuned using a public image-mask dataset from Airlangga University Hospital. We then apply it to a curated subset of the public NIH CXR dataset to train and evaluate deep convolutional neural networks for multi-label prediction of five abnormalities (Mass, Nodule, Pneumonia, Edema, and Fibrosis), with the normal case (No Finding) evaluated via a derived score. Experiments show that MedSAM produces anatomically plausible lung masks across diverse imaging conditions. We find that masking effects are both task-dependent and architecture-dependent. ResNet50 trained on original images achieves the strongest overall abnormality discrimination, while loose lung masking yields comparable macro AUROC but significantly improves No Finding discrimination, indicating a trade-off between abnormality-specific classification and normal case screening. Tight masking consistently reduces abnormality level performance but improves training efficiency. Loose masking partially mitigates this degradation by preserving perihilar and peripheral context. These results suggest that lung masking should be treated as a controllable spatial prior selected to match the backbone and clinical objective, rather than applied uniformly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408MedSAM\u5206\u5272\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684CXR\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u80ba\u90e8\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5e94\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7edf\u4e00\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7b5b\u67e5\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "CXR\u6210\u50cf\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u7b5b\u67e5\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u80ba\u90e8\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u4f46\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u75be\u75c5\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f31\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u76d1\u7763\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08MedSAM\uff09\u4e3a\u5f15\u5165\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u5148\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8CXR\u5206\u6790\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5272\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684CXR\u5206\u7c7b\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e86MedSAM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u80ba\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u7c7b\u3002MedSAM\u4f7f\u7528Airlangga\u5927\u5b66\u533b\u9662\u7684\u516c\u5171\u56fe\u50cf-\u63a9\u7801\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eNIH CXR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7cbe\u9009\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7528\u4e8e\u4e94\u79cd\u5f02\u5e38\uff08Mass\u3001Nodule\u3001Pneumonia\u3001Edema\u548cFibrosis\uff09\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMedSAM\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6210\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u7684\u80ba\u90e8\u63a9\u7801\u3002\u63a9\u7801\u6548\u679c\u65e2\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e5f\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u67b6\u6784\u3002ResNet50\u5728\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u5bbd\u677e\u7684\u80ba\u90e8\u63a9\u7801\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u6bd4\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2AUROC\uff0c\u4f46\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6b63\u5e38\u75c5\u4f8b\u7684\u7b5b\u67e5\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5f02\u5e38\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u6b63\u5e38\u75c5\u4f8b\u7b5b\u67e5\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u3002\u7d27\u5bc6\u63a9\u7801\u4e00\u81f4\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5f02\u5e38\u7ea7\u522b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5bbd\u677e\u63a9\u7801\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u7559\u80ba\u95e8\u548c\u5468\u56f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u90e8\u5206\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u9000\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u80ba\u90e8\u906e\u7f69\u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u76ee\u6807\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7edf\u4e00\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Current generative models typically operate in the global pixel domain or rely on binary masks, these paradigms often suffer from feature entanglement, leading to corrupted anatomical substrates or structural discontinuities. PathoSyn addresses these limitations by decomposing the synthesis task into deterministic anatomical reconstruction and stochastic deviation modeling. Central to our framework is a Deviation-Space Diffusion Model designed to learn the conditional distribution of pathological residuals, thereby capturing localized intensity variations while preserving global structural integrity by construction. To ensure spatial coherence, the diffusion process is coupled with a seam-aware fusion strategy and an inference-time stabilization module, which collectively suppress boundary artifacts and produce high-fidelity internal lesion heterogeneity. PathoSyn provides a mathematically principled pipeline for generating high-fidelity patient-specific synthetic datasets, facilitating the development of robust diagnostic algorithms in low-data regimes. By allowing interpretable counterfactual disease progression modeling, the framework supports precision intervention planning and provides a controlled environment for benchmarking clinical decision-support systems. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on tumor imaging benchmarks demonstrate that PathoSyn significantly outperforms holistic diffusion and mask-conditioned baselines in both perceptual realism and anatomical fidelity.

In contrast, most computational object recognition systems operate on isolated image regions, devoid of meaning in isolation, thus ignoring this vital contextual information. This paper argues for the critical role of context and introduces a novel framework for contextual object classification. We first construct a Geo-Semantic Contextual Graph (GSCG) from a single monocular image. This rich, structured representation is built by integrating a metric depth estimator with a unified panoptic and material segmentation model. The GSCG encodes objects as nodes with detailed geometric, chromatic, and material attributes, and their spatial relationships as edges. This explicit graph structure makes the model's reasoning process inherently interpretable. We then propose a specialized graph-based classifier that aggregates features from a target object, its immediate neighbors, and the global scene context to predict its class. Through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that our context-aware model achieves a classification accuracy of 73.4%, dramatically outperforming context-agnostic versions (as low as 38.4%). Furthermore, our GSCG-based approach significantly surpasses strong baselines, including fine-tuned ResNet models (max 53.5%) and a state-of-the-art multimodal Large Language Model (LLM), Llama 4 Scout, which, even when given the full image alongside a detailed description of objects, maxes out at 42.3%.

The study explores several DL models, including UNet, UNet++, ResUNet, AttentionUNet, and ResNet50-Segnet, applied to high-resolution Sentinel-2 Level 2A satellite images of the Amazon Rainforest. The datasets comprise three collections: two sets of three-band imagery and one set of four-band imagery. After evaluation, the most effective DL models are individually integrated with the OBIA technique to enhance mapping accuracy.

In particular, the real-world deployment of target detection methods is pivotal in the decision-making process during military command and reconnaissance. However, current domain adaptive object detection algorithms consider adapting one domain to another similar one only within the scope of natural or autonomous driving scenes. Since military domains often deal with a mixed variety of environments, detecting objects from multiple varying target domains poses a greater challenge. Several studies for armored military target detection have made use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data due to its robustness to all weather, long range, and high-resolution characteristics. Nevertheless, the costs of SAR data acquisition and processing are still much higher than those of the conventional RGB camera, which is a more affordable alternative with significantly lower data processing time. Furthermore, the lack of military target detection datasets limits the use of such a low-cost approach. To mitigate these issues, we propose to generate RGB-based synthetic data using a photorealistic visual tool, Unreal Engine, for military target detection in a cross-domain setting. To this end, we conducted synthetic-to-real transfer experiments by training our synthetic dataset and validating on our web-collected real military target datasets. We benchmark the state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods distinguished by the degree of supervision on our proposed train-val dataset pair, and find that current methods using minimal hints on the image (e.g., object class) achieve a substantial improvement over unsupervised or semi-supervised DA methods.

In this work, we propose Co2S, a stable semi-supervised RS segmentation framework that synergistically fuses priors from vision-language models and self-supervised models. Specifically, we construct a heterogeneous dual-student architecture comprising two distinct ViT-based vision foundation models initialized with pretrained CLIP and DINOv3 to mitigate error accumulation and pseudo-label drift. To effectively incorporate these distinct priors, an explicit-implicit semantic co-guidance mechanism is introduced that utilizes text embeddings and learnable queries to provide explicit and implicit class-level guidance, respectively, thereby jointly enhancing semantic consistency. Furthermore, a global-local feature collaborative fusion strategy is developed to effectively fuse the global contextual information captured by CLIP with the local details produced by DINOv3, enabling the model to generate highly precise segmentation results.

Rule-based synthesis, such as injecting noise or pasting patches, is cost-effective but often fails to produce realistic defect images. On the other hand, generative model-based synthesis can create high-quality defect images but requires substantial cost. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained text-guided image-to-image translation model and image retrieval model to efficiently generate synthetic defect images. Specifically, the image retrieval model assesses the similarity of the generated images to real normal images and filters out irrelevant outputs, thereby enhancing the quality and relevance of the generated defect images. To effectively leverage synthetic images, we also introduce a two stage training strategy. In this strategy, the model is first pre-trained on a large volume of images from rule-based synthesis and then fine-tuned on a smaller set of high-quality images. This method significantly reduces the cost for data collection while improving the anomaly detection performance. Experiments on the MVTec AD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u7f3a\u9677\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u5236\u9020\u4e2d\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u771f\u5b9e\u7f3a\u9677\u56fe\u50cf\u7a00\u7f3a\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7f3a\u9677\u56fe\u50cf\u53c8\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u7f3a\u9677\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5148\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c4\u5219\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u518d\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728MVTec AD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5408\u6210\u7f3a\u9677\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, while textual and static multimodal agents have seen rapid progress, a significant modality gap remains in processing the web's most dynamic modality: video. Existing video benchmarks predominantly focus on passive perception, feeding curated clips to models without requiring external retrieval. They fail to evaluate agentic video research, which necessitates actively interrogating video timelines, cross-referencing dispersed evidence, and verifying claims against the open web. To bridge this gap, we present \\textbf{Video-BrowseComp}, a challenging benchmark comprising 210 questions tailored for open-web agentic video reasoning. Unlike prior benchmarks, Video-BrowseComp enforces a mandatory dependency on temporal visual evidence, ensuring that answers cannot be derived solely through text search but require navigating video timelines to verify external claims. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals a critical bottleneck: even advanced search-augmented models like GPT-5.1 (w/ Search) achieve only 15.24\\% accuracy. Our analysis reveals that these models largely rely on textual proxies, excelling in metadata-rich domains (e.g., TV shows with plot summaries) but collapsing in metadata-sparse, dynamic environments (e.g., sports, gameplay) where visual grounding is essential.

We present physics-edge hybrid gas dynamic routing network (PEG-DRNet). First, we introduce the Gas Block, a diffusion-convection unit modeling gas transport: a local branch captures short-range variations, while a large-kernel branch captures long-range propagation. An edge-gated learnable fusion module balances local detail and global context, strengthening weak-contrast plume and contour cues. Second, we propose the adaptive gradient and phase edge operator (AGPEO), computing reliable edge priors from multi-directional gradients and phase-consistent responses. These are transformed by a multi-scale edge perception module (MSEPM) into hierarchical edge features that reinforce boundaries. Finally, the content-adaptive sparse routing path aggregation network (CASR-PAN), with adaptive information modulation modules for fusion and self, selectively propagates informative features across scales based on edge and content cues, improving cross-scale discriminability while reducing redundancy.

However, learning-based models are widely believed to be sensitive to domain shift, with robustness typically pursued through large and diverse training datasets, without explaining the underlying mechanisms. In this work, we show that domain-shift immunity is an inherent property of deep deformable registration models, arising from their reliance on local feature representations rather than global appearance for deformation estimation. To isolate and validate this mechanism, we introduce UniReg, a universal registration framework that decouples feature extraction from deformation estimation using fixed, pre-trained feature extractors and a UNet-based deformation network. Despite training on a single dataset, UniReg exhibits robust cross-domain and multi-modal performance comparable to optimization-based methods. Our analysis further reveals that failures of conventional CNN-based models under modality shift originate from dataset-induced biases in early convolutional layers. These findings identify local feature consistency as the key driver of robustness in learning-based deformable registration and motivate backbone designs that preserve domain-invariant local features.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u514d\u75ab\u6027\u6e90\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0cUniReg\u6846\u67b6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u673a\u5236\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8de8\u57df\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u514d\u75ab\u6027\u662f\u5176\u56fa\u6709\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u6e90\u4e8e\u5b83\u4eec\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u800c\u975e\u5168\u5c40\u5916\u89c2\u8fdb\u884c\u53d8\u5f62\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165UniReg\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u914d\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eUNet\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u7f51\u7edc\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u53d8\u5f62\u4f30\u8ba1\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0cUniReg\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u914d\u51c6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e86\u4fdd\u7559\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u9aa8\u5e72\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

Some previous methods have shown substantial improvements by either employing heterogeneous teacher models to provide high-quality pseudo labels or enforcing feature-perspective consistency between the teacher and student networks. However, these methods overlook the fact that the model usually tends to exhibit low sensitivity to object geometries with limited labeled data, making it difficult to capture geometric information, which is crucial for enhancing the student model's ability in object perception and localization. In this paper, we propose GeoTeacher to enhance the student model's ability to capture geometric relations of objects with limited training data, especially unlabeled data. We design a keypoint-based geometric relation supervision module that transfers the teacher model's knowledge of object geometry to the student, thereby improving the student's capability in understanding geometric relations. Furthermore, we introduce a voxel-wise data augmentation strategy that increases the diversity of object geometries, thereby further improving the student model's ability to comprehend geometric structures. To preserve the integrity of distant objects during augmentation, we incorporate a distance-decay mechanism into this strategy. Moreover, GeoTeacher can be combined with different SS3D methods to further improve their performance. Extensive experiments on the ONCE and Waymo datasets indicate the effectiveness and generalization of our method and we achieve the new state-of-the-art results.

Existing approaches often compromise visual fidelity by enforcing strictly unidirectional attention mechanisms or reducing model capacity. To address this problem, we introduce \\textbf{SoulX-LiveTalk}, a 14B-parameter framework optimized for high-fidelity real-time streaming. Diverging from conventional unidirectional paradigms, we use a \\textbf{Self-correcting Bidirectional Distillation} strategy that retains bidirectional attention within video chunks. This design preserves critical spatiotemporal correlations, significantly enhancing motion coherence and visual detail.

Existing image-based approaches face two critical challenges: methods achieving high accuracy typically require dense 3D supervision, while those operating without such supervision struggle to extract accurate geometry from images alone. In this paper, we present GVSynergy-Det, a novel framework that enhances 3D detection through synergistic Gaussian-Voxel representation learning. Our key insight is that continuous Gaussian and discrete voxel representations capture complementary geometric information: Gaussians excel at modeling fine-grained surface details while voxels provide structured spatial context. We introduce a dual-representation architecture that: 1) adapts generalizable Gaussian Splatting to extract complementary geometric features for detection tasks, and 2) develops a cross-representation enhancement mechanism that enriches voxel features with geometric details from Gaussian fields. Unlike previous methods that either rely on time-consuming per-scene optimization or utilize Gaussian representations solely for depth regularization, our synergistic strategy directly leverages features from both representations through learnable integration, enabling more accurate object localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GVSynergy-Det achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging indoor benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing methods on both ScanNetV2 and ARKitScenes datasets, all without requiring any depth or dense 3D geometry supervision (e.g., point clouds or TSDF).", "AI": {"tldr": "GVSynergy-Det\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af-\u4f53\u7d20\u534f\u540c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6df1\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u53473D\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u5bc6\u96c63D\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u51c6\u786e\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u8868\u793a\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u65af\u548c\u4f53\u7d20\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728ScanNetV2\u548cARKitScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GVSynergy-Det\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af-\u4f53\u7d20\u534f\u540c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u76843D\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6df1\u5ea6\u6216\u5bc6\u96c63D\u51e0\u4f55\u76d1\u7763\u3002"}}

However, existing DWMs lack 3D scene understanding capabilities and can only generate content conditioned on input data, without the ability to interpret or reason about the driving environment. Moreover, current approaches represent 3D spatial information with point cloud or BEV features do not accurately align textual information with the underlying 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified DWM framework based on 3D Gaussian scene representation, which enables both 3D scene understanding and multi-modal scene generation, while also enabling contextual enrichment for understanding and generation tasks. Our approach directly aligns textual information with the 3D scene by embedding rich linguistic features into each Gaussian primitive, thereby achieving early modality alignment. In addition, we design a novel task-aware language-guided sampling strategy that removes redundant 3D Gaussians and injects accurate and compact 3D tokens into LLM.

However, they still tend to produce hallucinated content that is inconsistent with the visual input, which limits their reliability in real-world applications. We propose \\textbf{CoFi-Dec}, a training-free decoding framework that mitigates hallucinations by integrating generative self-feedback with coarse-to-fine visual conditioning. Inspired by the human visual process from global scene perception to detailed inspection, CoFi-Dec first generates two intermediate textual responses conditioned on coarse- and fine-grained views of the original image. These responses are then transformed into synthetic images using a text-to-image model, forming multi-level visual hypotheses that enrich grounding cues. To unify the predictions from these multiple visual conditions, we introduce a Wasserstein-based fusion mechanism that aligns their predictive distributions into a geometrically consistent decoding trajectory. This principled fusion reconciles high-level semantic consistency with fine-grained visual grounding, leading to more robust and faithful outputs. Extensive experiments on six hallucination-focused benchmarks show that CoFi-Dec substantially reduces both entity-level and semantic-level hallucinations, outperforming existing decoding strategies.

Current diffusion model-based applications exploit the power of learned visual representations from multistep forward-backward Markovian processes for single-task prediction tasks by attaching a task-specific decoder. However, the heuristic selection of diffusion timestep features still heavily relies on empirical intuition, often leading to sub-optimal performance biased towards certain tasks. To alleviate this constraint, we investigate the significance of versatile diffusion timestep features by adaptively selecting timesteps best suited for the few-shot dense prediction task, evaluated on an arbitrary unseen task. To this end, we propose two modules: Task-aware Timestep Selection (TTS) to select ideal diffusion timesteps based on timestep-wise losses and similarity scores, and Timestep Feature Consolidation (TFC) to consolidate the selected timestep features to improve the dense predictive performance in a few-shot setting. Accompanied by our parameter-efficient fine-tuning adapter, our framework effectively achieves superiority in dense prediction performance given only a few support queries.

To address issues such as subjects missing or conflicts, recent works incorporate layout guidance to provide explicit spatial constraints.

In this paper, we present AnyMS, a novel training-free framework for layout-guided multi-subject customization. AnyMS leverages three input conditions: text prompt, subject images, and layout constraints, and introduces a bottom-up dual-level attention decoupling mechanism to harmonize their integration during generation. Specifically, global decoupling separates cross-attention between textual and visual conditions to ensure text alignment. Local decoupling confines each subject's attention to its designated area, which prevents subject conflicts and thus guarantees identity preservation and layout control. Moreover, AnyMS employs pre-trained image adapters to extract subject-specific features aligned with the diffusion model, removing the need for subject learning or adapter tuning.

In particular, it is desirable to detect unexpected small road hazards reliably in real-time, especially under varying adverse conditions (e.g., weather and daylight). However, existing road driving datasets provide large-scale images acquired in either normal or adverse scenarios only, and often do not contain the road obstacles captured in the same visual domain as for the other classes. To address this, we introduce a new dataset called AVOID, the Adverse Visual Conditions Dataset, for real-time obstacle detection collected in a simulated environment. AVOID consists of a large set of unexpected road obstacles located along each path captured under various weather and time conditions. Each image is coupled with the corresponding semantic and depth maps, raw and semantic LiDAR data, and waypoints, thereby supporting most visual perception tasks.

To bridge this gap, we present MM-UAVBench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates MLLMs across three core capability dimensions-perception, cognition, and planning-in low-altitude UAV scenarios. MM-UAVBench comprises 19 sub-tasks with over 5.7K manually annotated questions, all derived from real-world UAV data collected from public datasets. Extensive experiments on 16 open-source and proprietary MLLMs reveal that current models struggle to adapt to the complex visual and cognitive demands of low-altitude scenarios.

Across several large multimodal models, adopting this strategy consistently improves diagnostic accuracy, indicating the effectiveness of evidence-seeking workflows in computational pathology.

We argue that these two tasks should be unified within a single framework, as logical reasoning and imaginative thinking are both fundamental qualities of a film director. In this work, we propose UniMAGE, a unified director model that bridges user prompts with well-structured scripts, thereby empowering non-experts to produce long-context, multi-shot films by leveraging existing audio-video generation models. To achieve this, we employ the Mixture-of-Transformers architecture that unifies text and image generation. To further enhance narrative logic and keyframe consistency, we introduce a ``first interleaving, then disentangling'' training paradigm.

Existing RS diffusion foundation models typically aggregate multiple classification datasets or apply simplistic deduplication, overlooking the distributional requirements of generation modeling and the heterogeneity of RS imagery. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free, two-stage data pruning approach that quickly select a high-quality subset under high pruning ratios, enabling a preliminary foundation model to converge rapidly and serve as a versatile backbone for generation, downstream fine-tuning, and other applications. Our method jointly considers local information content with global scene-level diversity and representativeness. First, an entropy-based criterion efficiently removes low-information samples. Next, leveraging RS scene classification datasets as reference benchmarks, we perform scene-aware clustering with stratified sampling to improve clustering effectiveness while reducing computational costs on large-scale unlabeled data. Finally, by balancing cluster-level uniformity and sample representativeness, the method enables fine-grained selection under high pruning ratios while preserving overall diversity and representativeness. Experiments show that, even after pruning 85\\% of the training data, our method significantly improves convergence and generation quality.

The MS-VLAM constructs a three-tier alignment mechanism covering object, local-region and global levels, which systematically captures cross-modal semantic consistency and alleviates issues of semantic misalignment and granularity imbalance.Experimental results on the RS-GPT4V dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the accuracy of semantic understanding and computational efficiency in tasks including image captioning and cross-modal retrieval.

However, generating a sequence of images while preserving consistent character identity across diverse scene descriptions remains a challenging task. Existing methods often struggle with a trade-off between maintaining identity consistency and ensuring per-image prompt alignment. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, ASemconsist, that addresses this challenge through selective text embedding modification, enabling explicit semantic control over character identity without sacrificing prompt alignment. Furthermore, based on our analysis of padding embeddings in FLUX, we propose a semantic control strategy that repurposes padding embeddings as semantic containers. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive feature-sharing strategy that automatically evaluates textual ambiguity and applies constraints only to the ambiguous identity prompt. Finally, we propose a unified evaluation protocol, the Consistency Quality Score (CQS), which integrates identity preservation and per-image text alignment into a single comprehensive metric, explicitly capturing performance imbalances between the two metrics. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively overcoming prior trade-offs.

Recently, Gaussian Splatting has emerged as an efficient representation framework, and its extension to 2D image representation enables lightweight, yet expressive modeling of visual content. While recent 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) approaches provide compact storage and real-time decoding, they often produce blurry or indistinct boundaries when the number of Gaussians is small due to the lack of contour awareness. In this work, we propose a Contour Information-Aware 2D Gaussian Splatting framework that incorporates object segmentation priors into Gaussian-based image representation. By constraining each Gaussian to a specific segmentation region during rasterization, our method prevents cross-boundary blending and preserves edge structures under high compression. We also introduce a warm-up scheme to stabilize training and improve convergence. Experiments on synthetic color charts and the DAVIS dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves higher reconstruction quality around object edges compared to existing 2DGS methods. The improvement is particularly evident in scenarios with very few Gaussians, while our method still maintains fast rendering and low memory usage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\u5148\u9a8c\u76842D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8fb9\u7f18\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5feb\u901f\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76842D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff082DGS\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8f6e\u5ed3\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u6a21\u7cca\u6216\u4e0d\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u9650\u5236\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5206\u5272\u533a\u57df\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u5149\u6805\u5316\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8de8\u8fb9\u754c\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u9884\u70ed\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u8272\u5361\u548cDAVIS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5bf9\u8c61\u8fb9\u7f18\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u67092DGS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Contour Information-Aware 2D Gaussian Splatting\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Caching-based methods achieve training-free acceleration, while suffering from considerable computational error. Existing methods typically incorporate error correction strategies such as pruning or prediction to mitigate it. However, their fixed caching strategy fails to adapt to the complex error variations during denoising, which limits the full potential of error correction. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel fidelity-optimization plugin for existing error correction methods via cumulative error minimization, named CEM. CEM predefines the error to characterize the sensitivity of model to acceleration jointly influenced by timesteps and cache intervals. Guided by this prior, we formulate a dynamic programming algorithm with cumulative error approximation for strategy optimization, which achieves the caching error minimization, resulting in a substantial improvement in generation fidelity. CEM is model-agnostic and exhibits strong generalization, which is adaptable to arbitrary acceleration budgets. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing error correction frameworks and quantized models without introducing any additional computational overhead. Extensive experiments conducted on nine generation models and quantized methods across three tasks demonstrate that CEM significantly improves generation fidelity of existing acceleration models, and outperforms the original generation performance on FLUX.1-dev, PixArt-$\u03b1$, StableDiffusion1.5 and Hunyuan.

However, these models rely on static dense computation that applies uniform processing to all inputs, misallocating representational capacity and computational resources such as over-allocating on trivial scenes while under-serving complex ones. This mismatch results in both computational redundancy and suboptimal detection performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose YOLO-Master, a novel YOLO-like framework that introduces instance-conditional adaptive computation for RTOD. This is achieved through a Efficient Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (ES-MoE) block that dynamically allocates computational resources to each input according to its scene complexity. At its core, a lightweight dynamic routing network guides expert specialization during training through a diversity enhancing objective, encouraging complementary expertise among experts. Additionally, the routing network adaptively learns to activate only the most relevant experts, thereby improving detection performance while minimizing computational overhead during inference. Comprehensive experiments on five large-scale benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of YOLO-Master. On MS COCO, our model achieves 42.4% AP with 1.62ms latency, outperforming YOLOv13-N by +0.8% mAP and 17.8% faster inference.

In this work, we present two multimodal frameworks designed to tackle both problems on the iMiGUE dataset. For micro-gesture classification, we explore the complementary strengths of RGB and 3D pose-based representations to capture nuanced spatio-temporal patterns. To comprehensively represent gestures, video, and skeletal embeddings are extracted using MViTv2-S and 2s-AGCN, respectively. Then, they are integrated through a Cross-Modal Token Fusion module to combine spatial and pose information.

We begin from a single hypothesis: that visual understanding presupposes a semantic language for vision, in which many perceptual observations correspond to a small number of discrete semantic states. Together with widely assumed premises on transferability and abstraction in representation learning, this hypothesis implies that the visual observation space must be organized in a fiber bundle like structure, where nuisance variation populates fibers and semantics correspond to a quotient base space. From this structure we derive two theoretical consequences. First, the semantic quotient $X/G$ is not a submanifold of $X$ and cannot be obtained through smooth deformation alone, semantic invariance requires a non-homeomorphic, discriminative target, for example, supervision via labels, cross instance identification, or multimodal alignment that supplies explicit semantic equivalence. Second, we show that approximating the quotient also places structural demands on the model architecture. Semantic abstraction requires not only an external semantic target, but a representation mechanism capable of supporting topology change: an expand-and-snap process in which the manifold is first geometrically expanded to separate structure and then collapsed to form discrete semantic regions. We emphasize that these results are interpretive rather than prescriptive: the framework provides a topological lens that aligns with empirical regularities observed in large-scale discriminative and multimodal models, and with classical principles in statistical learning theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ece\u62d3\u6251\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u5bdf\u7a7a\u95f4\u9700\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u7ea4\u7ef4\u4e1b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u6e90\u4e8e\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u6027\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ece\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8bed\u8a00\u5047\u8bbe\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u548c\u62bd\u8c61\u6027\u524d\u63d0\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u5bdf\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7ea4\u7ef4\u4e1b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u5546\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u662f\u5b50\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u53d8\u5f62\u83b7\u5f97\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u9700\u8981\u975e\u540c\u80da\u7684\u5224\u522b\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5546\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fd8\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ece\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49\u8bed\u8a00\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u5bdf\u7a7a\u95f4\u5fc5\u987b\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u7ea4\u7ef4\u4e1b\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u89c4\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5224\u522b\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u62d3\u6251\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches often rely on pre-constructed 3D representations or off-the-shelf reconstruction pipelines, which constrain scalability and real-world applicability. A recent line of work explores learning spatial reasoning directly from multi-view images, enabling Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand 3D scenes without explicit 3D reconstructions. Nevertheless, key challenges that frequently arise in real-world environments, such as partial visibility, occlusion, and low-overlap conditions that require spatial reasoning from fragmented visual cues, remain under-explored. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable multi-view data generation and annotation pipeline that constructs realistic spatial reasoning QAs, resulting in SpatialMosaic, a comprehensive instruction-tuning dataset featuring 2M QA pairs. We further introduce SpatialMosaic-Bench, a challenging benchmark for evaluating multi-view spatial reasoning under realistic and challenging scenarios, consisting of 1M QA pairs across 6 tasks.

Meanwhile, CSMGC establishes geometric consensus via a cross-stage sparse graph network, ensuring the consistency of geometric information across different stages.

Current IMDL research typically uses cross-dataset evaluation, where models trained on one benchmark are tested on others. However, this simplified evaluation approach conceals the fragility of existing methods when handling diverse AI-generated content, leading to misleading impressions of progress. This paper challenges this illusion by proposing NeXT-IMDL, a large-scale diagnostic benchmark designed not just to collect data, but to probe the generalization boundaries of current detectors systematically. Specifically, NeXT-IMDL categorizes AIGC-based manipulations along four fundamental axes: editing models, manipulation types, content semantics, and forgery granularity. Built upon this, NeXT-IMDL implements five rigorous cross-dimension evaluation protocols. Our extensive experiments on 11 representative models reveal a critical insight: while these models perform well in their original settings, they exhibit systemic failures and significant performance degradation when evaluated under our designed protocols that simulate real-world, various generalization scenarios.

Native 3D methods relying on geometric cues often suffer from boundary leakage, center drift, and inconsistent tooth identities, especially for minority classes and complex anatomies. Meanwhile, 2D foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provide strong boundary-aware semantics, but directly applying them in 3D is impractical in clinical workflows. To address these issues, we propose SOFTooth, a semantics-enhanced, order-aware 2D-3D fusion framework that leverages frozen 2D semantics without explicit 2D mask supervision. First, a point-wise residual gating module injects occlusal-view SAM embeddings into 3D point features to refine tooth-gingiva and inter-tooth boundaries. Second, a center-guided mask refinement regularizes consistency between instance masks and geometric centroids, reducing center drift. Furthermore, an order-aware Hungarian matching strategy integrates anatomical tooth order and center distance into similarity-based assignment, ensuring coherent labeling even under missing or crowded dentitions.

However, its inherently complex nature, spanning visual perception, cognition, and emotion, poses fundamental challenges. Although aesthetic descriptions offer a viable representation of this complexity, two critical challenges persist: (1) data scarcity and imbalance: existing dataset overly focuses on visual perception and neglects deeper dimensions due to the expensive manual annotation; and (2) model fragmentation: current visual networks isolate aesthetic attributes with multi-branch encoder, while multimodal methods represented by contrastive learning struggle to effectively process long-form textual descriptions. To resolve challenge (1), we first present the Refined Aesthetic Description (RAD) dataset, a large-scale (70k), multi-dimensional structured dataset, generated via an iterative pipeline without heavy annotation costs and easy to scale. To address challenge (2), we propose ArtQuant, an aesthetics assessment framework for artistic images which not only couples isolated aesthetic dimensions through joint description generation, but also better models long-text semantics with the help of LLM decoders.

However, current approaches relegate world models to limited roles: they operate within ostensibly unified architectures that still keep world prediction and motion planning as decoupled processes. To bridge this gap, we propose DriveLaW, a novel paradigm that unifies video generation and motion planning. By directly injecting the latent representation from its video generator into the planner, DriveLaW ensures inherent consistency between high-fidelity future generation and reliable trajectory planning. Specifically, DriveLaW consists of two core components: DriveLaW-Video, our powerful world model that generates high-fidelity forecasting with expressive latent representations, and DriveLaW-Act, a diffusion planner that generates consistent and reliable trajectories from the latent of DriveLaW-Video, with both components optimized by a three-stage progressive training strategy. The power of our unified paradigm is demonstrated by new state-of-the-art results across both tasks. DriveLaW not only advances video prediction significantly, surpassing best-performing work by 33.3% in FID and 1.8% in FVD, but also achieves a new record on the NAVSIM planning benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "DriveLaW\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002DriveLaW\u65e8\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u4e24\u8005\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "DriveLaW\u5305\u542bDriveLaW-Video\uff08\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u548cDriveLaW-Act\uff08\u6269\u6563\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6e10\u8fdb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "DriveLaW\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2dFID\u63d0\u534733.3%\uff0cFVD\u63d0\u53471.8%\uff0c\u5e76\u5728NAVSIM\u89c4\u5212\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u521b\u4e0b\u65b0\u7eaa\u5f55\u3002", "conclusion": "DriveLaW\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u672a\u6765\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u5185\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing preference-based training methods like Diffusion Direct Preference Optimization help address these issues but rely on costly and potentially noisy human-labeled datasets. In this work, we introduce Direct Diffusion Score Preference Optimization (DDSPO), which directly derives per-timestep supervision from winning and losing policies when such policies are available. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on final samples, DDSPO provides dense, transition-level signals across the denoising trajectory. In practice, we avoid reliance on labeled data by automatically generating preference signals using a pretrained reference model: we contrast its outputs when conditioned on original prompts versus semantically degraded variants. This practical strategy enables effective score-space preference supervision without explicit reward modeling or manual annotations. Empirical results demonstrate that DDSPO improves text-image alignment and visual quality, outperforming or matching existing preference-based methods while requiring significantly less supervision.

This study presents a hybrid framework integrating vision based waterline detection, YOLOv8 pose scale extraction, and large multimodal language models (GPT 4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash) for automated river gauge plate reading. The methodology involves sequential stages of image preprocessing, annotation, waterline detection, scale gap estimation, and numeric reading extraction. Experiments demonstrate that waterline detection achieved high precision of 94.24 percent and an F1 score of 83.64 percent, while scale gap detection provided accurate geometric calibration for subsequent reading extraction. Incorporating scale gap metadata substantially improved the predictive performance of LLMs, with Gemini Stage 2 achieving the highest accuracy, with a mean absolute error of 5.43 cm, root mean square error of 8.58 cm, and R squared of 0.84 under optimal image conditions. Results highlight the sensitivity of LLMs to image quality, with degraded images producing higher errors, and underscore the importance of combining geometric metadata with multimodal artificial intelligence for robust water level estimation.

In this paper, we propose a denoising Brownian bridge model with dual approximators (Dual-approx Bridge), a novel generative model that exploits the Brownian bridge dynamics and two neural network-based approximators (one for forward and one for reverse process) to produce faithful output with negligible variance and high image quality in I2I translations. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including image generation and super-resolution demonstrate the consistent and superior performance of Dual-approx Bridge in terms of image quality and faithfulness to GT when compared to both stochastic and deterministic baselines.

However, CNN backbones that are not tailored to specific tasks may fail to effectively aggregate global context and oversmooth dense motion fields in scenes with large disparity. To address these problems, we propose a novel network named SC-Net, which effectively integrates bilateral context from both spatial and channel perspectives. Specifically, we design an adaptive focused regularization module (AFR) to enhance the model's position-awareness and robustness against spurious motion samples, thereby facilitating the generation of a more accurate motion field. We then propose a bilateral field adjustment module (BFA) to refine the motion field by simultaneously modeling long-range relationships and facilitating interaction across spatial and channel dimensions.

Nonetheless, when confronted with lengthy videos, these models struggle: their temporal windows are narrow, and they fail to notice fine-grained semantic shifts that unfold over extended durations. Moreover, mainstream text-based retrieval pipelines, which rely chiefly on surface-level lexical overlap, ignore the rich temporal interdependence among visual, audio, and subtitle channels. To mitigate these limitations, we propose TV-RAG, a training-free architecture that couples temporal alignment with entropy-guided semantics to improve long-video reasoning. The framework contributes two main mechanisms: \\emph{(i)} a time-decay retrieval module that injects explicit temporal offsets into the similarity computation, thereby ranking text queries according to their true multimedia context; and \\emph{(ii)} an entropy-weighted key-frame sampler that selects evenly spaced, information-dense frames, reducing redundancy while preserving representativeness. By weaving these temporal and semantic signals together, TV-RAG realises a dual-level reasoning routine that can be grafted onto any LVLM without re-training or fine-tuning. The resulting system offers a lightweight, budget-friendly upgrade path and consistently surpasses most leading baselines across established long-video benchmarks such as Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench, confirming the effectiveness of our model.

A limitation in current approaches is their focus on basic geometric relationships or localized features, often neglecting cross-scale contextual interactions between objects. This paper introduces the Deep Panoptic Context Aggregation Network (PanCAN), a novel approach that hierarchically integrates multi-order geometric contexts through cross-scale feature aggregation in a high-dimensional Hilbert space. Specifically, PanCAN learns multi-order neighborhood relationships at each scale by combining random walks with an attention mechanism. Modules from different scales are cascaded, where salient anchors at a finer scale are selected and their neighborhood features are dynamically fused via attention. This enables effective cross-scale modeling that significantly enhances complex scene understanding by combining multi-order and cross-scale context-aware features.

Although inference-time scaling can theoretically improve this trade-off by allocating more computation, existing strategies remain suboptimal: reward-driven particle optimization often causes perceptual over-smoothing, while optimal-path search tends to lose structural consistency. To overcome these difficulties, we propose Iterative Diffusion Inference-Time Scaling with Adaptive Frequency Steering (IAFS), a training-free framework that jointly leverages iterative refinement and frequency-aware particle fusion. IAFS addresses the challenge of balancing perceptual quality and structural fidelity by progressively refining the generated image through iterative correction of structural deviations. Simultaneously, it ensures effective frequency fusion by adaptively integrating high-frequency perceptual cues with low-frequency structural information, allowing for a more accurate and balanced reconstruction across different image details. Extensive experiments across multiple diffusion-based SR models show that IAFS effectively resolves the perception-fidelity conflict, yielding consistently improved perceptual detail and structural accuracy, and outperforming existing inference-time scaling methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "IAFS\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec6\u5316\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9891\u7387\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e2d\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4f4e\u9891\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u653e\u7b56\u7565\u4e5f\u672a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86IAFS\uff08\u8fed\u4ee3\u6269\u6563\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u653e\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9891\u7387\u5f15\u5bfc\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec6\u5316\u548c\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u7c92\u5b50\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cIAFS\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6269\u6563\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "IAFS\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Traditional safety methods like text blacklisting or harmful content classification have significant drawbacks: they can be easily circumvented or require extensive datasets and extra training. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PurifyGen, a novel, training-free approach for safe T2I generation that retains the model's original weights. PurifyGen introduces a dual-stage strategy for prompt purification. First, we evaluate the safety of each token in a prompt by computing its complementary semantic distance, which measures the semantic proximity between the prompt tokens and concept embeddings from predefined toxic and clean lists. This enables fine-grained prompt classification without explicit keyword matching or retraining. Tokens closer to toxic concepts are flagged as risky. Second, for risky prompts, we apply a dual-space transformation: we project toxic-aligned embeddings into the null space of the toxic concept matrix, effectively removing harmful semantic components, and simultaneously align them into the range space of clean concepts. This dual alignment purifies risky prompts by both subtracting unsafe semantics and reinforcing safe ones, while retaining the original intent and coherence. We further define a token-wise strategy to selectively replace only risky token embeddings, ensuring minimal disruption to safe content. PurifyGen offers a plug-and-play solution with theoretical grounding and strong generalization to unseen prompts and models. Extensive testing shows that PurifyGen surpasses current methods in reducing unsafe content across five datasets and competes well with training-dependent approaches.

The proposed method, termed Haar-tSVD, exploits a unified tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) projection combined with Haar transform to efficiently capture global and local patch correlations. Haar-tSVD operates as a one-step, parallelizable plug-and-play denoiser that eliminates the need for learning local bases, thereby striking a balance between denoising speed and performance. Besides, an adaptive noise estimation scheme is introduced to improve robustness according to eigenvalue analysis of the circulant structure. To further enhance the performance under severe noise conditions, we integrate deep neural networks with Haar-tSVD based on the established Haar-PCA relationship.

To address these challenges, we propose ProGuard, a vision-language proactive guard that identifies and describes out-of-distribution (OOD) safety risks without the need for model adjustments required by traditional reactive approaches. We first construct a modality-balanced dataset of 87K samples, each annotated with both binary safety labels and risk categories under a hierarchical multimodal safety taxonomy, effectively mitigating modality bias and ensuring consistent moderation across text, image, and text-image inputs. Based on this dataset, we train our vision-language base model purely through reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve efficient and concise reasoning. To approximate proactive safety scenarios in a controlled setting, we further introduce an OOD safety category inference task and augment the RL objective with a synonym-bank-based similarity reward that encourages the model to generate concise descriptions for unseen unsafe categories. Experimental results show that ProGuard achieves performance comparable to closed-source large models on binary safety classification, substantially outperforms existing open-source guard models on unsafe content categorization.

However, the simultaneous denoising of all video frames with bidirectional attention via an iterative process in diffusion models prevents real-time interaction. While existing distillation methods can make the model autoregressive and reduce sampling steps to mitigate this, they focus primarily on text-to-video generation, leaving the human-AI interaction unnatural and less efficient. This paper targets real-time interactive video diffusion conditioned on a multimodal context, including text, image, and audio, to bridge the gap. Given the observation that the leading on-policy distillation approach Self Forcing encounters challenges (visual artifacts like flickering, black frames, and quality degradation) with multimodal conditioning, we investigate an improved distillation recipe with emphasis on the quality of condition inputs as well as the initialization and schedule for the on-policy optimization. On benchmarks for multimodal-conditioned (audio, image, and text) avatar video generation including HDTF, AVSpeech, and CelebV-HQ, our distilled model matches the visual quality of the full-step, bidirectional baselines of similar or larger size with 20x less inference cost and latency. Further, we integrate our model with audio language models and long-form video inference technique Anchor-Heavy Identity Sinks to build LiveTalk, a real-time multimodal interactive avatar system. System-level evaluation on our curated multi-turn interaction benchmark shows LiveTalk outperforms state-of-the-art models (Sora2, Veo3) in multi-turn video coherence and content quality, while reducing response latency from 1 to 2 minutes to real-time generation, enabling seamless human-AI multimodal interaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u65f6\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u901a\u7528\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u914d\u65b9\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4ee5\u53ca\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u5728HDTF\u3001AVSpeech\u548cCelebV-HQ\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee520\u500d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u5339\u914d\u4e86\u5168\u6b65\u9aa4\u53cc\u5411\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u7cfb\u7edfLiveTalk\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

Enhancing Visual Perception in Vision-Language Models", "comment": "Project webpage: https://glab-caltech.github.io/twin/", "summary": "Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but remain coarse-grained, exhibit visual biases, and miss subtle visual details. Existing training corpora reinforce this limitation by emphasizing general recognition (\"Is it a cat or a dog?\") over fine-grained perception. To address this, we introduce a new training corpus and task designed to enhance the perceptual abilities of VLMs. TWIN is a large-scale dataset of 561,000 image-pair queries that task models to determine whether two visually similar images depict the same object, encouraging attention to nuanced visual cues. The dataset spans a diverse range of everyday objects across contexts, viewpoints, and appearances. Fine-tuning VLMs on TWIN yields notable gains in fine-grained recognition, even on unseen domains such as art, animals, plants, and landmarks. To quantify these gains, we introduce FGVQA, a benchmark suite of 12,000 queries that repurposes fine-grained recognition and retrieval datasets from multiple domains. While existing VLMs struggle on FGVQA, when fine-tuned on TWIN they improve by up to 19.3%, without compromising performance on general VQA benchmarks. Finally, our TWIN dataset scales favorably with object annotations, and our analysis shows that scale is key to performance. We envision TWIN as a drop-in addition to open-source VLM training corpora, advancing perceptual precision of future models.

These complexities require to be addressed with an effective and scalable system that can assist in enhancing the salience of the subtle visual cues and provide a high level of the generalization on the multimodal imaging data. A Scalable Residual Feature Aggregation (SRFA) framework is proposed to be used to meet these conditions in this study. The framework integrates a pipeline of preprocessing followed by the segmentation using the MAGRes-UNet that is effective in making the pancreatic structures and isolating regions of interest more visible. DenseNet-121 performed with residual feature storage is used to extract features to allow deep hierarchical features to be aggregated without properties loss. To go further, hybrid HHO-BA metaheuristic feature selection strategy is used, which guarantees the best feature subset refinement. To be classified, the system is trained based on a new hybrid model that integrates the ability to pay attention on the world, which is the Vision Transformer (ViT) with the high representational efficiency of EfficientNet-B3. A dual optimization mechanism incorporating SSA and GWO is used to fine-tune hyperparameters to enhance greater robustness and less overfitting. Experimental results support the significant improvement in performance, with the suggested model reaching 96.23% accuracy, 95.58% F1-score and 94.83% specificity, the model is significantly better than the traditional CNNs and contemporary transformer-based models.

Next, through controlled experiments with a latent vector-set (Vecset) diffusion model, we find that, on the data side, memorization depends on data modality, and increases with data diversity and finer-grained conditioning; on the modeling side, it peaks at a moderate guidance scale and can be mitigated by longer Vecsets and simple rotation augmentation.

Existing methods typically rely on the attention mechanism to align objects across frames, simplifying the motion model with a unified explicit physical model (constant velocity, etc.). These approaches prefer semantic features for implicit alignment, challenging the importance of explicit motion modeling in the traditional perception paradigm. However, variations in motion states and object features across categories and frames render this alignment suboptimal. To address this, we propose HAT, a spatio-temporal alignment module that allows each object to adaptively decode the optimal alignment proposal from multiple hypotheses without direct supervision. Specifically, HAT first utilizes multiple explicit motion models to generate spatial anchors and motion-aware feature proposals for historical instances. It then performs multi-hypothesis decoding by incorporating semantic and motion cues embedded in cached object queries, ultimately providing the optimal alignment proposal for the target frame. On nuScenes, HAT consistently improves 3D temporal detectors and trackers across diverse baselines. It achieves state-of-the-art tracking results with 46.0% AMOTA on the test set when paired with the DETR3D detector. In an object-centric E2E AD method, HAT enhances perception accuracy (+1.3% mAP, +3.1% AMOTA) and reduces the collision rate by 32%.

Recent diffusion-based methods have achieved strong results for single-view intrinsic decomposition; however, extending these approaches to multi-view settings remains challenging, often leading to severe view inconsistency. We propose \\textbf{Intrinsic Decomposition Transformer (IDT)}, a feed-forward framework for multi-view intrinsic image decomposition. By leveraging transformer-based attention to jointly reason over multiple input images, IDT produces view-consistent intrinsic factors in a single forward pass, without iterative generative sampling. IDT adopts a physically grounded image formation model that explicitly decomposes images into diffuse reflectance, diffuse shading, and specular shading. This structured factorization separates Lambertian and non-Lambertian light transport, enabling interpretable and controllable decomposition of material and illumination effects across views. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IDT achieves cleaner diffuse reflectance, more coherent diffuse shading, and better-isolated specular components, while substantially improving multi-view consistency compared to prior intrinsic decomposition methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "IDT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5185\u7980\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5f62\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u56fe\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u5185\u7980\u5206\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528transformer-based attention\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5185\u7980\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8fed\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cIDT\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5e72\u51c0\u7684\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u3001\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u7740\u8272\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u955c\u9762\u5206\u91cf\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "IDT\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5185\u7980\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u89e3\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Our key observation is that modern video diffusion models already synthesize convincing transparent phenomena, suggesting they have internalized the optical rules. We build TransPhy3D, a synthetic video corpus of transparent/reflective scenes: 11k sequences rendered with Blender/Cycles. Scenes are assembled from a curated bank of category-rich static assets and shape-rich procedural assets paired with glass/plastic/metal materials. We render RGB + depth + normals with physically based ray tracing and OptiX denoising. Starting from a large video diffusion model, we learn a video-to-video translator for depth (and normals) via lightweight LoRA adapters. During training we concatenate RGB and (noisy) depth latents in the DiT backbone and co-train on TransPhy3D and existing frame-wise synthetic datasets, yielding temporally consistent predictions for arbitrary-length input videos. The resulting model, DKT, achieves zero-shot SOTA on real and synthetic video benchmarks involving transparency: ClearPose, DREDS (CatKnown/CatNovel), and TransPhy3D-Test. It improves accuracy and temporal consistency over strong image/video baselines, and a normal variant sets the best video normal estimation results on ClearPose. A compact 1.3B version runs at ~0.17 s/frame. Integrated into a grasping stack, DKT's depth boosts success rates across translucent, reflective and diffuse surfaces, outperforming prior estimators. Together, these results support a broader claim: \"Diffusion knows transparency.\" Generative video priors can be repurposed, efficiently and label-free, into robust, temporally coherent perception for challenging real-world manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "TransPhy3D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cDKT\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u900f\u660e\u7269\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672cSOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u900f\u660e\u7269\u4f53\u5bf9\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6781\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u6298\u5c04\u3001\u53cd\u5c04\u548c\u900f\u5c04\u7834\u574f\u4e86\u7acb\u4f53\u3001ToF\u548c\u7eaf\u5224\u522b\u6027\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7a7a\u6d1e\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u73b0\u4ee3\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u80fd\u5408\u6210\u903c\u771f\u7684\u900f\u660e\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u4eec\u5df2\u5185\u5316\u4e86\u5149\u5b66\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86TransPhy3D\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b11k\u4e2a\u900f\u660e/\u53cd\u5c04\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Blender/Cycles\u6e32\u67d3\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LoRA\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u4ece\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u9891\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\uff08\u548c\u6cd5\u7ebf\uff09\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5c06RGB\u548c\uff08\u566a\u58f0\uff09\u6df1\u5ea6\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5728DiT\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u62fc\u63a5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728TransPhy3D\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u5e27\u7ea7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5171\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578bDKT\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08ClearPose\u3001DREDS\u548cTransPhy3D-Test\uff09\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672cSOTA\u3002\u5b83\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u56fe\u50cf/\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7ebf\u30021.3B\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u7248\u672c\u6bcf\u5e27\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea60.17\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08Diffusion\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u7406\u89e3\u900f\u660e\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u5148\u9a8c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u5730\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

We propose Stream-DiffVSR, a causally conditioned diffusion framework for efficient online VSR. Operating strictly on past frames, it combines a four-step distilled denoiser for fast inference, an Auto-regressive Temporal Guidance (ARTG) module that injects motion-aligned cues during latent denoising, and a lightweight temporal-aware decoder with a Temporal Processor Module (TPM) that enhances detail and temporal coherence. Stream-DiffVSR processes 720p frames in 0.328 seconds on an RTX4090 GPU and significantly outperforms prior diffusion-based methods. Compared with the online SOTA TMP, it boosts perceptual quality (LPIPS +0.095) while reducing latency by over 130x. Stream-DiffVSR achieves the lowest latency reported for diffusion-based VSR, reducing initial delay from over 4600 seconds to 0.328 seconds, thereby making it the first diffusion VSR method suitable for low-latency online deployment.
