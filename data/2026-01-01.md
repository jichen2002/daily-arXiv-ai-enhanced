*Ankan Aich,Yangming Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过合成先验和DV-LORA方法，显著提升了内窥镜环境下的单目深度估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有自监督方法在镜面反射和充满液体的内窥镜环境中对薄手术工具和透明表面边界崩溃的问题。

Method: 采用Depth Anything V2架构的高保真合成先验，并通过Dynamic Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (DV-LORA)方法高效适配医疗领域。

Result: 在SCARED数据集上实现了98.1%的准确率（<1.25），并将平方相对误差降低了17%以上，建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该研究通过结合Depth Anything V2架构的高保真合成先验和DV-LORA方法，在医疗领域实现了单目深度估计的显著提升，特别是在高反射环境下表现出色。

Abstract: Accurate Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is critical for robotic surgery but remains fragile in specular, fluid-filled endoscopic environments. Existing self-supervised methods, typically relying on foundation models trained with noisy real-world pseudo-labels, often suffer from boundary collapse on thin surgical tools and transparent surfaces. In this work, we address this by leveraging the high-fidelity synthetic priors of the Depth Anything V2 architecture, which inherently captures precise geometric details of thin structures. We efficiently adapt these priors to the medical domain using Dynamic Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (DV-LORA), minimizing the parameter budget while bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Additionally, we introduce a physically-stratified evaluation protocol on the SCARED dataset to rigorously quantify performance in high-specularity regimes often masked by aggregate metrics. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an accuracy (< 1.25) of 98.1% and reducing Squared Relative Error by over 17% compared to established baselines, demonstrating superior robustness in adverse surgical lighting.

Abstract: Effective urban warfare training requires situational awareness and muscle memory, developed through repeated practice in realistic yet controlled environments. A key drill, Enter and Clear the Room (ECR), demands threat assessment, coordination, and securing confined spaces. The military uses Synthetic Training Environments that offer scalable, controlled settings for repeated exercises. However, automatic performance assessment remains challenging, particularly when aiming for objective evaluation of cognitive, psychomotor, and teamwork skills. Traditional methods often rely on costly, intrusive sensors or subjective human observation, limiting scalability and accuracy. This paper introduces a video-based assessment pipeline that derives performance analytics from training videos without requiring additional hardware. By utilizing computer vision models, the system extracts 2D skeletons, gaze vectors, and movement trajectories. From these data, we develop task-specific metrics that measure psychomotor fluency, situational awareness, and team coordination. These metrics feed into an extended Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) hierarchy, which employs a weighted combination to generate overall performance scores for teamwork and cognition. We demonstrate the approach with a case study of real-world ECR drills, providing actionable, domain specific metrics that capture individual and team performance. We also discuss how these insights can support After Action Reviews with interactive dashboards within Gamemaster and the Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), providing intuitive and understandable feedback. We conclude by addressing limitations, including tracking difficulties, ground-truth validation, and the broader applicability of our approach. Future work includes expanding analysis to 3D video data and leveraging video analysis to enable scalable evaluation within STEs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频压缩中高频细节丢失的问题，同时降低自回归视频模型的长历史记忆成本。

Method: 提出PFP神经网络结构，通过显式预训练目标压缩长视频为短上下文，保留单帧高频细节。基线模型可将20秒视频压缩至约5k长度的上下文，并支持随机帧检索。

Result: 实验表明，PFP能在低上下文成本下实现长历史记忆，且保真度损失相对较低。通过消融设置评估了框架，并讨论了神经网络设计的权衡。

Conclusion: PFP是一种有效的神经网络结构，能够将长视频压缩为短上下文，并通过预训练目标保留任意时间位置单帧的高频细节。该模型可直接微调为自回归视频模型的记忆编码器，实现低成本的长历史记忆。

Abstract: We present PFP, a neural network structure to compress long videos into short contexts, with an explicit pretraining objective to preserve the high-frequency details of single frames at arbitrary temporal positions. The baseline model can compress a 20-second video into a context at about 5k length, where random frames can be retrieved with perceptually preserved appearances. Such pretrained models can be directly fine-tuned as memory encoders for autoregressive video models, enabling long history memory with low context cost and relatively low fidelity loss. We evaluate the framework with ablative settings and discuss the trade-offs of possible neural architecture designs.

TL;DR: 本文提出终身领域自适应3D人体姿态估计任务，设计GAN框架结合多种感知知识，实验证明其有效缓解领域偏移和灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: 3D Human Pose Estimation (3D HPE) is vital in various applications, from person re-identification and action recognition to virtual reality. However, the reliance on annotated 3D data collected in controlled environments poses challenges for generalization to diverse in-the-wild scenarios. Existing domain adaptation (DA) paradigms like general DA and source-free DA for 3D HPE overlook the issues of non-stationary target pose datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel task named lifelong domain adaptive 3D HPE. To our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the lifelong domain adaptation to the 3D HPE task. In this lifelong DA setting, the pose estimator is pretrained on the source domain and subsequently adapted to distinct target domains. Moreover, during adaptation to the current target domain, the pose estimator cannot access the source and all the previous target domains. The lifelong DA for 3D HPE involves overcoming challenges in adapting to current domain poses and preserving knowledge from previous domains, particularly combating catastrophic forgetting. We present an innovative Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, which incorporates 3D pose generators, a 2D pose discriminator, and a 3D pose estimator. This framework effectively mitigates domain shifts and aligns original and augmented poses. Moreover, we construct a novel 3D pose generator paradigm, integrating pose-aware, temporal-aware, and domain-aware knowledge to enhance the current domain's adaptation and alleviate catastrophic forgetting on previous domains. Our method demonstrates superior performance through extensive experiments on diverse domain adaptive 3D HPE datasets.

### [5] [Nonlinear Noise2Noise for Efficient Monte Carlo Denoiser Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24794)
*Andrew Tinits,Stephen Mann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Noise2Noise方法通过理论分析，允许特定非线性函数应用于噪声目标图像，解决了高动态范围图像去噪中的偏差问题，无需干净目标图像即可达到良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Noise2Noise训练中非线性函数导致的偏差问题，尤其是在高动态范围图像去噪中，传统方法因非线性预处理不兼容而受限。

Method: 开发了一个理论框架来分析非线性函数对噪声目标图像的影响，并描述了一类偏差最小的非线性函数。

Result: 通过特定损失函数和色调映射函数的组合，减少了异常值的影响且引入最小偏差，使得仅使用噪声训练数据即可接近原始实现的去噪效果。

Conclusion: Noise2Noise方法通过允许对噪声目标图像应用特定非线性函数，扩展了其适用性，尤其是在高动态范围图像去噪中，无需干净目标图像即可达到接近原始实现的效果。

Abstract: The Noise2Noise method allows for training machine learning-based denoisers with pairs of input and target images where both the input and target can be noisy. This removes the need for training with clean target images, which can be difficult to obtain. However, Noise2Noise training has a major limitation: nonlinear functions applied to the noisy targets will skew the results. This bias occurs because the nonlinearity makes the expected value of the noisy targets different from the clean target image. Since nonlinear functions are common in image processing, avoiding them limits the types of preprocessing that can be performed on the noisy targets. Our main insight is that certain nonlinear functions can be applied to the noisy targets without adding significant bias to the results. We develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the effects of these nonlinearities, and describe a class of nonlinear functions with minimal bias.
  We demonstrate our method on the denoising of high dynamic range (HDR) images produced by Monte Carlo rendering. Noise2Noise training can have trouble with HDR images, where the training process is overwhelmed by outliers and performs poorly. We consider a commonly used method of addressing these training issues: applying a nonlinear tone mapping function to the model output and target images to reduce their dynamic range. This method was previously thought to be incompatible with Noise2Noise training because of the nonlinearities involved. We show that certain combinations of loss functions and tone mapping functions can reduce the effect of outliers while introducing minimal bias. We apply our method to an existing machine learning-based Monte Carlo denoiser, where the original implementation was trained with high-sample count reference images. Our results approach those of the original implementation, but are produced using only noisy training data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究通过深度学习将儿童MRI转换为合成CT，实现了高精度的颅骨和缝合线分割，为非侵入性颅骨评估提供了新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化儿科颅骨发育和缝合线骨化对于诊断和治疗生长相关颅骨疾病至关重要。MRI无辐射但无法清晰显示颅骨缝合线或评估颅骨生长，因此需要一种非侵入性方法。

Method: 研究采用深度学习驱动的管道，结合特定领域的变分自编码器，从常规儿科MRI生成感知上无法区分的颅骨sCT。

Result: sCT与真实CT的结构相似性达到99%，Frechet起始距离为1.01。颅骨分割在七个颅骨上的平均Dice系数为85%，缝合线Dice系数为80%。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种基于深度学习的管道，能够将儿童T1加权MRI转换为合成CT（sCT），实现了颅骨分割、缝合线概率热图生成及直接缝合线分割，填补了非侵入性颅骨评估的关键空白。

Abstract: Quantifying normative pediatric cranial development and suture ossification is crucial for diagnosing and treating growth-related cephalic disorders. Computed tomography (CT) is widely used to evaluate cranial and sutural deformities; however, its ionizing radiation is contraindicated in children without significant abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers radiation free scans with superior soft tissue contrast, but unlike CT, MRI cannot elucidate cranial sutures, estimate skull bone density, or assess cranial vault growth. This study proposes a deep learning driven pipeline for transforming T1 weighted MRIs of children aged 0.2 to 2 years into synthetic CTs (sCTs), predicting detailed cranial bone segmentation, generating suture probability heatmaps, and deriving direct suture segmentation from the heatmaps. With our in-house pediatric data, sCTs achieved 99% structural similarity and a Frechet inception distance of 1.01 relative to real CTs. Skull segmentation attained an average Dice coefficient of 85% across seven cranial bones, and sutures achieved 80% Dice. Equivalence of skull and suture segmentation between sCTs and real CTs was confirmed using two one sided tests (TOST p < 0.05). To our knowledge, this is the first pediatric cranial CT synthesis framework to enable suture segmentation on sCTs derived from MRI, despite MRI's limited depiction of bone and sutures. By combining robust, domain specific variational autoencoders, our method generates perceptually indistinguishable cranial sCTs from routine pediatric MRIs, bridging critical gaps in non invasive cranial evaluation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人工智能的扩展行为，以建立在高分辨率电光数据集上训练基础模型的实用技术，这些数据集的规模远超当前最先进水平。

Result: 观察到即使在如此大规模下，性能仍符合数据受限而非模型参数受限的机制。

Conclusion: 研究发现，即使在大规模数据下，性能仍受限于数据而非模型参数，这为未来遥感基础模型的数据收集策略、计算预算和优化计划提供了实用指导。

Abstract: We explore the scaling behaviors of artificial intelligence to establish practical techniques for training foundation models on high-resolution electro-optical (EO) datasets that exceed the current state-of-the-art scale by orders of magnitude. Modern multimodal machine learning (ML) applications, such as generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) systems for image captioning, search, and reasoning, depend on robust, domain-specialized encoders for non-text modalities. In natural-image domains where internet-scale data is plentiful, well-established scaling laws help optimize the joint scaling of model capacity, training compute, and dataset size. Unfortunately, these relationships are much less well-understood in high-value domains like remote sensing (RS). Using over a quadrillion pixels of commercial satellite EO data and the MITRE Federal AI Sandbox, we train progressively larger vision transformer (ViT) backbones, report success and failure modes observed at petascale, and analyze implications for bridging domain gaps across additional RS modalities. We observe that even at this scale, performance is consistent with a data limited regime rather than a model parameter-limited one. These practical insights are intended to inform data-collection strategies, compute budgets, and optimization schedules that advance the future development of frontier-scale RS foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出无监督的双层优化框架，通过任务表现自动评估超声技能，验证有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超声技能评估依赖专家监督和反馈，具有主观性和耗时性。现有自动化评估方法多采用监督学习，局限于预定义的影响因素。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新颖的双层优化框架，通过胎儿超声图像的获取任务表现来评估技能，无需依赖手动预定义的技能评级。

Abstract: Traditionally, ultrasound skill assessment has relied on expert supervision and feedback, a process known for its subjectivity and time-intensive nature. Previous works on quantitative and automated skill assessment have predominantly employed supervised learning methods, often limiting the analysis to predetermined or assumed factors considered influential in determining skill levels. In this work, we propose a novel bi-level optimisation framework that assesses fetal ultrasound skills by how well a task is performed on the acquired fetal ultrasound images, without using manually predefined skill ratings. The framework consists of a clinical task predictor and a skill predictor, which are optimised jointly by refining the two networks simultaneously. We validate the proposed method on real-world clinical ultrasound videos of scanning the fetal head. The results demonstrate the feasibility of predicting ultrasound skills by the proposed framework, which quantifies optimised task performance as a skill indicator.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床中多模态MRI数据常不完整，如何最大化利用不完整信息是重要挑战。

Method: 采用元参数化自适应模态融合（Meta-AMF）和一致性正则化模块，无需改变原始模型架构即可实现端到端优化。

Result: 在BraTS2020数据集上，平均Dice分数分别为WT 87.55、TC 79.36、ET 62.67，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的MGML框架通过元参数化自适应模态融合和一致性正则化模块，有效解决了多模态MRI数据不完整时的分割问题，并在BraTS2020和BraTS2023数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Leveraging multimodal information from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a vital role in lesion segmentation, especially for brain tumors. However, in clinical practice, multimodal MRI data are often incomplete, making it challenging to fully utilize the available information. Therefore, maximizing the utilization of this incomplete multimodal information presents a crucial research challenge. We present a novel meta-guided multi-modal learning (MGML) framework that comprises two components: meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion and consistency regularization module. The meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion (Meta-AMF) enables the model to effectively integrate information from multiple modalities under varying input conditions. By generating adaptive soft-label supervision signals based on the available modalities, Meta-AMF explicitly promotes more coherent multimodal fusion. In addition, the consistency regularization module enhances segmentation performance and implicitly reinforces the robustness and generalization of the overall framework. Notably, our approach does not alter the original model architecture and can be conveniently integrated into the training pipeline for end-to-end model optimization. We conducted extensive experiments on the public BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets. Compared to multiple state-of-the-art methods from previous years, our method achieved superior performance. On BraTS2020, for the average Dice scores across fifteen missing modality combinations, building upon the baseline, our method obtained scores of 87.55, 79.36, and 62.67 for the whole tumor (WT), the tumor core (TC), and the enhancing tumor (ET), respectively. We have made our source code publicly available at https://github.com/worldlikerr/MGML.

### [10] [RedunCut: Measurement-Driven Sampling and Accuracy Performance Modeling for Low-Cost Live Video Analytics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24386)
*Gur-Eyal Sela,Kumar Krishna Agrawal,Bharathan Balaji,Joseph Gonzalez,Ion Stoica*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RedunCut是一种新型DMSS系统，通过优化采样和准确率预测，显著降低视频分析的计算成本，适用于多样化场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态模型大小选择（DMSS）虽能降低推理成本，但现有方法在多样化工作负载（如移动视频和低准确率目标）中表现不佳，主要由于采样效率低和准确率预测不准确。

Method: RedunCut采用两阶段方法：1) 测量驱动的规划器评估采样的成本效益权衡；2) 轻量级数据驱动性能模型提升准确率预测。

Result: RedunCut在道路车辆、无人机和监控视频等多种场景中，计算成本降低14-62%，且对历史数据有限和漂移情况保持鲁棒。

Conclusion: RedunCut通过测量驱动的规划器和轻量级数据驱动性能模型，显著降低了计算成本（14-62%），并在多样化的视频类型和任务中保持了鲁棒性。

Abstract: Live video analytics (LVA) runs continuously across massive camera fleets, but inference cost with modern vision models remains high. To address this, dynamic model size selection (DMSS) is an attractive approach: it is content-aware but treats models as black boxes, and could potentially reduce cost by up to 10x without model retraining or modification. Without ground truth labels at runtime, we observe that DMSS methods use two stages per segment: (i) sampling a few models to calculate prediction statistics (e.g., confidences), then (ii) selection of the model size from those statistics. Prior systems fail to generalize to diverse workloads, particularly to mobile videos and lower accuracy targets. We identify that the failure modes stem from inefficient sampling whose cost exceeds its benefit, and inaccurate per-segment accuracy prediction.
  In this work, we present RedunCut, a new DMSS system that addresses both: It uses a measurement-driven planner that estimates the cost-benefit tradeoff of sampling, and a lightweight, data-driven performance model to improve accuracy prediction. Across road-vehicle, drone, and surveillance videos and multiple model families and tasks, RedunCut reduces compute cost by 14-62% at fixed accuracy and remains robust to limited historical data and to drift.

Conclusion: 所提出的CVGL系统通过结合DINOv2主干网络、多尺度通道重分配模块和改进的聚合模块，有效解决了跨视角地理定位中的特征聚合和对齐问题，在减少训练参数的同时实现了竞争性性能。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localisation (CVGL) aims to estimate the geographic location of a query image by matching it with images from a large-scale database. However, the significant view-point discrepancies present considerable challenges for effective feature aggregation and alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CVGL system that incorporates three key improvements. Firstly, we leverage the DINOv2 backbone with a convolution adapter fine-tuning to enhance model adaptability to cross-view variations. Secondly, we propose a multi-scale channel reallocation module to strengthen the diversity and stability of spatial representations. Finally, we propose an improved aggregation module that integrates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) routing into the feature aggregation process. Specifically, the module dynamically selects expert subspaces for the keys and values in a cross-attention framework, enabling adaptive processing of heterogeneous input domains. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance with fewer trained parameters.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的AI驱动框架在微吻合手术中实现了高精度的动作分割和技能分类，为微外科教育提供了客观、实时的反馈，有望推动标准化和数据驱动的培训协议。

Abstract: Proficiency in microanastomosis is a critical surgical skill in neurosurgery, where the ability to precisely manipulate fine instruments is crucial to successful outcomes. These procedures require sustained attention, coordinated hand movements, and highly refined motor skills, underscoring the need for objective and systematic methods to evaluate and enhance microsurgical training. Conventional assessment approaches typically rely on expert raters supervising the procedures or reviewing surgical videos, which is an inherently subjective process prone to inter-rater variability, inconsistency, and significant time investment. These limitations highlight the necessity for automated and scalable solutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel AI-driven framework for automated action segmentation and performance assessment in microanastomosis procedures, designed to operate efficiently on edge computing platforms. The proposed system comprises three main components: (1) an object tip tracking and localization module based on YOLO and DeepSORT; (2) an action segmentation module leveraging self-similarity matrix for action boundary detection and unsupervised clustering; and (3) a supervised classification module designed to evaluate surgical gesture proficiency. Experimental validation on a dataset of 58 expert-rated microanastomosis videos demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a frame-level action segmentation accuracy of 92.4% and an overall skill classification accuracy of 85.5% in replicating expert evaluations. These findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to provide objective, real-time feedback in microsurgical education, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training protocols and advancing competency assessment in high-stakes surgical environments.

Conclusion: DehazeSNN通过结合U-Net-like设计和SNNs，有效解决了CNN和Transformer在图像去雾中的局限性，提供了高质量的去雾图像，同时减少了计算负担。

Abstract: Image dehazing is a critical challenge in computer vision, essential for enhancing image clarity in hazy conditions. Traditional methods often rely on atmospheric scattering models, while recent deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, have improved performance by effectively analyzing image features. However, CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, and Transformers demand significant computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose DehazeSNN, an innovative architecture that integrates a U-Net-like design with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). DehazeSNN captures multi-scale image features while efficiently managing local and long-range dependencies. The introduction of the Orthogonal Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire Block (OLIFBlock) enhances cross-channel communication, resulting in superior dehazing performance with reduced computational burden. Our extensive experiments show that DehazeSNN is highly competitive to state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, delivering high-quality haze-free images with a smaller model size and less multiply-accumulate operations. The proposed dehazing method is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoranLiu507/DehazeSNN.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models has driven remarkable advancements in generating high-quality, temporally coherent videos from natural language descriptions. Despite these achievements, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce T2VAttack, a comprehensive study of adversarial attacks on T2V diffusion models from both semantic and temporal perspectives. Considering the inherently dynamic nature of video data, we propose two distinct attack objectives: a semantic objective to evaluate video-text alignment and a temporal objective to assess the temporal dynamics. To achieve an effective and efficient attack process, we propose two adversarial attack methods: (i) T2VAttack-S, which identifies semantically or temporally critical words in prompts and replaces them with synonyms via greedy search, and (ii) T2VAttack-I, which iteratively inserts optimized words with minimal perturbation to the prompt. By combining these objectives and strategies, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the adversarial robustness of several state-of-the-art T2V models, including ModelScope, CogVideoX, Open-Sora, and HunyuanVideo. Our experiments reveal that even minor prompt modifications, such as the substitution or insertion of a single word, can cause substantial degradation in semantic fidelity and temporal dynamics, highlighting critical vulnerabilities in current T2V diffusion models.

Abstract: This paper presents an effective solution for view extrapolation in autonomous driving scenarios. Recent approaches focus on generating shifted novel view images from given viewpoints using diffusion models. However, these methods heavily rely on priors such as LiDAR point clouds, 3D bounding boxes, and lane annotations, which demand expensive sensors or labor-intensive labeling, limiting applicability in real-world deployment. In this work, with only images and optional camera poses, we first estimate a global static point cloud and per-frame dynamic point clouds, fusing them into a unified representation. We then employ a deformable 4D Gaussian framework to reconstruct the scene. The initially trained 4D Gaussian model renders degraded and pseudo-images to train a video diffusion model. Subsequently, progressively shifted Gaussian renderings are iteratively refined by the diffusion model,and the enhanced results are incorporated back as training data for 4DGS. This process continues until extrapolation reaches the target viewpoints. Compared with baselines, our method produces higher-quality images at novel extrapolated viewpoints.

Motivation: 快速灾害响应和环境监测需要从卫星图像中检测地表变化，但由于大气噪声、季节变化和传感器伪影的复杂相互作用，这一任务极具挑战性。

Method: 训练了一个基于SATLAS基础模型的修复模型，利用全球分布的训练数据重建Sentinel-2时间序列的最后一帧，并通过预测与观测的差异检测异常。

Conclusion: 深度学习模型通过利用卫星时间序列的冗余性，能够以前所未有的灵敏度检测地表变化，为全球范围内的自动化监测提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Detecting surface changes from satellite imagery is critical for rapid disaster response and environmental monitoring, yet remains challenging due to the complex interplay between atmospheric noise, seasonal variations, and sensor artifacts. Here we show that deep learning can leverage the temporal redundancy of satellite time series to detect anomalies at unprecedented sensitivity, by learning to predict what the surface should look like in the absence of change. We train an inpainting model built upon the SATLAS foundation model to reconstruct the last frame of a Sentinel-2 time series from preceding acquisitions, using globally distributed training data spanning diverse climate zones and land cover types. When applied to regions affected by sudden surface changes, the discrepancy between prediction and observation reveals anomalies that traditional change detection methods miss. We validate our approach on earthquake-triggered surface ruptures from the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake sequence, demonstrating detection of a rift feature in Tepehan with higher sensitivity and specificity than temporal median or Reed-Xiaoli anomaly detectors. Our method reaches detection thresholds approximately three times lower than baseline approaches, providing a path towards automated, global-scale monitoring of surface changes from freely available multi-spectral satellite data.

Conclusion: GCA-ResUNet在医学图像分割中实现了分割精度与计算效率的平衡，为临床部署提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of heterogeneous anatomical structures is pivotal for computer-aided diagnosis and subsequent clinical decision-making. Although U-Net based convolutional neural networks have achieved remarkable progress, their intrinsic locality and largely homogeneous attention formulations often limit the modeling of long-range contextual dependencies, especially in multi-organ scenarios and low-contrast regions. Transformer-based architectures mitigate this issue by leveraging global self-attention, but they usually require higher computational resources and larger training data, which may impede deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments.In this paper, we propose GCA-ResUNet, an efficient medical image segmentation framework equipped with a lightweight and plug-and-play Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) module. The proposed GCA decouples channel-wise context modeling into multiple groups to explicitly account for semantic heterogeneity across channels, and integrates direction-aware coordinate encoding to capture structured spatial dependencies along horizontal and vertical axes. This design enhances global representation capability while preserving the efficiency advantages of CNN backbones. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks, Synapse and ACDC, demonstrate that GCA-ResUNet achieves Dice scores of 86.11% and 92.64%, respectively, outperforming a range of representative CNN and Transformer-based methods, including Swin-UNet and TransUNet. In particular, GCA-ResUNet yields consistent improvements in delineating small anatomical structures with complex boundaries. These results indicate that the proposed approach provides a favorable trade-off between segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical and scalable solution for clinical deployment.

Conclusion: GASeg通过结合几何和外观特征，利用拓扑信息解决了自监督语义分割中的外观模糊问题，并在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Self-supervised semantic segmentation methods often fail when faced with appearance ambiguities. We argue that this is due to an over-reliance on unstable, appearance-based features such as shadows, glare, and local textures. We propose \textbf{GASeg}, a novel framework that bridges appearance and geometry by leveraging stable topological information. The core of our method is Differentiable Box-Counting (\textbf{DBC}) module, which quantifies multi-scale topological statistics from two parallel streams: geometric-based features and appearance-based features. To force the model to learn these stable structural representations, we introduce Topological Augmentation (\textbf{TopoAug}), an adversarial strategy that simulates real-world ambiguities by applying morphological operators to the input images. A multi-objective loss, \textbf{GALoss}, then explicitly enforces cross-modal alignment between geometric-based and appearance-based features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GASeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks, including COCO-Stuff, Cityscapes, and PASCAL, validating our approach of bridging geometry and appearance via topological information.

Abstract: This work presents a novel pipeline to recover the 3D structure of an unknown target spacecraft from a sequence of images captured during Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO) in space. The target's geometry and appearance are represented as a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model. However, learning 3DGS requires static scenes, an assumption in contrast to dynamic lighting conditions encountered in spaceborne imagery. The trained 3DGS model can also be used for camera pose estimation through photometric optimization. Therefore, in addition to recovering a geometrically accurate 3DGS model, the photometric accuracy of the rendered images is imperative to downstream pose estimation tasks during the RPO process. This work proposes to incorporate the prior knowledge of the Sun's position, estimated and maintained by the servicer spacecraft, into the training pipeline for improved photometric quality of 3DGS rasterization. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, as 3DGS models trained on a sequence of images learn to adapt to rapidly changing illumination conditions in space and reflect global shadowing and self-occlusion.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that Visual Language Models (VLMs) hold great potential for tasks such as automated medical diagnosis. However, processing complex three-dimensional (3D) multimodal medical images poses significant challenges - specifically, the effective integration of complementary information and the occasional oversight of subtle yet critical pathological features. To address these issues, we present a novel two-stage fusion framework termed Hilbert-VLM. This framework leverages the HilbertMed-SAM module for precise lesion segmentation, with the generated multimodal enhanced prompts then guiding the VLM toward accurate disease classification. Our key innovation lies in the systematic redesign of the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) architecture: we incorporate Hilbert space-filling curves into the scanning mechanism of the Mamba State Space Model (SSM) to maximize the preservation of spatial locality in 3D data, a property critical for medical image analysis. We also introduce a novel Hilbert-Mamba Cross-Attention (HMCA) mechanism and a scale-aware decoder to capture fine-grained details. Meanwhile, the prompt enhancement module unifies segmentation masks and their corresponding textual attributes into an information-dense prompt to support VLM inference. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the Hilbert-VLM model. On the BraTS2021 segmentation benchmark, it achieves a Dice score of 82.35 percent, with a diagnostic classification accuracy (ACC) of 78.85 percent. These results demonstrate that the proposed model offers substantial potential to improve the accuracy and reliability of medical VLM-based analysis.

Abstract: Recent methods in flow-based diffusion editing have enabled direct transformations between source and target image distribution without explicit inversion. However, the latent trajectories in these methods often exhibit accumulated velocity errors, leading to semantic inconsistency and loss of structural fidelity. We propose Conditioned Velocity Correction (CVC), a principled framework that reformulates flow-based editing as a distribution transformation problem driven by a known source prior. CVC rethinks the role of velocity in inter-distribution transformation by introducing a dual-perspective velocity conversion mechanism. This mechanism explicitly decomposes the latent evolution into two components: a structure-preserving branch that remains consistent with the source trajectory, and a semantically-guided branch that drives a controlled deviation toward the target distribution. The conditional velocity field exhibits an absolute velocity error relative to the true underlying distribution trajectory, which inherently introduces potential instability and trajectory drift in the latent space. To address this quantifiable deviation and maintain fidelity to the true flow, we apply a posterior-consistent update to the resulting conditional velocity field. This update is derived from Empirical Bayes Inference and Tweedie correction, which ensures a mathematically grounded error compensation over time. Our method yields stable and interpretable latent dynamics, achieving faithful reconstruction alongside smooth local semantic conversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CVC consistently achieves superior fidelity, better semantic alignment, and more reliable editing behavior across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Realistic virtual try-on (VTON) concerns not only faithful rendering of garment details but also coordination of the style. Prior art typically pursues the former, but neglects a key factor that shapes the holistic style -- garment fit. Garment fit delineates how a garment aligns with the body of a wearer and is a fundamental element in fashion design. In this work, we introduce fit-aware VTON and present FitControler, a learnable plug-in that can seamlessly integrate into modern VTON models to enable customized fit control. To achieve this, we highlight two challenges: i) how to delineate layouts of different fits and ii) how to render the garment that matches the layout. FitControler first features a fit-aware layout generator to redraw the body-garment layout conditioned on a set of delicately processed garment-agnostic representations, and a multi-scale fit injector is then used to deliver layout cues to enable layout-driven VTON. In particular, we build a fit-aware VTON dataset termed Fit4Men, including 13,000 body-garment pairs of different fits, covering both tops and bottoms, and featuring varying camera distances and body poses. Two fit consistency metrics are also introduced to assess the fitness of generations. Extensive experiments show that FitControler can work with various VTON models and achieve accurate fit control. Code and data will be released.

TL;DR: A structure-guided 2DGS method improves RD efficiency by coupling image structure with capacity and precision allocation, achieving significant bitrate savings without sacrificing speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2DGS pipelines inefficiently allocate representation capacity and parameter precision, limiting RD efficiency at low bitrates.

Method: The approach includes structure-guided initialization, adaptive bitwidth quantization during fine-tuning, and geometry-consistent regularization to align Gaussian orientations with local gradients.

Result: The method reduces BD-rate by 43.44% on Kodak and 29.91% on DIV2K, maintaining over 1000 FPS decoding.

Conclusion: The proposed structure-guided allocation principle for 2DGS significantly enhances both representational power and RD performance while maintaining high decoding speed, achieving substantial BD-rate reductions on standard datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) have demonstrated its potential as a compact image representation with millisecond-level decoding. However, existing 2DGS-based pipelines allocate representation capacity and parameter precision largely oblivious to image structure, limiting their rate-distortion (RD) efficiency at low bitrates. To address this, we propose a structure-guided allocation principle for 2DGS, which explicitly couples image structure with both representation capacity and quantization precision, while preserving native decoding speed. First, we introduce a structure-guided initialization that assigns 2D Gaussians according to spatial structural priors inherent in natural images, yielding a localized and semantically meaningful distribution. Second, during quantization-aware fine-tuning, we propose adaptive bitwidth quantization of covariance parameters, which grants higher precision to small-scale Gaussians in complex regions and lower precision elsewhere, enabling RD-aware optimization, thereby reducing redundancy without degrading edge quality. Third, we impose a geometry-consistent regularization that aligns Gaussian orientations with local gradient directions to better preserve structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves both the representational power and the RD performance of 2DGS while maintaining over 1000 FPS decoding. Compared with the baseline GSImage, we reduce BD-rate by 43.44% on Kodak and 29.91% on DIV2K.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit strong performance across various tasks. However, these VLMs encounter significant challenges when applied to the remote sensing domain due to the inherent differences between remote sensing images and natural images. Existing remote sensing VLMs often fail to extract fine-grained visual features and suffer from visual forgetting during deep language processing. To address this, we introduce MF-RSVLM, a Multi-Feature Fusion Remote Sensing Vision--Language Model that effectively extracts and fuses visual features for RS understanding. MF-RSVLM learns multi-scale visual representations and combines global context with local details, improving the capture of small and complex structures in RS scenes. A recurrent visual feature injection scheme ensures the language model remains grounded in visual evidence and reduces visual forgetting during generation. Extensive experiments on diverse RS benchmarks show that MF-RSVLM achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across remote sensing classification, image captioning, and VQA tasks.

Conclusion: RSAgent通过多轮工具调用实现了文本引导的对象分割，显著提升了零样本性能和在域外基准上的表现。

Abstract: Text-guided object segmentation requires both cross-modal reasoning and pixel grounding abilities. Most recent methods treat text-guided segmentation as one-shot grounding, where the model predicts pixel prompts in a single forward pass to drive an external segmentor, which limits verification, refocusing and refinement when initial localization is wrong. To address this limitation, we propose RSAgent, an agentic Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) which interleaves reasoning and action for segmentation via multi-turn tool invocations. RSAgent queries a segmentation toolbox, observes visual feedback, and revises its spatial hypothesis using historical observations to re-localize targets and iteratively refine masks. We further build a data pipeline to synthesize multi-turn reasoning segmentation trajectories, and train RSAgent with a two-stage framework: cold-start supervised fine-tuning followed by agentic reinforcement learning with fine-grained, task-specific rewards. Extensive experiments show that RSAgent achieves a zero-shot performance of 66.5% gIoU on ReasonSeg test, improving over Seg-Zero-7B by 9%, and reaches 81.5% cIoU on RefCOCOg, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

Abstract: Long-form video editing poses unique challenges due to the exponential increase in the computational cost from joint editing and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion across extended sequences. To address these limitations, we propose PipeFlow, a scalable, pipelined video editing method that introduces three key innovations: First, based on a motion analysis using Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Optical Flow, we identify and propose to skip editing of frames with low motion. Second, we propose a pipelined task scheduling algorithm that splits a video into multiple segments and performs DDIM inversion and joint editing in parallel based on available GPU memory. Lastly, we leverage a neural network-based interpolation technique to smooth out the border frames between segments and interpolate the previously skipped frames. Our method uniquely scales to longer videos by dividing them into smaller segments, allowing PipeFlow's editing time to increase linearly with video length. In principle, this enables editing of infinitely long videos without the growing per-frame computational overhead encountered by other methods. PipeFlow achieves up to a 9.6X speedup compared to TokenFlow and a 31.7X speedup over Diffusion Motion Transfer (DMT).

Abstract: Image denoising is an important problem in low-level vision and serves as a critical module for many image recovery tasks. Anisotropic diffusion is a wide family of image denoising approaches with promising performance. However, traditional anisotropic diffusion approaches use explicit diffusion operators which are not well adapted to complex image structures. As a result, their performance is limited compared to recent learning-based approaches. In this work, we describe a trainable anisotropic diffusion framework based on reinforcement learning. By modeling the denoising process as a series of naive diffusion actions with order learned by deep Q-learning, we propose an effective diffusion-based image denoiser. The diffusion actions selected by deep Q-learning at different iterations indeed composite a stochastic anisotropic diffusion process with strong adaptivity to different image structures, which enjoys improvement over the traditional ones. The proposed denoiser is applied to removing three types of often-seen noise. The experiments show that it outperforms existing diffusion-based methods and competes with the representative deep CNN-based methods.

However, since it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to collect large-scale and well-annotated data, the annotation of multi-modal data inevitably contains some noise. This will degrade the retrieval performance of the model. To tackle the problem, numerous robust CMR methods have been developed, including robust learning paradigms, label calibration strategies, and instance selection mechanisms. Unfortunately, they often fail to simultaneously satisfy model performance ceilings, calibration reliability, and data utilization rate. To overcome the limitations, we propose a novel robust cross-modal learning framework, namely Neighbor-aware Instance Refining with Noisy Labels (NIRNL). Specifically, we first propose Cross-modal Margin Preserving (CMP) to adjust the relative distance between positive and negative pairs, thereby enhancing the discrimination between sample pairs. Then, we propose Neighbor-aware Instance Refining (NIR) to identify pure subset, hard subset, and noisy subset through cross-modal neighborhood consensus. Afterward, we construct different tailored optimization strategies for this fine-grained partitioning, thereby maximizing the utilization of all available data while mitigating error propagation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that NIRNL achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting remarkable robustness, especially under high noise rates.

Abstract: Pathology context and expert experience play significant roles in clinical ocular disease diagnosis. Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have good ocular disease recognition results, they often ignore exploring the clinical pathology context and expert experience priors to improve ocular disease recognition performance and decision-making interpretability. To this end, we first develop a novel Pathology Recalibration Module (PRM) to leverage the potential of pathology context prior via the combination of the well-designed pixel-wise context compression operator and pathology distribution concentration operator; then this paper applies a novel expert prior Guidance Adapter (EPGA) to further highlight significant pixel-wise representation regions by fully mining the expert experience prior. By incorporating PRM and EPGA into the modern DNN, the PCRNet is constructed for automated ocular disease recognition. Additionally, we introduce an Integrated Loss (IL) to boost the ocular disease recognition performance of PCRNet by considering the effects of sample-wise loss distributions and training label frequencies. The extensive experiments on three ocular disease datasets demonstrate the superiority of PCRNet with IL over state-of-the-art attention-based networks and advanced loss methods. Further visualization analysis explains the inherent behavior of PRM and EPGA that affects the decision-making process of DNNs.

Conclusion: 该方法在三个具有层次标注的细粒度数据集上表现优于现有技术，验证了平衡层次对比损失和解耦学习策略的有效性。

Abstract: Fine-grained remote sensing datasets often use hierarchical label structures to differentiate objects in a coarse-to-fine manner, with each object annotated across multiple levels. However, embedding this semantic hierarchy into the representation learning space to improve fine-grained detection performance remains challenging. Previous studies have applied supervised contrastive learning at different hierarchical levels to group objects under the same parent class while distinguishing sibling subcategories. Nevertheless, they overlook two critical issues: (1) imbalanced data distribution across the label hierarchy causes high-frequency classes to dominate the learning process, and (2) learning semantic relationships among categories interferes with class-agnostic localization. To address these issues, we propose a balanced hierarchical contrastive loss combined with a decoupled learning strategy within the detection transformer (DETR) framework. The proposed loss introduces learnable class prototypes and equilibrates gradients contributed by different classes at each hierarchical level, ensuring that each hierarchical class contributes equally to the loss computation in every mini-batch. The decoupled strategy separates DETR's object queries into classification and localization sets, enabling task-specific feature extraction and optimization. Experiments on three fine-grained datasets with hierarchical annotations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: RainFusion2.0成功提出了一种在线自适应、硬件高效且低开销的稀疏注意力机制，显著降低了Diffusion Transformer模型的计算成本，同时在多种硬件平台上保持了稳健的性能。

Abstract: In video and image generation tasks, Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models incur extremely high computational costs due to attention mechanisms, which limits their practical applications. Furthermore, with hardware advancements, a wide range of devices besides graphics processing unit (GPU), such as application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), have been increasingly adopted for model inference. Sparse attention, which leverages the inherent sparsity of attention by skipping computations for insignificant tokens, is an effective approach to mitigate computational costs. However, existing sparse attention methods have two critical limitations: the overhead of sparse pattern prediction and the lack of hardware generality, as most of these methods are designed for GPU. To address these challenges, this study proposes RainFusion2.0, which aims to develop an online adaptive, hardware-efficient, and low-overhead sparse attention mechanism to accelerate both video and image generative models, with robust performance across diverse hardware platforms. Key technical insights include: (1) leveraging block-wise mean values as representative tokens for sparse mask prediction; (2) implementing spatiotemporal-aware token permutation; and (3) introducing a first-frame sink mechanism specifically designed for video generation scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RainFusion2.0 can achieve 80% sparsity while achieving an end-to-end speedup of 1.5~1.8x without compromising video quality. Moreover, RainFusion2.0 demonstrates effectiveness across various generative models and validates its generalization across diverse hardware platforms.

Conclusion: D$^2$VLM框架通过解耦学习时间定位和文本响应任务，并引入证据标记和因子化偏好优化算法，显著提升了视频语言模型在事件级感知上的性能。

Abstract: Recent video-language models have shown great potential for video understanding, but still struggle with accurate temporal grounding for event-level perception. We observe that two main factors in video understanding (i.e., temporal grounding and textual response) form a logical hierarchy: accurate temporal evidence grounding lays the foundation for reliable textual response. However, existing works typically handle these two tasks in a coupled manner without a clear logical structure, leading to sub-optimal objectives. We address this from a factorized learning perspective. We first propose D$^2$VLM, a framework that decouples the learning of these two tasks while also emphasizing their inherent dependency. We adopt a "grounding then answering with evidence referencing" paradigm and introduce evidence tokens for evidence grounding, which emphasize event-level visual semantic capture beyond the focus on timestamp representation in existing works. To further facilitate the learning of these two tasks, we introduce a novel factorized preference optimization (FPO) algorithm. Unlike standard preference optimization, FPO explicitly incorporates probabilistic temporal grounding modeling into the optimization objective, enabling preference learning for both temporal grounding and textual response. We also construct a synthetic dataset to address the lack of suitable datasets for factorized preference learning with explicit temporal grounding. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate the clear advantage of our approach. Our source code is available at https://github.com/nusnlp/d2vlm.

Conclusion: 论文提出Latent Motion Reasoning（LMR）框架，通过两阶段的‘思考-行动’决策过程，有效解决了语义-运动阻抗不匹配问题，验证了运动规划的最优基础是学习的运动对齐概念空间。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art paradigms predominantly treat Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation as a direct translation problem, mapping symbolic language directly to continuous poses. While effective for simple actions, this System 1 approach faces a fundamental theoretical bottleneck we identify as the Semantic-Kinematic Impedance Mismatch: the inherent difficulty of grounding semantically dense, discrete linguistic intent into kinematically dense, high-frequency motion data in a single shot. In this paper, we argue that the solution lies in an architectural shift towards Latent System 2 Reasoning. Drawing inspiration from Hierarchical Motor Control in cognitive science, we propose Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR) that reformulates generation as a two-stage Think-then-Act decision process. Central to LMR is a novel Dual-Granularity Tokenizer that disentangles motion into two distinct manifolds: a compressed, semantically rich Reasoning Latent for planning global topology, and a high-frequency Execution Latent for preserving physical fidelity. By forcing the model to autoregressively reason (plan the coarse trajectory) before it moves (instantiates the frames), we effectively bridge the ineffability gap between language and physics. We demonstrate LMR's versatility by implementing it for two representative baselines: T2M-GPT (discrete) and MotionStreamer (continuous). Extensive experiments show that LMR yields non-trivial improvements in both semantic alignment and physical plausibility, validating that the optimal substrate for motion planning is not natural language, but a learned, motion-aligned concept space.

Abstract: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) serves as a core perception module in autonomous driving systems, but it remains highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. Errors in depth estimation may propagate through downstream decision making and influence overall traffic safety. Existing physical attacks primarily rely on texture-based patches, which impose strict placement constraints and exhibit limited realism, thereby reducing their effectiveness in complex driving environments. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces a training-free generative adversarial attack framework that generates naturalistic, scene-consistent adversarial objects via a diffusion-based conditional generation process. The framework incorporates a Salient Region Selection module that identifies regions most influential to MDE and a Jacobian Vector Product Guidance mechanism that steers adversarial gradients toward update directions supported by the pre-trained diffusion model. This formulation enables the generation of physically plausible adversarial objects capable of inducing substantial adversarial depth shifts. Extensive digital and physical experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing attacks in effectiveness, stealthiness, and physical deployability, underscoring its strong practical implications for autonomous driving safety assessment.

Method: 通过 TrustGeoGen 生成六个经过正式验证的任务，系统评估从属性提取到逻辑错误纠正的能力。

Result: 实验显示，虽然推理模型如 OpenAI-o3 表现优于通用 MLLMs，但随着任务复杂性增加，性能显著下降。子目标分解和无关前提过滤对最终问题解决准确性有重要影响，而 Chain-of-Thought 提示在某些任务中意外降低了性能。

Conclusion: GeoBench 作为一个全面的基准测试，为开发几何问题解决系统提供了可操作的指导方针。

Abstract: Geometric problem solving constitutes a critical branch of mathematical reasoning, requiring precise analysis of shapes and spatial relationships. Current evaluations of geometric reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) face limitations, including the risk of test data contamination from textbook-based benchmarks, overemphasis on final answers over reasoning processes, and insufficient diagnostic granularity. To address these issues, we present GeoBench, a hierarchical benchmark featuring four reasoning levels in geometric problem-solving: Visual Perception, Goal-Oriented Planning, Rigorous Theorem Application, and Self-Reflective Backtracking. Through six formally verified tasks generated via TrustGeoGen, we systematically assess capabilities ranging from attribute extraction to logical error correction. Experiments reveal that while reasoning models like OpenAI-o3 outperform general MLLMs, performance declines significantly with increasing task complexity. Key findings demonstrate that sub-goal decomposition and irrelevant premise filtering critically influence final problem-solving accuracy, whereas Chain-of-Thought prompting unexpectedly degrades performance in some tasks. These findings establish GeoBench as a comprehensive benchmark while offering actionable guidelines for developing geometric problem-solving systems.

Abstract: Automated neural network architecture design remains a significant challenge in computer vision. Task diversity and computational constraints require both effective architectures and efficient search methods. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising alternative to computationally intensive Neural Architecture Search (NAS), but their application to architecture generation in computer vision has not been systematically studied, particularly regarding prompt engineering and validation strategies. Building on the task-agnostic NNGPT/LEMUR framework, this work introduces and validates two key contributions for computer vision. First, we present Few-Shot Architecture Prompting (FSAP), the first systematic study of the number of supporting examples (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) for LLM-based architecture generation. We find that using n = 3 examples best balances architectural diversity and context focus for vision tasks. Second, we introduce Whitespace-Normalized Hash Validation, a lightweight deduplication method (less than 1 ms) that provides a 100x speedup over AST parsing and prevents redundant training of duplicate computer vision architectures. In large-scale experiments across seven computer vision benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CelebA, ImageNette, SVHN, Places365), we generated 1,900 unique architectures. We also introduce a dataset-balanced evaluation methodology to address the challenge of comparing architectures across heterogeneous vision tasks. These contributions provide actionable guidelines for LLM-based architecture search in computer vision and establish rigorous evaluation practices, making automated design more accessible to researchers with limited computational resources.

Conclusion: D$^2$-Align框架通过方向性修正奖励信号，有效缓解了偏好模式崩溃（PMC），在保持生成多样性的同时，实现了与人类偏好的更好对齐。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated significant progress in aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preference via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. However, while existing methods achieve high scores on automated reward metrics, they often lead to Preference Mode Collapse (PMC)-a specific form of reward hacking where models converge on narrow, high-scoring outputs (e.g., images with monolithic styles or pervasive overexposure), severely degrading generative diversity. In this work, we introduce and quantify this phenomenon, proposing DivGenBench, a novel benchmark designed to measure the extent of PMC. We posit that this collapse is driven by over-optimization along the reward model's inherent biases. Building on this analysis, we propose Directional Decoupling Alignment (D$^2$-Align), a novel framework that mitigates PMC by directionally correcting the reward signal. Specifically, our method first learns a directional correction within the reward model's embedding space while keeping the model frozen. This correction is then applied to the reward signal during the optimization process, preventing the model from collapsing into specific modes and thereby maintaining diversity. Our comprehensive evaluation, combining qualitative analysis with quantitative metrics for both quality and diversity, reveals that D$^2$-Align achieves superior alignment with human preference.

Motivation: 传统的监督学习依赖硬目标，可能导致过自信、校准性差、泛化能力弱和鲁棒性不足。自蒸馏方法虽试图缓解这些问题，但仍依赖硬目标，效果有限。

Method: 提出了一种名为贝叶斯自蒸馏（BSD）的方法，利用模型的自身预测通过贝叶斯推理构建样本特定的目标分布。

Result: BSD在多种深度架构和数据集上表现出色，例如在CIFAR-100上，ResNet-50的测试准确率提高了1.4%，预期校准误差降低了40%。此外，BSD还提升了模型对数据损坏、扰动和标签噪声的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BSD方法通过贝叶斯推理构建样本特定的目标分布，显著提升了测试准确性和校准性，同时增强了模型对数据损坏、扰动和标签噪声的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Supervised training of deep neural networks for classification typically relies on hard targets, which promote overconfidence and can limit calibration, generalization, and robustness. Self-distillation methods aim to mitigate this by leveraging inter-class and sample-specific information present in the model's own predictions, but often remain dependent on hard targets, reducing their effectiveness. With this in mind, we propose Bayesian Self-Distillation (BSD), a principled method for constructing sample-specific target distributions via Bayesian inference using the model's own predictions. Unlike existing approaches, BSD does not rely on hard targets after initialization. BSD consistently yields higher test accuracy (e.g. +1.4% for ResNet-50 on CIFAR-100) and significantly lower Expected Calibration Error (ECE) (-40% ResNet-50, CIFAR-100) than existing architecture-preserving self-distillation methods for a range of deep architectures and datasets. Additional benefits include improved robustness against data corruptions, perturbations, and label noise. When combined with a contrastive loss, BSD achieves state-of-the-art robustness under label noise for single-stage, single-network methods.

Abstract: A long-standing objective in humanoid robotics is the realization of versatile agents capable of following diverse multimodal instructions with human-level flexibility. Despite advances in humanoid control, bridging high-level multimodal perception with whole-body execution remains a significant bottleneck. Existing methods often struggle to translate heterogeneous instructions -- such as language, music, and trajectories -- into stable, real-time actions. Here we show that UniAct, a two-stage framework integrating a fine-tuned MLLM with a causal streaming pipeline, enables humanoid robots to execute multimodal instructions with sub-500 ms latency. By unifying inputs through a shared discrete codebook via FSQ, UniAct ensures cross-modal alignment while constraining motions to a physically grounded manifold. This approach yields a 19% improvement in the success rate of zero-shot tracking of imperfect reference motions. We validate UniAct on UniMoCap, our 20-hour humanoid motion benchmark, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse real-world scenarios. Our results mark a critical step toward responsive, general-purpose humanoid assistants capable of seamless interaction through unified perception and control.

Abstract: While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have attained significant strides in multimodal reasoning, their reasoning processes remain predominantly text-centric, leading to suboptimal performance in complex long-horizon, vision-centric tasks. In this paper, we establish a novel Generative Multimodal Reasoning paradigm and introduce DiffThinker, a diffusion-based reasoning framework. Conceptually, DiffThinker reformulates multimodal reasoning as a native generative image-to-image task, achieving superior logical consistency and spatial precision in vision-centric tasks. We perform a systematic comparison between DiffThinker and MLLMs, providing the first in-depth investigation into the intrinsic characteristics of this paradigm, revealing four core properties: efficiency, controllability, native parallelism, and collaboration. Extensive experiments across four domains (sequential planning, combinatorial optimization, constraint satisfaction, and spatial configuration) demonstrate that DiffThinker significantly outperforms leading closed source models including GPT-5 (+314.2\%) and Gemini-3-Flash (+111.6\%), as well as the fine-tuned Qwen3-VL-32B baseline (+39.0\%), highlighting generative multimodal reasoning as a promising approach for vision-centric reasoning.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of autonomous systems, including self-driving vehicles and drones, has intensified the need to forge true Spatial Intelligence from multi-modal onboard sensor data. While foundation models excel in single-modal contexts, integrating their capabilities across diverse sensors like cameras and LiDAR to create a unified understanding remains a formidable challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for multi-modal pre-training, identifying the core set of techniques driving progress toward this goal. We dissect the interplay between foundational sensor characteristics and learning strategies, evaluating the role of platform-specific datasets in enabling these advancements. Our central contribution is the formulation of a unified taxonomy for pre-training paradigms: ranging from single-modality baselines to sophisticated unified frameworks that learn holistic representations for advanced tasks like 3D object detection and semantic occupancy prediction. Furthermore, we investigate the integration of textual inputs and occupancy representations to facilitate open-world perception and planning. Finally, we identify critical bottlenecks, such as computational efficiency and model scalability, and propose a roadmap toward general-purpose multi-modal foundation models capable of achieving robust Spatial Intelligence for real-world deployment.

*Yu-Tang Chang,Pin-Wei Chen,Shih-Fang Chen*

TL;DR: DGC是一种内存高效的高光谱图像分割框架，无需预训练，但在多目标损失平衡上存在优化不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱成像分析因数据量大而面临计算瓶颈，现有预训练模型在特定领域（如农业监测）中表现不佳。

Method: Deep Global Clustering (DGC) 是一种内存高效的高光谱图像分割框架，通过局部补丁观察学习全局聚类结构，无需预训练。

Result: 在叶片病害数据集上，DGC实现了背景与组织的分离（平均IoU 0.925），并展示了通过可导航语义粒度进行无监督病害检测的能力。

Conclusion: DGC框架在概念上具有潜力，但需要解决多目标损失平衡的优化不稳定性问题，以实现稳定的实现。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) analysis faces computational bottlenecks due to massive data volumes that exceed available memory. While foundation models pre-trained on large remote sensing datasets show promise, their learned representations often fail to transfer to domain-specific applications like close-range agricultural monitoring where spectral signatures, spatial scales, and semantic targets differ fundamentally. This report presents Deep Global Clustering (DGC), a conceptual framework for memory-efficient HSI segmentation that learns global clustering structure from local patch observations without pre-training. DGC operates on small patches with overlapping regions to enforce consistency, enabling training in under 30 minutes on consumer hardware while maintaining constant memory usage. On a leaf disease dataset, DGC achieves background-tissue separation (mean IoU 0.925) and demonstrates unsupervised disease detection through navigable semantic granularity. However, the framework suffers from optimization instability rooted in multi-objective loss balancing: meaningful representations emerge rapidly but degrade due to cluster over-merging in feature space. We position this work as intellectual scaffolding - the design philosophy has merit, but stable implementation requires principled approaches to dynamic loss balancing.

TL;DR: IG 策略通过中间层监督和外推，显著提升了扩散模型的训练效率和生成质量，尤其在结合 CFG 后达到 SOTA 性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准 CFG 常导致样本过度简化或失真，而其他引导方法受限于复杂的退化策略、额外训练和采样步骤。IG 旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了一种简单有效的策略 Internal Guidance (IG)，通过在训练过程中引入中间层的辅助监督，并在采样过程中外推中间层和深层的输出来生成结果。

Result: 在 ImageNet 256x256 上，SiT-XL/2+IG 在 80 和 800 轮时分别达到 FID=5.31 和 1.75；LightningDiT-XL/1+IG 更是达到 FID=1.34，结合 CFG 后达到 FID=1.19。

Conclusion: Internal Guidance (IG) 策略在训练效率和生成质量上均取得了显著提升，尤其在结合 CFG 后达到了当前最佳性能（FID=1.19）。

Abstract: The diffusion model presents a powerful ability to capture the entire (conditional) data distribution. However, due to the lack of sufficient training and data to learn to cover low-probability areas, the model will be penalized for failing to generate high-quality images corresponding to these areas. To achieve better generation quality, guidance strategies such as classifier free guidance (CFG) can guide the samples to the high-probability areas during the sampling stage. However, the standard CFG often leads to over-simplified or distorted samples. On the other hand, the alternative line of guiding diffusion model with its bad version is limited by carefully designed degradation strategies, extra training and additional sampling steps. In this paper, we proposed a simple yet effective strategy Internal Guidance (IG), which introduces an auxiliary supervision on the intermediate layer during training process and extrapolates the intermediate and deep layer's outputs to obtain generative results during sampling process. This simple strategy yields significant improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality on various baselines. On ImageNet 256x256, SiT-XL/2+IG achieves FID=5.31 and FID=1.75 at 80 and 800 epochs. More impressively, LightningDiT-XL/1+IG achieves FID=1.34 which achieves a large margin between all of these methods. Combined with CFG, LightningDiT-XL/1+IG achieves the current state-of-the-art FID of 1.19.

TL;DR: PointRAFT是一种直接从部分点云预测马铃薯重量的高通量回归网络，显著提高了重量预测精度并满足商业化收割机的高通量需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于RGB-D图像重建的点云因自遮挡而不完整，导致马铃薯重量系统性低估，因此需要一种方法直接从部分点云预测连续3D形状属性。

Method: 引入了PointRAFT，一种高通量的点云回归网络，通过对象高度嵌入结合马铃薯高度作为额外的几何线索，直接从原始3D数据推断目标值。

Result: 在5,254个点云的测试集上，PointRAFT的平均绝对误差为12.0克，均方根误差为17.2克，显著优于线性回归基线和标准PointNet++回归网络，且平均推理时间为6.3毫秒每点云。

Conclusion: PointRAFT是一种高效的点云回归网络，能够直接从部分点云预测马铃薯的重量，满足商业化马铃薯收割机的高通量需求，并适用于广泛的3D表型和机器人感知任务。

Abstract: Potato yield is a key indicator for optimizing cultivation practices in agriculture. Potato yield can be estimated on harvesters using RGB-D cameras, which capture three-dimensional (3D) information of individual tubers moving along the conveyor belt. However, point clouds reconstructed from RGB-D images are incomplete due to self-occlusion, leading to systematic underestimation of tuber weight. To address this, we introduce PointRAFT, a high-throughput point cloud regression network that directly predicts continuous 3D shape properties, such as tuber weight, from partial point clouds. Rather than reconstructing full 3D geometry, PointRAFT infers target values directly from raw 3D data. Its key architectural novelty is an object height embedding that incorporates tuber height as an additional geometric cue, improving weight prediction under practical harvesting conditions. PointRAFT was trained and evaluated on 26,688 partial point clouds collected from 859 potato tubers across four cultivars and three growing seasons on an operational harvester in Japan. On a test set of 5,254 point clouds from 172 tubers, PointRAFT achieved a mean absolute error of 12.0 g and a root mean squared error of 17.2 g, substantially outperforming a linear regression baseline and a standard PointNet++ regression network. With an average inference time of 6.3 ms per point cloud, PointRAFT supports processing rates of up to 150 tubers per second, meeting the high-throughput requirements of commercial potato harvesters. Beyond potato weight estimation, PointRAFT provides a versatile regression network applicable to a wide range of 3D phenotyping and robotic perception tasks. The code, network weights, and a subset of the dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/pieterblok/pointraft.git.

TL;DR: CropTrack 是一种结合外观和运动信息的多目标跟踪框架，针对农业环境中的挑战优化，显著提升了跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业环境中的多目标跟踪面临重复模式、相似外观、光照突变和频繁遮挡等挑战，现有基于运动的跟踪方法在频繁遮挡下难以保持目标身份。

Method: CropTrack 整合了重新排名增强的外观关联、一对多关联与基于外观的冲突解决策略，以及指数移动平均原型特征库。

Result: 在公开农业 MOT 数据集上，CropTrack 在身份保持和关联准确性上表现优于传统基于运动的方法，身份切换次数更少。

Conclusion: CropTrack 通过结合外观和运动信息，显著提升了农业环境中多目标跟踪的性能，尤其是在身份保持和关联准确性方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Multiple-object tracking (MOT) in agricultural environments presents major challenges due to repetitive patterns, similar object appearances, sudden illumination changes, and frequent occlusions. Contemporary trackers in this domain rely on the motion of objects rather than appearance for association. Nevertheless, they struggle to maintain object identities when targets undergo frequent and strong occlusions. The high similarity of object appearances makes integrating appearance-based association nontrivial for agricultural scenarios. To solve this problem we propose CropTrack, a novel MOT framework based on the combination of appearance and motion information. CropTrack integrates a reranking-enhanced appearance association, a one-to-many association with appearance-based conflict resolution strategy, and an exponential moving average prototype feature bank to improve appearance-based association. Evaluated on publicly available agricultural MOT datasets, CropTrack demonstrates consistent identity preservation, outperforming traditional motion-based tracking methods. Compared to the state of the art, CropTrack achieves significant gains in identification F1 and association accuracy scores with a lower number of identity switches.

TL;DR: CorGi和CorGi+是无需训练的DiT加速框架，通过选择性重用块输出减少冗余计算，实现2.0倍加速且保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiT模型的迭代去噪过程存在大量冗余计算，导致推理成本高。

Method: 提出了CorGi（基于贡献的块级间隔缓存）和CorGi+（利用跨注意力图保护重要细节），通过缓存低贡献块并在后续步骤中重用，减少冗余计算。

Result: 在文本到图像任务中，CorGi和CorGi+平均实现了2.0倍的加速，同时保持了高生成质量。

Conclusion: CorGi和CorGi+通过选择性重用DiT中的Transformer块输出，有效减少了冗余计算，在保持生成质量的同时实现了高达2.0倍的加速。

Abstract: Diffusion transformer (DiT) achieves remarkable performance in visual generation, but its iterative denoising process combined with larger capacity leads to a high inference cost. Recent works have demonstrated that the iterative denoising process of DiT models involves substantial redundant computation across steps. To effectively reduce the redundant computation in DiT, we propose CorGi (Contribution-Guided Block-Wise Interval Caching), training-free DiT inference acceleration framework that selectively reuses the outputs of transformer blocks in DiT across denoising steps. CorGi caches low-contribution blocks and reuses them in later steps within each interval to reduce redundant computation while preserving generation quality. For text-to-image tasks, we further propose CorGi+, which leverages per-block cross-attention maps to identify salient tokens and applies partial attention updates to protect important object details. Evaluation on the state-of-the-art DiT models demonstrates that CorGi and CorGi+ achieve up to 2.0x speedup on average, while preserving high generation quality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索MLLMs在具身代理任务中的潜力，尤其是在需要多轮对话、空间推理和序列动作预测的视觉与语言导航（VLN）任务中。

Method: 通过引入统一的、可扩展的评估框架VLN-MME，将传统导航数据集转化为标准化基准，简化评估过程，支持模块化设计和组件级消融实验。

Result: 发现增强基线代理的Chain-of-Thought推理和自反思能力反而导致性能下降，表明MLLMs在具身导航任务中的上下文感知能力较差，3D空间推理保真度低。

Conclusion: VLN-MME框架为多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在具身导航任务中的系统评估奠定了基础，揭示了其在序列决策能力上的局限性，为后续训练提供了关键指导。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, their performance as embodied agents, which requires multi-round dialogue spatial reasoning and sequential action prediction, needs further exploration. Our work investigates this potential in the context of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) by introducing a unified and extensible evaluation framework to probe MLLMs as zero-shot agents by bridging traditional navigation datasets into a standardized benchmark, named VLN-MME. We simplify the evaluation with a highly modular and accessible design. This flexibility streamlines experiments, enabling structured comparisons and component-level ablations across diverse MLLM architectures, agent designs, and navigation tasks. Crucially, enabled by our framework, we observe that enhancing our baseline agent with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and self-reflection leads to an unexpected performance decrease. This suggests MLLMs exhibit poor context awareness in embodied navigation tasks; although they can follow instructions and structure their output, their 3D spatial reasoning fidelity is low. VLN-MME lays the groundwork for systematic evaluation of general-purpose MLLMs in embodied navigation settings and reveals limitations in their sequential decision-making capabilities. We believe these findings offer crucial guidance for MLLM post-training as embodied agents.

Abstract: The challenge of imbalanced data is prominent in medical image classification. This challenge arises when there is a significant disparity in the number of images belonging to a particular class, such as the presence or absence of a specific disease, as compared to the number of images belonging to other classes. This issue is especially notable during pandemics, which may result in an even more significant imbalance in the dataset. Researchers have employed various approaches in recent years to detect COVID-19 infected individuals accurately and quickly, with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms at the forefront. However, the lack of sufficient and balanced data remains a significant obstacle to these methods. This study addresses the challenge by proposing a progressive generative adversarial network to generate synthetic data to supplement the real ones. The proposed method suggests a weighted approach to combine synthetic data with real ones before inputting it into a deep network classifier. A multi-objective meta-heuristic population-based optimization algorithm is employed to optimize the hyper-parameters of the classifier. The proposed model exhibits superior cross-validated metrics compared to existing methods when applied to a large and imbalanced chest X-ray image dataset of COVID-19. The proposed model achieves 95.5% and 98.5% accuracy for 4-class and 2-class imbalanced classification problems, respectively. The successful experimental outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in classifying medical images using imbalanced data during pandemics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准未充分评估VLMs在低光等视觉退化条件下的性能，而这是24/7操作的核心需求。

Method: 通过物理保真度设计，在RAW空间模拟低光条件，结合ISP渲染流程，构建多级低光条件下的问答基准。

Result: 评估显示，当前VLMs和低光图像增强模型在DarkEQA基准下表现受限。

Conclusion: DarkEQA benchmark揭示了现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在低光条件下的局限性，为未来研究提供了开源工具和数据集。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly adopted as central reasoning modules for embodied agents. Existing benchmarks evaluate their capabilities under ideal, well-lit conditions, yet robust 24/7 operation demands performance under a wide range of visual degradations, including low-light conditions at night or in dark environments--a core necessity that has been largely overlooked. To address this underexplored challenge, we present DarkEQA, an open-source benchmark for evaluating EQA-relevant perceptual primitives under multi-level low-light conditions. DarkEQA isolates the perception bottleneck by evaluating question answering from egocentric observations under controlled degradations, enabling attributable robustness analysis. A key design feature of DarkEQA is its physical fidelity: visual degradations are modeled in linear RAW space, simulating physics-based illumination drop and sensor noise followed by an ISP-inspired rendering pipeline. We demonstrate the utility of DarkEQA by evaluating a wide range of state-of-the-art VLMs and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) models. Our analysis systematically reveals VLMs' limitations when operating under these challenging visual conditions. Our code and benchmark dataset will be released upon acceptance.

### [51] [ARM: A Learnable, Plug-and-Play Module for CLIP-based Open-vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24224)
*Ziquan Liu,Zhewei Zhu,Xuyang Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARM是一种轻量级模块，通过自适应特征融合提升CLIP在开放词汇语义分割中的表现，训练一次即可广泛适用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无训练方法在开放词汇语义分割（OVSS）中因依赖昂贵的外部基础模型或静态手工启发式方法而存在计算成本高或效果不佳的问题。

Method: 提出了注意力细化模块（ARM），该模块通过语义引导的交叉注意力块和自注意力块，自适应地融合层次特征，利用深层特征（K, V）选择和优化细节丰富的浅层特征（Q）。

Result: 大量实验表明，ARM在多个基准测试中持续提升基线性能，且推理开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: ARM作为一种轻量级、可学习的模块，有效释放并优化了CLIP的内部潜力，通过“训练一次，随处使用”的范式，显著提升了无训练框架在开放词汇语义分割任务中的性能。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) is fundamentally hampered by the coarse, image-level representations of CLIP, which lack precise pixel-level details. Existing training-free methods attempt to resolve this by either importing priors from costly external foundation models (e.g., SAM, DINO) or by applying static, hand-crafted heuristics to CLIP's internal features. These approaches are either computationally expensive or sub-optimal. We propose the Attention Refinement Module (ARM), a lightweight, learnable module that effectively unlocks and refines CLIP's internal potential. Unlike static-fusion methods, ARM learns to adaptively fuse hierarchical features. It employs a semantically-guided cross-attention block, using robust deep features (K, V) to select and refine detail-rich shallow features (Q), followed by a self-attention block. The key innovation lies in a ``train once, use anywhere" paradigm. Trained once on a general-purpose dataset (e.g., COCO-Stuff), ARM acts as a universal plug-and-play post-processor for diverse training-free frameworks. Extensive experiments show that ARM consistently boosts baseline performance on multiple benchmarks with negligible inference overhead, establishing an efficient and effective paradigm for training-free OVSS.

Motivation: 为了解决现有视频扩散模型在空间和时间控制上的局限性，提出了一种能够独立调整相机视角和运动序列的方法。

Method: 通过引入动画时间嵌入机制、时间扭曲训练方案、改进的相机条件机制以及CamxTime数据集，实现了对视频生成过程中空间和时间的独立控制。

Result: 模型能够重新渲染场景，实现跨空间和时间的连续任意探索，并在评估中表现出色。

Conclusion: SpaceTimePilot 展示了清晰的空间-时间解耦能力，并在真实世界和合成数据上取得了优于先前工作的结果。

Abstract: We present SpaceTimePilot, a video diffusion model that disentangles space and time for controllable generative rendering. Given a monocular video, SpaceTimePilot can independently alter the camera viewpoint and the motion sequence within the generative process, re-rendering the scene for continuous and arbitrary exploration across space and time. To achieve this, we introduce an effective animation time-embedding mechanism in the diffusion process, allowing explicit control of the output video's motion sequence with respect to that of the source video. As no datasets provide paired videos of the same dynamic scene with continuous temporal variations, we propose a simple yet effective temporal-warping training scheme that repurposes existing multi-view datasets to mimic temporal differences. This strategy effectively supervises the model to learn temporal control and achieve robust space-time disentanglement. To further enhance the precision of dual control, we introduce two additional components: an improved camera-conditioning mechanism that allows altering the camera from the first frame, and CamxTime, the first synthetic space-and-time full-coverage rendering dataset that provides fully free space-time video trajectories within a scene. Joint training on the temporal-warping scheme and the CamxTime dataset yields more precise temporal control. We evaluate SpaceTimePilot on both real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating clear space-time disentanglement and strong results compared to prior work.

Conclusion: Mirage不仅在高真实感和时间一致性方面表现出色，还能推广到其他视频到视频的转换任务，为未来研究提供了可靠的基准。

Abstract: Vision-centric autonomous driving systems rely on diverse and scalable training data to achieve robust performance. While video object editing offers a promising path for data augmentation, existing methods often struggle to maintain both high visual fidelity and temporal coherence. In this work, we propose \textbf{Mirage}, a one-step video diffusion model for photorealistic and coherent asset editing in driving scenes. Mirage builds upon a text-to-video diffusion prior to ensure temporal consistency across frames. However, 3D causal variational autoencoders often suffer from degraded spatial fidelity due to compression, and directly passing 3D encoder features to decoder layers breaks temporal causality. To address this, we inject temporally agnostic latents from a pretrained 2D encoder into the 3D decoder to restore detail while preserving causal structures. Furthermore, because scene objects and inserted assets are optimized under different objectives, their Gaussians exhibit a distribution mismatch that leads to pose misalignment. To mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage data alignment strategy combining coarse 3D alignment and fine 2D refinement, thereby improving alignment and providing cleaner supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mirage achieves high realism and temporal consistency across diverse editing scenarios. Beyond asset editing, Mirage can also generalize to other video-to-video translation tasks, serving as a reliable baseline for future research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的FER模型在多样化数据上泛化能力弱，限制了其在真实世界中的应用。MotivNet旨在解决这一问题，无需跨领域训练即可实现泛化。

Method: 使用Meta-Sapiens作为主干网络，提出MotivNet作为其下游任务，并通过基准性能、模型相似性和数据相似性三个标准评估其可行性。

Result: MotivNet在跨领域数据上表现出色，验证了其作为Sapiens下游任务的可行性，并在基准测试中与现有SOTA模型竞争。

Conclusion: MotivNet通过作为Sapiens的下游任务，验证了其在跨领域数据上的泛化能力，推动了FER在真实世界中的应用。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MotivNet, a generalizable facial emotion recognition model for robust real-world application. Current state-of-the-art FER models tend to have weak generalization when tested on diverse data, leading to deteriorated performance in the real world and hindering FER as a research domain. Though researchers have proposed complex architectures to address this generalization issue, they require training cross-domain to obtain generalizable results, which is inherently contradictory for real-world application. Our model, MotivNet, achieves competitive performance across datasets without cross-domain training by using Meta-Sapiens as a backbone. Sapiens is a human vision foundational model with state-of-the-art generalization in the real world through large-scale pretraining of a Masked Autoencoder. We propose MotivNet as an additional downstream task for Sapiens and define three criteria to evaluate MotivNet's viability as a Sapiens task: benchmark performance, model similarity, and data similarity. Throughout this paper, we describe the components of MotivNet, our training approach, and our results showing MotivNet is generalizable across domains. We demonstrate that MotivNet can be benchmarked against existing SOTA models and meets the listed criteria, validating MotivNet as a Sapiens downstream task, and making FER more incentivizing for in-the-wild application.

Conclusion: MambaSeg通过双分支结构和双维度交互模块（DDIM）有效融合RGB和事件数据，实现了高效、可扩展且鲁棒的多模态感知，显著提升了语义分割性能并降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision with wide-ranging applications, including autonomous driving and robotics. While RGB-based methods have achieved strong performance with CNNs and Transformers, their effectiveness degrades under fast motion, low-light, or high dynamic range conditions due to limitations of frame cameras. Event cameras offer complementary advantages such as high temporal resolution and low latency, yet lack color and texture, making them insufficient on their own. To address this, recent research has explored multimodal fusion of RGB and event data; however, many existing approaches are computationally expensive and focus primarily on spatial fusion, neglecting the temporal dynamics inherent in event streams. In this work, we propose MambaSeg, a novel dual-branch semantic segmentation framework that employs parallel Mamba encoders to efficiently model RGB images and event streams. To reduce cross-modal ambiguity, we introduce the Dual-Dimensional Interaction Module (DDIM), comprising a Cross-Spatial Interaction Module (CSIM) and a Cross-Temporal Interaction Module (CTIM), which jointly perform fine-grained fusion along both spatial and temporal dimensions. This design improves cross-modal alignment, reduces ambiguity, and leverages the complementary properties of each modality. Extensive experiments on the DDD17 and DSEC datasets demonstrate that MambaSeg achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance while significantly reducing computational cost, showcasing its promise for efficient, scalable, and robust multimodal perception.

Motivation: 解决当前深度学习方法在金属伪影减少（MAR）中的局限性，如监督方法的频谱模糊和无监督方法的结构幻觉问题。

Method: 提出了Physically-Grounded Manifold Projection (PGMP)框架，包括Anatomically-Adaptive Physics Simulation (AAPS)管道、DMP-Former和Semantic-Structural Alignment (SSA)模块。

Result: 在合成和多中心临床数据集上的实验表明，PGMP在未见过的解剖结构上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PGMP框架通过结合物理模拟和确定性流形投影，显著提升了牙科CBCT中金属伪影减少的效果，同时在效率和诊断可靠性上设定了新的基准。

Abstract: Metal artifacts in Dental CBCT severely obscure anatomical structures, hindering diagnosis. Current deep learning for Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR) faces limitations: supervised methods suffer from spectral blurring due to "regression-to-the-mean", while unsupervised ones risk structural hallucinations. Denoising Diffusion Models (DDPMs) offer realism but rely on slow, stochastic iterative sampling, unsuitable for clinical use. To resolve this, we propose the Physically-Grounded Manifold Projection (PGMP) framework. First, our Anatomically-Adaptive Physics Simulation (AAPS) pipeline synthesizes high-fidelity training pairs via Monte Carlo spectral modeling and patient-specific digital twins, bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Second, our DMP-Former adapts the Direct x-Prediction paradigm, reformulating restoration as a deterministic manifold projection to recover clean anatomy in a single forward pass, eliminating stochastic sampling. Finally, a Semantic-Structural Alignment (SSA) module anchors the solution using priors from medical foundation models (MedDINOv3), ensuring clinical plausibility. Experiments on synthetic and multi-center clinical datasets show PGMP outperforms state-of-the-art methods on unseen anatomy, setting new benchmarks in efficiency and diagnostic reliability.

Motivation: 解决MLLM因语言先验导致的视觉不接地幻觉问题，尤其是处理反事实视频时的挑战。

Method: 提出了DualityForge框架，通过可控扩散视频编辑生成反事实视频及QA对，并设计了DNA-Train两阶段训练方法。

Result: 在DualityVidQA-Test上相对Qwen2.5-VL-7B基线提升了24.0%，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: DualityForge和DNA-Train方法显著减少了MLLM在反事实视频中的幻觉问题，并在泛化能力上表现出色。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in video understanding. However, they suffer from a critical vulnerability: an over-reliance on language priors, which can lead to visual ungrounded hallucinations, especially when processing counterfactual videos that defy common sense. This limitation, stemming from the intrinsic data imbalance between text and video, is challenging to address due to the substantial cost of collecting and annotating counterfactual data. To address this, we introduce DualityForge, a novel counterfactual data synthesis framework that employs controllable, diffusion-based video editing to transform real-world videos into counterfactual scenarios. By embedding structured contextual information into the video editing and QA generation processes, the framework automatically produces high-quality QA pairs together with original-edited video pairs for contrastive training. Based on this, we build DualityVidQA, a large-scale video dataset designed to reduce MLLM hallucinations. In addition, to fully exploit the contrastive nature of our paired data, we propose Duality-Normalized Advantage Training (DNA-Train), a two-stage SFT-RL training regime where the RL phase applies pair-wise $\ell_1$ advantage normalization, thereby enabling a more stable and efficient policy optimization. Experiments on DualityVidQA-Test demonstrate that our method substantially reduces model hallucinations on counterfactual videos, yielding a relative improvement of 24.0% over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline. Moreover, our approach achieves significant gains across both hallucination and general-purpose benchmarks, indicating strong generalization capability. We will open-source our dataset and code.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种三维全景拼接框架，通过三维点表示和全局融合，有效减少了传统方法在复杂场景中的失真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像拼接技术在应用于真实三维场景时，由于多深度层和遮挡的存在，常导致非重叠区域的鬼影、结构弯曲和拉伸失真。这些问题在多视图累积和360°闭环拼接场景中尤为突出。

Method: 研究引入了一种空间提升的全景拼接框架，首先将每张输入图像提升为统一坐标系中的密集三维点表示，并通过置信度指标增强全局跨视图融合。随后，在三维空间中建立统一的投影中心，并采用等距圆柱投影将融合数据映射到单个全景流形上。最后，在画布域内进行孔洞填充以解决视点转换揭示的未知区域。

Result: 实验评估表明，所提出的方法在涉及显著视差和复杂遮挡的情况下，显著减轻了几何失真和重影伪影。

Conclusion: 该研究通过将图像拼接从二维变形范式重新构想为三维一致性范式，显著减少了在显著视差和复杂遮挡情况下的几何失真和重影伪影，生成了更自然和一致的360°全景结果。

Abstract: Traditional image stitching techniques have predominantly utilized two-dimensional homography transformations and mesh warping to achieve alignment on a planar surface. While effective for scenes that are approximately coplanar or exhibit minimal parallax, these approaches often result in ghosting, structural bending, and stretching distortions in non-overlapping regions when applied to real three-dimensional scenes characterized by multiple depth layers and occlusions. Such challenges are exacerbated in multi-view accumulations and 360° closed-loop stitching scenarios. In response, this study introduces a spatially lifted panoramic stitching framework that initially elevates each input image into a dense three-dimensional point representation within a unified coordinate system, facilitating global cross-view fusion augmented by confidence metrics. Subsequently, a unified projection center is established in three-dimensional space, and an equidistant cylindrical projection is employed to map the fused data onto a single panoramic manifold, thereby producing a geometrically consistent 360° panoramic layout. Finally, hole filling is conducted within the canvas domain to address unknown regions revealed by viewpoint transitions, restoring continuous texture and semantic coherence. This framework reconceptualizes stitching from a two-dimensional warping paradigm to a three-dimensional consistency paradigm and is designed to flexibly incorporate various three-dimensional lifting and completion modules. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method substantially mitigates geometric distortions and ghosting artifacts in scenarios involving significant parallax and complex occlusions, yielding panoramic results that are more natural and consistent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见胃肠道病变在常规内镜检查中不常见，限制了开发可靠AI模型和培训新手临床医生的数据可用性。

Method: EndoRare 是一种一次性、无需重新训练的生成框架，通过语言引导的概念解耦，从单一参考图像合成多样化的高保真病变样本。

Result: EndoRare 生成的合成图像被专家判定为临床可信，用于数据增强时显著提升了AI分类器的性能，新手内镜医师在使用EndoRare生成案例后，召回率和精确度分别提高了0.400和0.267。

Conclusion: EndoRare 提供了一种数据高效的方法，填补了罕见疾病在计算机辅助诊断和临床教育中的空白。

Abstract: Rare gastrointestinal lesions are infrequently encountered in routine endoscopy, restricting the data available for developing reliable artificial intelligence (AI) models and training novice clinicians. Here we present EndoRare, a one-shot, retraining-free generative framework that synthesizes diverse, high-fidelity lesion exemplars from a single reference image. By leveraging language-guided concept disentanglement, EndoRare separates pathognomonic lesion features from non-diagnostic attributes, encoding the former into a learnable prototype embedding while varying the latter to ensure diversity. We validated the framework across four rare pathologies (calcifying fibrous tumor, juvenile polyposis syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome). Synthetic images were judged clinically plausible by experts and, when used for data augmentation, significantly enhanced downstream AI classifiers, improving the true positive rate at low false-positive rates. Crucially, a blinded reader study demonstrated that novice endoscopists exposed to EndoRare-generated cases achieved a 0.400 increase in recall and a 0.267 increase in precision. These results establish a practical, data-efficient pathway to bridge the rare-disease gap in both computer-aided diagnostics and clinical education.

TL;DR: Virtual-Eyes预处理提升了通用模型RAD-DINO在LDCT肺癌筛查中的性能，但可能损害专用模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化深度学习流程中稳健预处理对低剂量CT（LDCT）肺癌筛查的影响，比较通用基础模型与专用模型的差异表现。

Method: 开发并验证了Virtual-Eyes，一个16位CT质量控制流程，包括严格的512x512分辨率要求、排除非诊断性序列，以及通过Hounsfield单位过滤和双侧肺覆盖率评分提取连续肺块。使用765名NLST患者数据，计算切片级嵌入并训练无泄漏的患者级MLP头。

Result: Virtual-Eyes显著提升了RAD-DINO的切片级AUC（0.576至0.610）和患者级AUC（均值池化：0.646至0.683；最大池化：0.619至0.735），并改善了校准（Brier分数0.188至0.112）。但Sybil和ResNet-18在Virtual-Eyes下性能下降，Merlin的迁移性有限。

Conclusion: 针对性的质量控制（Virtual-Eyes）可以稳定并提升通用基础模型（如RAD-DINO）的性能，但可能破坏适应原始临床数据的专用模型（如Sybil和ResNet-18）。

Abstract: Robust preprocessing is rarely quantified in deep-learning pipelines for low-dose CT (LDCT) lung cancer screening. We develop and validate Virtual-Eyes, a clinically motivated 16-bit CT quality-control pipeline, and measure its differential impact on generalist foundation models versus specialist models. Virtual-Eyes enforces strict 512x512 in-plane resolution, rejects short or non-diagnostic series, and extracts a contiguous lung block using Hounsfield-unit filtering and bilateral lung-coverage scoring while preserving the native 16-bit grid. Using 765 NLST patients (182 cancer, 583 non-cancer), we compute slice-level embeddings from RAD-DINO and Merlin with frozen encoders and train leakage-free patient-level MLP heads; we also evaluate Sybil and a 2D ResNet-18 baseline under Raw versus Virtual-Eyes inputs without backbone retraining. Virtual-Eyes improves RAD-DINO slice-level AUC from 0.576 to 0.610 and patient-level AUC from 0.646 to 0.683 (mean pooling) and from 0.619 to 0.735 (max pooling), with improved calibration (Brier score 0.188 to 0.112). In contrast, Sybil and ResNet-18 degrade under Virtual-Eyes (Sybil AUC 0.886 to 0.837; ResNet-18 AUC 0.571 to 0.596) with evidence of context dependence and shortcut learning, and Merlin shows limited transferability (AUC approximately 0.507 to 0.567) regardless of preprocessing. These results demonstrate that anatomically targeted QC can stabilize and improve generalist foundation-model workflows but may disrupt specialist models adapted to raw clinical context.

Motivation: 解决Ego-RVOS任务中因第一人称视频固有模糊性和训练数据偏差导致的现有方法性能不足问题。

Method: CERES采用双模态因果干预：通过后门调整原则抵消语言表示偏差，利用前门调整概念结合语义视觉特征与几何深度信息，构建对第一人称视角扭曲更鲁棒的表示。

Result: CERES在Ego-RVOS基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CERES通过因果推理框架有效解决了Ego-RVOS任务中的语言和视觉偏差问题，显著提升了模型性能，展示了因果推理在提升第一人称视频理解模型可靠性方面的潜力。

Abstract: Egocentric Referring Video Object Segmentation (Ego-RVOS) aims to segment the specific object actively involved in a human action, as described by a language query, within first-person videos. This task is critical for understanding egocentric human behavior. However, achieving such segmentation robustly is challenging due to ambiguities inherent in egocentric videos and biases present in training data. Consequently, existing methods often struggle, learning spurious correlations from skewed object-action pairings in datasets and fundamental visual confounding factors of the egocentric perspective, such as rapid motion and frequent occlusions. To address these limitations, we introduce Causal Ego-REferring Segmentation (CERES), a plug-in causal framework that adapts strong, pre-trained RVOS backbones to the egocentric domain. CERES implements dual-modal causal intervention: applying backdoor adjustment principles to counteract language representation biases learned from dataset statistics, and leveraging front-door adjustment concepts to address visual confounding by intelligently integrating semantic visual features with geometric depth information guided by causal principles, creating representations more robust to egocentric distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CERES achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ego-RVOS benchmarks, highlighting the potential of applying causal reasoning to build more reliable models for broader egocentric video understanding.

Method: 提出了Dermatology Assessment Schema（DAS）框架，包含36个高级和27个细粒度评估问题，支持多模态模型评估。

Result: 在分割任务中，增强提示策略表现最佳（Jaccard指数0.395，Dice得分0.566）；在封闭式QA任务中，o3模型表现最优（准确率0.798）。

Conclusion: DermaVQA-DAS通过引入Dermatology Assessment Schema（DAS）和专家标注数据集，显著提升了患者为中心的皮肤病图像分析能力，并公开了数据集和评估协议以推动未来研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in dermatological image analysis have been driven by large-scale annotated datasets; however, most existing benchmarks focus on dermatoscopic images and lack patient-authored queries and clinical context, limiting their applicability to patient-centered care. To address this gap, we introduce DermaVQA-DAS, an extension of the DermaVQA dataset that supports two complementary tasks: closed-ended question answering (QA) and dermatological lesion segmentation. Central to this work is the Dermatology Assessment Schema (DAS), a novel expert-developed framework that systematically captures clinically meaningful dermatological features in a structured and standardized form. DAS comprises 36 high-level and 27 fine-grained assessment questions, with multiple-choice options in English and Chinese. Leveraging DAS, we provide expert-annotated datasets for both closed QA and segmentation and benchmark state-of-the-art multimodal models. For segmentation, we evaluate multiple prompting strategies and show that prompt design impacts performance: the default prompt achieves the best results under Mean-of-Max and Mean-of-Mean evaluation aggregation schemes, while an augmented prompt incorporating both patient query title and content yields the highest performance under majority-vote-based microscore evaluation, achieving a Jaccard index of 0.395 and a Dice score of 0.566 with BiomedParse. For closed-ended QA, overall performance is strong across models, with average accuracies ranging from 0.729 to 0.798; o3 achieves the best overall accuracy (0.798), closely followed by GPT-4.1 (0.796), while Gemini-1.5-Pro shows competitive performance within the Gemini family (0.783). We publicly release DermaVQA-DAS, the DAS schema, and evaluation protocols to support and accelerate future research in patient-centered dermatological vision-language modeling (https://osf.io/72rp3).

Result: SenseNova-MARS在搜索和细粒度图像理解基准测试中表现优异，超越了Gemini-3-Flash和GPT-5等专有模型。

Conclusion: SenseNova-MARS代表了一种有前景的多模态代理推理框架，通过强化学习提升了视觉语言模型在复杂视觉任务中的工具使用和推理能力，并在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve complex tasks through agentic reasoning, their capabilities remain largely constrained to text-oriented chain-of-thought or isolated tool invocation. They fail to exhibit the human-like proficiency required to seamlessly interleave dynamic tool manipulation with continuous reasoning, particularly in knowledge-intensive and visually complex scenarios that demand coordinated external tools such as search and image cropping. In this work, we introduce SenseNova-MARS, a novel Multimodal Agentic Reasoning and Search framework that empowers VLMs with interleaved visual reasoning and tool-use capabilities via reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, SenseNova-MARS dynamically integrates the image search, text search, and image crop tools to tackle fine-grained and knowledge-intensive visual understanding challenges. In the RL stage, we propose the Batch-Normalized Group Sequence Policy Optimization (BN-GSPO) algorithm to improve the training stability and advance the model's ability to invoke tools and reason effectively. To comprehensively evaluate the agentic VLMs on complex visual tasks, we introduce the HR-MMSearch benchmark, the first search-oriented benchmark composed of high-resolution images with knowledge-intensive and search-driven questions. Experiments demonstrate that SenseNova-MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-source search and fine-grained image understanding benchmarks. Specifically, on search-oriented benchmarks, SenseNova-MARS-8B scores 67.84 on MMSearch and 41.64 on HR-MMSearch, surpassing proprietary models such as Gemini-3-Flash and GPT-5. SenseNova-MARS represents a promising step toward agentic VLMs by providing effective and robust tool-use capabilities. To facilitate further research in this field, we will release all code, models, and datasets.

Conclusion: 该研究强调了明确的3D度量数据对于构建基于VLM的可信自动驾驶系统的必要性，LVLDrive框架在场景理解、度量空间感知和可靠驾驶决策方面优于仅依赖视觉的方法。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show significant promise for end-to-end autonomous driving by leveraging the common sense embedded in language models, their reliance on 2D image cues for complex scene understanding and decision-making presents a critical bottleneck for safety and reliability. Current image-based methods struggle with accurate metric spatial reasoning and geometric inference, leading to unreliable driving policies. To bridge this gap, we propose LVLDrive (LiDAR-Vision-Language), a novel framework specifically designed to upgrade existing VLMs with robust 3D metric spatial understanding for autonomous driving by incoperating LiDAR point cloud as an extra input modality. A key challenge lies in mitigating the catastrophic disturbance introduced by disparate 3D data to the pre-trained VLMs. To this end, we introduce a Gradual Fusion Q-Former that incrementally injects LiDAR features, ensuring the stability and preservation of the VLM's existing knowledge base. Furthermore, we develop a spatial-aware question-answering (SA-QA) dataset to explicitly teach the model advanced 3D perception and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on driving benchmarks demonstrate that LVLDrive achieves superior performance compared to vision-only counterparts across scene understanding, metric spatial perception, and reliable driving decision-making. Our work highlights the necessity of explicit 3D metric data for building trustworthy VLM-based autonomous systems.

Motivation: 受狭义相对论和量子力学物理理论的启发，研究卷积滤波与整流的机械特性，探索信息传播的基本模式。

Method: 通过将卷积核分解为正交的偶数和奇数分量，并在离散余弦变换（DCT）的谱域中分析这些分量的性质，特别是小卷积滤波器（如3×3像素）的结构主要由低频基（如DC Σ和梯度分量∇）主导。

Result: 偶分量导致图像内容各向同性扩散并保持质心，类似于零净动量的静能或势能；奇分量导致质心的方向性位移，类似于非零动量的动能。信息位移的速度与奇分量与总核能量的比率线性相关。

Conclusion: 该论文首次展示了通用CNN中的信息处理与现代相对论物理的基石——能量-动量关系之间的联系，提出了基本信息力学作为理解卷积滤波与整流机械特性的新模型。

Abstract: This paper proposes elementary information mechanics as a new model for understanding the mechanical properties of convolutional filtering with rectification, inspired by physical theories of special relativity and quantum mechanics. We consider kernels decomposed into orthogonal even and odd components. Even components cause image content to diffuse isotropically while preserving the center of mass, analogously to rest or potential energy with zero net momentum. Odd kernels cause directional displacement of the center of mass, analogously to kinetic energy with non-zero momentum. The speed of information displacement is linearly related to the ratio of odd vs total kernel energy. Even-Odd properties are analyzed in the spectral domain via the discrete cosine transform (DCT), where the structure of small convolutional filters (e.g. $3 \times 3$ pixels) is dominated by low-frequency bases, specifically the DC $Σ$ and gradient components $\nabla$, which define the fundamental modes of information propagation. To our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating the link between information processing in generic CNNs and the energy-momentum relation, a cornerstone of modern relativistic physics.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种基于DINOv2特征的F2IDiff基础模型，用于解决传统T2IDiff模型在智能手机摄影中高保真LR图像上的局限性，通过低层次特征提供更严格的约束和丰富的描述。

Abstract: With the advent of Generative AI, Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) quality has seen substantial improvement, as the strong priors learned by Text-2-Image Diffusion (T2IDiff) Foundation Models (FM) can bridge the gap between High-Resolution (HR) and Low-Resolution (LR) images. However, flagship smartphone cameras have been slow to adopt generative models because strong generation can lead to undesirable hallucinations. For substantially degraded LR images, as seen in academia, strong generation is required and hallucinations are more tolerable because of the wide gap between LR and HR images. In contrast, in consumer photography, the LR image has substantially higher fidelity, requiring only minimal hallucination-free generation. We hypothesize that generation in SISR is controlled by the stringency and richness of the FM's conditioning feature. First, text features are high level features, which often cannot describe subtle textures in an image. Additionally, Smartphone LR images are at least $12MP$, whereas SISR networks built on T2IDiff FM are designed to perform inference on much smaller images ($<1MP$). As a result, SISR inference has to be performed on small patches, which often cannot be accurately described by text feature. To address these shortcomings, we introduce an SISR network built on a FM with lower-level feature conditioning, specifically DINOv2 features, which we call a Feature-to-Image Diffusion (F2IDiff) Foundation Model (FM). Lower level features provide stricter conditioning while being rich descriptors of even small patches.

Motivation: 现有基于块的生成方法需要完整的非因果上下文窗口，引入了显著的延迟，无法满足实时非语言反馈的需求。

Method: 采用流友好的自回归框架和流匹配头进行概率建模，并设计了因果编码器增强模块，结合短未来上下文（如60毫秒）以提高质量同时保持低延迟。

Result: DyStream 每帧生成视频仅需34毫秒，系统总延迟保持在100毫秒以下，同时在HDTF数据集上实现了离线8.13和在线7.61的唇同步置信度得分，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: DyStream 是一种基于流匹配的自回归模型，能够实时生成说话者和听者的视频，显著降低了延迟，并实现了优异的唇同步质量。

Abstract: Generating realistic, dyadic talking head video requires ultra-low latency. Existing chunk-based methods require full non-causal context windows, introducing significant delays. This high latency critically prevents the immediate, non-verbal feedback required for a realistic listener. To address this, we present DyStream, a flow matching-based autoregressive model that could generate video in real-time from both speaker and listener audio. Our method contains two key designs: (1) we adopt a stream-friendly autoregressive framework with flow-matching heads for probabilistic modeling, and (2) We propose a causal encoder enhanced by a lookahead module to incorporate short future context (e.g., 60 ms) to improve quality while maintaining low latency. Our analysis shows this simple-and-effective method significantly surpass alternative causal strategies, including distillation and generative encoder. Extensive experiments show that DyStream could generate video within 34 ms per frame, guaranteeing the entire system latency remains under 100 ms. Besides, it achieves state-of-the-art lip-sync quality, with offline and online LipSync Confidence scores of 8.13 and 7.61 on HDTF, respectively. The model, weights and codes are available.

Abstract: The development of effective training and evaluation strategies is critical. Conventional methods for assessing surgical proficiency typically rely on expert supervision, either through onsite observation or retrospective analysis of recorded procedures. However, these approaches are inherently subjective, susceptible to inter-rater variability, and require substantial time and effort from expert surgeons. These demands are often impractical in low- and middle-income countries, thereby limiting the scalability and consistency of such methods across training programs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel AI-driven framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis performance. The system integrates a video transformer architecture based on TimeSformer, improved with hierarchical temporal attention and weighted spatial attention mechanisms, to achieve accurate action recognition within surgical videos. Fine-grained motion features are then extracted using a YOLO-based object detection and tracking method, allowing for detailed analysis of instrument kinematics. Performance is evaluated along five aspects of microanastomosis skill, including overall action execution, motion quality during procedure-critical actions, and general instrument handling. Experimental validation using a dataset of 58 expert-annotated videos demonstrates the effectiveness of the system, achieving 87.7% frame-level accuracy in action segmentation that increased to 93.62% with post-processing, and an average classification accuracy of 76% in replicating expert assessments across all skill aspects. These findings highlight the system's potential to provide objective, consistent, and interpretable feedback, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training and evaluation in surgical education.

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过一级离散小波变换（DWT）分解得到的基元在潜在空间中近似可组合，为理解ViT如何组织信息提供了新视角。

Abstract: While insights into the workings of the transformer model have largely emerged by analysing their behaviour on language tasks, this work investigates the representations learnt by the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder through the lens of compositionality. We introduce a framework, analogous to prior work on measuring compositionality in representation learning, to test for compositionality in the ViT encoder. Crucial to drawing this analogy is the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), which is a simple yet effective tool for obtaining input-dependent primitives in the vision setting. By examining the ability of composed representations to reproduce original image representations, we empirically test the extent to which compositionality is respected in the representation space. Our findings show that primitives from a one-level DWT decomposition produce encoder representations that approximately compose in latent space, offering a new perspective on how ViTs structure information.

Abstract: High-fidelity compression of multispectral solar imagery remains challenging for space missions, where limited bandwidth must be balanced against preserving fine spectral and spatial details. We present a learned image compression framework tailored to solar observations, leveraging two complementary modules: (1) the Inter-Spectral Windowed Graph Embedding (iSWGE), which explicitly models inter-band relationships by representing spectral channels as graph nodes with learned edge features; and (2) the Windowed Spatial Graph Attention and Convolutional Block Attention (WSGA-C), which combines sparse graph attention with convolutional attention to reduce spatial redundancy and emphasize fine-scale structures. Evaluations on the SDOML dataset across six extreme ultraviolet (EUV) channels show that our approach achieves a 20.15%reduction in Mean Spectral Information Divergence (MSID), up to 1.09% PSNR improvement, and a 1.62% log transformed MS-SSIM gain over strong learned baselines, delivering sharper and spectrally faithful reconstructions at comparable bits-per-pixel rates.

Abstract: Tensor network structure search (TN-SS) aims to automatically discover optimal network topologies and rank configurations for efficient tensor decomposition in high-dimensional data representation. Despite recent advances, existing TN-SS methods face significant limitations in computational tractability, structure adaptivity, and optimization robustness across diverse tensor characteristics. They struggle with three key challenges: single-scale optimization missing multi-scale structures, discrete search spaces hindering smooth structure evolution, and separated structure-parameter optimization causing computational inefficiency. We propose RGTN (Renormalization Group guided Tensor Network search), a physics-inspired framework transforming TN-SS via multi-scale renormalization group flows. Unlike fixed-scale discrete search methods, RGTN uses dynamic scale-transformation for continuous structure evolution across resolutions. Its core innovation includes learnable edge gates for optimization-stage topology modification and intelligent proposals based on physical quantities like node tension measuring local stress and edge information flow quantifying connectivity importance. Starting from low-complexity coarse scales and refining to finer ones, RGTN finds compact structures while escaping local minima via scale-induced perturbations. Extensive experiments on light field data, high-order synthetic tensors, and video completion tasks show RGTN achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios and runs 4-600$\times$ faster than existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our physics-inspired approach.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed medical imaging, with computer vision (CV) systems achieving state-of-the-art performance in classification and detection tasks. However, these systems typically output structured predictions, leaving radiologists responsible for translating results into full narrative reports. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, offer new opportunities to bridge this gap by generating diagnostic narratives from structured findings. This study introduces a pipeline that integrates YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for anomaly detection in chest X-ray images with a large language model (LLM) to generate natural-language radiology reports. The YOLO models produce bounding-box predictions and class labels, which are then passed to the LLM to generate descriptive findings and clinical summaries. YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 are compared in terms of detection accuracy, inference latency, and the quality of generated text, as measured by cosine similarity to ground-truth reports. Results show strong semantic similarity between AI and human reports, while human evaluation reveals GPT-4 excels in clarity (4.88/5) but exhibits lower scores for natural writing flow (2.81/5), indicating that current systems achieve clinical accuracy but remain stylistically distinguishable from radiologist-authored text.

Motivation: 当前方法（如 SFT 和 RL）存在灾难性遗忘、领域依赖、训练不稳定等问题，而训练免费方法因静态推理范式受限，缺乏自我纠正能力。

Method: EVOL-SAM3 提出了一种零样本框架，将推理分割重新定义为推理时的进化搜索过程，通过“生成-评估-进化”循环迭代优化提示假设。

Conclusion: EVOL-SAM3 在零样本设置下显著优于静态基线方法和完全监督的最先进方法，展示了其在推理分割任务中的优越性。

Abstract: Reasoning Segmentation requires models to interpret complex, context-dependent linguistic queries to achieve pixel-level localization. Current dominant approaches rely heavily on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, SFT suffers from catastrophic forgetting and domain dependency, while RL is often hindered by training instability and rigid reliance on predefined reward functions. Although recent training-free methods circumvent these training burdens, they are fundamentally limited by a static inference paradigm. These methods typically rely on a single-pass "generate-then-segment" chain, which suffers from insufficient reasoning depth and lacks the capability to self-correct linguistic hallucinations or spatial misinterpretations. In this paper, we challenge these limitations and propose EVOL-SAM3, a novel zero-shot framework that reformulates reasoning segmentation as an inference-time evolutionary search process. Instead of relying on a fixed prompt, EVOL-SAM3 maintains a population of prompt hypotheses and iteratively refines them through a "Generate-Evaluate-Evolve" loop. We introduce a Visual Arena to assess prompt fitness via reference-free pairwise tournaments, and a Semantic Mutation operator to inject diversity and correct semantic errors. Furthermore, a Heterogeneous Arena module integrates geometric priors with semantic reasoning to ensure robust final selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVOL-SAM3 not only substantially outperforms static baselines but also significantly surpasses fully supervised state-of-the-art methods on the challenging ReasonSeg benchmark in a zero-shot setting.

Conclusion: The proposed MS-VQ-VAE framework is well-suited for scalable video compression in bandwidth-sensitive scenarios, including real-time streaming, mobile video analytics, and CDN-level storage optimization.

Abstract: The exponential growth of video traffic has placed increasing demands on bandwidth and storage infrastructure, particularly for content delivery networks (CDNs) and edge devices. While traditional video codecs like H.264 and HEVC achieve high compression ratios, they are designed primarily for pixel-domain reconstruction and lack native support for machine learning-centric latent representations, limiting their integration into deep learning pipelines. In this work, we present a Multi-Scale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MS-VQ-VAE) designed to generate compact, high-fidelity latent representations of low-resolution video, suitable for efficient storage, transmission, and client-side decoding. Our architecture extends the VQ-VAE-2 framework to a spatiotemporal setting, introducing a two-level hierarchical latent structure built with 3D residual convolutions. The model is lightweight (approximately 18.5M parameters) and optimized for 64x64 resolution video clips, making it appropriate for deployment on edge devices with constrained compute and memory resources. To improve perceptual reconstruction quality, we incorporate a perceptual loss derived from a pre-trained VGG16 network. Trained on the UCF101 dataset using 2-second video clips (32 frames at 16 FPS), on the test set we achieve 25.96 dB PSNR and 0.8375 SSIM. On validation, our model improves over the single-scale baseline by 1.41 dB PSNR and 0.0248 SSIM. The proposed framework is well-suited for scalable video compression in bandwidth-sensitive scenarios, including real-time streaming, mobile video analytics, and CDN-level storage optimization.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation have achieved good visual quality, yet synthesizing videos that faithfully follow physical laws remains an open challenge. Existing methods mainly based on graphics or prompt extension struggle to generalize beyond simple simulated environments or learn implicit physical reasoning. The scarcity of training data with rich physics interactions and phenomena is also a problem. In this paper, we first introduce a Physics-Augmented video data construction Pipeline, PhyAugPipe, that leverages a vision-language model (VLM) with chain-of-thought reasoning to collect a large-scale training dataset, PhyVidGen-135K. Then we formulate a principled Physics-aware Groupwise Direct Preference Optimization, PhyGDPO, framework that builds upon the groupwise Plackett-Luce probabilistic model to capture holistic preferences beyond pairwise comparisons. In PhyGDPO, we design a Physics-Guided Rewarding (PGR) scheme that embeds VLM-based physics rewards to steer optimization toward physical consistency. We also propose a LoRA-Switch Reference (LoRA-SR) scheme that eliminates memory-heavy reference duplication for efficient training. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-source methods on PhyGenBench and VideoPhy2.

Abstract: Cross-modal systems trained on 2D visual inputs are presented with a dimensional shift when processing 3D scenes. An in-scene camera bridges the dimensionality gap but requires learning a control module. We introduce a new method that improves multivariate mutual information estimates by regret minimisation with derivative-free optimisation. Our algorithm enables off-the-shelf cross-modal systems trained on 2D visual inputs to adapt online to object occlusions and differentiate features. The pairing of expressive measures and value-based optimisation assists control of an in-scene camera to learn directly from the noisy outputs of vision-language models. The resulting pipeline improves performance in cross-modal tasks on multi-object 3D scenes without resorting to pretraining or finetuning.

Conclusion: RGBT-Ground 基准和 RGBT-VGNet 方法的提出显著提升了复杂现实场景下的视觉定位性能，特别是在夜间和远距离场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG) aims to localize specific objects in an image according to natural language expressions, serving as a fundamental task in vision-language understanding. However, existing VG benchmarks are mostly derived from datasets collected under clean environments, such as COCO, where scene diversity is limited. Consequently, they fail to reflect the complexity of real-world conditions, such as changes in illumination, weather, etc., that are critical to evaluating model robustness and generalization in safety-critical applications. To address these limitations, we present RGBT-Ground, the first large-scale visual grounding benchmark built for complex real-world scenarios. It consists of spatially aligned RGB and Thermal infrared (TIR) image pairs with high-quality referring expressions, corresponding object bounding boxes, and fine-grained annotations at the scene, environment, and object levels. This benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation and facilitates the study of robust grounding under diverse and challenging conditions. Furthermore, we establish a unified visual grounding framework that supports both uni-modal (RGB or TIR) and multi-modal (RGB-TIR) visual inputs. Based on it, we propose RGBT-VGNet, a simple yet effective baseline for fusing complementary visual modalities to achieve robust grounding. We conduct extensive adaptations to the existing methods on RGBT-Ground. Experimental results show that our proposed RGBT-VGNet significantly outperforms these adapted methods, particularly in nighttime and long-distance scenarios. All resources will be publicly released to promote future research on robust visual grounding in complex real-world environments.

Conclusion: DARFT框架通过明确优化决策模糊样本（DAS），显著提升了CDVQA模型的判别性和鲁棒性，尤其在少样本设置下表现优异。

Abstract: Change detection visual question answering (CDVQA) requires answering text queries by reasoning about semantic changes in bi-temporal remote sensing images. A straightforward approach is to boost CDVQA performance with generic vision-language models via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Despite recent progress, we observe that a significant portion of failures do not stem from clearly incorrect predictions, but from decision ambiguity, where the model assigns similar confidence to the correct answer and strong distractors. To formalize this challenge, we define Decision-Ambiguous Samples (DAS) as instances with a small probability margin between the ground-truth answer and the most competitive alternative. We argue that explicitly optimizing DAS is crucial for improving the discriminability and robustness of CDVQA models. To this end, we propose DARFT, a Decision-Ambiguity-guided Reinforcement Fine-Tuning framework that first mines DAS using an SFT-trained reference policy and then applies group-relative policy optimization on the mined subset. By leveraging multi-sample decoding and intra-group relative advantages, DARFT suppresses strong distractors and sharpens decision boundaries without additional supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains over SFT baselines, particularly under few-shot settings.

In addition, high-resolution films have not been explored by the open-source methods.We propose HaineiFRDM(Film Restoration Diffusion Model), a film restoration framework, to explore diffusion model's powerful content-understanding ability to help human expert better restore indistinguishable film defects.Specifically, we employ a patch-wise training and testing strategy to make restoring high-resolution films on one 24GB-VRAMR GPU possible and design a position-aware Global Prompt and Frame Fusion Modules.Also, we introduce a global-local frequency module to reconstruct consistent textures among different patches. Besides, we firstly restore a low-resolution result and use it as global residual to mitigate blocky artifacts caused by patching process.Furthermore, we construct a film restoration dataset that contains restored real-degraded films and realistic synthetic data.Comprehensive experimental results conclusively demonstrate the superiority of our model in defect restoration ability over existing open-source methods.

Abstract: Systematic failures of computer vision models on subsets with coherent visual patterns, known as error slices, pose a critical challenge for robust model evaluation. Existing slice discovery methods are primarily developed for image classification, limiting their applicability to multi-instance tasks such as detection, segmentation, and pose estimation. In real-world scenarios, error slices often arise from corner cases involving complex visual relationships, where existing instance-level approaches lacking fine-grained reasoning struggle to yield meaningful insights. Moreover, current benchmarks are typically tailored to specific algorithms or biased toward image classification, with artificial ground truth that fails to reflect real model failures. To address these limitations, we propose SliceLens, a hypothesis-driven framework that leverages LLMs and VLMs to generate and verify diverse failure hypotheses through grounded visual reasoning, enabling reliable identification of fine-grained and interpretable error slices. We further introduce FeSD (Fine-grained Slice Discovery), the first benchmark specifically designed for evaluating fine-grained error slice discovery across instance-level vision tasks, featuring expert-annotated and carefully refined ground-truth slices with precise grounding to local error regions. Extensive experiments on both existing benchmarks and FeSD demonstrate that SliceLens achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Precision@10 by 0.42 (0.73 vs. 0.31) on FeSD, and identifies interpretable slices that facilitate actionable model improvements, as validated through model repair experiments.

Abstract: Building intelligent agents capable of dexterous manipulation is essential for achieving human-like automation in both robotics and digital environments. However, existing GUI agents rely on discrete click predictions (x,y), which prohibits free-form, closed-loop trajectories (e.g. dragging a progress bar) that require continuous, on-the-fly perception and adjustment. In this work, we develop ShowUI-$π$, the first flow-based generative model as GUI dexterous hand, featuring the following designs: (i) Unified Discrete-Continuous Actions, integrating discrete clicks and continuous drags within a shared model, enabling flexible adaptation across diverse interaction modes; (ii) Flow-based Action Generation for drag modeling, which predicts incremental cursor adjustments from continuous visual observations via a lightweight action expert, ensuring smooth and stable trajectories; (iii) Drag Training data and Benchmark, where we manually collect and synthesize 20K drag trajectories across five domains (e.g. PowerPoint, Adobe Premiere Pro), and introduce ScreenDrag, a benchmark with comprehensive online and offline evaluation protocols for assessing GUI agents' drag capabilities. Our experiments show that proprietary GUI agents still struggle on ScreenDrag (e.g. Operator scores 13.27, and the best Gemini-2.5-CUA reaches 22.18). In contrast, ShowUI-$π$ achieves 26.98 with only 450M parameters, underscoring both the difficulty of the task and the effectiveness of our approach. We hope this work advances GUI agents toward human-like dexterous control in digital world. The code is available at https://github.com/showlab/showui-pi.

Abstract: Compressed deep learning models are crucial for deploying computer vision systems on resource-constrained devices. However, model compression may affect robustness, especially under natural corruption. Therefore, it is important to consider robustness evaluation while validating computer vision systems. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of compression techniques - quantization, pruning, and weight clustering applied individually and in combination to convolutional neural networks (ResNet-50, VGG-19, and MobileNetV2). Using the CIFAR-10-C and CIFAR 100-C datasets, we analyze the trade-offs between robustness, accuracy, and compression ratio. Our results show that certain compression strategies not only preserve but can also improve robustness, particularly on networks with more complex architectures. Utilizing multiobjective assessment, we determine the best configurations, showing that customized technique combinations produce beneficial multi-objective results. This study provides insights into selecting compression methods for robust and efficient deployment of models in corrupted real-world environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在微调预训练视觉Transformer时，难以平衡学习性能和参数效率，CLoRA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: CLoRA包含基础空间共享和SADE组件，通过共享下/上投影空间和正则化矩阵相似性来增强低秩模块的学习能力和多样性。

Result: 实验结果表明，CLoRA在图像和点云数据集上表现优异，尤其在点云分析中需要的GFLOPs最少。

Conclusion: CLoRA通过基础空间共享和样本无关多样性增强（SADE）组件，在保持参数效率的同时提升了学习性能，实现了学习性能与参数效率的更好平衡。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has achieved remarkable success in fine-tuning pre-trained vision transformers for various downstream tasks. Existing studies mainly focus on exploring more parameter-efficient strategies or more effective representation learning schemes. However, these methods either sacrifice fine-tuning performance or introduce excessive trainable parameters, failing to strike a balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a novel tuning method named collaborative low-rank adaptation (CLoRA) in this paper. CLoRA consists of base-space sharing and sample-agnostic diversity enhancement (SADE) components. To maintain parameter efficiency while expanding the learning capacity of low-rank modules (LRMs), base-space sharing allows all LRMs to share a set of down/up-projection spaces. In CLoRA, the low-rank matrices obtained from the shared spaces collaboratively construct each LRM. Since the representations extracted by these matrices may contain redundant information, SADE is employed to regularize the similarities among them to encourage diverse representations in the training process. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used image and point cloud datasets to evaluate the performance of CLoRA. Experimental results demonstrate that CLoRA strikes a better balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency, while requiring the fewest GFLOPs for point cloud analysis, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to localize the object in 3D point cloud scenes that semantically corresponds to given natural language sentences. It is very critical for roadside infrastructure system to interpret natural languages and localize relevant target objects in complex traffic environments. However, most existing datasets and approaches for 3D visual grounding focus on the indoor and outdoor driving scenes, outdoor monitoring scenarios remain unexplored due to scarcity of paired point cloud-text data captured by roadside infrastructure sensors. In this paper, we introduce a novel task of 3D Visual Grounding for Outdoor Monitoring Scenarios, which enables infrastructure-level understanding of traffic scenes beyond the ego-vehicle perspective. To support this task, we construct MoniRefer, the first real-world large-scale multi-modal dataset for roadside-level 3D visual grounding. The dataset consists of about 136,018 objects with 411,128 natural language expressions collected from multiple complex traffic intersections in the real-world environments. To ensure the quality and accuracy of the dataset, we manually verified all linguistic descriptions and 3D labels for objects. Additionally, we also propose a new end-to-end method, named Moni3DVG, which utilizes the rich appearance information provided by images and geometry and optical information from point cloud for multi-modal feature learning and 3D object localization. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the proposed benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method. Our dataset and code will be released.

Conclusion: 本文提出的Layer-by-Layer Hierarchical Attention Network通过分层注意力和阶段融合机制，显著提升了特征点匹配的精度和鲁棒性，尤其在处理高比例异常值时表现优异。

Abstract: Establishing the correct correspondence of feature points is a fundamental task in computer vision. However, the presence of numerous outliers among the feature points can significantly affect the matching results, reducing the accuracy and robustness of the process. Furthermore, a challenge arises when dealing with a large proportion of outliers: how to ensure the extraction of high-quality information while reducing errors caused by negative samples. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel method called Layer-by-Layer Hierarchical Attention Network, which enhances the precision of feature point matching in computer vision by addressing the issue of outliers. Our method incorporates stage fusion, hierarchical extraction, and an attention mechanism to improve the network's representation capability by emphasizing the rich semantic information of feature points. Specifically, we introduce a layer-by-layer channel fusion module, which preserves the feature semantic information from each stage and achieves overall fusion, thereby enhancing the representation capability of the feature points. Additionally, we design a hierarchical attention module that adaptively captures and fuses global perception and structural semantic information using an attention mechanism. Finally, we propose two architectures to extract and integrate features, thereby improving the adaptability of our network. We conduct experiments on two public datasets, namely YFCC100M and SUN3D, and the results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques in both outlier removal and camera pose estimation.

Conclusion: 该论文通过构建新的数据集和改进的FRS-YOLO模型，有效提升了火灾救援场景中的目标检测性能，解决了现有研究中的关键问题。

Abstract: Object detection in fire rescue scenarios is importance for command and decision-making in firefighting operations. However, existing research still suffers from two main limitations. First, current work predominantly focuses on environments such as mountainous or forest areas, while paying insufficient attention to urban rescue scenes, which are more frequent and structurally complex. Second, existing detection systems include a limited number of classes, such as flames and smoke, and lack a comprehensive system covering key targets crucial for command decisions, such as fire trucks and firefighters. To address the above issues, this paper first constructs a new dataset named "FireRescue" for rescue command, which covers multiple rescue scenarios, including urban, mountainous, forest, and water areas, and contains eight key categories such as fire trucks and firefighters, with a total of 15,980 images and 32,000 bounding boxes. Secondly, to tackle the problems of inter-class confusion and missed detection of small targets caused by chaotic scenes, diverse targets, and long-distance shooting, this paper proposes an improved model named FRS-YOLO. On the one hand, the model introduces a plug-and-play multidi-mensional collaborative enhancement attention module, which enhances the discriminative representation of easily confused categories (e.g., fire trucks vs. ordinary trucks) through cross-dimensional feature interaction. On the other hand, it integrates a dynamic feature sampler to strengthen high-response foreground features, thereby mitigating the effects of smoke occlusion and background interference. Experimental results demonstrate that object detection in fire rescue scenarios is highly challenging, and the proposed method effectively improves the detection performance of YOLO series models in this context.

Conclusion: RadAR通过径向并行预测和动态输出校正，显著提高了生成效率，同时保持了自回归模型的表示能力。

Abstract: Inspired by the remarkable success of autoregressive models in language modeling, this paradigm has been widely adopted in visual generation. However, the sequential token-by-token decoding mechanism inherent in traditional autoregressive models leads to low inference efficiency.In this paper, we propose RadAR, an efficient and parallelizable framework designed to accelerate autoregressive visual generation while preserving its representational capacity. Our approach is motivated by the observation that visual tokens exhibit strong local dependencies and spatial correlations with their neighbors--a property not fully exploited in standard raster-scan decoding orders. Specifically, we organize the generation process around a radial topology: an initial token is selected as the starting point, and all other tokens are systematically grouped into multiple concentric rings according to their spatial distances from this center. Generation then proceeds in a ring-wise manner, from inner to outer regions, enabling the parallel prediction of all tokens within the same ring. This design not only preserves the structural locality and spatial coherence of visual scenes but also substantially increases parallelization. Furthermore, to address the risk of inconsistent predictions arising from simultaneous token generation with limited context, we introduce a nested attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically refines implausible outputs during the forward pass, thereby mitigating error accumulation and preventing model collapse. By integrating radial parallel prediction with dynamic output correction, RadAR significantly improves generation efficiency.

Result: 在LTX-Video（2B/13B）和WAN 2.1（1.3B/14B）上，FlowBlending实现了最高1.65倍的推理加速和57.35%的FLOPs减少，同时保持了大模型的性能。此外，它与现有采样加速技术兼容，可实现额外2倍加速。

Conclusion: FlowBlending是一种阶段感知的多模型采样策略，通过在不同阶段使用不同容量的模型，实现了推理速度的显著提升（最高1.65倍）和计算量的大幅减少（57.35% FLOPs），同时保持了大模型的视觉保真度、时间连贯性和语义对齐。

Abstract: In this work, we show that the impact of model capacity varies across timesteps: it is crucial for the early and late stages but largely negligible during the intermediate stage. Accordingly, we propose FlowBlending, a stage-aware multi-model sampling strategy that employs a large model and a small model at capacity-sensitive stages and intermediate stages, respectively. We further introduce simple criteria to choose stage boundaries and provide a velocity-divergence analysis as an effective proxy for identifying capacity-sensitive regions. Across LTX-Video (2B/13B) and WAN 2.1 (1.3B/14B), FlowBlending achieves up to 1.65x faster inference with 57.35% fewer FLOPs, while maintaining the visual fidelity, temporal coherence, and semantic alignment of the large models. FlowBlending is also compatible with existing sampling-acceleration techniques, enabling up to 2x additional speedup.

Result: EchoVidia在可控性上提升40.7%，感知质量提升12.5%。

Conclusion: EchoVidia框架在可控性和感知质量上显著优于现有VT2A模型，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Sound effects build an essential layer of multimodal storytelling, shaping the emotional atmosphere and the narrative semantics of videos. Despite recent advancement in video-text-to-audio (VT2A), the current formulation faces three key limitations: First, an imbalance between visual and textual conditioning that leads to visual dominance; Second, the absence of a concrete definition for fine-grained controllable generation; Third, weak instruction understanding and following, as existing datasets rely on brief categorical tags. To address these limitations, we introduce EchoFoley, a new task designed for video-grounded sound generation with both event level local control and hierarchical semantic control. Our symbolic representation for sounding events specifies when, what, and how each sound is produced within a video or instruction, enabling fine-grained controls like sound generation, insertion, and editing. To support this task, we construct EchoFoley-6k, a large-scale, expert-curated benchmark containing over 6,000 video-instruction-annotation triplets. Building upon this foundation, we propose EchoVidia a sounding-event-centric agentic generation framework with slow-fast thinking strategy. Experiments show that EchoVidia surpasses recent VT2A models by 40.7% in controllability and 12.5% in perceptual quality.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced novel-view synthesis. Recent methods extend multi-view 2D segmentation to 3D, enabling instance/semantic segmentation for better scene understanding. A key challenge is the inconsistency of 2D instance labels across views, leading to poor 3D predictions. Existing methods use a two-stage approach in which some rely on contrastive learning with hyperparameter-sensitive clustering, while others preprocess labels for consistency. We propose a unified framework that merges these steps, reducing training time and improving performance by introducing a learnable feature embedding for segmentation in Gaussian primitives. This embedding is then efficiently decoded into instance labels through a novel "Embedding-to-Label" process, effectively integrating the optimization. While this unified framework offers substantial benefits, we observed artifacts at the object boundaries. To address the object boundary issues, we propose hard-mining samples along these boundaries. However, directly applying hard mining to the feature embeddings proved unstable. Therefore, we apply a linear layer to the rasterized feature embeddings before calculating the triplet loss, which stabilizes training and significantly improves performance. Our method outperforms baselines qualitatively and quantitatively on the ScanNet, Replica3D, and Messy-Rooms datasets.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that cause misclassification when specific perturbations are added to input images. This vulnerability also threatens the reliability of DNN-based monocular depth estimation (MDE) models, making robustness enhancement a critical need in practical applications. To validate the vulnerability of DNN-based MDE models, this study proposes a projection-based adversarial attack method that projects perturbation light onto a target object. The proposed method employs physics-in-the-loop (PITL) optimization -- evaluating candidate solutions in actual environments to account for device specifications and disturbances -- and utilizes a distributed covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy. Experiments confirmed that the proposed method successfully created adversarial examples that lead to depth misestimations, resulting in parts of objects disappearing from the target scene.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has demonstrated remarkable promptable visual segmentation capabilities in video data, showing potential for extension to medical image segmentation (MIS) tasks involving 3D volumes and temporally correlated 2D image sequences. However, adapting SAM2 to MIS presents several challenges, including the need for extensive annotated medical data for fine-tuning and high-quality manual prompts, which are both labor-intensive and require intervention from medical experts. To address these challenges, we introduce OFL-SAM2, a prompt-free SAM2 framework for label-efficient MIS. Our core idea is to leverage limited annotated samples to train a lightweight mapping network that captures medical knowledge and transforms generic image features into target features, thereby providing additional discriminative target representations for each frame and eliminating the need for manual prompts. Crucially, the mapping network supports online parameter update during inference, enhancing the model's generalization across test sequences. Technically, we introduce two key components: (1) an online few-shot learner that trains the mapping network to generate target features using limited data, and (2) an adaptive fusion module that dynamically integrates the target features with the memory-attention features generated by frozen SAM2, leading to accurate and robust target representation.

Motivation: 现有的基准在金融数值推理方面存在不足，FinMMDocR 旨在填补这一空白，提供更具挑战性和现实意义的评估标准。

Method: FinMMDocR 通过专家标注的 1,200 个问题、837 份中英文文档以及多步计算任务，评估 MLLMs 在金融数值推理中的表现。

Result: 最佳表现的 MLLM 准确率仅为 58.0%，不同 RAG 方法在该任务上表现差异显著。

Conclusion: FinMMDocR 是一个新颖的双语多模态基准，旨在推动 MLLMs 和增强推理方法在现实世界复杂多模态推理任务中的改进。

Abstract: We introduce FinMMDocR, a novel bilingual multimodal benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on real-world financial numerical reasoning. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work delivers three major advancements. (1) Scenario Awareness: 57.9% of 1,200 expert-annotated problems incorporate 12 types of implicit financial scenarios (e.g., Portfolio Management), challenging models to perform expert-level reasoning based on assumptions; (2) Document Understanding: 837 Chinese/English documents spanning 9 types (e.g., Company Research) average 50.8 pages with rich visual elements, significantly surpassing existing benchmarks in both breadth and depth of financial documents; (3) Multi-Step Computation: Problems demand 11-step reasoning on average (5.3 extraction + 5.7 calculation steps), with 65.0% requiring cross-page evidence (2.4 pages average). The best-performing MLLM achieves only 58.0% accuracy, and different retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods show significant performance variations on this task. We expect FinMMDocR to drive improvements in MLLMs and reasoning-enhanced methods on complex multimodal reasoning tasks in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: 3D object detectors are fundamental components of perception systems in autonomous vehicles. While these detectors achieve remarkable performance on standard autonomous driving benchmarks, they often struggle to generalize across different domains - for instance, a model trained in the U.S. may perform poorly in regions like Asia or Europe. This paper presents a novel lidar domain adaptation method based on neuron activation patterns, demonstrating that state-of-the-art performance can be achieved by annotating only a small, representative, and diverse subset of samples from the target domain if they are correctly selected. The proposed approach requires very small annotation budget and, when combined with post-training techniques inspired by continual learning prevent weight drift from the original model. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed domain adaptation approach outperforms both linear probing and state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable crop disease diagnosis is essential for agricultural decision-making, yet existing methods often rely on costly supervised fine-tuning and perform poorly under domain shifts. We propose Caption--Prompt--Judge (CPJ), a training-free few-shot framework that enhances Agri-Pest VQA through structured, interpretable image captions. CPJ employs large vision-language models to generate multi-angle captions, refined iteratively via an LLM-as-Judge module, which then inform a dual-answer VQA process for both recognition and management responses. Evaluated on CDDMBench, CPJ significantly improves performance: using GPT-5-mini captions, GPT-5-Nano achieves \textbf{+22.7} pp in disease classification and \textbf{+19.5} points in QA score over no-caption baselines. The framework provides transparent, evidence-based reasoning, advancing robust and explainable agricultural diagnosis without fine-tuning.

TL;DR: ProDM是一种生成扩散模型，通过模拟数据引擎、属性感知学习和渐进校正方案，有效减少非门控CT中的运动伪影，提升CAC评分准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非门控胸部CT中的运动伪影限制了冠状动脉钙化（CAC）评分的准确性，而心脏门控CT由于门控要求和保险覆盖问题在人群筛查和常规成像中应用有限。ProDM旨在通过生成扩散模型恢复非门控CT中的无运动钙化病变。

Method: ProDM框架包含三个关键组件：(1) CAC运动模拟数据引擎，从心脏门控CT中合成多样化的非门控采集数据；(2) 属性感知学习策略，通过可微钙一致性损失保留病变完整性；(3) 渐进校正方案，逐步减少伪影以增强稳定性和钙保真度。

Result: 实验显示，ProDM显著提高了CAC评分的准确性、空间病变保真度和风险分层性能，读者研究进一步证实其能有效抑制运动伪影并提升临床可用性。

Conclusion: ProDM框架通过生成扩散模型有效减少了非门控CT中的运动伪影，显著提高了冠状动脉钙化（CAC）评分的准确性、空间病变保真度和风险分层性能，为常规胸部CT成像中的可靠CAC量化提供了潜力。

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring from chest CT is a well-established tool to stratify and refine clinical cardiovascular disease risk estimation. CAC quantification relies on the accurate delineation of calcified lesions, but is oftentimes affected by artifacts introduced by cardiac and respiratory motion. ECG-gated cardiac CTs substantially reduce motion artifacts, but their use in population screening and routine imaging remains limited due to gating requirements and lack of insurance coverage. Although identification of incidental CAC from non-gated chest CT is increasingly considered for it offers an accessible and widely available alternative, this modality is limited by more severe motion artifacts. We present ProDM (Property-aware Progressive Correction Diffusion Model), a generative diffusion framework that restores motion-free calcified lesions from non-gated CTs. ProDM introduces three key components: (1) a CAC motion simulation data engine that synthesizes realistic non-gated acquisitions with diverse motion trajectories directly from cardiac-gated CTs, enabling supervised training without paired data; (2) a property-aware learning strategy incorporating calcium-specific priors through a differentiable calcium consistency loss to preserve lesion integrity; and (3) a progressive correction scheme that reduces artifacts gradually across diffusion steps to enhance stability and calcium fidelity. Experiments on real patient datasets show that ProDM significantly improves CAC scoring accuracy, spatial lesion fidelity, and risk stratification performance compared with several baselines. A reader study on real non-gated scans further confirms that ProDM suppresses motion artifacts and improves clinical usability. These findings highlight the potential of progressive, property-aware frameworks for reliable CAC quantification from routine chest CT imaging.

Motivation: 现有评估框架依赖单帧评估，易导致模型通过错误过程得出正确结论（outcome-hacking），需过程感知的评估方法。

Method: 提出VIPER基准和Process-outcome Consistency (POC@r)指标，利用VLM-as-Judge分层评估中间步骤和最终结果的合理性。

Result: 实验显示，当前最先进视频模型的POC@1.0仅为20%，且存在显著outcome-hacking现象。

Conclusion: 当前视频生成模型在广义视觉推理方面存在显著差距，VIPER基准和POC@r指标的提出为未来研究提供了新的评估方向。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video generation have demonstrated an emerging capability termed Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning, where models resolve complex tasks through the generation of continuous frames. While these models show promise for Generative Video Reasoning (GVR), existing evaluation frameworks often rely on single-frame assessments, which can lead to outcome-hacking, where a model reaches a correct conclusion through an erroneous process. To address this, we propose a process-aware evaluation paradigm. We introduce VIPER, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 tasks across temporal, structural, symbolic, spatial, physics, and planning reasoning. Furthermore, we propose Process-outcome Consistency (POC@r), a new metric that utilizes VLM-as-Judge with a hierarchical rubric to evaluate both the validity of the intermediate steps and the final result. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art video models achieve only about 20% POC@1.0 and exhibit a significant outcome-hacking. We further explore the impact of test-time scaling and sampling robustness, highlighting a substantial gap between current video generation and true generalized visual reasoning. Our benchmark will be publicly released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决终身行人重识别（L-ReID）中的历史图库数据因隐私和高成本问题无法重新索引，导致新旧模型特征不兼容的问题。

Method: 提出了一种双向连续兼容表示（Bi-C2R）框架，用于持续更新旧模型提取的图库特征，以实现兼容的高效L-ReID。

Conclusion: 提出的Bi-C2R框架在RFL-ReID任务和传统L-ReID任务上均取得了领先性能。

Abstract: Lifelong person Re-IDentification (L-ReID) exploits sequentially collected data to continuously train and update a ReID model, focusing on the overall performance of all data. Its main challenge is to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem of old knowledge while training on new data. Existing L-ReID methods typically re-extract new features for all historical gallery images for inference after each update, known as "re-indexing". However, historical gallery data typically suffers from direct saving due to the data privacy issue and the high re-indexing costs for large-scale gallery images. As a result, it inevitably leads to incompatible retrieval between query features extracted by the updated model and gallery features extracted by those before the update, greatly impairing the re-identification performance. To tackle the above issue, this paper focuses on a new task called Re-index Free Lifelong person Re-IDentification (RFL-ReID), which requires performing lifelong person re-identification without re-indexing historical gallery images. Therefore, RFL-ReID is more challenging than L-ReID, requiring continuous learning and balancing new and old knowledge in diverse streaming data, and making the features output by the new and old models compatible with each other. To this end, we propose a Bidirectional Continuous Compatible Representation (Bi-C2R) framework to continuously update the gallery features extracted by the old model to perform efficient L-ReID in a compatible manner. We verify our proposed Bi-C2R method through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, which demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve leading performance on both the introduced RFL-ReID task and the traditional L-ReID task.

Conclusion: FoundationSLAM通过结合流估计与几何推理，实现了高精度的单目稠密SLAM系统，具有强泛化能力和实时性。

Abstract: We present FoundationSLAM, a learning-based monocular dense SLAM system that addresses the absence of geometric consistency in previous flow-based approaches for accurate and robust tracking and mapping. Our core idea is to bridge flow estimation with geometric reasoning by leveraging the guidance from foundation depth models. To this end, we first develop a Hybrid Flow Network that produces geometry-aware correspondences, enabling consistent depth and pose inference across diverse keyframes. To enforce global consistency, we propose a Bi-Consistent Bundle Adjustment Layer that jointly optimizes keyframe pose and depth under multi-view constraints. Furthermore, we introduce a Reliability-Aware Refinement mechanism that dynamically adapts the flow update process by distinguishing between reliable and uncertain regions, forming a closed feedback loop between matching and optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FoundationSLAM achieves superior trajectory accuracy and dense reconstruction quality across multiple challenging datasets, while running in real-time at 18 FPS, demonstrating strong generalization to various scenarios and practical applicability of our method.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种自举框架，将视觉配音从不适定的修复任务转化为条件良好的视频到视频编辑问题，显著提高了唇部同步的准确性、身份保持的忠实性以及对复杂场景的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Audio-driven visual dubbing aims to synchronize a video's lip movements with new speech, but is fundamentally challenged by the lack of ideal training data: paired videos where only a subject's lip movements differ while all other visual conditions are identical. Existing methods circumvent this with a mask-based inpainting paradigm, where an incomplete visual conditioning forces models to simultaneously hallucinate missing content and sync lips, leading to visual artifacts, identity drift, and poor synchronization. In this work, we propose a novel self-bootstrapping framework that reframes visual dubbing from an ill-posed inpainting task into a well-conditioned video-to-video editing problem. Our approach employs a Diffusion Transformer, first as a data generator, to synthesize ideal training data: a lip-altered companion video for each real sample, forming visually aligned video pairs. A DiT-based audio-driven editor is then trained on these pairs end-to-end, leveraging the complete and aligned input video frames to focus solely on precise, audio-driven lip modifications. This complete, frame-aligned input conditioning forms a rich visual context for the editor, providing it with complete identity cues, scene interactions, and continuous spatiotemporal dynamics. Leveraging this rich context fundamentally enables our method to achieve highly accurate lip sync, faithful identity preservation, and exceptional robustness against challenging in-the-wild scenarios. We further introduce a timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning strategy as a necessary component to disentangle conflicting editing objectives across diffusion timesteps, thereby facilitating stable training and yielding enhanced lip synchronization and visual fidelity. Additionally, we propose ContextDubBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for robust evaluation in diverse and challenging practical application scenarios.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在恢复时间动态和细粒度空间结构上的不足，以捕捉区分相似动作的关键细微运动线索。

Method: FineTec首先通过上下文感知补全恢复基础骨架序列，然后通过骨架空间分解模块生成增强序列，最后通过物理驱动的估计模块和GCN识别头进行联合处理。

Result: FineTec在NTU-60、NTU-120、Gym99和Gym288等基准测试中显著优于现有方法，尤其在Gym99-severe和Gym288-severe设置下分别达到89.1%和78.1%的Top-1准确率。

Conclusion: FineTec框架在时间损坏的骨架序列中显著提升了细粒度动作识别的准确性，特别是在具有严重数据缺失的真实场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Recognizing fine-grained actions from temporally corrupted skeleton sequences remains a significant challenge, particularly in real-world scenarios where online pose estimation often yields substantial missing data. Existing methods often struggle to accurately recover temporal dynamics and fine-grained spatial structures, resulting in the loss of subtle motion cues crucial for distinguishing similar actions. To address this, we propose FineTec, a unified framework for Fine-grained action recognition under Temporal Corruption. FineTec first restores a base skeleton sequence from corrupted input using context-aware completion with diverse temporal masking. Next, a skeleton-based spatial decomposition module partitions the skeleton into five semantic regions, further divides them into dynamic and static subgroups based on motion variance, and generates two augmented skeleton sequences via targeted perturbation. These, along with the base sequence, are then processed by a physics-driven estimation module, which utilizes Lagrangian dynamics to estimate joint accelerations. Finally, both the fused skeleton position sequence and the fused acceleration sequence are jointly fed into a GCN-based action recognition head. Extensive experiments on both coarse-grained (NTU-60, NTU-120) and fine-grained (Gym99, Gym288) benchmarks show that FineTec significantly outperforms previous methods under various levels of temporal corruption. Specifically, FineTec achieves top-1 accuracies of 89.1% and 78.1% on the challenging Gym99-severe and Gym288-severe settings, respectively, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法需要逐场景优化的问题，实现快速、逼真的3D场景重建与编辑。

Method: Edit3r采用前馈框架，直接从无姿态、视图不一致的指令编辑图像中预测指令对齐的3D编辑，无需优化或姿态估计。训练时使用SAM2重新着色策略生成跨视图一致的监督数据，以及不对称输入策略融合不同观察。

Result: Edit3r在DL3DV-Edit-Bench基准测试中表现优异，支持多种编辑类型，且在未训练过的2D方法编辑图像上表现良好。

Conclusion: Edit3r在语义对齐和3D一致性方面优于现有基线，且推理速度显著提升，适用于实时3D编辑应用。

Abstract: We present Edit3r, a feed-forward framework that reconstructs and edits 3D scenes in a single pass from unposed, view-inconsistent, instruction-edited images. Unlike prior methods requiring per-scene optimization, Edit3r directly predicts instruction-aligned 3D edits, enabling fast and photorealistic rendering without optimization or pose estimation. A key challenge in training such a model lies in the absence of multi-view consistent edited images for supervision. We address this with (i) a SAM2-based recoloring strategy that generates reliable, cross-view-consistent supervision, and (ii) an asymmetric input strategy that pairs a recolored reference view with raw auxiliary views, encouraging the network to fuse and align disparate observations. At inference, our model effectively handles images edited by 2D methods such as InstructPix2Pix, despite not being exposed to such edits during training. For large-scale quantitative evaluation, we introduce DL3DV-Edit-Bench, a benchmark built on the DL3DV test split, featuring 20 diverse scenes, 4 edit types and 100 edits in total. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative results show that Edit3r achieves superior semantic alignment and enhanced 3D consistency compared to recent baselines, while operating at significantly higher inference speed, making it promising for real-time 3D editing applications.

Conclusion: GaMO框架通过多视角外扩技术显著提升了稀疏视角下的3D重建质量，同时在几何一致性和计算效率上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D reconstruction have achieved remarkable progress in high-quality scene capture from dense multi-view imagery, yet struggle when input views are limited. Various approaches, including regularization techniques, semantic priors, and geometric constraints, have been implemented to address this challenge. Latest diffusion-based methods have demonstrated substantial improvements by generating novel views from new camera poses to augment training data, surpassing earlier regularization and prior-based techniques. Despite this progress, we identify three critical limitations in these state-of-the-art approaches: inadequate coverage beyond known view peripheries, geometric inconsistencies across generated views, and computationally expensive pipelines. We introduce GaMO (Geometry-aware Multi-view Outpainter), a framework that reformulates sparse-view reconstruction through multi-view outpainting. Instead of generating new viewpoints, GaMO expands the field of view from existing camera poses, which inherently preserves geometric consistency while providing broader scene coverage. Our approach employs multi-view conditioning and geometry-aware denoising strategies in a zero-shot manner without training. Extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet++ demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across 3, 6, and 9 input views, outperforming prior methods in PSNR and LPIPS, while achieving a $25\times$ speedup over SOTA diffusion-based methods with processing time under 10 minutes.

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal foundation models has revolutionized learning paradigms by enabling joint understanding across diverse data types. In the context of next-generation wireless networks, integrating sensing and communication modalities presents a unique opportunity to develop generalizable and data-efficient models. In this work, we introduce the contrastive learning based Wireless Multimodal Foundation Model (WMFM), a large-scale framework that jointly learns from wireless channel coefficients and visual imagery. The WMFM is pretrained using contrastive learning, a self-supervised learning technique that aligns embeddings of camera and channel data without requiring explicit labels. The pretrained encoders are then frozen and employed as feature extractors, with lightweight task-specific heads, fine-tuned for downstream tasks, including user localization and LoS/nLoS classification. Extensive experiments on the DeepVerse6G dataset demonstrate that the proposed WMFM achieves a 17% improvement in balanced accuracy for LoS/nLoS classification and a 48.5% reduction in localization error compared to the end-to-end (E2E) benchmark, while reducing training time by up to 90-fold. Even when trained with as little as 20% of the data, the WMFM-based heads outperform the fully supervised E2E model, underscoring their robustness and data-efficient learning. The proposed approach establishes a foundation for scalable, multimodal learning in Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems, paving the way for intelligent and adaptive 6G networks.

Conclusion: 本文总结了WiFi技术的关键进展，并展望了未来WiFi 8标准在提升可靠性方面的潜力。

Abstract: WiFi allows for the connection of devices and people around the globe. It has proven to be a monumental and revolutionary tool that keeps the world connected. However, recent WiFi advancements are numerous and at times confusing. WiFi has grown significantly over the years, yet few understand the scope and scale of WiFi progression as a whole. This paper tackles that problem, providing a broad literature review on the advancements of key WiFi features to date. This paper will center on seven key areas of focus: (1) bandwidth, (2) battery life, (3) traffic collisions, (4) interference, (5) data-intensive transmissions, (6) numerous devices, and (7) peak throughput/modulation. Each section will focus on WiFi's problems, how those problems were fixed, as well as the limitations of existing solutions. Moreover, the paper explains the role of new unreleased technologies in these seven areas. This includes exploring the upcoming WiFi 8 standard based on the IEEE 802.11bn "Ultra High Reliability" (UHR) specification and how it builds upon current specifications. Compared to previous specifications, WiFi 8 marks a stronger and more significant shift toward prioritizing reliability over pure data rates. Beyond a sole literature review, this paper uses a novel analogy. A road/highway analogy will be integrated throughout the paper to facilitate understanding of networking mechanisms. This paper is approachable and is written such that someone with very little WiFi knowledge should come away with a strong understanding of WiFi. As is typical of literature review papers, technical claims will be grounded in prior work.

Motivation: 探索SRM框架在可靠多播数据交付中的创新方法及其对后续网络架构（如NDN）的影响。

Method: 通过重新审视SRM框架，分析其数据中心模型与IP地址交付之间的不匹配，并探讨NDN如何解决这一问题。

Result: 实验发现SRM的数据中心框架与IP地址交付之间存在语义不匹配，NDN通过将网络交付与数据检索模型对齐并直接保护数据来解决这一问题。

Conclusion: 这篇论文回顾了SRM框架的挑战、经验教训及其对NDN发展的影响，强调了早期见解如何指导NDN的关键设计决策。

Abstract: A 1995 SIGCOMM paper, "A Reliable Multicast Framework for Light-weight Sessions and Application-Level Framing", commonly known as SRM, explored a fundamentally new approach to reliable multiparty data delivery. Rather than adapting established sender-driven reliable unicast mechanisms to multicast, as most contemporaneous proposals did, SRM introduced a data-centric model in which data receivers recover losses by explicitly requesting missing data. Thirty years later, we revisit the SRM framework, examining the challenges it faced, the lessons learned, and its influence on the later development of Named Data Networking (NDN). Experimentations with SRM revealed a fundamental semantic mismatch between its data-centric framework and IP's address-based delivery; while the application layer named data, the network layer remained 'blind' to those names, resulting in inefficient loss recovery. NDN resolves this architectural friction by aligning network delivery with the data-retrieval model and by securing data directly rather than securing communication channels. This retrospective highlights how early insights from SRM informed key design decisions in NDN and illustrates how NDN's design emerged from the cumulative insights gained over decades of networking research and development.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种基于可靠性理论的框架，通过结合共享与专用、主动与备用冗余策略，优化了异构雾服务器上的SFC放置问题，显著提高了性能和成本效益。

Abstract: The explosive growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has strained traditional cloud infrastructures, highlighting the need for low-latency and energy-efficient alternatives. Fog computing addresses this by placing computation near the network edge. However, limited and heterogeneous fog resources pose reliability challenges, especially for mission-critical applications. On the other hand, to improve flexibility, applications are deployed as Service Function Chains (SFCs), where each function runs as a Virtual Network Function (VNF). While scalable, this approach is more failure-prone than monolithic deployments, necessitating intelligent redundancy and placement strategies. This paper addresses the reliability-aware SFC placement problem over heterogeneous fog servers through the lens of reliability theory. We explore four redundancy strategies, combining shared vs. dedicated and active vs. standby modes, and propose a general framework to minimize latency and cost while meeting reliability and deadline constraints. The problem is formulated as an Integer Non-Linear Program (INLP), and two genetic algorithm (GA)-based solutions are developed. Simulation results show that shared-standby redundancy outperforms the conventional dedicated-active approach by up to 84%.

Abstract: Caching content is an inherent feature of Named Data Networks. Limited cache capacity of routers warrants that the choice of content being cached is judiciously done. Existing techniques resort to caching popular content to maximize utilization. However, these methods experience significant overhead for coordinating and estimating the popularity of content. To address this issue, in this paper, we present CPePC, which is a cooperative caching technique designed to improve performance. It accomplishes this through a combination of two factors. First, CPePC enhances efficiency by minimizing the overhead of popularity estimation. Second, it forecasts a parameter that governs caching decisions. Efficiency in popularity estimation is achieved by dividing the network into several non-overlapping communities using a community estimation algorithm and selecting a leader node to coordinate this on behalf of all the nodes in the community. CPePC bases its caching decisions by predicting a parameter whose value is estimated using current cache occupancy and the popularity of the content into account. We present algorithms for community detection, leader selection, content popularity estimation, and caching decisions made by the CPePC method. We evaluate and compare it with six other state-of-the-art caching techniques, with simulations performed using a discrete event simulator to show that it outperforms others.

Abstract: Semantic communications conveys task-relevant meaning rather than focusing solely on message reconstruction, improving bandwidth efficiency and robustness for next-generation wireless systems. However, learned semantic representations can still leak sensitive information to unintended receivers (eavesdroppers). This paper presents a deep learning-based semantic communication framework that jointly supports multiple receiver tasks while explicitly limiting semantic leakage to an eavesdropper. The legitimate link employs a learned encoder at the transmitter, while the receiver trains decoders for semantic inference and data reconstruction. The security problem is formulated via an iterative min-max optimization in which an eavesdropper is trained to improve its semantic inference, while the legitimate transmitter-receiver pair is trained to preserve task performance while reducing the eavesdropper's success. We also introduce an auxiliary layer that superimposes a cooperative, adversarially crafted perturbation on the transmitted waveform to degrade semantic leakage to an eavesdropper. Performance is evaluated over Rayleigh fading channels with additive white Gaussian noise using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Semantic accuracy and reconstruction quality improve with increasing latent dimension, while the min-max mechanism reduces the eavesdropper's inference performance significantly without degrading the legitimate receiver. The perturbation layer is successful in reducing semantic leakage even when the legitimate link is trained only for its own task. This comprehensive framework motivates semantic communication designs with tunable, end-to-end privacy against adaptive adversaries in realistic wireless settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于意图的网络（IBN）方法依赖统计语言模型解释用户意图，但无法保证生成配置的可行性。

Method: 开发了一个两阶段框架，包括使用NLP提取意图的解释器和通过整数线性编程计算可行VM放置和路由的优化器。

Result: 实验表明，该框架能动态更新VM放置和路由并保持可行性，LLM提取器在较少标记样本下实现更高准确率，而Sentence-BERT与SVM分类器提供更低延迟。

Conclusion: 结合NLP驱动的意图提取与基于优化的分配方法，为虚拟网络管理提供了安全、可解释且用户友好的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a chat-driven network management framework that integrates natural language processing (NLP) with optimization-based virtual network allocation, enabling intuitive and reliable reconfiguration of virtual network services. Conventional intent-based networking (IBN) methods depend on statistical language models to interpret user intent but cannot guarantee the feasibility of generated configurations. To overcome this, we develop a two-stage framework consisting of an Interpreter, which extracts intent from natural language prompts using NLP, and an Optimizer, which computes feasible virtual machine (VM) placement and routing via an integer linear programming. In particular, the Interpreter translates user chats into update directions, i.e., whether to increase, decrease, or maintain parameters such as CPU demand and latency bounds, thereby enabling iterative refinement of the network configuration. In this paper, two intent extractors, which are a Sentence-BERT model with support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and a large language model (LLM), are introduced. Experiments in single-user and multi-user settings show that the framework dynamically updates VM placement and routing while preserving feasibility. The LLM-based extractor achieves higher accuracy with fewer labeled samples, whereas the Sentence-BERT with SVM classifiers provides significantly lower latency suitable for real-time operation. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining NLP-driven intent extraction with optimization-based allocation for safe, interpretable, and user-friendly virtual network management.

Motivation: 为了解决低空多接入边缘计算（MEC）架构中任务完成延迟和能耗的优化问题，特别是在存在阻塞的情况下，通过部署混合智能反射面（IRS）增强空地连接。

Method: 论文提出了一种分层在线优化方法（HOOA），将多目标优化问题（MOOP）重新表述为Stackelberg博弈，并结合生成扩散模型增强的TD3算法（GDMTD3）和KKT方法来解决NP难问题。

Result: 仿真结果表明，HOOA在平均任务完成延迟和平均能耗方面分别比最佳基准方法和最先进的DRL算法提高了2.5%和3.1%。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的HOOA方法在动态环境中表现出优异的收敛稳定性，同时保持了强大的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-enabled low-altitude multi-access edge computing (MEC) architecture, where an aerial MEC server cooperates with a terrestrial MEC server to provide computing services, while hybrid IRSs (i.e., building-installed and UAV-carried IRSs) are deployed to enhance the air-ground connectivity under blockage. Based on this architecture, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) to minimize the task completion delay and energy consumption by jointly optimizing task offloading, UAV trajectory control, IRS phase-shift configuration, and computation resource allocation. The considered problem is NP-hard, and thus we propose a hierarchical online optimization approach (HOOA) to efficiently solve the problem. Specifically, we reformulate the MOOP as a Stackelberg game, where MEC servers collectively act as the leader to determine the system-level decisions, while the vehicles act as followers to make individual decisions. At the follower level, we present a many-to-one matching mechanism to generate feasible discrete decisions. At the leader level, we propose a generative diffusion model-enhanced twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (GDMTD3) algorithm integrated with a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)-based method, which is a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach, to determine the continuous decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed HOOA achieves significant improvements, which reduces average task completion delay by 2.5% and average energy consumption by 3.1% compared with the best-performing benchmark approach and state-of-the-art DRL algorithm, respectively. Moreover, the proposed HOOA exhibits superior convergence stability while maintaining strong robustness and scalability in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Effective communication is essential in distributed training, with predictability being one of its most significant characteristics. However, existing studies primarily focus on exploiting predictability through online profiling for runtime optimization, without a systematic understanding of it. In this work, we aim to systematically formulate communication predictability in distributed training, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs) that utilize hybrid parallelism. Our analysis focuses on both traffic patterns and communication overhead. Specifically, we investigate predictable traffic patterns in typical LLMs and evaluate how various factors influence GPU utilization and effective bandwidth (two critical variables affecting communication overhead). Furthermore, we develop an analytical formulation to estimate communication overhead in LLM training, which is validated with high accuracy against empirical data. Leveraging this formulation, we propose a configuration tuning tool, ConfigTuner, to optimize training performance. Compared to Megatron-LM, the training configurations optimized by ConfigTuner demonstrate up to a 1.36$\times$ increase in throughput. Compared to Alpa, ConfigTuner generates the same configuration suggestion while significantly reducing the search complexity.

Abstract: With the integration of cellular networks in vertical industries that demand precise location information, such as vehicle-to-everything (V2X), public safety, and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), positioning has become an imperative component for future wireless networks. By exploiting a wider spectrum, multiple antennas and flexible architectures, cellular positioning achieves ever-increasing positioning accuracy. Still, it faces fundamental performance degradation when the distance between user equipment (UE) and the base station (BS) is large or in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. To this end, the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) Rel-18 proposes to standardize sidelink (SL) positioning, which provides unique opportunities to extend the positioning coverage via direct positioning signaling between UEs. Despite the standardization advancements, the capability of SL positioning is controversial, especially how much spectrum is required to achieve the positioning accuracy defined in 3GPP. To this end, this article summarizes the latest standardization advancements of 3GPP on SL positioning comprehensively, covering a) network architecture; b) positioning types; and c) performance requirements. The capability of SL positioning using various positioning methods under different imperfect factors is evaluated and discussed in-depth. Finally, according to the evolution of SL in 3GPP Rel-19, we discuss the possible research directions and challenges of SL positioning.

Conclusion: PartMotionEdit通过其细粒度的运动编辑框架，显著提升了文本驱动的3D人体运动编辑的精确性和可解释性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Existing text-driven 3D human motion editing methods have demonstrated significant progress, but are still difficult to precisely control over detailed, part-specific motions due to their global modeling nature. In this paper, we propose PartMotionEdit, a novel fine-grained motion editing framework that operates via part-level semantic modulation. The core of PartMotionEdit is a Part-aware Motion Modulation (PMM) module, which builds upon a predefined five-part body decomposition. PMM dynamically predicts time-varying modulation weights for each body part, enabling precise and interpretable editing of local motions. To guide the training of PMM, we also introduce a part-level similarity curve supervision mechanism enhanced with dual-layer normalization. This mechanism assists PMM in learning semantically consistent and editable distributions across all body parts. Furthermore, we design a Bidirectional Motion Interaction (BMI) module. It leverages bidirectional cross-modal attention to achieve more accurate semantic alignment between textual instructions and motion semantics. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on a well-known benchmark demonstrate that PartMotionEdit outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: BATISNet通过结合语义特征和实例特征学习，以及边界感知损失函数的设计，显著提升了复杂牙科病例中的牙齿点云分割准确性和完整性。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the tooth point cloud is of great significance for diagnosis clinical assisting and treatment planning. Existing methods mostly employ semantic segmentation, focusing on the semantic feature between different types of teeth. However, due to the tightly packed structure of teeth, unclear boundaries, and the diversity of complex cases such as missing teeth, malposed teeth, semantic segmentation often struggles to achieve satisfactory results when dealing with complex dental cases. To address these issues, this paper propose BATISNet, a boundary-aware instance network for tooth point cloud segmentation. This network model consists of a feature extraction backbone and an instance segmentation module. It not only focuses on extracting the semantic features of different types of teeth but also learns the instance features of individual teeth. It helps achieve more robust and accurate tooth instance segmentation in complex clinical scenarios such as missing teeth and malposed teeth. Additionally, to further enhance the completeness and accuracy of tooth boundary segmentation, a boundary-aware loss function is designed to specifically supervise the boundary segmentation between instances. It mitigates effectively tooth adhesion and boundary ambiguity issues. Extensive experimental results show that BATISNet outperforms existing methods in tooth integrity segmentation, providing more reliable and detailed data support for practical clinical applications.

Conclusion: PhysTalk通过将3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）场景与物理模拟器直接耦合，实现了无需耗时网格提取的实时、基于物理的交互式4D动画生成，使4D动画制作更加普及和高效。

Abstract: Realistic visual simulations are omnipresent, yet their creation requires computing time, rendering, and expert animation knowledge. Open-vocabulary visual effects generation from text inputs emerges as a promising solution that can unlock immense creative potential. However, current pipelines lack both physical realism and effective language interfaces, requiring slow offline optimization. In contrast, PhysTalk takes a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene as input and translates arbitrary user prompts into real time, physics based, interactive 4D animations. A large language model (LLM) generates executable code that directly modifies 3DGS parameters through lightweight proxies and particle dynamics. Notably, PhysTalk is the first framework to couple 3DGS directly with a physics simulator without relying on time consuming mesh extraction. While remaining open vocabulary, this design enables interactive 3D Gaussian animation via collision aware, physics based manipulation of arbitrary, multi material objects. Finally, PhysTalk is train-free and computationally lightweight: this makes 4D animation broadly accessible and shifts these workflows from a "render and wait" paradigm toward an interactive dialogue with a modern, physics-informed pipeline.

Result: MSched在科学计算、深度学习和LLM任务中分别比需求分页快11.05倍和57.88倍。

Conclusion: MSched通过预测GPU内存访问模式并优化页面放置策略，显著提升了内存超载情况下的性能表现。

Abstract: The limited HBM capacity has become the primary bottleneck for hosting an increasing number of larger-scale GPU tasks. While demand paging extends capacity via host DRAM, it incurs up to 78x slowdown due to the massive working sets and poor locality of GPU workloads. We observe, however, that GPU memory access patterns are inherently predictable via kernel launch arguments and their asynchronous execution nature. Leveraging this, we propose MSched, an OS-level scheduler that extends GPU context switching to include proactive working set preparation, thereby coalescing fragmented, eventual, and expensive page faults into a single efficient migration. MSched employs a template-based approach to predict working sets with near-perfect accuracy and proposes a co-design between task scheduler and memory manager to enforce a globally optimal page placement policy. Evaluation demonstrates that MSched outperforms demand paging by up to 11.05x for scientific and deep learning workloads, and 57.88x for LLM under memory oversubscription.

Designing performant heuristics is an expensive, time-consuming process that we are forced to continuously go through due to the constant flux of hardware, workloads and environments.
  We propose a new alternative: synthesizing instance-optimal heuristics -- specialized for the exact workloads and hardware where they will be deployed -- using code-generating large language models (LLMs). To make this synthesis tractable, Vulcan separates policy and mechanism through LLM-friendly, task-agnostic interfaces. With these interfaces, users specify the inputs and objectives of their desired policy, while Vulcan searches for performant policies via evolutionary search over LLM-generated code. This interface is expressive enough to capture a wide range of system policies, yet sufficiently constrained to allow even small, inexpensive LLMs to generate correct and executable code.
  We use Vulcan to synthesize performant heuristics for cache eviction and memory tiering, and find that these heuristics outperform all human-designed state-of-the-art algorithms by upto 69% and 7.9% in performance for each of these tasks respectively.

### [124] [The Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT): A Protocol for Measuring Epistemic Robustness in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23850)
*Rahul Baxi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DDFT协议通过语义压缩和对抗性测试评估语言模型的认知稳健性，发现模型大小并非稳健性关键因素，错误检测能力才是核心。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的语言模型评估仅衡量理想条件下的知识掌握情况，而非在现实压力下的稳健性。

Method: 提出了一种两系统认知模型，包括生成流畅文本的语义系统和验证事实准确性的认知验证器。

Result: 研究发现认知稳健性与传统设计范式正交，模型大小与稳健性无显著相关性，而错误检测能力是稳健性的关键瓶颈。

Conclusion: DDFT框架为评估语言模型在关键应用部署前的认知稳健性提供了理论基础和实用工具。

Abstract: Current language model evaluations measure what models know under ideal conditions but not how robustly they know it under realistic stress. Static benchmarks like MMLU and TruthfulQA cannot distinguish a model that lacks knowledge from one whose verification mechanisms collapse when information degrades or adversaries probe for weaknesses. We introduce the Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT), a protocol that measures epistemic robustness: a model's ability to maintain factual accuracy under progressive semantic compression and adversarial fabrication. We propose a two-system cognitive model comprising a Semantic System that generates fluent text and an Epistemic Verifier that validates factual accuracy. Our findings, based on evaluating 9 frontier models across 8 knowledge domains at 5 compression levels (1,800 turn-level evaluations), reveal that epistemic robustness is orthogonal to conventional design paradigms. Neither parameter count (r=0.083, p=0.832) nor architectural type (r=0.153, p=0.695) significantly predicts robustness, suggesting it emerges from training methodology and verification mechanisms distinct from current approaches. Error detection capability strongly predicts overall robustness (rho=-0.817, p=0.007), indicating this is the critical bottleneck. We find that flagship models exhibit brittleness despite their scale, while smaller models can achieve robust performance, challenging assumptions about the relationship between model size and reliability. The DDFT framework provides both theoretical foundation and practical tools for assessing epistemic robustness before deployment in critical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前大型语言模型（LLM）代理依赖预定义工具或脆弱工具生成的局限性，提升其在复杂科学任务中的适应性和能力。

Method: CASCADE框架通过两种元技能实现：基于网络搜索和代码提取的持续学习，以及通过内省和知识图谱探索的自我反思。

Result: 在SciSkillBench基准测试中，CASCADE使用GPT-5实现了93.3%的成功率，显著高于无进化机制的35.4%。

Conclusion: CASCADE框架通过自我进化和技能共享，推动了AI辅助科学研究向可扩展性发展，展示了在复杂科学任务中的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents currently depend on predefined tools or brittle tool generation, constraining their capability and adaptability to complex scientific tasks. We introduce CASCADE, a self-evolving agentic framework representing an early instantiation of the transition from "LLM + tool use" to "LLM + skill acquisition". CASCADE enables agents to master complex external tools and codify knowledge through two meta-skills: continuous learning via web search and code extraction, and self-reflection via introspection and knowledge graph exploration, among others. We evaluate CASCADE on SciSkillBench, a benchmark of 116 materials science and chemistry research tasks. CASCADE achieves a 93.3% success rate using GPT-5, compared to 35.4% without evolution mechanisms. We further demonstrate real-world applications in computational analysis, autonomous laboratory experiments, and selective reproduction of published papers. Along with human-agent collaboration and memory consolidation, CASCADE accumulates executable skills that can be shared across agents and scientists, moving toward scalable AI-assisted scientific research.

Conclusion: McCoy框架通过结合大型语言模型（LLMs）和答案集编程（ASP），为疾病预测提供了一个强大且可解释的解决方案，初步结果在小规模疾病诊断任务中表现良好。

Abstract: Accurate disease prediction is vital for timely intervention, effective treatment, and reducing medical complications. While symbolic AI has been applied in healthcare, its adoption remains limited due to the effort required for constructing high-quality knowledge bases. This work introduces McCoy, a framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Answer Set Programming (ASP) to overcome this barrier. McCoy orchestrates an LLM to translate medical literature into ASP code, combines it with patient data, and processes it using an ASP solver to arrive at the final diagnosis. This integration yields a robust, interpretable prediction framework that leverages the strengths of both paradigms. Preliminary results show McCoy has strong performance on small-scale disease diagnosis tasks.

*Gaurab Chhetri,Subasish Das,Tausif Islam Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPARK框架通过协调的基于角色的LLM代理，实现了任务特定的检索和新兴个性化，为下一代搜索系统提供了洞察。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化搜索需要能够建模用户不断变化的多维信息需求，这对受限于静态配置文件或单一检索管道的系统提出了挑战。

Method: SPARK框架通过角色、专业知识、任务上下文和领域定义了一个角色空间，并引入了角色协调器来动态解释传入查询以激活最相关的专业代理。每个代理执行独立的检索增强生成过程，支持专用的长期和短期记忆存储以及上下文感知推理模块。代理间协作通过结构化通信协议实现。

Result: SPARK框架产生了关于协调效率、个性化质量和认知负载分布的可测试预测，同时结合了自适应学习机制以实现持续的角色优化。

Conclusion: SPARK框架通过整合细粒度的代理专业化和协作检索，为下一代搜索系统提供了洞察，能够捕捉人类信息寻求行为的复杂性、流动性和上下文敏感性。

Abstract: Personalized search demands the ability to model users' evolving, multi-dimensional information needs; a challenge for systems constrained by static profiles or monolithic retrieval pipelines. We present SPARK (Search Personalization via Agent-Driven Retrieval and Knowledge-sharing), a framework in which coordinated persona-based large language model (LLM) agents deliver task-specific retrieval and emergent personalization. SPARK formalizes a persona space defined by role, expertise, task context, and domain, and introduces a Persona Coordinator that dynamically interprets incoming queries to activate the most relevant specialized agents. Each agent executes an independent retrieval-augmented generation process, supported by dedicated long- and short-term memory stores and context-aware reasoning modules. Inter-agent collaboration is facilitated through structured communication protocols, including shared memory repositories, iterative debate, and relay-style knowledge transfer. Drawing on principles from cognitive architectures, multi-agent coordination theory, and information retrieval, SPARK models how emergent personalization properties arise from distributed agent behaviors governed by minimal coordination rules. The framework yields testable predictions regarding coordination efficiency, personalization quality, and cognitive load distribution, while incorporating adaptive learning mechanisms for continuous persona refinement. By integrating fine-grained agent specialization with cooperative retrieval, SPARK provides insights for next-generation search systems capable of capturing the complexity, fluidity, and context sensitivity of human information-seeking behavior.

TL;DR: ROAD是一种无需精细数据集的多智能体框架，通过动态调试提升LLM代理性能，实验证明其高效且优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实世界的软件工程中，通常在代理开发的初始冷启动阶段缺乏精心策划的数据集，而ROAD旨在通过动态调试调查而非随机搜索来解决这一问题。

Method: ROAD采用多智能体架构，包括分析器（Analyzer）进行根因分析、优化器（Optimizer）进行模式聚合和教练（Coach）进行策略整合，将非结构化故障日志转化为结构化的决策树协议。

Result: 实验结果显示，ROAD在标准化学术基准和实时生产知识管理引擎上均表现出色，成功率和搜索准确率分别提高了5.6%和3.8%，且在零售领域的复杂推理任务中，代理性能提升了约19%。

Conclusion: ROAD框架通过模仿人类工程师的故障分析和修复循环，为部署可靠的LLM代理提供了一种数据高效且可行的替代方案，相比资源密集型的强化学习训练更具优势。

Abstract: Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) performance, yet current state-of-the-art methods typically rely on large, labeled gold-standard development sets to compute fitness scores for evolutionary or Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches. In real-world software engineering, however, such curated datasets are rarely available during the initial cold start of agent development, where engineers instead face messy production logs and evolving failure modes. We present ROAD (Reflective Optimization via Automated Debugging), a novel framework that bypasses the need for refined datasets by treating optimization as a dynamic debugging investigation rather than a stochastic search. Unlike traditional mutation strategies, ROAD utilizes a specialized multi-agent architecture, comprising an Analyzer for root-cause analysis, an Optimizer for pattern aggregation, and a Coach for strategy integration, to convert unstructured failure logs into robust, structured Decision Tree Protocols. We evaluated ROAD across both a standardized academic benchmark and a live production Knowledge Management engine. Experimental results demonstrate that ROAD is highly sample-efficient, achieving a 5.6 percent increase in success rate (73.6 percent to 79.2 percent) and a 3.8 percent increase in search accuracy within just three automated iterations. Furthermore, on complex reasoning tasks in the retail domain, ROAD improved agent performance by approximately 19 percent relative to the baseline. These findings suggest that mimicking the human engineering loop of failure analysis and patching offers a viable, data-efficient alternative to resource-intensive RL training for deploying reliable LLM agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LoongFlow是一种自进化代理框架，通过结合LLMs和PES范式，显著提升了进化效率并降低了计算成本，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统进化方法在静态大型语言模型向自改进代理的过渡中存在结构化推理不足的问题，导致过早收敛和高维代码空间探索效率低下。

Method: LoongFlow结合了大型语言模型（LLMs）和‘计划-执行-总结’（PES）认知范式，通过混合进化记忆系统（结合多岛模型、MAP-Elites和自适应Boltzmann选择）维持长期架构一致性。

Result: 在AlphaEvolve基准和Kaggle竞赛中，LoongFlow的进化效率比领先基线（如OpenEvolve、ShinkaEvolve）高出60%，并发现了更优的解决方案。

Conclusion: LoongFlow框架在自主科学发现领域迈出了重要一步，显著提高了解决方案的质量并降低了计算开销。

Abstract: The transition from static Large Language Models (LLMs) to self-improving agents is hindered by the lack of structured reasoning in traditional evolutionary approaches. Existing methods often struggle with premature convergence and inefficient exploration in high-dimensional code spaces. To address these challenges, we introduce LoongFlow, a self-evolving agent framework that achieves state-of-the-art solution quality with significantly reduced computational costs. Unlike "blind" mutation operators, LoongFlow integrates LLMs into a cognitive "Plan-Execute-Summarize" (PES) paradigm, effectively mapping the evolutionary search to a reasoning-heavy process. To sustain long-term architectural coherence, we incorporate a hybrid evolutionary memory system. By synergizing Multi-Island models with MAP-Elites and adaptive Boltzmann selection, this system theoretically balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off, maintaining diverse behavioral niches to prevent optimization stagnation. We instantiate LoongFlow with a General Agent for algorithmic discovery and an ML Agent for pipeline optimization. Extensive evaluations on the AlphaEvolve benchmark and Kaggle competitions demonstrate that LoongFlow outperforms leading baselines (e.g., OpenEvolve, ShinkaEvolve) by up to 60% in evolutionary efficiency while discovering superior solutions. LoongFlow marks a substantial step forward in autonomous scientific discovery, enabling the generation of expert-level solutions with reduced computational overhead.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CogRec结合LLMs和Soar架构，通过动态查询和规则转化实现高效、可解释的推荐，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在推荐系统中存在'黑盒'特性、知识幻觉和在线学习能力有限等问题，而Soar认知架构虽然推理过程结构化且可解释，但知识获取困难。CogRec旨在结合两者的优势。

Method: CogRec利用Soar作为核心符号推理引擎，通过LLM初始化知识库，采用感知-认知-行动（PCA）循环，并在遇到障碍时动态查询LLM获取解决方案，通过Soar的分块机制转化为新的符号规则。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的评估显示，CogRec在推荐准确性、可解释性和长尾问题处理上表现优异。

Conclusion: CogRec结合了大型语言模型（LLMs）和Soar认知架构的优势，显著提升了推荐系统的准确性、可解释性，并有效解决了长尾问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable capacity in understanding user preferences for recommendation systems. However, they are constrained by several critical challenges, including their inherent "Black-Box" characteristics, susceptibility to knowledge hallucination, and limited online learning capacity. These factors compromise their trustworthiness and adaptability. Conversely, cognitive architectures such as Soar offer structured and interpretable reasoning processes, yet their knowledge acquisition is notoriously laborious. To address these complementary challenges, we propose a novel cognitive recommender agent called CogRec which synergizes the strengths of LLMs with the Soar cognitive architecture. CogRec leverages Soar as its core symbolic reasoning engine and leverages an LLM for knowledge initialization to populate its working memory with production rules. The agent operates on a Perception-Cognition-Action(PCA) cycle. Upon encountering an impasse, it dynamically queries the LLM to obtain a reasoned solution. This solution is subsequently transformed into a new symbolic production rule via Soar's chunking mechanism, thereby enabling robust online learning. This learning paradigm allows the agent to continuously evolve its knowledge base and furnish highly interpretable rationales for its recommendations. Extensive evaluations conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that CogRec demonstrates significant advantages in recommendation accuracy, explainability, and its efficacy in addressing the long-tail problem.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的图结构方法，用于解决ARC-AGI-3基准中的交互式推理任务，通过视觉帧处理和系统化状态探索，显著优于现有LLMs，并开源了代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论文的动机是解决ARC-AGI-3基准中的交互式推理任务，该基准包含游戏式任务，要求代理通过有限的交互推断任务机制并适应逐渐增加的复杂性。当前最先进的LLMs无法可靠解决这些任务，因此需要一种新的方法。

Method: 该方法结合了基于视觉的帧处理与系统化的状态空间探索，使用图结构表示。它将视觉帧分割为有意义的组件，基于视觉显著性优先处理动作，并维护一个探索过的状态和转换的有向图。

Result: 在ARC-AGI-3预览挑战中，该结构化探索策略解决了六款游戏中52个关卡的中位数30个，并在私有排行榜上排名第三，显著优于基于前沿LLM的代理。

Conclusion: 该论文的结论是，即使在无学习的情况下，显式的图结构探索也能作为交互式推理的强大基线，并强调了在稀疏反馈环境中系统状态跟踪和动作优先级的重要性，这些是目前大型语言模型（LLMs）无法捕捉任务动态的关键。

Abstract: We present a training-free graph-based approach for solving interactive reasoning tasks in the ARC-AGI-3 benchmark. ARC-AGI-3 comprises game-like tasks where agents must infer task mechanics through limited interactions, and adapt to increasing complexity as levels progress. Success requires forming hypotheses, testing them, and tracking discovered mechanics. The benchmark has revealed that state-of-the-art LLMs are currently incapable of reliably solving these tasks. Our method combines vision-based frame processing with systematic state-space exploration using graph-structured representations. It segments visual frames into meaningful components, prioritizes actions based on visual salience, and maintains a directed graph of explored states and transitions. By tracking visited states and tested actions, the agent prioritizes actions that provide the shortest path to untested state-action pairs. On the ARC-AGI-3 Preview Challenge, this structured exploration strategy solves a median of 30 out of 52 levels across six games and ranks 3rd on the private leaderboard, substantially outperforming frontier LLM-based agents. These results demonstrate that explicit graph-structured exploration, even without learning, can serve as a strong baseline for interactive reasoning and underscore the importance of systematic state tracking and action prioritization in sparse-feedback environments where current LLMs fail to capture task dynamics. The code is open source and available at https://github.com/dolphin-in-a-coma/arc-agi-3-just-explore.

Abstract: We introduce SCP: the Science Context Protocol, an open-source standard designed to accelerate discovery by enabling a global network of autonomous scientific agents. SCP is built on two foundational pillars: (1) Unified Resource Integration: At its core, SCP provides a universal specification for describing and invoking scientific resources, spanning software tools, models, datasets, and physical instruments. This protocol-level standardization enables AI agents and applications to discover, call, and compose capabilities seamlessly across disparate platforms and institutional boundaries. (2) Orchestrated Experiment Lifecycle Management: SCP complements the protocol with a secure service architecture, which comprises a centralized SCP Hub and federated SCP Servers. This architecture manages the complete experiment lifecycle (registration, planning, execution, monitoring, and archival), enforces fine-grained authentication and authorization, and orchestrates traceable, end-to-end workflows that bridge computational and physical laboratories. Based on SCP, we have constructed a scientific discovery platform that offers researchers and agents a large-scale ecosystem of more than 1,600 tool resources. Across diverse use cases, SCP facilitates secure, large-scale collaboration between heterogeneous AI systems and human researchers while significantly reducing integration overhead and enhancing reproducibility. By standardizing scientific context and tool orchestration at the protocol level, SCP establishes essential infrastructure for scalable, multi-institution, agent-driven science.

Conclusion: 本文提出的基于深度强化学习的方法在解决FSMVRP问题上表现出色，尤其在计算效率和可扩展性方面具有显著优势，为实际应用提供了潜在价值，并启发了将DRL技术扩展到其他VRP变体的可能性。

Abstract: The Fleet Size and Mix Vehicle Routing Problem (FSMVRP) is a prominent variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), extensively studied in operations research and computational science. FSMVRP requires simultaneous decisions on fleet composition and routing, making it highly applicable to real-world scenarios such as short-term vehicle rental and on-demand logistics. However, these requirements also increase the complexity of FSMVRP, posing significant challenges, particularly in large-scale and time-constrained environments. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for solving FSMVRP, capable of generating near-optimal solutions within a few seconds. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and develop a novel policy network, termed FRIPN, that seamlessly integrates fleet composition and routing decisions. Our method incorporates specialized input embeddings designed for distinctdecision objectives, including a remaining graph embedding to facilitate effective vehicle employment decisions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on both randomly generated instances and benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits notable advantages in terms of computational efficiency and scalability, particularly in large-scale and time-constrained scenarios. These strengths highlight the potential of our approach for practical applications and provide valuable inspiration for extending DRL-based techniques to other variants of VRP.

TL;DR: RSA是一种新型对齐方法，通过嵌套风险度量显式纳入风险意识，有效控制模型偏移和罕见有害行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法（如Safe RLHF和SACPO）在风险中性范式下运行，无法有效应对参考策略偏离和罕见但灾难性有害行为的风险。

Method: RSA将安全对齐问题转化为基于嵌套风险度量的令牌级风险感知约束策略优化问题，并通过逐步对齐过程实现策略更新。

Result: 实验结果表明，RSA在保持高有用性的同时确保了强安全性，并显著抑制了低概率高影响的尾部风险。

Conclusion: RSA方法通过引入风险意识，在保持模型有用性的同时显著提升了安全性和对尾部风险的控制。

Abstract: When fine-tuning pre-trained Language Models (LMs) to exhibit desired behaviors, maintaining control over risk is critical for ensuring both safety and trustworthiness. Most existing safety alignment methods, such as Safe RLHF and SACPO, typically operate under a risk-neutral paradigm that is insufficient to address the risks arising from deviations from the reference policy and offers limited robustness against rare but potentially catastrophic harmful behaviors. To address this limitation, we propose Risk-aware Stepwise Alignment (RSA), a novel alignment method that explicitly incorporates risk awareness into the policy optimization process by leveraging a class of nested risk measures. Specifically, RSA formulates safety alignment as a token-level risk-aware constrained policy optimization problem and solves it through a stepwise alignment procedure that yields token-level policy updates derived from the nested risk measures. This design offers two key benefits: (1) it mitigates risks induced by excessive model shift away from a reference policy, and (2) it explicitly suppresses low-probability yet high-impact harmful behaviors. Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis on policy optimality under mild assumptions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high levels of helpfulness while ensuring strong safety and significantly suppresses tail risks, namely low-probability yet high-impact unsafe responses.

Motivation: 针对部分可观测环境下LLM代理的世界状态对齐问题，现有方法通常依赖梯度更新或额外训练，存在效率低下或集成复杂度高的问题。本文旨在提出一种无需梯度更新或额外训练的高效对齐方法。

Method: 代理通过维护外部结构化环境状态信念，基于动作条件观察进行迭代更新，并通过最大化信念空间上的预测信息增益来选择动作。信息增益通过轻量级LLM代理估计，世界对齐通过量化后验信念与真实环境配置一致性的新颖奖励来评估。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在潜在世界状态对齐方面优于基于提示增强或检索增强的LLM基线方法，且集成开销显著降低。

Conclusion: 本文提出的测试时自适应代理通过后验引导的信念细化，在不依赖基于梯度的更新或额外训练的情况下，显著提升了在部分可观测环境下LLM代理的世界状态对齐性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a test-time adaptive agent that performs exploratory inference through posterior-guided belief refinement without relying on gradient-based updates or additional training for LLM agent operating under partial observability. Our agent maintains an external structured belief over the environment state, iteratively updates it via action-conditioned observations, and selects actions by maximizing predicted information gain over the belief space. We estimate information gain using a lightweight LLM-based surrogate and assess world alignment through a novel reward that quantifies the consistency between posterior belief and ground-truth environment configuration. Experiments show that our method outperforms inference-time scaling baselines such as prompt-augmented or retrieval-enhanced LLMs, in aligning with latent world states with significantly lower integration overhead.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一个在表示空间中规划的模型（JEPA-WMs），通过优化模型架构、训练目标和规划算法，显著提升了在导航和操作任务中的表现，优于现有基线DINO-WM和V-JEPA-2-AC。

Abstract: A long-standing challenge in AI is to develop agents capable of solving a wide range of physical tasks and generalizing to new, unseen tasks and environments. A popular recent approach involves training a world model from state-action trajectories and subsequently use it with a planning algorithm to solve new tasks. Planning is commonly performed in the input space, but a recent family of methods has introduced planning algorithms that optimize in the learned representation space of the world model, with the promise that abstracting irrelevant details yields more efficient planning. In this work, we characterize models from this family as JEPA-WMs and investigate the technical choices that make algorithms from this class work. We propose a comprehensive study of several key components with the objective of finding the optimal approach within the family. We conducted experiments using both simulated environments and real-world robotic data, and studied how the model architecture, the training objective, and the planning algorithm affect planning success. We combine our findings to propose a model that outperforms two established baselines, DINO-WM and V-JEPA-2-AC, in both navigation and manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了交互式评估框架，揭示探索、记忆和推理在基础模型空间理解中的不同作用，强调特定机制对提升空间能力的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对基础模型空间能力的评估多基于静态地图或文本查询，忽视了空间理解的交互性和经验驱动特性。

Method: 提出了一个交互式评估框架，通过逐步探索部分可观察的网格地图（包含道路、交叉点和兴趣点），并评估六种空间任务的表现。

Result: 探索策略主要影响经验获取但对最终推理准确性影响有限；记忆表示（尤其是序列和图结构）在整合空间经验中起核心作用；推理方案（如高级提示）支持更有效的多步推理；空间推理性能在模型版本和规模超过一定阈值后会趋于饱和。

Conclusion: 研究发现，空间理解能力的提升需要针对空间表示和推理的特定机制，而非单纯依赖模型规模的扩大。

Abstract: Map environments provide a fundamental medium for representing spatial structure. Understanding how foundation model (FM) agents understand and act in such environments is therefore critical for enabling reliable map-based reasoning and applications. However, most existing evaluations of spatial ability in FMs rely on static map inputs or text-based queries, overlooking the interactive and experience-driven nature of spatial understanding.In this paper, we propose an interactive evaluation framework to analyze how FM agents explore, remember, and reason in symbolic map environments. Agents incrementally explore partially observable grid-based maps consisting of roads, intersections, and points of interest (POIs), receiving only local observations at each step. Spatial understanding is then evaluated using six kinds of spatial tasks. By systematically varying exploration strategies, memory representations, and reasoning schemes across multiple foundation models, we reveal distinct functional roles of these components. Exploration primarily affects experience acquisition but has a limited impact on final reasoning accuracy. In contrast, memory representation plays a central role in consolidating spatial experience, with structured memories particularly sequential and graph-based representations, substantially improving performance on structure-intensive tasks such as path planning. Reasoning schemes further shape how stored spatial knowledge is used, with advanced prompts supporting more effective multi-step inference. We further observe that spatial reasoning performance saturates across model versions and scales beyond a certain capability threshold, indicating that improvements in map-based spatial understanding require mechanisms tailored to spatial representation and reasoning rather than scaling alone.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多使用相同数据集进行基准测试，限制了结果的普遍性，未能充分捕捉数学任务中的多样化挑战。本研究旨在分析LLMs在代表性不足的数学竞赛问题上的表现。

Method: 研究通过让三个领先的LLMs（GPT-4o-mini、Gemini-2.0-Flash和DeepSeek-V3）解答密苏里大学数学竞赛中的微积分、解析几何和离散数学问题，并将其回答与已知正确答案进行比较，以确定各问题领域的准确性。同时分析了LLMs的推理过程，探索错误模式。

Result: DeepSeek-V3在微积分、解析几何和离散数学三个类别中表现最佳，包括推理和最终答案的正确性。所有三个LLMs在几何领域表现明显较弱。DeepSeek-V3的错误多为计算和逻辑错误，GPT-4o-mini常见逻辑和方法错误，而Gemini则倾向于不完整推理和草率结论。

Conclusion: 评估LLMs在代表性不足的数学竞赛数据集上的表现，可以更深入地了解其独特的错误模式，并突出结构化推理中的持续挑战，尤其是在几何领域。

Abstract: Understanding the limitations of Large Language Models, or LLMs, in mathematical reasoning has been the focus of several recent studies. However, the majority of these studies use the same datasets for benchmarking, which limits the generalizability of their findings and may not fully capture the diverse challenges present in mathematical tasks. The purpose of the present study is to analyze the performance of LLMs on underrepresented mathematics competition problems. We prompted three leading LLMs, namely GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-2.0-Flash, and DeepSeek-V3, with the Missouri Collegiate Mathematics Competition problems in the areas of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics. The LLMs responses were then compared to the known correct solutions in order to determine the accuracy of the LLM for each problem domain. We also analyzed the LLMs reasoning to explore patterns in errors across problem types and models. DeepSeek-V3 has the best performance in all three categories of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics, both in reasoning and correct final answers. All three LLMs exhibited notably weak performance in Geometry. The majority of errors made by DeepSeek-V3 were attributed to computational and logical mistakes, whereas GPT-4o-mini frequently exhibited logical and approach-related errors. Gemini, on the other hand, tended to struggle with incomplete reasoning and drawing rushed conclusions. In conclusion, evaluating LLMs on underrepresented mathematics competition datasets can provide deeper insights into their distinct error patterns and highlight ongoing challenges in structured reasoning, particularly within the domain of Geometry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在通用语言任务上表现优异，但在结构化环境中的空间变换和多步规划方面仍存在困难，因此需要一种分解空间推理的方法。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先通过监督微调训练模型掌握基本空间物理变换（如旋转、平移和缩放），然后冻结该模型并训练轻量级LoRA适配器，在GRPO框架下学习多步规划策略。

Result: 该方法在动态和静态环境中均优于基线模型，训练收敛更快且更稳定，并通过注意力模式分析验证了空间理解的提升。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段方法在空间推理任务中表现优于基线模型，包括通用骨干模型、物理感知模型和端到端RL模型，且在动态和静态环境中均表现出色。此外，该方法训练收敛更快且更稳定。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has gained increasing attention due to applications in navigation and planning. Despite strong general language capabilities, LLMs still struggle with spatial transformations and multi-step planning in structured environments. We propose a two-stage approach that decomposes spatial reasoning into atomic building blocks and their composition. First, we apply supervised fine-tuning on elementary spatial transformations, such as rotation, translation, and scaling, to equip the model with basic spatial physics. We then freeze this physics-aware model and train lightweight LoRA adapters within the GRPO framework to learn policies that compose these building blocks for multi-step planning in puzzle-based environments, in a closed-loop manner. To support this pipeline, we synthesize an ASCII-art dataset and construct a corresponding ASCII-based reinforcement learning environment. Our method consistently outperforms baselines, including the generic backbone, physics-aware model, and end-to-end RL models, under both Dynamic environments with explicit state updates and Static environments where the model must rely on its internal state across steps. In addition, the proposed approach converges faster and exhibits more stable training compared to end-to-end reinforcement learning from scratch. Finally, we analyze attention patterns to assess whether fine-tuning induces meaningful improvements in spatial understanding.

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，不同的大型语言模型在处理复杂、多步骤工具调用时存在显著性能差异，MCPAgentBench作为一个基于真实MCP定义的基准测试，有效评估了代理的工具使用能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly serving as autonomous agents, and their utilization of external tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is considered a future trend. Current MCP evaluation sets suffer from issues such as reliance on external MCP services and a lack of difficulty awareness. To address these limitations, we propose MCPAgentBench, a benchmark based on real-world MCP definitions designed to evaluate the tool-use capabilities of agents. We construct a dataset containing authentic tasks and simulated MCP tools. The evaluation employs a dynamic sandbox environment that presents agents with candidate tool lists containing distractors, thereby testing their tool selection and discrimination abilities. Furthermore, we introduce comprehensive metrics to measure both task completion rates and execution efficiency. Experiments conducted on various latest mainstream Large Language Models reveal significant performance differences in handling complex, multi-step tool invocations.

Method: 提出递归语言模型（RLMs），一种通用的推理策略，将长提示视为外部环境的一部分，允许LLM以编程方式检查、分解并递归调用自身处理提示片段。

Result: RLMs成功处理了超出模型上下文窗口两个数量级的输入，即使在较短提示下，也在四种不同的长上下文任务中显著优于基础LLMs和常见长上下文框架。

Conclusion: RLMs能够有效处理超出模型上下文窗口的长提示，且在多种长上下文任务中表现优于基础LLMs和常见的长上下文框架，同时保持查询成本相当或更低。

Abstract: We study allowing large language models (LLMs) to process arbitrarily long prompts through the lens of inference-time scaling. We propose Recursive Language Models (RLMs), a general inference strategy that treats long prompts as part of an external environment and allows the LLM to programmatically examine, decompose, and recursively call itself over snippets of the prompt. We find that RLMs successfully handle inputs up to two orders of magnitude beyond model context windows and, even for shorter prompts, dramatically outperform the quality of base LLMs and common long-context scaffolds across four diverse long-context tasks, while having comparable (or cheaper) cost per query.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in language tasks but often lack collaborative awareness and struggle to optimize global performance in multi-agent settings. We present a reinforcement learning-augmented LLM agent framework that formulates cooperation as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) and adopts centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE). We introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize agent policies with access to global signals during training, together with a simplified joint reward that balances task quality, speed, and coordination cost. On collaborative writing and coding benchmarks, our framework delivers a 3x increase in task processing speed over single-agent baselines, 98.7% structural/style consistency in writing, and a 74.6% test pass rate in coding. The approach consistently outperforms strong multi-agent LLM baselines and provides a practical path toward reliable collaboration in complex workflows.

Abstract: This paper proposes a group deliberation oriented multi-agent conversational model to address the limitations of single large language models in complex reasoning tasks. The model adopts a three-level role division architecture consisting of generation, verification, and integration. An opinion generation agent produces diverse reasoning perspectives, an evidence verification agent retrieves external knowledge and quantifies factual support, and a consistency arbitration agent integrates logically coherent conclusions. A self-game mechanism is introduced to expand multi-path reasoning trajectories, while a retrieval enhancement module dynamically supplements external knowledge. A composite reward function combining factual consistency and logical coherence is designed, and an improved proximal policy optimization strategy is applied for collaborative training. Experimental results show that the proposed model improves multi-hop reasoning accuracy by 16.8 percent on HotpotQA, 14.3 percent on 2WikiMultihopQA, and 19.2 percent on MeetingBank, while improving consistency by 21.5 percent. The model achieves higher reasoning efficiency than mainstream multi-agent approaches, providing an effective and stable solution for complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Youtu-Agent 是一个模块化框架，通过自动化生成和持续进化解决了现有LLM代理框架的高配置成本和静态能力问题，实验证明了其在多个任务上的卓越性能。

Abstract: Existing Large Language Model (LLM) agent frameworks face two significant challenges: high configuration costs and static capabilities. Building a high-quality agent often requires extensive manual effort in tool integration and prompt engineering, while deployed agents struggle to adapt to dynamic environments without expensive fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Youtu-Agent}, a modular framework designed for the automated generation and continuous evolution of LLM agents. Youtu-Agent features a structured configuration system that decouples execution environments, toolkits, and context management, enabling flexible reuse and automated synthesis. We introduce two generation paradigms: a \textbf{Workflow} mode for standard tasks and a \textbf{Meta-Agent} mode for complex, non-standard requirements, capable of automatically generating tool code, prompts, and configurations. Furthermore, Youtu-Agent establishes a hybrid policy optimization system: (1) an \textbf{Agent Practice} module that enables agents to accumulate experience and improve performance through in-context optimization without parameter updates; and (2) an \textbf{Agent RL} module that integrates with distributed training frameworks to enable scalable and stable reinforcement learning of any Youtu-Agents in an end-to-end, large-scale manner. Experiments demonstrate that Youtu-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on WebWalkerQA (71.47\%) and GAIA (72.8\%) using open-weight models. Our automated generation pipeline achieves over 81\% tool synthesis success rate, while the Practice module improves performance on AIME 2024/2025 by +2.7\% and +5.4\% respectively. Moreover, our Agent RL training achieves 40\% speedup with steady performance improvement on 7B LLMs, enhancing coding/reasoning and searching capabilities respectively up to 35\% and 21\% on Maths and general/multi-hop QA benchmarks.

Abstract: Intelligent fault diagnosis has become an indispensable technique for ensuring machinery reliability. However, existing methods suffer significant performance decline in real-world scenarios where models are tested under unseen working conditions, while domain adaptation approaches are limited to their reliance on target domain samples. Moreover, most existing studies rely on single-modal sensing signals, overlooking the complementary nature of multi-modal information for improving model generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis. A dual disentanglement framework is developed to decouple modality-invariant and modality-specific features, as well as domain-invariant and domain-specific representations, enabling both comprehensive multi-modal representation learning and robust domain generalization. A cross-domain mixed fusion strategy is designed to randomly mix modality information across domains for modality and domain diversity augmentation. Furthermore, a triple-modal fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively integrate multi-modal heterogeneous information. Extensive experiments are conducted on induction motor fault diagnosis under both unseen constant and time-varying working conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms advanced methods and comprehensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each proposed component and multi-modal fusion.

Abstract: Fault diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries is critical for system safety. While existing deep learning methods exhibit superior detection accuracy, their "black-box" nature hinders interpretability. Furthermore, restricted by binary classification paradigms, they struggle to provide root cause analysis and maintenance recommendations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes BatteryAgent, a hierarchical framework that integrates physical knowledge features with the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework comprises three core modules: (1) A Physical Perception Layer that utilizes 10 mechanism-based features derived from electrochemical principles, balancing dimensionality reduction with physical fidelity; (2) A Detection and Attribution Layer that employs Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and SHAP to quantify feature contributions; and (3) A Reasoning and Diagnosis Layer that leverages an LLM as the agent core. This layer constructs a "numerical-semantic" bridge, combining SHAP attributions with a mechanism knowledge base to generate comprehensive reports containing fault types, root cause analysis, and maintenance suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that BatteryAgent effectively corrects misclassifications on hard boundary samples, achieving an AUROC of 0.986, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the framework extends traditional binary detection to multi-type interpretable diagnosis, offering a new paradigm shift from "passive detection" to "intelligent diagnosis" for battery safety management.

Abstract: Robotic systems for household object rearrangement often rely on latent preference models inferred from human demonstrations. While effective at prediction, these models offer limited insight into the interpretable factors that guide human decisions. We introduce an explicit formulation of object arrangement preferences along four interpretable constructs: spatial practicality (putting items where they naturally fit best in the space), habitual convenience (making frequently used items easy to reach), semantic coherence (placing items together if they are used for the same task or are contextually related), and commonsense appropriateness (putting things where people would usually expect to find them). To capture these constructs, we designed and validated a self-report questionnaire through a 63-participant online study. Results confirm the psychological distinctiveness of these constructs and their explanatory power across two scenarios (kitchen and living room). We demonstrate the utility of these constructs by integrating them into a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner and show that when guided by participant-derived preferences, our planner can generate reasonable arrangements that closely align with those generated by participants. This work contributes a compact, interpretable formulation of object arrangement preferences and a demonstration of how it can be operationalized for robot planning.

Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然具备广泛的领域知识，但往往无法捕捉对预测任务至关重要的数据集特定模式，GenZ旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用广义EM算法，联合优化语义特征描述符和统计模型参数，通过迭代过程对比统计建模误差识别的项目组来发现语义特征描述。

Result: 在房价预测中，模型的中位数相对误差为12%，显著优于GPT-5基线（38%）；在电影推荐中，模型仅通过语义描述就达到了0.59的余弦相似度，与传统协同过滤需4000用户评分的性能相当。

Conclusion: GenZ模型通过结合基础模型和统计建模，发现了数据集特定的语义特征，显著提升了预测任务的性能，并在房价预测和电影推荐两个领域验证了其有效性。

Abstract: We present GenZ, a hybrid model that bridges foundational models and statistical modeling through interpretable semantic features. While large language models possess broad domain knowledge, they often fail to capture dataset-specific patterns critical for prediction tasks. Our approach addresses this by discovering semantic feature descriptions through an iterative process that contrasts groups of items identified via statistical modeling errors, rather than relying solely on the foundational model's domain understanding. We formulate this as a generalized EM algorithm that jointly optimizes semantic feature descriptors and statistical model parameters. The method prompts a frozen foundational model to classify items based on discovered features, treating these judgments as noisy observations of latent binary features that predict real-valued targets through learned statistical relationships. We demonstrate the approach on two domains: house price prediction (hedonic regression) and cold-start collaborative filtering for movie recommendations. On house prices, our model achieves 12\% median relative error using discovered semantic features from multimodal listing data, substantially outperforming a GPT-5 baseline (38\% error) that relies on the LLM's general domain knowledge. For Netflix movie embeddings, our model predicts collaborative filtering representations with 0.59 cosine similarity purely from semantic descriptions -- matching the performance that would require approximately 4000 user ratings through traditional collaborative filtering. The discovered features reveal dataset-specific patterns (e.g., architectural details predicting local housing markets, franchise membership predicting user preferences) that diverge from the model's domain knowledge alone.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的方法通过使用约束模板和排除异常约束的机制，成功生成了满足所有硬约束并减少软约束违规的护理人员排班表。

Abstract: Technologies for automatically generating work schedules have been extensively studied; however, in long-term care facilities, the conditions vary between facilities, making it essential to interview the managers who create shift schedules to design facility-specific constraint conditions. The proposed method utilizes constraint templates to extract combinations of various components, such as shift patterns for consecutive days or staff combinations. The templates can extract a variety of constraints by changing the number of days and the number of staff members to focus on and changing the extraction focus to patterns or frequency. In addition, unlike existing constraint extraction techniques, this study incorporates mechanisms to exclude exceptional constraints. The extracted constraints can be employed by a constraint programming solver to create care worker schedules. Experiments demonstrated that our proposed method successfully created schedules that satisfied all hard constraints and reduced the number of violations for soft constraints by circumventing the extraction of exceptional constraints.

Abstract: Agentic crafting requires LLMs to operate in real-world environments over multiple turns by taking actions, observing outcomes, and iteratively refining artifacts. Despite its importance, the open-source community lacks a principled, end-to-end ecosystem to streamline agent development. We introduce the Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE), a foundational infrastructure that optimizes the production pipeline for agent LLMs. ALE consists of three components: ROLL, a post-training framework for weight optimization; ROCK, a sandbox environment manager for trajectory generation; and iFlow CLI, an agent framework for efficient context engineering. We release ROME (ROME is Obviously an Agentic Model), an open-source agent grounded by ALE and trained on over one million trajectories. Our approach includes data composition protocols for synthesizing complex behaviors and a novel policy optimization algorithm, Interaction-based Policy Alignment (IPA), which assigns credit over semantic interaction chunks rather than individual tokens to improve long-horizon training stability. Empirically, we evaluate ROME within a structured setting and introduce Terminal Bench Pro, a benchmark with improved scale and contamination control. ROME demonstrates strong performance across benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and Terminal Bench, proving the effectiveness of the ALE infrastructure.

Abstract: This report presents the design and implementation of a semi-automated data annotation pipeline developed within the DARTS project, whose goal is to create a large-scale, multimodal dataset of driving scenarios recorded in Polish conditions. Manual annotation of such heterogeneous data is both costly and time-consuming.

The system automatically generates initial annotations, enables iterative model retraining, and incorporates data anonymization and domain adaptation techniques. At its core, the tool relies on 3D object detection algorithms to produce preliminary annotations. Overall, the developed tools and methodology result in substantial time savings while ensuring consistent, high-quality annotations across different sensor modalities. The solution directly supports the DARTS project by accelerating the preparation of large annotated dataset in the project's standardized format, strengthening the technological base for autonomous vehicle research in Poland.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索迭代部署和用户数据筛选如何影响LLMs的特性，特别是在规划任务中的表现，并理解其与强化学习的潜在联系。

Method: 通过在多个规划领域测试迭代部署机制，观察模型规划能力的提升及泛化能力的涌现，并结合理论分析揭示其与强化学习的关联。

Result: 迭代部署显著提升了模型的规划能力，后续模型展现出发现更长规划的泛化能力。理论分析表明，这一机制隐含实现了强化学习的外循环训练。

Conclusion: 迭代部署大型语言模型（LLMs）并通过用户精心筛选的数据进行微调，可以显著改变模型的特性。这一机制不仅在实践中提升了规划能力，还揭示了与强化学习（RL）的深层联系，为AI安全和模型训练提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We show that iterative deployment of large language models (LLMs), each fine-tuned on data carefully curated by users from the previous models' deployment, can significantly change the properties of the resultant models. By testing this mechanism on various planning domains, we observe substantial improvements in planning skills, with later models displaying emergent generalization by discovering much longer plans than the initial models. We then provide theoretical analysis showing that iterative deployment effectively implements reinforcement learning (RL) training in the outer-loop (i.e. not as part of intentional model training), with an implicit reward function. The connection to RL has two important implications: first, for the field of AI safety, as the reward function entailed by repeated deployment is not defined explicitly, and could have unexpected implications to the properties of future model deployments. Second, the mechanism highlighted here can be viewed as an alternative training regime to explicit RL, relying on data curation rather than explicit rewards.

Abstract: We present STAgent, an agentic large language model tailored for spatio-temporal understanding, designed to solve complex tasks such as constrained point-of-interest discovery and itinerary planning. STAgent is a specialized model capable of interacting with ten distinct tools within spatio-temporal scenarios, enabling it to explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps during complex reasoning. Notably, STAgent effectively preserves its general capabilities. We empower STAgent with these capabilities through three key contributions: (1) a stable tool environment that supports over ten domain-specific tools, enabling asynchronous rollout and training; (2) a hierarchical data curation framework that identifies high-quality data like a needle in a haystack, curating high-quality queries with a filter ratio of 1:10,000, emphasizing both diversity and difficulty; and (3) a cascaded training recipe that starts with a seed SFT stage acting as a guardian to measure query difficulty, followed by a second SFT stage fine-tuned on queries with high certainty, and an ultimate RL stage that leverages data of low certainty. Initialized with Qwen3-30B-A3B to establish a strong SFT foundation and leverage insights into sample difficulty, STAgent yields promising performance on TravelBench while maintaining its general capabilities across a wide range of general benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed agentic model.

Abstract: Cloud data pipelines increasingly operate under dynamic workloads, evolving schemas, cost constraints, and strict governance requirements. Despite advances in cloud-native orchestration frameworks, most production pipelines rely on static configurations and reactive operational practices, resulting in prolonged recovery times, inefficient resource utilization, and high manual overhead. This paper presents Agentic Cloud Data Engineering, a policy-aware control architecture that integrates bounded AI agents into the governance and control plane of cloud data pipelines. In Agentic Cloud Data Engineering platform, specialized agents analyze pipeline telemetry and metadata, reason over declarative cost and compliance policies, and propose constrained operational actions such as adaptive resource reconfiguration, schema reconciliation, and automated failure recovery. All agent actions are validated against governance policies to ensure predictable and auditable behavior. We evaluate Agentic Cloud Data Engineering platform using representative batch and streaming analytics workloads constructed from public enterprise-style datasets. Experimental results show that Agentic Cloud Data Engineering platform reduces mean pipeline recovery time by up to 45%, lowers operational cost by approximately 25%, and decreases manual intervention events by over 70% compared to static orchestration, while maintaining data freshness and policy compliance. These results demonstrate that policy-bounded agentic control provides an effective and practical approach for governing cloud data pipelines in enterprise environments.

Abstract: Edge computing enables latency-critical applications to process data close to end devices, yet task heterogeneity and limited resources pose significant challenges to efficient orchestration. This paper presents a measurement-driven, container-based resource management framework for intra-node optimization on a single edge server hosting multiple heterogeneous applications. Extensive profiling experiments are conducted to derive a nonlinear fitting model that characterizes the relationship among CPU/memory allocations and processing latency across diverse workloads, enabling reliable estimation of performance under varying configurations and providing quantitative support for subsequent optimization. Using this model and a queueing-based delay formulation, we formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem to jointly minimize system latency and power consumption, which is shown to be NP-hard. The problem is decomposed into tractable convex subproblems and solved through a two-stage container-based resource management scheme (CRMS) combining convex optimization and greedy refinement. The proposed scheme achieves polynomial-time complexity and supports quasi-dynamic execution under global resource constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that CRMS reduces latency by over 14\% and improves energy efficiency compared with heuristic and search-based baselines, offering a practical and scalable solution for heterogeneous edge environments with dynamic workload characteristics.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables mobile edge devices, functioning as clients, to collaboratively train a decentralized model while ensuring local data privacy. However, the efficiency of FL in wireless networks is limited not only by constraints on communication and computational resources but also by significant data heterogeneity among clients, particularly in large-scale networks. This paper first presents a theoretical analysis of the impact of client data heterogeneity on global model generalization error, which can result in repeated training cycles, increased energy consumption, and prolonged latency. Based on the theoretical insights, an optimization problem is formulated to jointly minimize learning latency and energy consumption while constraining generalization error. A joint client selection and resource allocation (CSRA) approach is then proposed, employing a series of convex optimization and relaxation techniques. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CSRA scheme yields higher test accuracy, reduced learning latency, and lower energy consumption compared to baseline methods that do not account for data heterogeneity.

Result: 实验结果表明，PackKV在保持与最先进量化方法相同的准确度下降下，平均实现了K缓存153.2%和V缓存179.6%的内存减少率，并在A100和RTX Pro 6000 GPU上分别实现了75.7%和171.7%的平均吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: PackKV是一种高效且通用的KV缓存管理框架，针对长上下文生成进行了优化，通过新颖的有损压缩技术和系统架构的协同设计，显著减少了内存需求并提高了执行吞吐量。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential across a wide range of practical applications. However, long-context inference remains a significant challenge due to the substantial memory requirements of the key-value (KV) cache, which can scale to several gigabytes as sequence length and batch size increase. In this paper, we present \textbf{PackKV}, a generic and efficient KV cache management framework optimized for long-context generation. %, which synergistically supports both latency-critical and throughput-critical inference scenarios. PackKV introduces novel lossy compression techniques specifically tailored to the characteristics of KV cache data, featuring a careful co-design of compression algorithms and system architecture. Our approach is compatible with the dynamically growing nature of the KV cache while preserving high computational efficiency. Experimental results show that, under the same and minimum accuracy drop as state-of-the-art quantization methods, PackKV achieves, on average, \textbf{153.2}\% higher memory reduction rate for the K cache and \textbf{179.6}\% for the V cache. Furthermore, PackKV delivers extremely high execution throughput, effectively eliminating decompression overhead and accelerating the matrix-vector multiplication operation. Specifically, PackKV achieves an average throughput improvement of \textbf{75.7}\% for K and \textbf{171.7}\% for V across A100 and RTX Pro 6000 GPUs, compared to cuBLAS matrix-vector multiplication kernels, while demanding less GPU memory bandwidth.

Motivation: 随着LLM和基础模型的扩展，检查点/恢复成为训练和推理的关键模式，但现有方法在高并发下存在性能瓶颈。

Method: 开发微基准测试来量化使用liburing时的权衡，评估聚合、对齐和I/O合并在不同I/O模式下的表现。

Result: 相比现有LLM检查点引擎，我们的方法实现了高达3.9倍的写入吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: 本研究强调了在现代文件系统和I/O后端中，对齐和聚合策略的重要性，通过优化实现了比现有LLM检查点引擎更高的写入吞吐量。

Abstract: As LLMs and foundation models scale, checkpoint/restore has become a critical pattern for training and inference. With 3D parallelism (tensor, pipeline, data), checkpointing involves many processes, each managing numerous tensors of varying shapes and sizes, that must be persisted frequently to stable storage (e.g., parallel file systems). This turns checkpoint/restore into a big-data I/O problem characterized by volume, variety, and velocity. The workflow must traverse the full storage stack -- from GPU memory through host memory and local storage to external repositories -- whose tiers differ by orders of magnitude in performance, creating bottlenecks under concurrency even with asynchronous flush/prefetch. Kernel-accelerated I/O libraries such as \texttt{liburing} may mitigate these issues versus POSIX, but their effectiveness for LLM checkpointing remains underexplored. We develop microbenchmarks to quantify trade-offs when using \texttt{liburing}, evaluating how aggregation, alignment, and I/O coalescing interact under buffered and direct I/O. We find that uncoalesced small-buffer operations halve throughput relative to synthetic workloads, while file system-aware aggregation restores bandwidth and reduces metadata overhead. Compared to state-of-the-art LLM checkpointing engines, our approach achieves up to $3.9\times$ higher write throughput than DataStates-LLM and $7.6\times$ higher than TorchSnapshot. These results highlight the need for aggregation and coalescing strategies that align with modern file systems and I/O backends.

Result: 理论证明RABO和RAFBO可实现渐近最优收敛速率$O(1/\sqrt{C_x^{\ast}Q})$，实验验证了方法的有效性和计算效率。

Conclusion: 论文提出了RABO和RAFBO两种资源自适应的分布式双层优化框架，通过二阶自由超梯度估计器实现了在低资源客户端上的高效优化，实验验证了其有效性和计算效率。

Abstract: With the development of large-scale models, traditional distributed bilevel optimization algorithms cannot be applied directly in low-resource clients. The key reason lies in the excessive computation involved in optimizing both the lower- and upper-level functions. Thus, we present the first resource-adaptive distributed bilevel optimization framework with a second-order free hypergradient estimator, which allows each client to optimize the submodels adapted to the available resources. Due to the coupled influence of partial outer parameters x and inner parameters y, it's challenging to theoretically analyze the upper bound regarding the globally averaged hypergradient for full model parameters. The error bound of inner parameter also needs to be reformulated since the local partial training. The provable theorems show that both RABO and RAFBO can achieve an asymptotically optimal convergence rate of $O(1/\sqrt{C_x^{\ast}Q})$, which is dominated by the minimum coverage of the outer parameter $C_x^{\ast}$. Extensive experiments on two different tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and computation efficiency of our proposed methods.

Abstract: Modern cloud-native systems increasingly rely on multi-cluster deployments to support scalability, resilience, and geographic distribution. However, existing resource management approaches remain largely reactive and cluster-centric, limiting their ability to optimize system-wide behavior under dynamic workloads. These limitations result in inefficient resource utilization, delayed adaptation, and increased operational overhead across distributed environments. This paper presents an AI-driven framework for adaptive resource optimization in multi-cluster cloud systems. The proposed approach integrates predictive learning, policy-aware decision-making, and continuous feedback to enable proactive and coordinated resource management across clusters. By analyzing cross-cluster telemetry and historical execution patterns, the framework dynamically adjusts resource allocation to balance performance, cost, and reliability objectives. A prototype implementation demonstrates improved resource efficiency, faster stabilization during workload fluctuations, and reduced performance variability compared to conventional reactive approaches. The results highlight the effectiveness of intelligent, self-adaptive infrastructure management as a key enabler for scalable and resilient cloud platforms.

Abstract: Modern ML training and inference now span tens to tens of thousands of GPUs, where network faults can waste 10--15\% of GPU hours due to slow recovery. Common network errors and link fluctuations trigger timeouts that often terminate entire jobs, forcing expensive checkpoint rollback during training and request reprocessing during inference. We present R$^2$CCL, a fault-tolerant communication library that provides lossless, low-overhead failover by exploiting multi-NIC hardware. R$^2$CCL performs rapid connection migration, bandwidth-aware load redistribution, and resilient collective algorithms to maintain progress under failures. We evaluate R$^2$CCL on two 8-GPU H100 InfiniBand servers and via large-scale ML simulators modeling hundreds of GPUs with diverse failure patterns. Experiments show that R$^2$CCL is highly robust to NIC failures, incurring less than 1\% training and less than 3\% inference overheads. R$^2$CCL outperforms baselines AdapCC and DejaVu by 12.18$\times$ and 47$\times$, respectively.

Abstract: Prehensile autonomous manipulation, such as peg insertion, tool use, or assembly, require precise in-hand understanding of the object pose and the extrinsic contacts made during interactions. Providing accurate estimation of pose and contacts is challenging. Tactile sensors can provide local geometry at the sensor and force information about the grasp, but the locality of sensing means resolving poses and contacts from tactile alone is often an ill-posed problem, as multiple configurations can be consistent with the observations. Adding visual feedback can help resolve ambiguities, but can suffer from noise and occlusions. In this work, we propose a method that pairs local observations from sensing with the physical constraints of contact. We propose a set of factors that ensure local consistency with tactile observations as well as enforcing physical plausibility, namely, that the estimated pose and contacts must respect the kinematic and force constraints of quasi-static rigid body interactions. We formalize our problem as a factor graph, allowing for efficient estimation. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing geometric and contact-informed estimation pipelines, especially when only tactile information is available.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable generalization by mapping web-scale knowledge to robotic control, yet they remain blind to physical contact. Consequently, they struggle with contact-rich manipulation tasks that require reasoning about force, texture, and slip. While some approaches incorporate low-dimensional tactile signals, they fail to capture the high-resolution dynamics essential for such interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce DreamTacVLA, a framework that grounds VLA models in contact physics by learning to feel the future. Our model adopts a hierarchical perception scheme in which high-resolution tactile images serve as micro-vision inputs coupled with wrist-camera local vision and third-person macro vision. To reconcile these multi-scale sensory streams, we first train a unified policy with a Hierarchical Spatial Alignment (HSA) loss that aligns tactile tokens with their spatial counterparts in the wrist and third-person views. To further deepen the model's understanding of fine-grained contact dynamics, we finetune the system with a tactile world model that predicts future tactile signals. To mitigate tactile data scarcity and the wear-prone nature of tactile sensors, we construct a hybrid large-scale dataset sourced from both high-fidelity digital twin and real-world experiments. By anticipating upcoming tactile states, DreamTacVLA acquires a rich model of contact physics and conditions its actions on both real observations and imagined consequences. Across contact-rich manipulation tasks, it outperforms state-of-the-art VLA baselines, achieving up to 95% success, highlighting the importance of understanding physical contact for robust, touch-aware robotic agents.

Abstract: This paper introduces SHIELD, a Spherical-Projection Hybrid-Frontier Integration for Efficient LiDAR-based Drone exploration method. Although laser LiDAR offers the advantage of a wide field of view, its application in UAV exploration still faces several challenges. The observation quality of LiDAR point clouds is generally inferior to that of depth cameras. Traditional frontier methods based on known and unknown regions impose a heavy computational burden, especially when handling the wide field of view of LiDAR. In addition, regions without point cloud are also difficult to classify as free space through raycasting. To address these problems, the SHIELD is proposed. It maintains an observation-quality occupancy map and performs ray-casting on this map to address the issue of inconsistent point-cloud quality during exploration. A hybrid frontier method is used to tackle both the computational burden and the limitations of point-cloud quality exploration. In addition, an outward spherical-projection ray-casting strategy is proposed to jointly ensure flight safety and exploration efficiency in open areas. Simulations and flight experiments prove the effectiveness of SHIELD. This work will be open-sourced to contribute to the research community.

Abstract: A single service robot can present two distinct agencies: its onboard autonomy and an operator-mediated agency, yet users experience them through one physical body. We formalize this dual-agency structure as a User-Robot-Operator triad in an autonomous remote-control setting that combines autonomous execution with remote human support. Prior to the recent surge of language-based and multimodal interfaces, we developed and evaluated an early-stage prototype in 2020 that combined natural-language text chat with freehand sketch annotations over the robot's live camera view to support remote intervention. We evaluated three modes - autonomous, remote, and hybrid - in controlled fetch-and-carry tasks using a domestic mobile manipulator (HSR) on a World Robot Summit 2020 rule-compliant test field. The results show systematic mode-dependent differences in user-rated affinity and additional insights on perceived security, indicating that switching or blending agency within one robot measurably shapes human impressions. These findings provide empirical guidance for designing human-in-the-loop mobile manipulation in domestic physical tasks.

Abstract: Significant challenges are posed by simulation and testing in the field of low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) traffic due to the high costs associated with large-scale UAV testing and the complexity of establishing low-altitude traffic test scenarios. Stringent safety requirements make high fidelity one of the key metrics for simulation platforms. Despite advancements in simulation platforms for low-altitude UAVs, there is still a shortage of platforms that feature rich traffic scenarios, high-precision UAV and scenario simulators, and comprehensive testing capabilities for low-altitude traffic. Therefore, this paper introduces an integrated high-fidelity simulation platform for low-altitude UAV traffic. This platform simulates all components of the UAV traffic network, including the control system, the traffic management system, the UAV system, the communication network , the anomaly and fault modules, etc. Furthermore, it integrates RflySim/AirSim and Unreal Engine 5 to develop full-state models of UAVs and 3D maps that model the real world using the oblique photogrammetry technique. Additionally, the platform offers a wide range of interfaces, and all models and scenarios can be customized with a high degree of flexibility. The platform's source code has been released, making it easier to conduct research related to low-altitude traffic.

Conclusion: ERIQ和FACT提供了一个原则性框架，用于诊断并克服推理与精确执行之间的权衡，推动了鲁棒、通用机器人操控的发展。

Abstract: General-purpose robotic systems operating in open-world environments must achieve both broad generalization and high-precision action execution, a combination that remains challenging for existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. While large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) improve semantic generalization, insufficient embodied reasoning leads to brittle behavior, and conversely, strong reasoning alone is inadequate without precise control. To provide a decoupled and quantitative assessment of this bottleneck, we introduce Embodied Reasoning Intelligence Quotient (ERIQ), a large-scale embodied reasoning benchmark in robotic manipulation, comprising 6K+ question-answer pairs across four reasoning dimensions. By decoupling reasoning from execution, ERIQ enables systematic evaluation and reveals a strong positive correlation between embodied reasoning capability and end-to-end VLA generalization. To bridge the gap from reasoning to precise execution, we propose FACT, a flow-matching-based action tokenizer that converts continuous control into discrete sequences while preserving high-fidelity trajectory reconstruction. The resulting GenieReasoner jointly optimizes reasoning and action in a unified space, outperforming both continuous-action and prior discrete-action baselines in real-world tasks. Together, ERIQ and FACT provide a principled framework for diagnosing and overcoming the reasoning-precision trade-off, advancing robust, general-purpose robotic manipulation.

Abstract: On the way towards full autonomy, sharing roads between automated vehicles and human actors in so-called mixed traffic is unavoidable. Moreover, even if all vehicles on the road were autonomous, pedestrians would still be crossing the streets. We propose social robots as moderators between autonomous vehicles and vulnerable road users (VRU). To this end, we identify four enablers requiring integration: (1) advanced perception, allowing the robot to see the environment; (2) vehicular communications allowing connected vehicles to share intentions and the robot to send guiding commands; (3) social human-robot interaction allowing the robot to effectively communicate with VRUs and drivers; (4) formal specification allowing the robot to understand traffic and plan accordingly. This paper presents an overview of the key enablers and report on a first proof-of-concept integration of the first three enablers envisioning a social robot advising pedestrians in scenarios with a cooperative automated e-bike.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have enabled language-conditioned, long-horizon robot manipulation, but most existing systems are limited to grippers. Scaling VLA policies to bimanual robots with high degree-of-freedom (DoF) dexterous hands remains challenging due to the expanded action space, frequent hand-object occlusions, and the cost of collecting real-robot data. We present GR-Dexter, a holistic hardware-model-data framework for VLA-based generalist manipulation on a bimanual dexterous-hand robot. Our approach combines the design of a compact 21-DoF robotic hand, an intuitive bimanual teleoperation system for real-robot data collection, and a training recipe that leverages teleoperated robot trajectories together with large-scale vision-language and carefully curated cross-embodiment datasets. Across real-world evaluations spanning long-horizon everyday manipulation and generalizable pick-and-place, GR-Dexter achieves strong in-domain performance and improved robustness to unseen objects and unseen instructions. We hope GR-Dexter serves as a practical step toward generalist dexterous-hand robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: RANGER框架在无需环境3D地图的情况下，实现了具有竞争力的导航成功率和探索效率，并展现出卓越的上下文学习适应能力。

Abstract: Efficiently finding targets in complex environments is fundamental to real-world embodied applications. While recent advances in multimodal foundation models have enabled zero-shot object goal navigation, allowing robots to search for arbitrary objects without fine-tuning, existing methods face two key limitations: (1) heavy reliance on precise depth and pose information provided by simulators, which restricts applicability in real-world scenarios; and (2) lack of in-context learning (ICL) capability, making it difficult to quickly adapt to new environments, as in leveraging short videos. To address these challenges, we propose RANGER, a novel zero-shot, open-vocabulary semantic navigation framework that operates using only a monocular camera. Leveraging powerful 3D foundation models, RANGER eliminates the dependency on depth and pose while exhibiting strong ICL capability. By simply observing a short video of a new environment, the system can also significantly improve task efficiency without requiring architectural modifications or fine-tuning. The framework integrates several key components: keyframe-based 3D reconstruction, semantic point cloud generation, vision-language model (VLM)-driven exploration value estimation, high-level adaptive waypoint selection, and low-level action execution. Experiments on the HM3D benchmark and real-world environments demonstrate that RANGER achieves competitive performance in terms of navigation success rate and exploration efficiency, while showing superior ICL adaptability, with no previous 3D mapping of the environment required.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) play an important role in various applications, where precise trajectory tracking is crucial. However, conventional control algorithms for trajectory tracking often exhibit limited performance due to the underactuated, nonlinear, and highly coupled dynamics of quadrotor systems. To address these challenges, we propose HBO-PID, a novel control algorithm that integrates the Heteroscedastic Bayesian Optimization (HBO) framework with the classical PID controller to achieve accurate and robust trajectory tracking. By explicitly modeling input-dependent noise variance, the proposed method can better adapt to dynamic and complex environments, and therefore improve the accuracy and robustness of trajectory tracking. To accelerate the convergence of optimization, we adopt a two-stage optimization strategy that allow us to more efficiently find the optimal controller parameters. Through experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Compared to SOTA methods, it improves the position accuracy by 24.7% to 42.9%, and the angular accuracy by 40.9% to 78.4%.

Abstract: Constrained motion planning is a common but challenging problem in robotic manipulation. In recent years, data-driven constrained motion planning algorithms have shown impressive planning speed and success rate. Among them, the latent motion method based on manifold approximation is the most efficient planning algorithm. Due to errors in manifold approximation and the difficulty in accurately identifying collision conflicts within the latent space, time-consuming path validity checks and path replanning are required. In this paper, we propose a method that trains a neural network to predict the minimum distance between the robot and obstacles using latent vectors as inputs. The learned distance gradient is then used to calculate the direction of movement in the latent space to move the robot away from obstacles. Based on this, a local path optimization algorithm in the latent space is proposed, and it is integrated with the path validity checking process to reduce the time of replanning. The proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms in multiple planning scenarios, demonstrating the fastest planning speed

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have demonstrated potential for autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) in crowded environments. Most existing approaches rely on single-frame observation and employ simple concatenation for multi-modal fusion, which limits their ability to capture temporal context and hinders dynamic adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose a DRL-based navigation framework, DRL-TH, which leverages temporal graph attention and hierarchical graph pooling to integrate historical observations and adaptively fuse multi-modal information. Specifically, we introduce a temporal-guided graph attention network (TG-GAT) that incorporates temporal weights into attention scores to capture correlations between consecutive frames, thereby enabling the implicit estimation of scene evolution. In addition, we design a graph hierarchical abstraction module (GHAM) that applies hierarchical pooling and learnable weighted fusion to dynamically integrate RGB and LiDAR features, achieving balanced representation across multiple scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DRL-TH outperforms existing methods in various crowded environments. We also implemented DRL-TH control policy on a real UGV and showed that it performed well in real world scenarios.

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising approach to training precise and dexterous robotic manipulation policies in an online manner, enabling robots to learn from their own experience while gradually reducing human labor. However, prior real-world RL methods often assume that human interventions are optimal across the entire state space, overlooking the fact that even expert operators cannot consistently provide optimal actions in all states or completely avoid mistakes. Indiscriminately mixing intervention data with robot-collected data inherits the sample inefficiency of RL, while purely imitating intervention data can ultimately degrade the final performance achievable by RL. The question of how to leverage potentially suboptimal and noisy human interventions to accelerate learning without being constrained by them thus remains open. To address this challenge, we propose SiLRI, a state-wise Lagrangian reinforcement learning algorithm for real-world robot manipulation tasks. Specifically, we formulate the online manipulation problem as a constrained RL optimization, where the constraint bound at each state is determined by the uncertainty of human interventions. We then introduce a state-wise Lagrange multiplier and solve the problem via a min-max optimization, jointly optimizing the policy and the Lagrange multiplier to reach a saddle point. Built upon a human-as-copilot teleoperation system, our algorithm is evaluated through real-world experiments on diverse manipulation tasks. Experimental results show that SiLRI effectively exploits human suboptimal interventions, reducing the time required to reach a 90% success rate by at least 50% compared with the state-of-the-art RL method HIL-SERL, and achieving a 100% success rate on long-horizon manipulation tasks where other RL methods struggle to succeed.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training is fundamental for generalization in language and vision models, but data for dexterous hand manipulation remains limited in scale and diversity, hindering policy generalization.

WiYH includes (1) the Oracle Suite, a wearable data collection kit with an auto-labeling pipeline for accurate motion capture; (2) the WiYH Dataset, featuring over 1,000 hours of multi-modal manipulation data across hundreds of skills in diverse real-world scenarios; and (3) extensive annotations and benchmarks supporting tasks from perception to action. Furthermore, experiments based on the WiYH ecosystem show that integrating WiYH's human-centric data significantly enhances the generalization and robustness of dexterous hand policies in tabletop manipulation tasks. We believe that World In Your Hands will bring new insights into human-centric data collection and policy learning to the community.

Conclusion: 论文展示了非线性模型预测控制（MPC）在固定翼小型无人飞行器系统3D路径跟踪中的实际可行性和优越性能，特别是在高速（36米/秒）条件下。

Abstract: This paper presents the design, implementation, and flight test results of two novel 3D path-following guidance algorithms based on nonlinear model predictive control (MPC), with specific application to fixed-wing small uncrewed aircraft systems. To enable MPC, control-augmented modelling and system identification of the RAAVEN small uncrewed aircraft is presented. Two formulations of MPC are then showcased. The first schedules a static reference path rate over the MPC horizon, incentivizing a constant inertial speed. The second, with inspiration from model predictive contouring control, dynamically optimizes for the reference path rate over the controller horizon as the system operates. This allows for a weighted tradeoff between path progression and distance from path, two competing objectives in path-following guidance. Both controllers are formulated to operate over general smooth 3D arc-length parameterized curves. The MPC guidance algorithms are flown over several high-curvature test paths, with comparison to a baseline lookahead guidance law. The results showcase the real-world feasibility and superior performance of nonlinear MPC for 3D path-following guidance at ground speeds up to 36 meters per second.

Abstract: Multi-session map merging is crucial for extended autonomous operations in large-scale environments. In this paper, we present GMLD, a learning-based local descriptor framework for large-scale multi-session point cloud map merging that systematically aligns maps collected across different sessions with overlapping regions. The proposed framework employs a keypoint-aware encoder and a plane-based geometric transformer to extract discriminative features for loop closure detection and relative pose estimation. To further improve global consistency, we include inter-session scan matching cost factors in the factor-graph optimization stage. We evaluate our framework on the public datasets, as well as self-collected data from diverse environments. The results show accurate and robust map merging with low error, and the learned features deliver strong performance in both loop closure detection and relative pose estimation.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe the automated simulation and reporting pipeline implemented for our autonomous racing stack, ur.autopilot. The backbone of the simulation is based on a high-fidelity model of the vehicle interfaced as a Functional Mockup Unit (FMU). The pipeline can execute the software stack and the simulation up to three times faster than real-time, locally or on GitHub for Continuous Integration/- Continuous Delivery (CI/CD). As the most important input of the pipeline, there is a set of running scenarios. Each scenario allows the initialization of the ego vehicle in different initial conditions (position and speed), as well as the initialization of any other configuration of the stack. This functionality is essential to validate efficiently critical modules, like the one responsible for high-speed overtaking maneuvers or localization, which are among the most challenging aspects of autonomous racing. Moreover, we describe how we implemented a fault injection module, capable of introducing sensor delays and perturbations as well as modifying outputs of any node of the stack. Finally, we describe the design of our automated reporting process, aimed at maximizing the effectiveness of the simulation analysis.

Motivation: 现有增强推理的VLA模型主要描述感知和意图，很少质疑计划行动的安全性或适当性。

Method: CF-VLA首先生成时间分段的元动作总结驾驶意图，然后基于元动作和视觉上下文进行反事实推理，模拟潜在结果，识别不安全行为，并输出修正后的元动作指导最终轨迹生成。采用rollout-filter-label流程高效获取自我反思能力。

Conclusion: CF-VLA通过将推理轨迹从一次性描述转化为因果自我修正信号，朝着自我反思的自动驾驶代理迈出了一步，这些代理学会在行动前思考。

Abstract: Recent reasoning-augmented Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have improved the interpretability of end-to-end autonomous driving by generating intermediate reasoning traces. Yet these models primarily describe what they perceive and intend to do, rarely questioning whether their planned actions are safe or appropriate. This work introduces Counterfactual VLA (CF-VLA), a self-reflective VLA framework that enables the model to reason about and revise its planned actions before execution. CF-VLA first generates time-segmented meta-actions that summarize driving intent, and then performs counterfactual reasoning conditioned on both the meta-actions and the visual context. This step simulates potential outcomes, identifies unsafe behaviors, and outputs corrected meta-actions that guide the final trajectory generation. To efficiently obtain such self-reflective capabilities, we propose a rollout-filter-label pipeline that mines high-value scenes from a base (non-counterfactual) VLA's rollouts and labels counterfactual reasoning traces for subsequent training rounds. Experiments on large-scale driving datasets show that CF-VLA improves trajectory accuracy by up to 17.6%, enhances safety metrics by 20.5%, and exhibits adaptive thinking: it only enables counterfactual reasoning in challenging scenarios. By transforming reasoning traces from one-shot descriptions to causal self-correction signals, CF-VLA takes a step toward self-reflective autonomous driving agents that learn to think before they act.

Abstract: 3D meshes are a fundamental representation widely used in computer science and engineering. In robotics, they are particularly valuable because they capture objects in a form that aligns directly with how robots interact with the physical world, enabling core capabilities such as predicting stable grasps, detecting collisions, and simulating dynamics. Although automatic 3D mesh generation methods have shown promising progress in recent years, potentially offering a path toward real-time robot perception, two critical challenges remain. First, generating high-fidelity meshes is prohibitively slow for real-time use, often requiring tens of seconds per object. Second, mesh generation by itself is insufficient. In robotics, a mesh must be contextually grounded, i.e., correctly segmented from the scene and registered with the proper scale and pose. Additionally, unless these contextual grounding steps remain efficient, they simply introduce new bottlenecks. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end system that addresses these challenges, producing a high-quality, contextually grounded 3D mesh from a single RGB-D image in under one second. Our pipeline integrates open-vocabulary object segmentation, accelerated diffusion-based mesh generation, and robust point cloud registration, each optimized for both speed and accuracy. We demonstrate its effectiveness in a real-world manipulation task, showing that it enables meshes to be used as a practical, on-demand representation for robotics perception and planning.

Method: 引入Semantic Lookout，一种仅使用摄像头的候选约束视觉语言模型（VLM）后备动作选择器，从水效、世界锚定轨迹中选择谨慎动作（或保持原位），并在持续人类授权下操作。

Result: 在40个港口场景中测试表明，Sub-10秒模型保留了较慢最先进模型的大部分感知能力，后备动作选择器优于仅几何基线，并在火灾场景中增加了安全距离。实地运行验证了端到端操作。

Conclusion: 研究支持视觉语言模型（VLM）作为符合IMO MASS Code草案的语义后备动作选择器，并在实际延迟预算内有效，同时为未来领域适应的混合自主性研究提供了动力。

Abstract: The draft IMO MASS Code requires autonomous and remotely supervised maritime vessels to detect departures from their operational design domain, enter a predefined fallback that notifies the operator, permit immediate human override, and avoid changing the voyage plan without approval. Meeting these obligations in the alert-to-takeover gap calls for a short-horizon, human-overridable fallback maneuver. Classical maritime autonomy stacks struggle when the correct action depends on meaning (e.g., diver-down flag means people in the water, fire close by means hazard). We argue (i) that vision-language models (VLMs) provide semantic awareness for such out-of-distribution situations, and (ii) that a fast-slow anomaly pipeline with a short-horizon, human-overridable fallback maneuver makes this practical in the handover window. We introduce Semantic Lookout, a camera-only, candidate-constrained vision-language model (VLM) fallback maneuver selector that selects one cautious action (or station-keeping) from water-valid, world-anchored trajectories under continuous human authority. On 40 harbor scenes we measure per-call scene understanding and latency, alignment with human consensus (model majority-of-three voting), short-horizon risk-relief on fire hazard scenes, and an on-water alert->fallback maneuver->operator handover. Sub-10 s models retain most of the awareness of slower state-of-the-art models. The fallback maneuver selector outperforms geometry-only baselines and increases standoff distance on fire scenes. A field run verifies end-to-end operation. These results support VLMs as semantic fallback maneuver selectors compatible with the draft IMO MASS Code, within practical latency budgets, and motivate future work on domain-adapted, hybrid autonomy that pairs foundation-model semantics with multi-sensor bird's-eye-view perception and short-horizon replanning.

Result: 在仿真和真实机器人实验中，DISF算法相比基线方法在抓取成功率上有显著提升。

Conclusion: DISF算法在保持几何兼容性的同时减少了质心偏差，从而在仿真和实际实验中均表现出更高的抓取成功率。

Abstract: In this work, we address the limitation of surface fitting-based grasp planning algorithm, which primarily focuses on geometric alignment between the gripper and object surface while overlooking the stability of contact point distribution, often resulting in unstable grasps due to inadequate contact configurations. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel surface fitting algorithm that integrates contact stability while preserving geometric compatibility. Inspired by human grasping behavior, our method disentangles the grasp pose optimization into three sequential steps: (1) rotation optimization to align contact normals, (2) translation refinement to improve the alignment between the gripper frame origin and the object Center of Mass (CoM), and (3) gripper aperture adjustment to optimize contact point distribution. We validate our approach in simulation across 15 objects under both Known-shape (with clean CAD-derived dataset) and Observed-shape (with YCB object dataset) settings, including cross-platform grasp execution on three robot--gripper platforms. We further validate the method in real-world grasp experiments on a UR3e robot. Overall, DISF reduces CoM misalignment while maintaining geometric compatibility, translating into higher grasp success in both simulation and real-world execution compared to baselines.

Motivation: 解决机器人操作中状态模糊的问题，避免历史窗口扩展带来的计算成本高和过拟合问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练方式，结合分层帧特征提取器和上下文路由器，生成紧凑的上下文特征，并通过重构历史信息的辅助目标确保有效瓶颈。

Result: PAM在7个任务中验证了其能同时处理多种状态模糊场景，保持20Hz以上的推理速度。

Conclusion: PAM是一种新型的视觉运动策略，配备自适应工作记忆，能够在保持高推理速度的同时支持300帧的历史窗口，适用于多种状态模糊场景。

Abstract: State ambiguity is common in robotic manipulation. Identical observations may correspond to multiple valid behavior trajectories. The visuomotor policy must correctly extract the appropriate types and levels of information from the history to identify the current task phase. However, naively extending the history window is computationally expensive and may cause severe overfitting. Inspired by the continuous nature of human reasoning and the recoding of working memory, we introduce PAM, a novel visuomotor Policy equipped with Adaptive working Memory. With minimal additional training cost in a two-stage manner, PAM supports a 300-frame history window while maintaining high inference speed. Specifically, a hierarchical frame feature extractor yields two distinct representations for motion primitives and temporal disambiguation. For compact representation, a context router with range-specific queries is employed to produce compact context features across multiple history lengths. And an auxiliary objective of reconstructing historical information is introduced to ensure that the context router acts as an effective bottleneck. We meticulously design 7 tasks and verify that PAM can handle multiple scenarios of state ambiguity simultaneously. With a history window of approximately 10 seconds, PAM still supports stable training and maintains inference speeds above 20Hz. Project website: https://tinda24.github.io/pam/

Conclusion: HMP-DRL框架通过整合长期路径规划和语义感知的局部控制，显著提升了在复杂人机环境中的自主导航安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots operating in complex, dynamic environments face the dual challenge of navigating large-scale, structurally diverse spaces with static obstacles while safely interacting with various moving agents. Traditional graph-based planners excel at long-range pathfinding but lack reactivity, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods demonstrate strong collision avoidance but often fail to reach distant goals due to a lack of global context. We propose Hybrid Motion Planning with Deep Reinforcement Learning (HMP-DRL), a hybrid framework that bridges this gap. Our approach utilizes a graph-based global planner to generate a path, which is integrated into a local DRL policy via a sequence of checkpoints encoded in both the state space and reward function. To ensure social compliance, the local planner employs an entity-aware reward structure that dynamically adjusts safety margins and penalties based on the semantic type of surrounding agents. We validate the proposed method through extensive testing in a realistic simulation environment derived from real-world map data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that HMP-DRL consistently outperforms other methods, including state-of-the-art approaches, in terms of key metrics of robot navigation: success rate, collision rate, and time to reach the goal. Overall, these findings confirm that integrating long-term path guidance with semantically-aware local control significantly enhances both the safety and reliability of autonomous navigation in complex human-centric settings.

Abstract: While data-driven imitation learning has revolutionized robotic manipulation, current approaches remain constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse real-world demonstrations. Consequently, the ability of existing models to generalize across long-horizon bimanual tasks and mobile manipulation in unstructured environments remains limited. To bridge this gap, we present RoboMIND 2.0, a comprehensive real-world dataset comprising over 310K dual-arm manipulation trajectories collected across six distinct robot embodiments and 739 complex tasks. Crucially, to support research in contact-rich and spatially extended tasks, the dataset incorporates 12K tactile-enhanced episodes and 20K mobile manipulation trajectories. Complementing this physical data, we construct high-fidelity digital twins of our real-world environments, releasing an additional 20K-trajectory simulated dataset to facilitate robust sim-to-real transfer. To fully exploit the potential of RoboMIND 2.0, we propose MIND-2 system, a hierarchical dual-system frame-work optimized via offline reinforcement learning. MIND-2 integrates a high-level semantic planner (MIND-2-VLM) to decompose abstract natural language instructions into grounded subgoals, coupled with a low-level Vision-Language-Action executor (MIND-2-VLA), which generates precise, proprioception-aware motor actions.

Abstract: Humanoid robots toward human-level dexterity require robotic hands capable of simultaneously providing high grasping force, rapid actuation speeds, multiple degrees of freedom, and lightweight structures within human-like size constraints. Meeting these conflicting requirements remains challenging, as satisfying this combination typically necessitates heavier actuators and bulkier transmission systems, significantly restricting the payload capacity of robot arms. In this letter, we present a lightweight anthropomorphic hand actuated by Bowden cables, which uniquely combines rolling-contact joint optimization with antagonistic cable actuation, enabling single-motor-per-joint control with negligible cable-length deviation. By relocating the actuator module to the torso, the design substantially reduces distal mass while maintaining anthropomorphic scale and dexterity. Additionally, this antagonistic cable actuation eliminates the need for synchronization between motors. Using the proposed methods, the hand assembly with a distal mass of 236g (excluding remote actuators and Bowden sheaths) demonstrated reliable execution of dexterous tasks, exceeding 18N fingertip force and lifting payloads over one hundred times its own mass. Furthermore, robustness was validated through Cutkosky taxonomy grasps and trajectory consistency under perturbed actuator-hand transformations.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in robotics, with the action chunk playing a dominant role in these advances. Given the real-time and continuous nature of robotic motion control, the strategies for fusing a queue of successive action chunks have a profound impact on the overall performance of VLA models. Existing methods suffer from jitter, stalling, or even pauses in robotic action execution, which not only limits the achievable execution speed but also reduces the overall success rate of task completion. This paper introduces VLA-RAIL (A Real-Time Asynchronous Inference Linker), a novel framework designed to address these issues by conducting model inference and robot motion control asynchronously and guaranteeing smooth, continuous, and high-speed action execution. The core contributions of the paper are two fold: a Trajectory Smoother that effectively filters out the noise and jitter in the trajectory of one action chunk using polynomial fitting and a Chunk Fuser that seamlessly align the current executing trajectory and the newly arrived chunk, ensuring position, velocity, and acceleration continuity between two successive action chunks. We validate the effectiveness of VLA-RAIL on a benchmark of dynamic simulation tasks and several real-world manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that VLA-RAIL significantly reduces motion jitter, enhances execution speed, and improves task success rates, which will become a key infrastructure for the large-scale deployment of VLA models.

Abstract: Target search and tracking (SAT) is a fundamental problem for various robotic applications such as search and rescue and environmental exploration. This paper proposes an informative trajectory planning approach, namely ReSPIRe, for SAT in unknown cluttered environments under considerably inaccurate prior target information and limited sensing field of view. We first develop a novel sigma point-based approximation approach to fast and accurately estimate mutual information reward under non-Gaussian belief distributions, utilizing informative sampling in state and observation spaces to mitigate the computational intractability of integral calculation. To tackle significant uncertainty associated with inadequate prior target information, we propose the hierarchical particle structure in ReSPIRe, which not only extracts critical particles for global route guidance, but also adjusts the particle number adaptively for planning efficiency. Building upon the hierarchical structure, we develop the reusable belief tree search approach to build a policy tree for online trajectory planning under uncertainty, which reuses rollout evaluation to improve planning efficiency. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that ReSPIRe outperforms representative benchmark methods with smaller MI approximation error, higher search efficiency, and more stable tracking performance, while maintaining outstanding computational efficiency.

Conclusion: CREPES-X 是一个高效、准确且鲁棒的相对定位框架，适用于多机器人系统，能够在复杂环境中表现出色，无需全局信息。

Abstract: Relative localization is critical for cooperation in autonomous multi-robot systems. Existing approaches either rely on shared environmental features or inertial assumptions or suffer from non-line-of-sight degradation and outliers in complex environments. Robust and efficient fusion of inter-robot measurements such as bearings, distances, and inertials for tens of robots remains challenging. We present CREPES-X (Cooperative RElative Pose Estimation System with multiple eXtended features), a hierarchical relative localization framework that enhances speed, accuracy, and robustness under challenging conditions, without requiring any global information. CREPES-X starts with a compact hardware design: InfraRed (IR) LEDs, an IR camera, an ultra-wideband module, and an IMU housed in a cube no larger than 6cm on each side. Then CREPES-X implements a two-stage hierarchical estimator to meet different requirements, considering speed, accuracy, and robustness. First, we propose a single-frame relative estimator that provides instant relative poses for multi-robot setups through a closed-form solution and robust bearing outlier rejection. Then a multi-frame relative estimator is designed to offer accurate and robust relative states by exploring IMU pre-integration via robocentric relative kinematics with loosely- and tightly-coupled optimization. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of CREPES-X, showing robustness to up to 90% bearing outliers, proving resilience in challenging conditions, and achieving RMSE of 0.073m and 1.817° in real-world datasets.

While reinforcement learning has achieved notable success in various legged locomotion tasks, producing highly dynamic behaviors often requires extensive reward tuning or high-quality demonstrations. Leveraging reduced-order models can help mitigate these challenges. However, the model discrepancy poses a significant challenge when transferring policies to full-body dynamics environments. In this work, we introduce a continuation-based learning framework that combines simplified model pretraining and model homotopy transfer to efficiently generate and refine complex dynamic behaviors. First, we pretrain the policy using a single rigid body model to capture core motion patterns in a simplified environment. Next, we employ a continuation strategy to progressively transfer the policy to the full-body environment, minimizing performance loss. To define the continuation path, we introduce a model homotopy from the single rigid body model to the full-body model by gradually redistributing mass and inertia between the trunk and legs. The proposed method not only achieves faster convergence but also demonstrates superior stability during the transfer process compared to baseline methods. Our framework is validated on a range of dynamic tasks, including flips and wall-assisted maneuvers, and is successfully deployed on a real quadrupedal robot.

TL;DR: LSRE框架通过潜在语义规则编码，实现了实时语义风险评估，性能接近大型VLM但计算成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界自动驾驶需遵循复杂的人类社会规则，这些语义约束难以显式编码，而大型视觉语言模型（VLM）虽能解释此类语义，但其推理成本不适用于实时部署。

Method: 提出了LSRE（潜在语义规则编码）框架，将稀疏采样的VLM判断转换为循环世界模型潜在空间中的决策边界。

Result: 在CARLA中的六种语义失败场景实验中，LSRE的语义风险检测准确性与大型VLM基线相当，同时提供更早的危险预测并保持低计算延迟。

Conclusion: LSRE框架通过将语言定义的安全语义编码到轻量级潜在分类器中，实现了实时语义风险评估，且在罕见语义相似测试案例中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Real-world autonomous driving must adhere to complex human social rules that extend beyond legally codified traffic regulations. Many of these semantic constraints, such as yielding to emergency vehicles, complying with traffic officers' gestures, or stopping for school buses, are intuitive for humans yet difficult to encode explicitly. Although large vision-language models (VLMs) can interpret such semantics, their inference cost makes them impractical for real-time deployment.This work proposes LSRE, a Latent Semantic Rule Encoding framework that converts sparsely sampled VLM judgments into decision boundaries within the latent space of a recurrent world model. By encoding language-defined safety semantics into a lightweight latent classifier, LSRE enables real-time semantic risk assessment at 10 Hz without per-frame VLM queries. Experiments on six semantic-failure scenarios in CARLA demonstrate that LSRE attains semantic risk detection accuracy comparable to a large VLM baseline, while providing substantially earlier hazard anticipation and maintaining low computational latency. LSRE further generalizes to rarely seen semantic-similar test cases, indicating that language-guided latent classification offers an effective and deployable mechanism for semantic safety monitoring in autonomous driving.

Abstract: An important function of autonomous microrobots is the ability to perform robust movement over terrain. This paper explores an edge ML approach to microrobot locomotion, allowing for on-device, lower latency control under compute, memory, and power constraints. This paper explores the locomotion of a sub-centimeter quadrupedal microrobot via reinforcement learning (RL) and deploys the resulting controller on an ultra-small system-on-chip (SoC), SC$μ$M-3C, featuring an ARM Cortex-M0 microcontroller running at 5 MHz. We train a compact FP32 multilayer perceptron (MLP) policy with two hidden layers ($[128, 64]$) in a massively parallel GPU simulation and enhance robustness by utilizing domain randomization over simulation parameters. We then study integer (Int8) quantization (per-tensor and per-feature) to allow for higher inference update rates on our resource-limited hardware, and we connect hardware power budgets to achievable update frequency via a cycles-per-update model for inference on our Cortex-M0. We propose a resource-aware gait scheduling viewpoint: given a device power budget, we can select the gait mode (trot/intermediate/gallop) that maximizes expected RL reward at a corresponding feasible update frequency. Finally, we deploy our MLP policy on a real-world large-scale robot on uneven terrain, qualitatively noting that domain-randomized training can improve out-of-distribution stability. We do not claim real-world large-robot empirical zero-shot transfer in this work.

Method: 该方法从生成的视频中重建3D物体运动，并将操作任务转化为物体轨迹跟踪问题，通过轨迹优化或强化学习将3D物体流转化为可执行的低级命令。

Conclusion: Dream2Flow通过3D物体流作为中间表示，成功将视频生成模型与机器人控制连接起来，克服了体现差距，实现了对多样化物体的零样本操作指导。

Abstract: Generative video modeling has emerged as a compelling tool to zero-shot reason about plausible physical interactions for open-world manipulation. Yet, it remains a challenge to translate such human-led motions into the low-level actions demanded by robotic systems. We observe that given an initial image and task instruction, these models excel at synthesizing sensible object motions. Thus, we introduce Dream2Flow, a framework that bridges video generation and robotic control through 3D object flow as an intermediate representation. Our method reconstructs 3D object motions from generated videos and formulates manipulation as object trajectory tracking. By separating the state changes from the actuators that realize those changes, Dream2Flow overcomes the embodiment gap and enables zero-shot guidance from pre-trained video models to manipulate objects of diverse categories-including rigid, articulated, deformable, and granular. Through trajectory optimization or reinforcement learning, Dream2Flow converts reconstructed 3D object flow into executable low-level commands without task-specific demonstrations. Simulation and real-world experiments highlight 3D object flow as a general and scalable interface for adapting video generation models to open-world robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: ArtiSG框架通过将人类演示编码为结构化机器人记忆，显著提高了功能元素召回率和关节估计精度，并作为可靠的功能记忆指导机器人在真实环境中执行语言导向的操纵任务。

Abstract: 3D scene graphs have empowered robots with semantic understanding for navigation and planning, yet they often lack the functional information required for physical manipulation, particularly regarding articulated objects. Existing approaches for inferring articulation mechanisms from static observations are prone to visual ambiguity, while methods that estimate parameters from state changes typically rely on constrained settings such as fixed cameras and unobstructed views. Furthermore, fine-grained functional elements like small handles are frequently missed by general object detectors. To bridge this gap, we present ArtiSG, a framework that constructs functional 3D scene graphs by encoding human demonstrations into structured robotic memory. Our approach leverages a robust articulation data collection pipeline utilizing a portable setup to accurately estimate 6-DoF articulation trajectories and axes even under camera ego-motion. We integrate these kinematic priors into a hierarchical and open-vocabulary graph while utilizing interaction data to discover inconspicuous functional elements missed by visual perception. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that ArtiSG significantly outperforms baselines in functional element recall and articulation estimation precision. Moreover, we show that the constructed graph serves as a reliable functional memory that effectively guides robots to perform language-directed manipulation tasks in real-world environments containing diverse articulated objects.

TL;DR: A novel framework for DLO manipulation combines hierarchical planning and neural tracking, addressing challenges in constrained environments with validated effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DLO manipulation is challenging due to high-dimensional state space, complex deformation dynamics, and obstacles in realistic workspaces, necessitating efficient planning and robust tracking.

Method: The framework uses hierarchical deformation planning to generate a spatial path set satisfying homotopic constraints, followed by path-set-guided optimization for temporal deformation synthesis, and employs a neural model predictive control approach for accurate tracking.

Result: The framework demonstrates reliable performance in global deformation synthesis and local deformation tracking, validated in constrained DLO manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the challenges of DLO manipulation in constrained environments by combining hierarchical deformation planning with neural tracking, validated through extensive tasks.

Abstract: Deformable linear objects (DLOs) manipulation presents significant challenges due to DLOs' inherent high-dimensional state space and complex deformation dynamics. The wide-populated obstacles in realistic workspaces further complicate DLO manipulation, necessitating efficient deformation planning and robust deformation tracking. In this work, we propose a novel framework for DLO manipulation in constrained environments. This framework combines hierarchical deformation planning with neural tracking, ensuring reliable performance in both global deformation synthesis and local deformation tracking. Specifically, the deformation planner begins by generating a spatial path set that inherently satisfies the homotopic constraints associated with DLO keypoint paths. Next, a path-set-guided optimization method is applied to synthesize an optimal temporal deformation sequence for the DLO. In manipulation execution, a neural model predictive control approach, leveraging a data-driven deformation model, is designed to accurately track the planned DLO deformation sequence. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated in extensive constrained DLO manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Humanoid robots hold great promise for operating in human-centric environments, yet achieving robust whole-body coordination across the head, hands, and legs remains a major challenge. We present a system that combines a modular teleoperation interface with a scalable learning framework to address this problem. Our teleoperation design decomposes humanoid control into intuitive submodules, which include hand-eye coordination, grasp primitives, arm end-effector tracking, and locomotion. This modularity allows us to collect high-quality demonstrations efficiently. Building on this, we introduce Choice Policy, an imitation learning approach that generates multiple candidate actions and learns to score them. This architecture enables both fast inference and effective modeling of multimodal behaviors. We validate our approach on two real-world tasks: dishwasher loading and whole-body loco-manipulation for whiteboard wiping. Experiments show that Choice Policy significantly outperforms diffusion policies and standard behavior cloning. Furthermore, our results indicate that hand-eye coordination is critical for success in long-horizon tasks. Our work demonstrates a practical path toward scalable data collection and learning for coordinated humanoid manipulation in unstructured environments.

Motivation: 由于开源资源的稀缺，语言模型难以生成有效的TCAD代码，限制了设备设计和优化的效率。

Method: 构建了一个开源TCAD数据集，并微调了领域特定模型，提出了基于自然语言的多代理框架AgenticTCAD。

Result: AgenticTCAD在2纳米纳米片FET设计中仅需4.2小时即可达到IRDS-2024设备规格，而人类专家使用商业工具需7.1天。

Conclusion: AgenticTCAD显著提升了TCAD代码生成和设备设计的效率，验证了其在先进技术节点设计中的潜力。

Abstract: With the continued scaling of advanced technology nodes, the design-technology co-optimization (DTCO) paradigm has become increasingly critical, rendering efficient device design and optimization essential. In the domain of TCAD simulation, however, the scarcity of open-source resources hinders language models from generating valid TCAD code. To overcome this limitation, we construct an open-source TCAD dataset curated by experts and fine-tune a domain-specific model for TCAD code generation. Building on this foundation, we propose AgenticTCAD, a natural language - driven multi-agent framework that enables end-to-end automated device design and optimization. Validation on a 2 nm nanosheet FET (NS-FET) design shows that AgenticTCAD achieves the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems (IRDS)-2024 device specifications within 4.2 hours, whereas human experts required 7.1 days with commercial tools.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于云的LLMs在临床编码中的隐私风险和延迟问题，使其适用于本地医疗部署。

Method: Hybrid-Code是一个混合神经符号多代理框架，包含编码器（Coder）和审核器（Auditor）。编码器尝试基于BioMistral-7B的语言模型语义推理，失败时回退到确定性关键词匹配；审核器验证代码并基于临床证据进行质量控制。

Result: 在1,000份MIMIC-III出院摘要上评估，系统未产生知识库外的幻觉代码，验证率为24.47%，覆盖率为34.11%（95% CI: 31.2%--37.0%），语言模型利用率超过86%。审核器过滤了无效格式代码，拒绝率为75.53%，且确保患者数据不离开医院防火墙。

Conclusion: Hybrid-Code框架通过冗余和验证机制确保了临床编码的可靠性和隐私保护，证明了在生产医疗系统中，可靠性比纯模型性能更为重要。

Abstract: Clinical coding automation using cloud-based Large Language Models (LLMs) poses privacy risks and latency bottlenecks, rendering them unsuitable for on-premise healthcare deployment. We introduce Hybrid-Code, a hybrid neuro-symbolic multi-agent framework for local clinical coding that ensures production reliability through redundancy and verification. Our system comprises two agents: a Coder that attempts language model-based semantic reasoning using BioMistral-7B but falls back to deterministic keyword matching when model output is unreliable, ensuring pipeline completion; and an Auditor that verifies codes against a 257-code knowledge base and clinical evidence. Evaluating on 1,000 MIMIC-III discharge summaries, we demonstrate no hallucinated codes among accepted outputs within the knowledge base, 24.47% verification rate, and 34.11% coverage (95% CI: 31.2%--37.0%) with 86%+ language model utilization. The Auditor filtered invalid format codes and provided evidence-based quality control (75.53% rejection rate) while ensuring no patient data leaves the hospital firewall. The hybrid architecture -- combining language model semantic understanding (when successful), deterministic fallback (when the model fails), and symbolic verification (always active) -- ensures both reliability and privacy preservation, addressing critical barriers to AI adoption in healthcare. Our key finding is that reliability through redundancy is more valuable than pure model performance in production healthcare systems, where system failures are unacceptable.

Motivation: 现代IC复杂性导致测试模式增长，大多数模式针对一小部分难以检测（HTD）的故障，这促使开发新的ATPG算法以提高对HTD故障的测试效果。

Method: DEFT将离散的ATPG问题重新表述为连续优化任务，引入数学基础的重参数化，使连续目标与离散故障检测语义对齐，支持可靠的基于梯度的模式生成。

Result: 在相同模式预算和可比运行时间下，DEFT在两个工业基准测试中平均提高了HTD故障检测率21.1%和48.9%。

Conclusion: DEFT是一种有前景且有效的ATPG引擎，为现有启发式方法提供了有价值的补充。

Abstract: Modern IC complexity drives test pattern growth, with the majority of patterns targeting a small set of hard-to-detect (HTD) faults. This motivates new ATPG algorithms to improve test effectiveness specifically for HTD faults. This paper presents DEFT (Differentiable Automatic Test Pattern Generation), a new ATPG approach that reformulates the discrete ATPG problem as a continuous optimization task. DEFT introduces a mathematically grounded reparameterization that aligns the expected continuous objective with discrete fault-detection semantics, enabling reliable gradient-based pattern generation. To ensure scalability and stability on deep circuit graphs, DEFT integrates a custom CUDA kernel for efficient forward-backward propagation and applies gradient normalization to mitigate vanishing gradients. Compared to a leading commercial tool on two industrial benchmarks, DEFT improves HTD fault detection by 21.1% and 48.9% on average under the same pattern budget and comparable runtime. DEFT also supports practical ATPG settings such as partial assignment pattern generation, producing patterns with 19.3% fewer 0/1 bits while still detecting 35% more faults. These results indicate DEFT is a promising and effective ATPG engine, offering a valuable complement to existing heuristic.

Abstract: We present Mify-Coder, a 2.5B-parameter code model trained on 4.2T tokens using a compute-optimal strategy built on the Mify-2.5B foundation model. Mify-Coder achieves comparable accuracy and safety while significantly outperforming much larger baseline models on standard coding and function-calling benchmarks, demonstrating that compact models can match frontier-grade models in code generation and agent-driven workflows. Our training pipeline combines high-quality curated sources with synthetic data generated through agentically designed prompts, refined iteratively using enterprise-grade evaluation datasets. LLM-based quality filtering further enhances data density, enabling frugal yet effective training. Through disciplined exploration of CPT-SFT objectives, data mixtures, and sampling dynamics, we deliver frontier-grade code intelligence within a single continuous training trajectory. Empirical evidence shows that principled data and compute discipline allow smaller models to achieve competitive accuracy, efficiency, and safety compliance. Quantized variants of Mify-Coder enable deployment on standard desktop environments without requiring specialized hardware.

Conclusion: HyFair 是一种结合形式符号分析和随机搜索的混合技术，能够提供形式化保证并检测计算上具有挑战性的歧视性聚类，从而在公平性验证和本地解释方法上优于现有技术。

Abstract: Fairness in algorithmic decision-making is often framed in terms of individual fairness, which requires that similar individuals receive similar outcomes. A system violates individual fairness if there exists a pair of inputs differing only in protected attributes (such as race or gender) that lead to significantly different outcomes-for example, one favorable and the other unfavorable. While this notion highlights isolated instances of unfairness, it fails to capture broader patterns of systematic or clustered discrimination that may affect entire subgroups. We introduce and motivate the concept of discrimination clustering, a generalization of individual fairness violations. Rather than detecting single counterfactual disparities, we seek to uncover regions of the input space where small perturbations in protected features lead to k-significantly distinct clusters of outcomes. That is, for a given input, we identify a local neighborhood-differing only in protected attributes-whose members' outputs separate into many distinct clusters. These clusters reveal significant arbitrariness in treatment solely based on protected attributes that help expose patterns of algorithmic bias that elude pairwise fairness checks. We present HyFair, a hybrid technique that combines formal symbolic analysis (via SMT and MILP solvers) to certify individual fairness with randomized search to discover discriminatory clusters. This combination enables both formal guarantees-when no counterexamples exist-and the detection of severe violations that are computationally challenging for symbolic methods alone. Given a set of inputs exhibiting high k-unfairness, we introduce a novel explanation method to generate interpretable, decision-tree-style artifacts. Our experiments demonstrate that HyFair outperforms state-of-the-art fairness verification and local explanation methods.

Result: 我们综合了生命周期中的九个常见挑战领域，如需求质量和可追溯性、可变性管理以及工具链碎片化，并提供了一个优先标准目录，推荐基于模型的规划、可互操作和可追溯的工具链、需求提升、务实的自动化和虚拟化、有针对性的AI和形式化方法、可操作的指标以及轻量级组织实践。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个经过精心策划的目录，支持技术/工具选择，并可为未来的测试框架和改进提供参考。

Abstract: The automotive domain is shifting to software-centric development to meet regulation, market pressure, and feature velocity. This shift increases embedded systems' complexity and strains testing capacity. Despite relevant standards, a coherent system-testing methodology that spans heterogeneous, legacy-constrained toolchains remains elusive, and practice often depends on individual expertise rather than a systematic strategy. We derive challenges and requirements from a systematic literature review (SLR), complemented by industry experience and practice. We map them to test case specification techniques and testing tools, evaluating their suitability for automotive testing using PRISMA. Our contribution is a curated catalog that supports technique/tool selection and can inform future testing frameworks and improvements. We synthesize nine recurring challenge areas across the life cycle, such as requirements quality and traceability, variability management, and toolchain fragmentation. We then provide a prioritized criteria catalog that recommends model-based planning, interoperable and traceable toolchains, requirements uplift, pragmatic automation and virtualization, targeted AI and formal methods, actionable metrics, and lightweight organizational practices.

Objectives: This paper presents a systematic literature mapping to explore and categorize current advancements in fairness solutions within software engineering, focusing on three key dimensions: research trends, research focus, and viability in industrial contexts. Methods: We develop a classification framework to organize research on software fairness from a fresh perspective, applying it to 95 selected studies and analyzing their potential for industrial adoption. Results: Our findings reveal that software fairness research is expanding, yet it remains heavily focused on methods and algorithms. It primarily focuses on post-processing and group fairness, with less emphasis on early-stage interventions, individual fairness metrics, and understanding bias root causes. Additionally fairness research remains largely academic, with limited industry collaboration and low to medium Technology Readiness Level (TRL), indicating that industrial transferability remains distant. Conclusion: Our results underscore the need to incorporate fairness considerations across all stages of the software development life-cycle and to foster greater collaboration between academia and industry. This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the field, offering a foundation to guide future research and practical applications of fairness in software systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个分类法和框架，用于评估LLMs作为软件工程协作伙伴的行为，强调人机合作的动态性而非仅代码正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）从代码生成器演变为软件工程师的协作伙伴，现有的评估方法未能捕捉到成功人机合作所需的微妙、交互行为。

Method: 论文通过分析91组用户定义的代理规则，提出了企业软件工程中理想代理行为的基础分类法，并引入了上下文自适应行为（CAB）框架，该框架通过两个经验导出的轴（时间范围和类型工作）揭示了行为期望的变化。

Result: 论文定义了对代理行为的四个关键期望：遵守标准和流程、确保代码质量和可靠性、有效解决问题以及与用户协作，并展示了这些期望如何随时间和工作类型的变化而动态调整。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个以人为中心的基础，用于设计和评估下一代AI代理，将领域焦点从生成代码的正确性转向真正的协作智能的动态。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve from code generators into collaborative partners for software engineers, our methods for evaluation are lagging. Current benchmarks, focused on code correctness, fail to capture the nuanced, interactive behaviors essential for successful human-AI partnership. To bridge this evaluation gap, this paper makes two core contributions. First, we present a foundational taxonomy of desirable agent behaviors for enterprise software engineering, derived from an analysis of 91 sets of user-defined agent rules. This taxonomy defines four key expectations of agent behavior: Adhere to Standards and Processes, Ensure Code Quality and Reliability, Solving Problems Effectively, and Collaborating with the User.
  Second, recognizing that these expectations are not static, we introduce the Context-Adaptive Behavior (CAB) Framework. This emerging framework reveals how behavioral expectations shift along two empirically-derived axes: the Time Horizon (from immediate needs to future ideals), established through interviews with 15 expert engineers, and the Type of Work (from enterprise production to rapid prototyping, for example), identified through a prompt analysis of a prototyping agent. Together, these contributions offer a human-centered foundation for designing and evaluating the next generation of AI agents, moving the field's focus from the correctness of generated code toward the dynamics of true collaborative intelligence.

TL;DR: 传统SDP评估存在偏差，提出变更感知的多智能体辩论框架，实验证明其优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的SDP方法因文件跨版本持续存在且缺陷标签保留，导致评估结果存在标签持久性偏差，无法真正反映代码变更对缺陷的影响。

Method: 提出了一个基于LLM驱动的、变更感知的多智能体辩论框架，通过分析代码变更而非静态文件快照进行缺陷预测。

Result: 实验表明，传统模型在关键缺陷转换案例上表现不佳，而变更感知推理和多智能体辩论框架在演化子集上表现更均衡，显著提高了对缺陷引入的敏感性。

Conclusion: 当前文件级软件缺陷预测（SDP）的评估方法存在根本性缺陷，强调了在实际缺陷预测中需要采用变更感知的推理方法。

Abstract: Much of the reported progress in file-level software defect prediction (SDP) is, in reality, nothing but an illusion of accuracy. Over the last decades, machine learning and deep learning models have reported increasing performance across software versions. However, since most files persist across releases and retain their defect labels, standard evaluation rewards label-persistence bias rather than reasoning about code changes. To address this issue, we reformulate SDP as a change-aware prediction task, in which models reason over code changes of a file within successive project versions, rather than relying on static file snapshots. Building on this formulation, we propose an LLM-driven, change-aware, multi-agent debate framework. Our experiments on multiple PROMISE projects show that traditional models achieve inflated F1, while failing on rare but critical defect-transition cases. In contrast, our change-aware reasoning and multi-agent debate framework yields more balanced performance across evolution subsets and significantly improves sensitivity to defect introductions. These results highlight fundamental flaws in current SDP evaluation practices and emphasize the need for change-aware reasoning in practical defect prediction. The source code is publicly available.

Motivation: 探讨LLM编码工具在专业实践中的应用、相关风险及对开发工作流程的转变，尤其是对计算教育的影响。

Method: 通过对2024年末至2025年间发布的57个精选YouTube视频进行定性分析，捕捉从业者的反思与经验。

Result: 揭示了AI编码实践的定义、显著的生产力提升和降低的入门门槛，但也指出了代码质量、可维护性、安全漏洞等风险。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了基于AI编码的行业视角，并为教育实践与快速发展的专业现实对齐提供了指导。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced new paradigms in software development, including vibe coding, AI-assisted coding, and agentic coding, fundamentally reshaping how software is designed, implemented, and maintained. Prior research has primarily examined AI-based coding at the individual level or in educational settings, leaving industrial practitioners' perspectives underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by investigating how LLM coding tools are used in professional practice, the associated concerns and risks, and the resulting transformations in development workflows, with particular attention to implications for computing education. We conducted a qualitative analysis of 57 curated YouTube videos published between late 2024 and 2025, capturing reflections and experiences shared by practitioners. Following a filtering and quality assessment process, the selected sources were analyzed to compare LLM-based and traditional programming, identify emerging risks, and characterize evolving workflows. Our findings reveal definitions of AI-based coding practices, notable productivity gains, and lowered barriers to entry. Practitioners also report a shift in development bottlenecks toward code review and concerns regarding code quality, maintainability, security vulnerabilities, ethical issues, erosion of foundational problem-solving skills, and insufficient preparation of entry-level engineers. Building on these insights, we discuss implications for computer science and software engineering education and argue for curricular shifts toward problem-solving, architectural thinking, code review, and early project-based learning that integrates LLM tools. This study offers an industry-grounded perspective on AI-based coding and provides guidance for aligning educational practices with rapidly evolving professional realities.

Abstract: Using an AI assistant, we developed a method for systematically constructing controlled natural language for requirements based on formal specification patterns containing logical attributes. The method involves three stages: 1) compiling a generalized natural language requirement pattern that utilizes all attributes of the formal specification template; 2) generating, using the AI assistant, a corpus of natural language requirement patterns, reduced by partially evaluating attributes (the developed prompt utilizes the generalized template, attribute definitions, and specific formal semantics of the requirement patterns); and 3) formalizing the syntax of the controlled natural language based on an analysis of the grammatical structure of the resulting patterns. The method has been tested for event-driven temporal requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码幻觉检测方法多为粗粒度，缺乏细粒度定位技术，因此需要开发一种能精确定位幻觉代码行的新方法。

Method: 研究首先微调幻觉检测模型，随后设计探针网络将高维潜在向量投影到低维语法子空间，生成向量元组并重建P-AST，通过比较P-AST与O-AST定位幻觉代码行。

Result: 实验结果显示，CoHalLo在Top-1、Top-3、Top-5、Top-10准确率及IFA等指标上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CoHalLo通过探测隐藏层向量并比较P-AST与O-AST，实现了代码幻觉的细粒度定位，显著优于基线方法。

Abstract: The localization of code hallucinations aims to identify specific lines of code containing hallucinations, helping developers to improve the reliability of AI-generated code more efficiently. Although recent studies have adopted several methods to detect code hallucination, most of these approaches remain limited to coarse-grained detection and lack specialized techniques for fine-grained hallucination localization. This study introduces a novel method, called CoHalLo, which achieves line-level code hallucination localization by probing the hidden-layer vectors from hallucination detection models. CoHalLo uncovers the key syntactic information driving the model's hallucination judgments and locates the hallucinating code lines accordingly. Specifically, we first fine-tune the hallucination detection model on manually annotated datasets to ensure that it learns features pertinent to code syntactic information. Subsequently, we designed a probe network that projects high-dimensional latent vectors onto a low-dimensional syntactic subspace, generating vector tuples and reconstructing the predicted abstract syntax tree (P-AST). By comparing P-AST with the original abstract syntax tree (O-AST) extracted from the input AI-generated code, we identify the key syntactic structures associated with hallucinations. This information is then used to pinpoint hallucinated code lines. To evaluate CoHalLo's performance, we manually collected a dataset of code hallucinations. The experimental results show that CoHalLo achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 0.4253, Top-3 accuracy of 0.6149, Top-5 accuracy of 0.7356, Top-10 accuracy of 0.8333, IFA of 5.73, Recall@1% Effort of 0.052721, and Effort@20% Recall of 0.155269, which outperforms the baseline methods.

Result: BLVSPs使用GenAI提高了生产力和可访问性，但也面临幻觉风险和组织政策限制。

Conclusion: 论文讨论了BLVSPs在使用GenAI时面临的高风险与高回报，强调了在决定是否及何时使用GenAI工具时需要谨慎权衡。

Abstract: The software development workplace poses numerous technical and collaborative accessibility challenges for blind and low vision software professionals (BLVSPs). Though Generative AI (GenAI) is increasingly adopted within the software development industry and has been a rapidly growing topic of interest in research, to date, the unique perspectives of BLVSPs have yet to be consulted. We report on a qualitative study involving 39 semi-structured interviews with BLVSPs about what the introduction of GenAI has meant for their work. We found that BLVSPs used GenAI for many software development tasks, resulting in benefits such as increased productivity and accessibility. However, significant costs were also accompanied by GenAI use as they were more vulnerable to hallucinations than their sighted colleagues. Sometimes, organizational policies prevented use. Based on our findings, we discuss the higher-risks and higher-returns that BLVSPs had to carefully weigh when deciding whether and when to use GenAI tools for work.

TL;DR: Unifico是一个多ISA编译器，通过避免运行时堆栈转换降低ISA迁移开销，性能优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构ISA处理器设计缺乏支持异构ISA目标的编译工具链，尤其是运行时堆栈转换的高成本问题阻碍了研究进展。

Method: Unifico是一个多ISA编译器，利用LLVM基础设施生成在x86-64和ARMv8架构上保持相同堆栈布局的二进制文件，同时维护统一的ABI和虚拟地址空间。

Result: Unifico在NAS基准测试中平均引入小于6%（高端处理器）和10%（低端处理器）的开销，并将二进制大小开销从约200%降至约10%。

Conclusion: Unifico编译器通过避免运行时堆栈转换，显著降低了ISA迁移的开销，并在二进制大小和性能上优于现有技术（如Popcorn编译器）。

Abstract: Heterogeneous-ISA processor designs have attracted considerable research interest. However, unlike their homogeneous-ISA counterparts, explicit software support for bridging ISA heterogeneity is required. The lack of a compilation toolchain ready to support heterogeneous-ISA targets has been a major factor hindering research in this exciting emerging area. For any such compiler, "getting right" the mechanics involved in state transformation upon migration and doing this efficiently is of critical importance. In particular, any runtime conversion of the current program stack from one architecture to another would be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we design and develop Unifico, a new multi-ISA compiler that generates binaries that maintain the same stack layout during their execution on either architecture. Unifico avoids the need for runtime stack transformation, thus eliminating overheads associated with ISA migration. Additional responsibilities of the Unifico compiler backend include maintenance of a uniform ABI and virtual address space across ISAs. Unifico is implemented using the LLVM compiler infrastructure, and we are currently targeting the x86-64 and ARMv8 ISAs. We have evaluated Unifico across a range of compute-intensive NAS benchmarks and show its minimal impact on overall execution time, where less than 6% (10%) overhead is introduced on average for high-end (low-end) processors. We also analyze the performance impact of Unifico's key design features and demonstrate that they can be further optimized to mitigate this impact. When compared against the state-of-the-art Popcorn compiler, Unifico reduces binary size overhead from ~200% to ~10%, whilst eliminating the stack transformation overhead during ISA migration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）生成的代码可能偏离用户意图，需要监督和编辑。为此，研究旨在提供技术以定位生成代码与用户意图的偏差。

Method: 首先创建了一个包含修复后LLM生成程序的"最小意图对齐补丁"数据集，使用测试用例验证正确性。然后比较了白盒探测（提出了一种高效任意跨度查询技术）与黑盒反射和自一致性方法的效果。

Result: 研究发现，小型监督模型的探测可以实现较低的校准误差和约0.2的Brier Skill Score，能够有效估计由大模型生成的代码中被编辑的行。

Conclusion: 论文探讨了监督小型模型在定位大型语言模型生成代码与用户意图偏差方面的有效性，并发现这些技术在自然语言错误处理方面也有一定的泛化潜力。

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) can generate complicated source code from natural language prompts. However, LLMs can generate output that deviates from what the user wants, requiring supervision and editing. To support this process, we offer techniques to localize where generations might be misaligned from user intent. We first create a dataset of "Minimal Intent Aligning Patches" of repaired LLM generated programs. Each program uses test cases to verify correctness. After creating a dataset of programs, we measure how well various techniques can assign a well-calibrated probability to indicate which parts of code will be edited in a minimal patch (i.e., give a probability that corresponds with empirical odds it is edited). We compare white-box probing (where we propose a technique for efficient arbitrary-span querying), against black-box reflective and self-consistency based approaches. We find probes with a small supervisor model can achieve low calibration error and Brier Skill Score of approx 0.2 estimating edited lines on code generated by models many orders of magnitude larger. We discuss the generalizability of the techniques, and the connections to AI oversight and control, finding a probe trained only on code shows some signs of generalizing to natural language errors if new probability scaling is allowed.

Method: 通过大规模实证研究，考察了五种训练数据优化技术及其组合在三个基准和四个LLM上的效果。

Result: 数据合成在提高功能正确性和减少代码异味方面最有效，但与数据重构的组合在代码可维护性上表现更佳。

Conclusion: 本研究首次系统评估了五种广泛使用的训练数据优化技术及其组合对基于LLM的代码生成的影响，发现数据合成是最有效的技术，而数据合成与数据重构的组合表现最佳。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code generation, largely driven by the availability of high-quality code datasets for effective training. To further improve data quality, numerous training data optimization techniques have been proposed; however, their overall effectiveness has not been systematically evaluated. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study, examining five widely-used training data optimization techniques and their pairwise combinations for LLM-based code generation across three benchmarks and four LLMs. Our results show that data synthesis is the most effective technique for improving functional correctness and reducing code smells, although it performs relatively worse on code maintainability compared to data refactoring, cleaning, and selection. Regarding combinations, we find that most combinations do not further improve functional correctness but can effectively enhance code quality (code smells and maintainability). Among all combinations, data synthesis combined with data refactoring achieves the strongest overall performance. Furthermore, our fine-grained analysis reinforces these findings and provides deeper insights into how individual techniques and their combinations influence code generation effectiveness. Overall, this work represents a first step toward a systematic understanding of training data optimization and combination strategies, offering practical guidance for future research and deployment in LLM-based code generation.

Conclusion: Preguss框架显著提升了大规模软件和硬件系统形式化验证的自动化程度，减少了80.6%~88.9%的人工验证工作量。

Abstract: Fully automated verification of large-scale software and hardware systems is arguably the holy grail of formal methods. Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated their potential for enhancing the degree of automation in formal verification by, e.g., generating formal specifications as essential to deductive verification, yet exhibit poor scalability due to long-context reasoning limitations and, more importantly, the difficulty of inferring complex, interprocedural specifications. This paper presents Preguss -- a modular, fine-grained framework for automating the generation and refinement of formal specifications. Preguss synergizes between static analysis and deductive verification by steering two components in a divide-and-conquer fashion: (i) potential runtime error-guided construction and prioritization of verification units, and (ii) LLM-aided synthesis of interprocedural specifications at the unit level. We show that Preguss substantially outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based approaches and, in particular, it enables highly automated RTE-freeness verification for real-world programs with over a thousand LoC, with a reduction of 80.6%~88.9% human verification effort.

Abstract: LLM-based software engineering is influencing modern software development. In addition to correctness, prior studies have also examined the performance of software artifacts generated by AI agents. However, it is unclear how exactly the agentic AI systems address performance concerns in practice. In this paper, we present an empirical study of performance-related pull requests generated by AI agents. Using LLM-assisted detection and BERTopic-based topic modeling, we identified 52 performance-related topics grouped into 10 higher-level categories. Our results show that AI agents apply performance optimizations across diverse layers of the software stack and that the type of optimization significantly affects pull request acceptance rates and review times. We also found that performance optimization by AI agents primarily occurs during the development phase, with less focus on the maintenance phase. Our findings provide empirical evidence that can support the evaluation and improvement of agentic AI systems with respect to their performance optimization behaviors and review outcomes.

Motivation: 现有APR方法主要依赖静态分析或有限的动态信号，无法充分模拟人类逐步调试过程，限制了多步推理和复杂错误修复的效果。

Method: DynaFix是一种基于执行级动态信息的APR方法，通过迭代捕获运行时信息（如变量状态、控制流路径和调用栈）并转化为结构化提示，指导LLMs生成候选补丁。

Result: DynaFix在Defects4J v1.2和v2.0基准测试中修复了186个单函数错误，比现有方法提升了10%，包括38个之前未修复的错误，并将补丁搜索空间减少了70%。

Conclusion: DynaFix显著提升了自动程序修复的效果和效率，修复了186个单函数错误，并在Defects4J基准测试中优于现有方法，展现了其在复杂错误修复中的潜力。

Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to automatically generate correct patches for buggy programs. Recent approaches leveraging large language models (LLMs) have shown promise but face limitations. Most rely solely on static analysis, ignoring runtime behaviors. Some attempt to incorporate dynamic signals, but these are often restricted to training or fine-tuning, or injected only once into the repair prompt, without iterative use. This fails to fully capture program execution. Current iterative repair frameworks typically rely on coarse-grained feedback, such as pass/fail results or exception types, and do not leverage fine-grained execution-level information effectively. As a result, models struggle to simulate human stepwise debugging, limiting their effectiveness in multi-step reasoning and complex bug repair.
  To address these challenges, we propose DynaFix, an execution-level dynamic information-driven APR method that iteratively leverages runtime information to refine the repair process. In each repair round, DynaFix captures execution-level dynamic information such as variable states, control-flow paths, and call stacks, transforming them into structured prompts to guide LLMs in generating candidate patches. If a patch fails validation, DynaFix re-executes the modified program to collect new execution information for the next attempt. This iterative loop incrementally improves patches based on updated feedback, similar to the stepwise debugging practices of human developers. We evaluate DynaFix on the Defects4J v1.2 and v2.0 benchmarks. DynaFix repairs 186 single-function bugs, a 10% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, including 38 bugs previously unrepaired. It achieves correct patches within at most 35 attempts, reducing the patch search space by 70% compared with existing methods, thereby demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency in repairing complex bugs.

Conclusion: 尽管构建和运行这些AI编码代理本身能耗很高，但令人鼓舞的是，它们在生成软件工件时表现出能源意识。然而，与优化相关的PR（拉取请求）接受率较低，主要因为其对可维护性的负面影响。

Abstract: As Software Engineering enters its new era (SE 3.0), AI coding agents increasingly automate software development workflows. However, it remains unclear how exactly these agents recognize and address software energy concerns-an issue growing in importance due to large-scale data centers, energy-hungry language models, and battery-constrained devices. In this paper, we examined the energy awareness of agent-authored pull requests (PRs) using a publicly available dataset. We identified 216 energy-explicit PRs and conducted a thematic analysis, deriving a taxonomy of energy-aware work. Our further analysis of the applied optimization techniques shows that most align with established research recommendations. Although building and running these agents is highly energy intensive, encouragingly, the results indicate that they exhibit energy awareness when generating software artifacts. However, optimization-related PRs are accepted less frequently than others, largely due to their negative impact on maintainability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子软件工程（QSE）对于确保混合量子-经典系统的可靠性和可维护性至关重要，但关于真实量子项目中缺陷如何出现及影响质量的实证证据仍然有限。

Method: 采用混合方法，包括仓库挖掘、静态代码分析、问题元数据提取和验证的基于规则的分类框架，分析了32,296个已验证的缺陷报告。

Abstract: Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) is essential for ensuring the reliability and maintainability of hybrid quantum-classical systems, yet empirical evidence on how bugs emerge and affect quality in real-world quantum projects remains limited. This study presents the first ecosystem-scale longitudinal analysis of software defects across 123 open source quantum repositories from 2012 to 2024, spanning eight functional categories, including full-stack libraries, simulators, annealing, algorithms, compilers, assembly, cryptography, and experimental computing. Using a mixed method approach combining repository mining, static code analysis, issue metadata extraction, and a validated rule-based classification framework, we analyze 32,296 verified bug reports. Results show that full-stack libraries and compilers are the most defect-prone categories due to circuit, gate, and transpilation-related issues, while simulators are mainly affected by measurement and noise modeling errors. Classical bugs primarily impact usability and interoperability, whereas quantum-specific bugs disproportionately degrade performance, maintainability, and reliability. Longitudinal analysis indicates ecosystem maturation, with defect densities peaking between 2017 and 2021 and declining thereafter. High-severity defects cluster in cryptography, experimental computing, and compiler toolchains. Repositories employing automated testing detect more defects and resolve issues faster. A negative binomial regression further shows that automated testing is associated with an approximate 60 percent reduction in expected defect incidence. Overall, this work provides the first large-scale data-driven characterization of quantum software defects and offers empirical guidance for improving testing, documentation, and maintainability practices in QSE.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在抑制噪声干扰方面表现不佳，尤其是难以消除目标中的噪声，影响了基于函数相似性的bug检测性能。因此，提出MATUS以解决这一问题。

Method: MATUS从bug查询和目标中提取特征切片来表示（潜在）bug逻辑的语义特征，并利用bug代码的先验知识以端到端方式指导目标切片，定位切片标准。所有特征切片基于向量相似性进行嵌入和比较，最终审计bug候选以确认目标中的未知bug。

Result: 实验表明，MATUS在真实项目中的bug检测具有优势且效率可接受，共发现Linux内核中31个未知bug，其中11个被分配CVE编号。

Conclusion: MATUS通过抑制目标噪声并利用特征切片技术，显著提升了基于相似性测量的bug检测精度，成功在Linux内核中发现了31个未知bug，其中11个被分配了CVE编号。

Abstract: Measuring the function similarity to detect bugs is effective, but the statements unrelated to the bugs can impede the performance due to the noise interference. Suppressing the noise interference in existing works does not manage the tough job, i.e., eliminating the noise in the targets. In this paper, we propose MATUS to mitigate the target noise for precise bug detection based on similarity measurement. Feature slices are extracted from both the buggy query and the targets to represent the semantic feature of (potential) bug logics. In particular, MATUS guides the target slicing with the prior knowledge from the buggy code, in an end-to-end way to pinpoint the slicing criterion in the targets. All feature slices are embedded and compared based on the vector similarity. Buggy candidates are audited to confirm unknown bugs in the targets. Experiments show that MATUS holds advantages in bug detection for real-world projects with acceptable efficiency. In total, MATUS has spotted 31 unknown bugs in the Linux kernel. All of them have been confirmed by the kernel developers, and 11 have been assigned CVEs.

Conclusion: 该系统通过微服务架构和多重安全设计，在高并发场景下展现出良好的稳定性和数据一致性，有效解决了传统架构的不足。

Abstract: The railway ticketing system is one of the most important public service infrastructure. In peak periods such as holidays, it is often faced with the challenge of high concurrency scenarios because of a large number of users accessing at the same time. The traditional aggregation architecture can not meet the peak user requirements because of its insufficient fault tolerance and low ability. Therefore, the system needs to use microservice architecture for development, and add multiple security methods to ensure that the system can have good stability and data consistency under high concurrency scenarios, and can respond quickly to user requests. This paper introduces the use of B/S architecture and Spring Cloud to design and develop a railway ticket purchase system that can maintain stability and reliability under high concurrency scenarios, and formulate multiple security design methods for the system. This system integrates a range of functions, such as real-time train inquiries, dynamic seat updates, online seat selection, and ticket purchasing, effectively addressing common problems associated with offline ticket purchasing, such as long queues and delayed information. It enables a complete online process from inquiry and booking to payment and refunds. Furthermore, the "add passenger" function allows users to purchase tickets for others, extending the convenience of online ticketing to people with limited internet access. The system design prioritizes security and stability, while also focusing on high performance, and achieves these goals through a carefully designed architecture and the integration of multiple middleware components. After the completion of the system development, the core interface of the system is tested, and then the results are analyzed. The test data proves that the system has good ability and stability under high concurrency.

Motivation: 研究稀疏随机矩阵在高维数据降维中的应用，以解决标准高斯JL矩阵计算效率低的问题。

Method: 比较了Achlioptas（2003）和Kane与Nelson（2014）提出的稀疏随机矩阵构造方法，并实证评估了它们与标准高斯JL矩阵的性能。

Result: 稀疏随机矩阵在保持距离近似的同时，显著提高了计算速度。

Conclusion: 稀疏随机矩阵在高维数据降维中能够有效保持距离，同时提供更快的计算效率，与标准高斯JL矩阵相比具有竞争力。

Abstract: The Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) theorem states that a set of points in high-dimensional space can be embedded into a lower-dimensional space while approximately preserving pairwise distances with high probability Johnson and Lindenstrauss (1984). The standard JL theorem uses dense random matrices with Gaussian entries. However, for some applications, sparse random matrices are preferred as they allow for faster matrix-vector multiplication. I outline the constructions and proofs introduced by Achlioptas (2003) and the contemporary standard by Kane and Nelson (2014). Further, I implement and empirically compare these sparse constructions with standard Gaussian JL matrices.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肾脏交换在实际中受限于基础设施和法律约束，只能在小型循环中进行。现有的计算任务是NP完全的，需要更快的算法来克服计算障碍。

Method: 通过参数化复杂性框架，设计了更快的确定性FPT算法，并进行了路径宽度参数化下的W[1]-难解性证明。

Abstract: The kidney exchange mechanism allows many patient-donor pairs who are otherwise incompatible with each other to come together and exchange kidneys along a cycle. However, due to infrastructure and legal constraints, kidney exchange can only be performed in small cycles in practice. In reality, there are also some altruistic donors who do not have any paired patients. This allows us to also perform kidney exchange along paths that start from some altruistic donor. Unfortunately, the computational task is NP-complete. To overcome this computational barrier, an important line of research focuses on designing faster algorithms, both exact and using the framework of parameterized complexity.
  The standard parameter for the kidney exchange problem is the number $t$ of patients that receive a healthy kidney. The current fastest known deterministic FPT algorithm for this problem, parameterized by $t$, is $O^\star\left(14^t\right)$. In this work, we improve this by presenting a deterministic FPT algorithm that runs in time $O^\star\left((4e)^t\right)\approx O^\star\left(10.88^t\right)$. This problem is also known to be W[1]-hard parameterized by the treewidth of the underlying undirected graph. A natural question here is whether the kidney exchange problem admits an FPT algorithm parameterized by the pathwidth of the underlying undirected graph. We answer this negatively in this paper by proving that this problem is W[1]-hard parameterized by the pathwidth of the underlying undirected graph. We also present some parameterized intractability results improving the current understanding of the problem under the framework of parameterized complexity.

TL;DR: 本文首次突破了有向全局最小顶点割问题的Θ(mn)时间复杂度障碍，提出了随机化算法，优化了权重和无权重版本的运行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有向全局最小顶点割问题是图论和算法中最基本的问题之一，已有大量研究。然而，对于有向图中的顶点割问题，自1996年以来，Henzinger等人的算法时间复杂度为Θ(mn)，一直未被突破。本文旨在打破这一时间复杂度的障碍。

Method: 本文采用了随机化算法的方法，针对有向全局最小顶点割问题进行了优化。对于权重版本，算法的时间复杂度为O(mn^0.976·polylog W)；对于无权重版本，算法的时间复杂度为O(min{m^1+o(1)·k, n^2+o(1)})。

Result: 本文提出的随机化算法在有向全局最小顶点割问题上首次突破了Θ(mn)的时间复杂度障碍。对于权重版本，时间复杂度为O(mn^0.976·polylog W)；对于无权重版本，时间复杂度为O(min{m^1+o(1)·k, n^2+o(1)})。

Conclusion: 本文首次突破了有向全局最小顶点割问题的Θ(mn)时间复杂度障碍，提出了一个随机化算法，其时间复杂度为O(mn^0.976·polylog W)，其中W是顶点权重的最大与最小比值。此外，还提出了一个针对无权重版本的随机化算法，时间复杂度为O(min{m^1+o(1)·k, n^2+o(1)})，其中k是最优解的值。

Abstract: We study the directed global minimum vertex-cut problem: given a directed vertex-weighted graph $G$, compute a vertex-cut $(L,S,R)$ in $G$ of minimum value, which is defined to be the total weight of all vertices in $S$. The problem, together with its edge-based variant, is one of the most basic in graph theory and algorithms, and has been studied extensively. The fastest currently known algorithm for directed global minimum vertex-cut (Henzinger, Rao and Gabow, FOCS 1996 and J. Algorithms 2000) has running time $\tilde{O}(mn)$, where $m$ and $n$ denote the number of edges and vertices in the input graph, respectively. A long line of work over the past decades led to faster algorithms for other main versions of the problem, including the undirected edge-based setting (Karger, STOC 1996 and J. ACM 2000), directed edge-based setting (Cen et al., FOCS 2021), and undirected vertex-based setting (Chuzhoy and Trabelsi, STOC 2025). However, for the vertex-based version in directed graphs, the 29 year-old $\tilde{O}(mn)$-time algorithm of Henzinger, Rao and Gabow remains the state of the art to this day, in all edge-density regimes. In this paper we break the $Θ(mn)$ running time barrier for the first time, by providing a randomized algorithm for directed global minimum vertex-cut, with running time $O\left(mn^{0.976}\cdot\operatorname{polylog} W\right)$ where $W$ is the ratio of largest to smallest vertex weight. Additionally, we provide a randomized $O\left(\min\left\{m^{1+o(1)}\cdot k,n^{2+o(1)}\right\}\right)$-time algorithm for the unweighted version of directed global minimum vertex-cut, where $k$ is the value of the optimal solution. The best previous algorithm for the problem achieved running time $\tilde O\left(\min\left\{k^2 \cdot m, mn^{11/12+o(1)}, n^{2+o(1)}\right\}\right)$ (Forster et al., SODA 2020, Li et al., STOC 2021).

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种在有限查询条件下实现公平$k$-委员会选择的算法，解决了在仅有序信息时无法实现常数扭曲的问题。

Abstract: We study the problem of fair $k$-committee selection under an egalitarian objective. Given $n$ agents partitioned into $m$ groups (\eg, demographic quotas), the goal is to aggregate their preferences to form a committee of size $k$ that guarantees minimum representation from each group while minimizing the maximum \emph{cost} incurred by any agent. We model this setting as the ordinal fair $k$-center problem, where agents are embedded in an unknown metric space, and each agent reports a complete preference ranking (i.e., ordinal information) over all agents, consistent with the underlying distance metric (i.e., cardinal information). The cost incurred by an agent with respect to a committee is defined as its distance to the closest committee member. The quality of an algorithm is evaluated using the notion of distortion, which measures the worst-case ratio between the cost of the committee produced by the algorithm and the cost of an optimal committee, when given complete access to the underlying metric space.
  When cardinal information is not available, no constant distortion is possible for the ordinal $k$-center problem, even without fairness constraints, when $k\geq 3$ [Burkhardt et.al., AAAI'24]. To overcome this hardness, we allow limited access to cardinal information by querying the metric space. In this setting, our main contribution is a factor-$5$ distortion algorithm that requires only $O(k \log^2 k)$ queries. Along the way, we present an improved factor-$3$ distortion algorithm using $O(k^2)$ queries.

Abstract: Genome rearrangement distances are an established method in genome comparison. Works in this area may include various rearrangement operations representing large-scale mutations, gene orientation information, the number of nucleotides in intergenic regions, and weights reflecting the expected frequency of each operation. In this article, we model genomes containing at most one copy of each gene by considering gene sequences, with orientations, and representing intergenic regions according to their nucleotide lengths. We looked at a problem called Weighted Reversal, Transposition, and Indel Distance, which seeks the minimal cost sequence composed by the rearrangement operations of reversals, transposition, and indels, capable of transforming one genome into another. We leverage a structure called Labeled Intergenic Breakpoint Graph to show an algorithm for that problem with guaranteed approximations considering some sets of weights for the operations.

Abstract: We consider a recently introduced fair repetitive scheduling problem involving a set of clients, each asking for their associated job to be daily scheduled on a single machine across a finite planning horizon. The goal is to determine a job processing permutation for each day, aiming to minimize the maximum total completion time experienced by any client. This problem is known to be NP-hard for quite restrictive settings, with previous work offering exact solution methods for highly-structured special cases.
  In this paper, we focus on the design of approximation algorithms with provable performance guarantees. Our main contributions can be briefly summarized as follows:
  (i) When job processing times are day-dependent, we devise a polynomial-time LP-based $2$-approximation, as well as a polynomial-time approximation scheme for a constant number of days.
  (ii) With day-invariant processing times, we obtain a surprisingly simple $(\frac{1+\sqrt{2}}{2}+ε)$-approximation in polynomial time. This setting is also shown to admit a quasi-polynomial-time approximation scheme for an arbitrary number of days.
  The key technical component driving our approximation schemes is a novel batching technique, where jobs are conceptually grouped into batches, subsequently leading either to a low-dimensional dynamic program or to a compact configuration LP. Concurrently, while developing our constant-factor approximations, we propose a host of lower-bounding mechanisms that may be of broader interest.

Abstract: The concept of fair orientations in graphs was introduced by Christodoulou, Fiat, Koutsoupias, and Sgouritsa in 2023, naturally modeling fair division scenarios in which resources are only contested by neighbors. In this model, vertices represent agents and undirected edges represent goods; edges have to be oriented towards one of their endpoints, i.e., allocated to one of their adjacent agents. Although EFX orientations (envy-free up to any good) have been extensively studied in this setting, EF orientations (envy-free) remain unexplored. In this work, we initiate their study, mostly under the lens of parameterized complexity, presenting various tractable cases, hardness results, and parameterizations. Our results concern both simple graphs and multigraphs. Interestingly, many of our results transfer to EFX orientations, thus complementing and improving upon previous work; notably, we answer an open question regarding the structural parameterized complexity of the latter problem on graphs of polynomially-bounded valuations. We also show that EF orientations are tractable in cases in which EFX orientations are not, particularly for binary valuations. Lastly, we consider charity in the orientation setting, establishing algorithms for finding the minimum amount of edges that have to be removed from a graph in order for EF(X) orientations to exist.
