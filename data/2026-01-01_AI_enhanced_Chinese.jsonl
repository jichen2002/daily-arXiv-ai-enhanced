In the context of next-generation wireless networks, integrating sensing and communication modalities presents a unique opportunity to develop generalizable and data-efficient models. In this work, we introduce the contrastive learning based Wireless Multimodal Foundation Model (WMFM), a large-scale framework that jointly learns from wireless channel coefficients and visual imagery. The WMFM is pretrained using contrastive learning, a self-supervised learning technique that aligns embeddings of camera and channel data without requiring explicit labels. The pretrained encoders are then frozen and employed as feature extractors, with lightweight task-specific heads, fine-tuned for downstream tasks, including user localization and LoS/nLoS classification. Extensive experiments on the DeepVerse6G dataset demonstrate that the proposed WMFM achieves a 17% improvement in balanced accuracy for LoS/nLoS classification and a 48.5% reduction in localization error compared to the end-to-end (E2E) benchmark, while reducing training time by up to 90-fold. Even when trained with as little as 20% of the data, the WMFM-based heads outperform the fully supervised E2E model, underscoring their robustness and data-efficient learning. The proposed approach establishes a foundation for scalable, multimodal learning in Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems, paving the way for intelligent and adaptive 6G networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08WMFM\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LoS/nLoS\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3a6G\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u591a\u6837\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u8054\u5408\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u9769\u65b0\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u3002\u5728\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6a21\u6001\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u72ec\u7279\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08WMFM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u9f50\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u6807\u7b7e\u3002\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u88ab\u51bb\u7ed3\u5e76\u7528\u4f5c\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u5934\u90e8\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728DeepVerse6G\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cWMFM\u5728LoS/nLoS\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8617%\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8648.5%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8690\u500d\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752820%\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0cWMFM\u4ecd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\uff08ISAC\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u76846G\u7f51\u7edc\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

It has proven to be a monumental and revolutionary tool that keeps the world connected. However, recent WiFi advancements are numerous and at times confusing. WiFi has grown significantly over the years, yet few understand the scope and scale of WiFi progression as a whole. This paper tackles that problem, providing a broad literature review on the advancements of key WiFi features to date. This paper will center on seven key areas of focus: (1) bandwidth, (2) battery life, (3) traffic collisions, (4) interference, (5) data-intensive transmissions, (6) numerous devices, and (7) peak throughput/modulation. Each section will focus on WiFi's problems, how those problems were fixed, as well as the limitations of existing solutions. Moreover, the paper explains the role of new unreleased technologies in these seven areas. This includes exploring the upcoming WiFi 8 standard based on the IEEE 802.11bn \"Ultra High Reliability\" (UHR) specification and how it builds upon current specifications. Compared to previous specifications, WiFi 8 marks a stronger and more significant shift toward prioritizing reliability over pure data rates. Beyond a sole literature review, this paper uses a novel analogy. A road/highway analogy will be integrated throughout the paper to facilitate understanding of networking mechanisms.

Rather than adapting established sender-driven reliable unicast mechanisms to multicast, as most contemporaneous proposals did, SRM introduced a data-centric model in which data receivers recover losses by explicitly requesting missing data. Thirty years later, we revisit the SRM framework, examining the challenges it faced, the lessons learned, and its influence on the later development of Named Data Networking (NDN). Experimentations with SRM revealed a fundamental semantic mismatch between its data-centric framework and IP's address-based delivery; while the application layer named data, the network layer remained 'blind' to those names, resulting in inefficient loss recovery. NDN resolves this architectural friction by aligning network delivery with the data-retrieval model and by securing data directly rather than securing communication channels.

In this paper, we propose PartMotionEdit, a novel fine-grained motion editing framework that operates via part-level semantic modulation. The core of PartMotionEdit is a Part-aware Motion Modulation (PMM) module, which builds upon a predefined five-part body decomposition. PMM dynamically predicts time-varying modulation weights for each body part, enabling precise and interpretable editing of local motions. To guide the training of PMM, we also introduce a part-level similarity curve supervision mechanism enhanced with dual-layer normalization.

In Agentic Cloud Data Engineering platform, specialized agents analyze pipeline telemetry and metadata, reason over declarative cost and compliance policies, and propose constrained operational actions such as adaptive resource reconfiguration, schema reconciliation, and automated failure recovery. All agent actions are validated against governance policies to ensure predictable and auditable behavior. We evaluate Agentic Cloud Data Engineering platform using representative batch and streaming analytics workloads constructed from public enterprise-style datasets. Experimental results show that Agentic Cloud Data Engineering platform reduces mean pipeline recovery time by up to 45%, lowers operational cost by approximately 25%, and decreases manual intervention events by over 70% compared to static orchestration, while maintaining data freshness and policy compliance.

IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 2026", "summary": "Prehensile autonomous manipulation, such as peg insertion, tool use, or assembly, require precise in-hand understanding of the object pose and the extrinsic contacts made during interactions. Providing accurate estimation of pose and contacts is challenging. Tactile sensors can provide local geometry at the sensor and force information about the grasp, but the locality of sensing means resolving poses and contacts from tactile alone is often an ill-posed problem, as multiple configurations can be consistent with the observations. Adding visual feedback can help resolve ambiguities, but can suffer from noise and occlusions. In this work, we propose a method that pairs local observations from sensing with the physical constraints of contact. We propose a set of factors that ensure local consistency with tactile observations as well as enforcing physical plausibility, namely, that the estimated pose and contacts must respect the kinematic and force constraints of quasi-static rigid body interactions. We formalize our problem as a factor graph, allowing for efficient estimation. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing geometric and contact-informed estimation pipelines, especially when only tactile information is available.

Existing self-supervised methods, typically relying on foundation models trained with noisy real-world pseudo-labels, often suffer from boundary collapse on thin surgical tools and transparent surfaces. In this work, we address this by leveraging the high-fidelity synthetic priors of the Depth Anything V2 architecture, which inherently captures precise geometric details of thin structures.

Static benchmarks like MMLU and TruthfulQA cannot distinguish a model that lacks knowledge from one whose verification mechanisms collapse when information degrades or adversaries probe for weaknesses. We introduce the Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT), a protocol that measures epistemic robustness: a model's ability to maintain factual accuracy under progressive semantic compression and adversarial fabrication. We propose a two-system cognitive model comprising a Semantic System that generates fluent text and an Epistemic Verifier that validates factual accuracy. Our findings, based on evaluating 9 frontier models across 8 knowledge domains at 5 compression levels (1,800 turn-level evaluations), reveal that epistemic robustness is orthogonal to conventional design paradigms. Neither parameter count (r=0.083, p=0.832) nor architectural type (r=0.153, p=0.695) significantly predicts robustness, suggesting it emerges from training methodology and verification mechanisms distinct from current approaches. Error detection capability strongly predicts overall robustness (rho=-0.817, p=0.007), indicating this is the critical bottleneck. We find that flagship models exhibit brittleness despite their scale, while smaller models can achieve robust performance, challenging assumptions about the relationship between model size and reliability.

While demand paging extends capacity via host DRAM, it incurs up to 78x slowdown due to the massive working sets and poor locality of GPU workloads. We observe, however, that GPU memory access patterns are inherently predictable via kernel launch arguments and their asynchronous execution nature. Leveraging this, we propose MSched, an OS-level scheduler that extends GPU context switching to include proactive working set preparation, thereby coalescing fragmented, eventual, and expensive page faults into a single efficient migration. MSched employs a template-based approach to predict working sets with near-perfect accuracy and proposes a co-design between task scheduler and memory manager to enforce a globally optimal page placement policy.

Fog computing addresses this by placing computation near the network edge. However, limited and heterogeneous fog resources pose reliability challenges, especially for mission-critical applications. On the other hand, to improve flexibility, applications are deployed as Service Function Chains (SFCs), where each function runs as a Virtual Network Function (VNF). While scalable, this approach is more failure-prone than monolithic deployments, necessitating intelligent redundancy and placement strategies. This paper addresses the reliability-aware SFC placement problem over heterogeneous fog servers through the lens of reliability theory. We explore four redundancy strategies, combining shared vs. dedicated and active vs. standby modes, and propose a general framework to minimize latency and cost while meeting reliability and deadline constraints.

Existing methods mostly employ semantic segmentation, focusing on the semantic feature between different types of teeth. However, due to the tightly packed structure of teeth, unclear boundaries, and the diversity of complex cases such as missing teeth, malposed teeth, semantic segmentation often struggles to achieve satisfactory results when dealing with complex dental cases. To address these issues, this paper propose BATISNet, a boundary-aware instance network for tooth point cloud segmentation. This network model consists of a feature extraction backbone and an instance segmentation module. It not only focuses on extracting the semantic features of different types of teeth but also learns the instance features of individual teeth. It helps achieve more robust and accurate tooth instance segmentation in complex clinical scenarios such as missing teeth and malposed teeth.

Extensive profiling experiments are conducted to derive a nonlinear fitting model that characterizes the relationship among CPU/memory allocations and processing latency across diverse workloads, enabling reliable estimation of performance under varying configurations and providing quantitative support for subsequent optimization. Using this model and a queueing-based delay formulation, we formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem to jointly minimize system latency and power consumption, which is shown to be NP-hard. The problem is decomposed into tractable convex subproblems and solved through a two-stage container-based resource management scheme (CRMS) combining convex optimization and greedy refinement. The proposed scheme achieves polynomial-time complexity and supports quasi-dynamic execution under global resource constraints.

However, due to infrastructure and legal constraints, kidney exchange can only be performed in small cycles in practice. In reality, there are also some altruistic donors who do not have any paired patients. This allows us to also perform kidney exchange along paths that start from some altruistic donor. Unfortunately, the computational task is NP-complete. To overcome this computational barrier, an important line of research focuses on designing faster algorithms, both exact and using the framework of parameterized complexity.\n  The standard parameter for the kidney exchange problem is the number $t$ of patients that receive a healthy kidney. The current fastest known deterministic FPT algorithm for this problem, parameterized by $t$, is $O^\\star\\left(14^t\\right)$. In this work, we improve this by presenting a deterministic FPT algorithm that runs in time $O^\\star\\left((4e)^t\\right)\\approx O^\\star\\left(10.88^t\\right)$. This problem is also known to be W[1]-hard parameterized by the treewidth of the underlying undirected graph. A natural question here is whether the kidney exchange problem admits an FPT algorithm parameterized by the pathwidth of the underlying undirected graph. We answer this negatively in this paper by proving that this problem is W[1]-hard parameterized by the pathwidth of the underlying undirected graph. We also present some parameterized intractability results improving the current understanding of the problem under the framework of parameterized complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6539\u8fdb\u80be\u810f\u4ea4\u6362\u95ee\u9898\u7684FPT\u7b97\u6cd5\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u8def\u5f84\u5bbd\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e0b\u7684W[1]-\u96be\u89e3\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u80be\u810f\u4ea4\u6362\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u662fNP\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u514b\u670d\u8ba1\u7b97\u969c\u788d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u590d\u6742\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027FPT\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8def\u5f84\u5bbd\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e0b\u7684W[1]-\u96be\u89e3\u6027\u8bc1\u660e\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aO*((4e)^t)\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027FPT\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8def\u5f84\u5bbd\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e0b\u7684W[1]-\u96be\u89e3\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u80be\u810f\u4ea4\u6362\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027FPT\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4eceO*(14^t)\u964d\u81f3O*((4e)^t)\u2248O*(10.88^t)\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u8def\u5f84\u5bbd\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e0b\u662fW[1]-\u96be\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5176\u4ed6\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u96be\u89e3\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we introduce DreamTacVLA, a framework that grounds VLA models in contact physics by learning to feel the future. Our model adopts a hierarchical perception scheme in which high-resolution tactile images serve as micro-vision inputs coupled with wrist-camera local vision and third-person macro vision. To reconcile these multi-scale sensory streams, we first train a unified policy with a Hierarchical Spatial Alignment (HSA) loss that aligns tactile tokens with their spatial counterparts in the wrist and third-person views. To further deepen the model's understanding of fine-grained contact dynamics, we finetune the system with a tactile world model that predicts future tactile signals. To mitigate tactile data scarcity and the wear-prone nature of tactile sensors, we construct a hybrid large-scale dataset sourced from both high-fidelity digital twin and real-world experiments. By anticipating upcoming tactile states, DreamTacVLA acquires a rich model of contact physics and conditions its actions on both real observations and imagined consequences. Across contact-rich manipulation tasks, it outperforms state-of-the-art VLA baselines, achieving up to 95% success, highlighting the importance of understanding physical contact for robust, touch-aware robotic agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "DreamTacVLA\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u89e6\u89c9\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u529b\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u6ed1\u52a8\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89e6\u89c9\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u624b\u8155\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u5c40\u90e8\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u7b2c\u4e09\u4eba\u79f0\u5b8f\u89c2\u89c6\u89c9\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Hierarchical Spatial Alignment (HSA)\u635f\u5931\u548c\u89e6\u89c9\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cDreamTacVLA\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe95%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709VLA\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "DreamTacVLA\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u89e6\u89c9\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u7269\u7406\u63a5\u89e6\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

A key drill, Enter and Clear the Room (ECR), demands threat assessment, coordination, and securing confined spaces. The military uses Synthetic Training Environments that offer scalable, controlled settings for repeated exercises. However, automatic performance assessment remains challenging, particularly when aiming for objective evaluation of cognitive, psychomotor, and teamwork skills. Traditional methods often rely on costly, intrusive sensors or subjective human observation, limiting scalability and accuracy. This paper introduces a video-based assessment pipeline that derives performance analytics from training videos without requiring additional hardware. By utilizing computer vision models, the system extracts 2D skeletons, gaze vectors, and movement trajectories. From these data, we develop task-specific metrics that measure psychomotor fluency, situational awareness, and team coordination. These metrics feed into an extended Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) hierarchy, which employs a weighted combination to generate overall performance scores for teamwork and cognition. We demonstrate the approach with a case study of real-world ECR drills, providing actionable, domain specific metrics that capture individual and team performance. We also discuss how these insights can support After Action Reviews with interactive dashboards within Gamemaster and the Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), providing intuitive and understandable feedback.

Limited cache capacity of routers warrants that the choice of content being cached is judiciously done. Existing techniques resort to caching popular content to maximize utilization. However, these methods experience significant overhead for coordinating and estimating the popularity of content. To address this issue, in this paper, we present CPePC, which is a cooperative caching technique designed to improve performance. It accomplishes this through a combination of two factors. First, CPePC enhances efficiency by minimizing the overhead of popularity estimation. Second, it forecasts a parameter that governs caching decisions. Efficiency in popularity estimation is achieved by dividing the network into several non-overlapping communities using a community estimation algorithm and selecting a leader node to coordinate this on behalf of all the nodes in the community.

DEFT introduces a mathematically grounded reparameterization that aligns the expected continuous objective with discrete fault-detection semantics, enabling reliable gradient-based pattern generation. To ensure scalability and stability on deep circuit graphs, DEFT integrates a custom CUDA kernel for efficient forward-backward propagation and applies gradient normalization to mitigate vanishing gradients. Compared to a leading commercial tool on two industrial benchmarks, DEFT improves HTD fault detection by 21.1% and 48.9% on average under the same pattern budget and comparable runtime. DEFT also supports practical ATPG settings such as partial assignment pattern generation, producing patterns with 19.3% fewer 0/1 bits while still detecting 35% more faults.

However, the efficiency of FL in wireless networks is limited not only by constraints on communication and computational resources but also by significant data heterogeneity among clients, particularly in large-scale networks. This paper first presents a theoretical analysis of the impact of client data heterogeneity on global model generalization error, which can result in repeated training cycles, increased energy consumption, and prolonged latency. Based on the theoretical insights, an optimization problem is formulated to jointly minimize learning latency and energy consumption while constraining generalization error. A joint client selection and resource allocation (CSRA) approach is then proposed, employing a series of convex optimization and relaxation techniques.

The problem, together with its edge-based variant, is one of the most basic in graph theory and algorithms, and has been studied extensively. The fastest currently known algorithm for directed global minimum vertex-cut (Henzinger, Rao and Gabow, FOCS 1996 and J. Algorithms 2000) has running time $\\tilde{O}(mn)$, where $m$ and $n$ denote the number of edges and vertices in the input graph, respectively. A long line of work over the past decades led to faster algorithms for other main versions of the problem, including the undirected edge-based setting (Karger, STOC 1996 and J. ACM 2000), directed edge-based setting (Cen et al., FOCS 2021), and undirected vertex-based setting (Chuzhoy and Trabelsi, STOC 2025). However, for the vertex-based version in directed graphs, the 29 year-old $\\tilde{O}(mn)$-time algorithm of Henzinger, Rao and Gabow remains the state of the art to this day, in all edge-density regimes.

Although laser LiDAR offers the advantage of a wide field of view, its application in UAV exploration still faces several challenges. The observation quality of LiDAR point clouds is generally inferior to that of depth cameras. Traditional frontier methods based on known and unknown regions impose a heavy computational burden, especially when handling the wide field of view of LiDAR. In addition, regions without point cloud are also difficult to classify as free space through raycasting. To address these problems, the SHIELD is proposed. It maintains an observation-quality occupancy map and performs ray-casting on this map to address the issue of inconsistent point-cloud quality during exploration. A hybrid frontier method is used to tackle both the computational burden and the limitations of point-cloud quality exploration. In addition, an outward spherical-projection ray-casting strategy is proposed to jointly ensure flight safety and exploration efficiency in open areas.

However, learned semantic representations can still leak sensitive information to unintended receivers (eavesdroppers). This paper presents a deep learning-based semantic communication framework that jointly supports multiple receiver tasks while explicitly limiting semantic leakage to an eavesdropper. The legitimate link employs a learned encoder at the transmitter, while the receiver trains decoders for semantic inference and data reconstruction. The security problem is formulated via an iterative min-max optimization in which an eavesdropper is trained to improve its semantic inference, while the legitimate transmitter-receiver pair is trained to preserve task performance while reducing the eavesdropper's success. We also introduce an auxiliary layer that superimposes a cooperative, adversarially crafted perturbation on the transmitted waveform to degrade semantic leakage to an eavesdropper. Performance is evaluated over Rayleigh fading channels with additive white Gaussian noise using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

Open-vocabulary visual effects generation from text inputs emerges as a promising solution that can unlock immense creative potential.

In contrast, PhysTalk takes a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene as input and translates arbitrary user prompts into real time, physics based, interactive 4D animations. A large language model (LLM) generates executable code that directly modifies 3DGS parameters through lightweight proxies and particle dynamics. Notably, PhysTalk is the first framework to couple 3DGS directly with a physics simulator without relying on time consuming mesh extraction. While remaining open vocabulary, this design enables interactive 3D Gaussian animation via collision aware, physics based manipulation of arbitrary, multi material objects.

However, long-context inference remains a significant challenge due to the substantial memory requirements of the key-value (KV) cache, which can scale to several gigabytes as sequence length and batch size increase. In this paper, we present \\textbf{PackKV}, a generic and efficient KV cache management framework optimized for long-context generation. %, which synergistically supports both latency-critical and throughput-critical inference scenarios. PackKV introduces novel lossy compression techniques specifically tailored to the characteristics of KV cache data, featuring a careful co-design of compression algorithms and system architecture. Our approach is compatible with the dynamically growing nature of the KV cache while preserving high computational efficiency. Experimental results show that, under the same and minimum accuracy drop as state-of-the-art quantization methods, PackKV achieves, on average, \\textbf{153.2}\\% higher memory reduction rate for the K cache and \\textbf{179.6}\\% for the V cache. Furthermore, PackKV delivers extremely high execution throughput, effectively eliminating decompression overhead and accelerating the matrix-vector multiplication operation.

Given $n$ agents partitioned into $m$ groups (\\eg, demographic quotas), the goal is to aggregate their preferences to form a committee of size $k$ that guarantees minimum representation from each group while minimizing the maximum \\emph{cost} incurred by any agent. We model this setting as the ordinal fair $k$-center problem, where agents are embedded in an unknown metric space, and each agent reports a complete preference ranking (i.e., ordinal information) over all agents, consistent with the underlying distance metric (i.e., cardinal information). The cost incurred by an agent with respect to a committee is defined as its distance to the closest committee member. The quality of an algorithm is evaluated using the notion of distortion, which measures the worst-case ratio between the cost of the committee produced by the algorithm and the cost of an optimal committee, when given complete access to the underlying metric space.\n  When cardinal information is not available, no constant distortion is possible for the ordinal $k$-center problem, even without fairness constraints, when $k\\geq 3$ [Burkhardt et.al., AAAI'24].

We formalize this dual-agency structure as a User-Robot-Operator triad in an autonomous remote-control setting that combines autonomous execution with remote human support. Prior to the recent surge of language-based and multimodal interfaces, we developed and evaluated an early-stage prototype in 2020 that combined natural-language text chat with freehand sketch annotations over the robot's live camera view to support remote intervention. We evaluated three modes - autonomous, remote, and hybrid - in controlled fetch-and-carry tasks using a domestic mobile manipulator (HSR) on a World Robot Summit 2020 rule-compliant test field. The results show systematic mode-dependent differences in user-rated affinity and additional insights on perceived security, indicating that switching or blending agency within one robot measurably shapes human impressions.

However, the reliance on annotated 3D data collected in controlled environments poses challenges for generalization to diverse in-the-wild scenarios. Existing domain adaptation (DA) paradigms like general DA and source-free DA for 3D HPE overlook the issues of non-stationary target pose datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel task named lifelong domain adaptive 3D HPE. To our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the lifelong domain adaptation to the 3D HPE task. In this lifelong DA setting, the pose estimator is pretrained on the source domain and subsequently adapted to distinct target domains. Moreover, during adaptation to the current target domain, the pose estimator cannot access the source and all the previous target domains. The lifelong DA for 3D HPE involves overcoming challenges in adapting to current domain poses and preserving knowledge from previous domains, particularly combating catastrophic forgetting. We present an innovative Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, which incorporates 3D pose generators, a 2D pose discriminator, and a 3D pose estimator. This framework effectively mitigates domain shifts and aligns original and augmented poses. Moreover, we construct a novel 3D pose generator paradigm, integrating pose-aware, temporal-aware, and domain-aware knowledge to enhance the current domain's adaptation and alleviate catastrophic forgetting on previous domains. Our method demonstrates superior performance through extensive experiments on diverse domain adaptive 3D HPE datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7ec8\u8eab\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e943D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1GAN\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u611f\u77e5\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u57283D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u76ee\u6807\u59ff\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec8\u8eab\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e943D HPE\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9002\u5e94\u5f53\u524d\u9886\u57df\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u4fdd\u7559\u5148\u524d\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GAN\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b3D\u59ff\u6001\u751f\u6210\u5668\u30012D\u59ff\u6001\u5224\u522b\u5668\u548c3D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u59ff\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u9886\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5f53\u524d\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u5e76\u51cf\u8f7b\u5bf9\u5148\u524d\u9886\u57df\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e943D HPE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u7ec8\u8eab\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e943D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u7684GAN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u54083D\u59ff\u6001\u751f\u6210\u5668\u30012D\u59ff\u6001\u5224\u522b\u5668\u548c3D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u539f\u59cb\u4e0e\u589e\u5f3a\u59ff\u6001\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e943D HPE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

We present SPARK (Search Personalization via Agent-Driven Retrieval and Knowledge-sharing), a framework in which coordinated persona-based large language model (LLM) agents deliver task-specific retrieval and emergent personalization. SPARK formalizes a persona space defined by role, expertise, task context, and domain, and introduces a Persona Coordinator that dynamically interprets incoming queries to activate the most relevant specialized agents. Each agent executes an independent retrieval-augmented generation process, supported by dedicated long- and short-term memory stores and context-aware reasoning modules. Inter-agent collaboration is facilitated through structured communication protocols, including shared memory repositories, iterative debate, and relay-style knowledge transfer. Drawing on principles from cognitive architectures, multi-agent coordination theory, and information retrieval, SPARK models how emergent personalization properties arise from distributed agent behaviors governed by minimal coordination rules. The framework yields testable predictions regarding coordination efficiency, personalization quality, and cognitive load distribution, while incorporating adaptive learning mechanisms for continuous persona refinement. By integrating fine-grained agent specialization with cooperative retrieval, SPARK provides insights for next-generation search systems capable of capturing the complexity, fluidity, and context sensitivity of human information-seeking behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPARK\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u89d2\u8272\u7684LLM\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u65b0\u5174\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u641c\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u4fe1\u606f\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u6216\u5355\u4e00\u68c0\u7d22\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "SPARK\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u8272\u3001\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u9886\u57df\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u89d2\u8272\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u89d2\u8272\u534f\u8c03\u5668\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u89e3\u91ca\u4f20\u5165\u67e5\u8be2\u4ee5\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u4ee3\u7406\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u6267\u884c\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e13\u7528\u7684\u957f\u671f\u548c\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5b58\u50a8\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u3002\u4ee3\u7406\u95f4\u534f\u4f5c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u8bae\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "SPARK\u6846\u67b6\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u534f\u8c03\u6548\u7387\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "SPARK\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u641c\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u4fe1\u606f\u5bfb\u6c42\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002"}}

Conventional intent-based networking (IBN) methods depend on statistical language models to interpret user intent but cannot guarantee the feasibility of generated configurations. To overcome this, we develop a two-stage framework consisting of an Interpreter, which extracts intent from natural language prompts using NLP, and an Optimizer, which computes feasible virtual machine (VM) placement and routing via an integer linear programming. In particular, the Interpreter translates user chats into update directions, i.e., whether to increase, decrease, or maintain parameters such as CPU demand and latency bounds, thereby enabling iterative refinement of the network configuration. In this paper, two intent extractors, which are a Sentence-BERT model with support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and a large language model (LLM), are introduced. Experiments in single-user and multi-user settings show that the framework dynamically updates VM placement and routing while preserving feasibility. The LLM-based extractor achieves higher accuracy with fewer labeled samples, whereas the Sentence-BERT with SVM classifiers provides significantly lower latency suitable for real-time operation. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining NLP-driven intent extraction with optimization-based allocation for safe, interpretable, and user-friendly virtual network management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408NLP\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u865a\u62df\u7f51\u7edc\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u89e3\u91ca\u5668+\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u7528\u6237\u53cb\u597d\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u914d\u7f6e\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\uff08IBN\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u751f\u6210\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f7f\u7528NLP\u63d0\u53d6\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u548c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u7f16\u7a0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884cVM\u653e\u7f6e\u548c\u8def\u7531\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0VM\u653e\u7f6e\u548c\u8def\u7531\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0cLLM\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u5728\u8f83\u5c11\u6807\u8bb0\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u800cSentence-BERT\u4e0eSVM\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408NLP\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u865a\u62df\u7f51\u7edc\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u7528\u6237\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This removes the need for training with clean target images, which can be difficult to obtain. However, Noise2Noise training has a major limitation: nonlinear functions applied to the noisy targets will skew the results. This bias occurs because the nonlinearity makes the expected value of the noisy targets different from the clean target image. Since nonlinear functions are common in image processing, avoiding them limits the types of preprocessing that can be performed on the noisy targets. Our main insight is that certain nonlinear functions can be applied to the noisy targets without adding significant bias to the results. We develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the effects of these nonlinearities, and describe a class of nonlinear functions with minimal bias.\n  We demonstrate our method on the denoising of high dynamic range (HDR) images produced by Monte Carlo rendering. Noise2Noise training can have trouble with HDR images, where the training process is overwhelmed by outliers and performs poorly. We consider a commonly used method of addressing these training issues: applying a nonlinear tone mapping function to the model output and target images to reduce their dynamic range. This method was previously thought to be incompatible with Noise2Noise training because of the nonlinearities involved. We show that certain combinations of loss functions and tone mapping functions can reduce the effect of outliers while introducing minimal bias.

A system violates individual fairness if there exists a pair of inputs differing only in protected attributes (such as race or gender) that lead to significantly different outcomes-for example, one favorable and the other unfavorable. While this notion highlights isolated instances of unfairness, it fails to capture broader patterns of systematic or clustered discrimination that may affect entire subgroups. We introduce and motivate the concept of discrimination clustering, a generalization of individual fairness violations. Rather than detecting single counterfactual disparities, we seek to uncover regions of the input space where small perturbations in protected features lead to k-significantly distinct clusters of outcomes. That is, for a given input, we identify a local neighborhood-differing only in protected attributes-whose members' outputs separate into many distinct clusters. These clusters reveal significant arbitrariness in treatment solely based on protected attributes that help expose patterns of algorithmic bias that elude pairwise fairness checks. We present HyFair, a hybrid technique that combines formal symbolic analysis (via SMT and MILP solvers) to certify individual fairness with randomized search to discover discriminatory clusters. This combination enables both formal guarantees-when no counterexamples exist-and the detection of severe violations that are computationally challenging for symbolic methods alone.

With 3D parallelism (tensor, pipeline, data), checkpointing involves many processes, each managing numerous tensors of varying shapes and sizes, that must be persisted frequently to stable storage (e.g., parallel file systems). This turns checkpoint/restore into a big-data I/O problem characterized by volume, variety, and velocity. The workflow must traverse the full storage stack -- from GPU memory through host memory and local storage to external repositories -- whose tiers differ by orders of magnitude in performance, creating bottlenecks under concurrency even with asynchronous flush/prefetch. Kernel-accelerated I/O libraries such as \\texttt{liburing} may mitigate these issues versus POSIX, but their effectiveness for LLM checkpointing remains underexplored. We develop microbenchmarks to quantify trade-offs when using \\texttt{liburing}, evaluating how aggregation, alignment, and I/O coalescing interact under buffered and direct I/O. We find that uncoalesced small-buffer operations halve throughput relative to synthetic workloads, while file system-aware aggregation restores bandwidth and reduces metadata overhead. Compared to state-of-the-art LLM checkpointing engines, our approach achieves up to $3.9\\times$ higher write throughput than DataStates-LLM and $7.6\\times$ higher than TorchSnapshot.

Computed tomography (CT) is widely used to evaluate cranial and sutural deformities; however, its ionizing radiation is contraindicated in children without significant abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers radiation free scans with superior soft tissue contrast, but unlike CT, MRI cannot elucidate cranial sutures, estimate skull bone density, or assess cranial vault growth. This study proposes a deep learning driven pipeline for transforming T1 weighted MRIs of children aged 0.2 to 2 years into synthetic CTs (sCTs), predicting detailed cranial bone segmentation, generating suture probability heatmaps, and deriving direct suture segmentation from the heatmaps. With our in-house pediatric data, sCTs achieved 99% structural similarity and a Frechet inception distance of 1.01 relative to real CTs. Skull segmentation attained an average Dice coefficient of 85% across seven cranial bones, and sutures achieved 80% Dice. Equivalence of skull and suture segmentation between sCTs and real CTs was confirmed using two one sided tests (TOST p < 0.05). To our knowledge, this is the first pediatric cranial CT synthesis framework to enable suture segmentation on sCTs derived from MRI, despite MRI's limited depiction of bone and sutures. By combining robust, domain specific variational autoencoders, our method generates perceptually indistinguishable cranial sCTs from routine pediatric MRIs, bridging critical gaps in non invasive cranial evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u513f\u7ae5MRI\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5408\u6210CT\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u9885\u9aa8\u548c\u7f1d\u5408\u7ebf\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u4e3a\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u9885\u9aa8\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5316\u513f\u79d1\u9885\u9aa8\u53d1\u80b2\u548c\u7f1d\u5408\u7ebf\u9aa8\u5316\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u751f\u957f\u76f8\u5173\u9885\u9aa8\u75be\u75c5\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002MRI\u65e0\u8f90\u5c04\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u6e05\u6670\u663e\u793a\u9885\u9aa8\u7f1d\u5408\u7ebf\u6216\u8bc4\u4f30\u9885\u9aa8\u751f\u957f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4ece\u5e38\u89c4\u513f\u79d1MRI\u751f\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u4e0a\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u7684\u9885\u9aa8sCT\u3002", "result": "sCT\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9eCT\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8fbe\u523099%\uff0cFrechet\u8d77\u59cb\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e3a1.01\u3002\u9885\u9aa8\u5206\u5272\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u9885\u9aa8\u4e0a\u7684\u5e73\u5747Dice\u7cfb\u6570\u4e3a85%\uff0c\u7f1d\u5408\u7ebfDice\u7cfb\u6570\u4e3a80%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u513f\u7ae5T1\u52a0\u6743MRI\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5408\u6210CT\uff08sCT\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9885\u9aa8\u5206\u5272\u3001\u7f1d\u5408\u7ebf\u6982\u7387\u70ed\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u53ca\u76f4\u63a5\u7f1d\u5408\u7ebf\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u9885\u9aa8\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

In real-world software engineering, however, such curated datasets are rarely available during the initial cold start of agent development, where engineers instead face messy production logs and evolving failure modes. We present ROAD (Reflective Optimization via Automated Debugging), a novel framework that bypasses the need for refined datasets by treating optimization as a dynamic debugging investigation rather than a stochastic search. Unlike traditional mutation strategies, ROAD utilizes a specialized multi-agent architecture, comprising an Analyzer for root-cause analysis, an Optimizer for pattern aggregation, and a Coach for strategy integration, to convert unstructured failure logs into robust, structured Decision Tree Protocols. We evaluated ROAD across both a standardized academic benchmark and a live production Knowledge Management engine. Experimental results demonstrate that ROAD is highly sample-efficient, achieving a 5.6 percent increase in success rate (73.6 percent to 79.2 percent) and a 3.8 percent increase in search accuracy within just three automated iterations. Furthermore, on complex reasoning tasks in the retail domain, ROAD improved agent performance by approximately 19 percent relative to the baseline. These findings suggest that mimicking the human engineering loop of failure analysis and patching offers a viable, data-efficient alternative to resource-intensive RL training for deploying reliable LLM agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "ROAD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u7cbe\u7ec6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8bd5\u63d0\u5347LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u4ee3\u7406\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u9636\u6bb5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cbe\u5fc3\u7b56\u5212\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u800cROAD\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8bd5\u8c03\u67e5\u800c\u975e\u968f\u673a\u641c\u7d22\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "ROAD\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u6790\u5668\uff08Analyzer\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff08Optimizer\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u5f0f\u805a\u5408\u548c\u6559\u7ec3\uff08Coach\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u5c06\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6545\u969c\u65e5\u5fd7\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cROAD\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5b66\u672f\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u751f\u4ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ba1\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e865.6%\u548c3.8%\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u96f6\u552e\u9886\u57df\u7684\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ea619%\u3002", "conclusion": "ROAD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u7684\u6545\u969c\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u4e3a\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u9760\u7684LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u8d44\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Based on this architecture, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) to minimize the task completion delay and energy consumption by jointly optimizing task offloading, UAV trajectory control, IRS phase-shift configuration, and computation resource allocation. The considered problem is NP-hard, and thus we propose a hierarchical online optimization approach (HOOA) to efficiently solve the problem. Specifically, we reformulate the MOOP as a Stackelberg game, where MEC servers collectively act as the leader to determine the system-level decisions, while the vehicles act as followers to make individual decisions. At the follower level, we present a many-to-one matching mechanism to generate feasible discrete decisions. At the leader level, we propose a generative diffusion model-enhanced twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (GDMTD3) algorithm integrated with a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)-based method, which is a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach, to determine the continuous decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed HOOA achieves significant improvements, which reduces average task completion delay by 2.5% and average energy consumption by 3.1% compared with the best-performing benchmark approach and state-of-the-art DRL algorithm, respectively. Moreover, the proposed HOOA exhibits superior convergence stability while maintaining strong robustness and scalability in dynamic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6df7\u5408IRS\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u5728\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u7684MEC\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u7a7a\u591a\u63a5\u5165\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08MEC\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u963b\u585e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u90e8\u7f72\u6df7\u5408\u667a\u80fd\u53cd\u5c04\u9762\uff08IRS\uff09\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u5730\u8fde\u63a5\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u5728\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08HOOA\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff08MOOP\uff09\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3aStackelberg\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3a\u7684TD3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08GDMTD3\uff09\u548cKKT\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3NP\u96be\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHOOA\u5728\u5e73\u5747\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u80fd\u8017\u65b9\u9762\u5206\u522b\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684DRL\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e862.5%\u548c3.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684HOOA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6536\u655b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

This shift increases embedded systems' complexity and strains testing capacity. Despite relevant standards, a coherent system-testing methodology that spans heterogeneous, legacy-constrained toolchains remains elusive, and practice often depends on individual expertise rather than a systematic strategy. We derive challenges and requirements from a systematic literature review (SLR), complemented by industry experience and practice. We map them to test case specification techniques and testing tools, evaluating their suitability for automotive testing using PRISMA. Our contribution is a curated catalog that supports technique/tool selection and can inform future testing frameworks and improvements. We synthesize nine recurring challenge areas across the life cycle, such as requirements quality and traceability, variability management, and toolchain fragmentation. We then provide a prioritized criteria catalog that recommends model-based planning, interoperable and traceable toolchains, requirements uplift, pragmatic automation and virtualization, targeted AI and formal methods, actionable metrics, and lightweight organizational practices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u548c\u884c\u4e1a\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u6c7d\u8f66\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6280\u672f\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u76ee\u5f55\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u788e\u7247\u5316\u7b49\u4e5d\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u8350\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u7b49\u4f18\u5148\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c7d\u8f66\u9886\u57df\u6b63\u8f6c\u5411\u4ee5\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u6cd5\u89c4\u3001\u5e02\u573a\u538b\u529b\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u8fd9\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5e76\u8003\u9a8c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6709\u76f8\u5173\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4f46\u8de8\u5f02\u6784\u3001\u53d7\u9057\u7559\u7cfb\u7edf\u9650\u5236\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u7136\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u8df5\u5f80\u5f80\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e2a\u4eba\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u800c\u975e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\uff08SLR\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u884c\u4e1a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u53d6\u4e86\u6311\u6218\u548c\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u89c4\u8303\u6280\u672f\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528PRISMA\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u6c7d\u8f66\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u7efc\u5408\u4e86\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u7684\u4e5d\u4e2a\u5e38\u89c1\u6311\u6218\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5982\u9700\u6c42\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u53d8\u6027\u7ba1\u7406\u4ee5\u53ca\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u788e\u7247\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f18\u5148\u6807\u51c6\u76ee\u5f55\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u53ef\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u3001\u9700\u6c42\u63d0\u5347\u3001\u52a1\u5b9e\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u865a\u62df\u5316\u3001\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684AI\u548c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6307\u6807\u4ee5\u53ca\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ecf\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u7b56\u5212\u7684\u76ee\u5f55\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6280\u672f/\u5de5\u5177\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

The key reason lies in the excessive computation involved in optimizing both the lower- and upper-level functions. Thus, we present the first resource-adaptive distributed bilevel optimization framework with a second-order free hypergradient estimator, which allows each client to optimize the submodels adapted to the available resources. Due to the coupled influence of partial outer parameters x and inner parameters y, it's challenging to theoretically analyze the upper bound regarding the globally averaged hypergradient for full model parameters. The error bound of inner parameter also needs to be reformulated since the local partial training. The provable theorems show that both RABO and RAFBO can achieve an asymptotically optimal convergence rate of $O(1/\\sqrt{C_x^{\\ast}Q})$, which is dominated by the minimum coverage of the outer parameter $C_x^{\\ast}$.

The goal is to determine a job processing permutation for each day, aiming to minimize the maximum total completion time experienced by any client. This problem is known to be NP-hard for quite restrictive settings, with previous work offering exact solution methods for highly-structured special cases.\n  In this paper, we focus on the design of approximation algorithms with provable performance guarantees. Our main contributions can be briefly summarized as follows:\n  (i) When job processing times are day-dependent, we devise a polynomial-time LP-based $2$-approximation, as well as a polynomial-time approximation scheme for a constant number of days.\n  (ii) With day-invariant processing times, we obtain a surprisingly simple $(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2}+\u03b5)$-approximation in polynomial time. This setting is also shown to admit a quasi-polynomial-time approximation scheme for an arbitrary number of days.\n  The key technical component driving our approximation schemes is a novel batching technique, where jobs are conceptually grouped into batches, subsequently leading either to a low-dimensional dynamic program or to a compact configuration LP. Concurrently, while developing our constant-factor approximations, we propose a host of lower-bounding mechanisms that may be of broader interest.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u516c\u5e73\u91cd\u590d\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ecLP\u57fa\u7840\u76842-\u8fd1\u4f3c\u548c\u62df\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86NP-hard\u96be\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u516c\u5e73\u91cd\u590d\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684NP-hard\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7279\u4f8b\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86LP\uff08\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\uff09\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4f5c\u4e1a\u5206\u7ec4\u4e3a\u6279\u6b21\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u7ef4\u52a8\u6001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6216\u7d27\u51d1\u914d\u7f6eLP\u3002", "result": "1. \u5f53\u65e5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u65f6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4LP\u57fa\u7840\u76842-\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u9488\u5bf9\u56fa\u5b9a\u5929\u6570\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848\u30022. \u5f53\u65e5\u4e0d\u53d8\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86(1+\u221a2)/2+\u03b5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u62df\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u516c\u5e73\u91cd\u590d\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4LP\u57fa\u7840\u76842-\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9488\u5bf9\u5929\u6570\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684(1+\u221a2)/2+\u03b5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u5929\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u62df\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) improve semantic generalization, insufficient embodied reasoning leads to brittle behavior, and conversely, strong reasoning alone is inadequate without precise control. To provide a decoupled and quantitative assessment of this bottleneck, we introduce Embodied Reasoning Intelligence Quotient (ERIQ), a large-scale embodied reasoning benchmark in robotic manipulation, comprising 6K+ question-answer pairs across four reasoning dimensions. By decoupling reasoning from execution, ERIQ enables systematic evaluation and reveals a strong positive correlation between embodied reasoning capability and end-to-end VLA generalization. To bridge the gap from reasoning to precise execution, we propose FACT, a flow-matching-based action tokenizer that converts continuous control into discrete sequences while preserving high-fidelity trajectory reconstruction. The resulting GenieReasoner jointly optimizes reasoning and action in a unified space, outperforming both continuous-action and prior discrete-action baselines in real-world tasks. Together, ERIQ and FACT provide a principled framework for diagnosing and overcoming the reasoning-precision trade-off, advancing robust, general-purpose robotic manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ERIQ\u57fa\u51c6\u548cFACT\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u8bb0\u5668\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u63a7\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u8fd9\u4e24\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165ERIQ\u57fa\u51c6\u548cFACT\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u8bb0\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u8f68\u8ff9\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "GenieReasoner\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u5148\u524d\u79bb\u6563\u52a8\u4f5c\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u7aef\u5230\u7aefVLA\u6cdb\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f3a\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ERIQ\u548cFACT\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bca\u65ad\u5e76\u514b\u670d\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7cbe\u786e\u6267\u884c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u63a7\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Modern multimodal machine learning (ML) applications, such as generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) systems for image captioning, search, and reasoning, depend on robust, domain-specialized encoders for non-text modalities. In natural-image domains where internet-scale data is plentiful, well-established scaling laws help optimize the joint scaling of model capacity, training compute, and dataset size. Unfortunately, these relationships are much less well-understood in high-value domains like remote sensing (RS). Using over a quadrillion pixels of commercial satellite EO data and the MITRE Federal AI Sandbox, we train progressively larger vision transformer (ViT) backbones, report success and failure modes observed at petascale, and analyze implications for bridging domain gaps across additional RS modalities.

Existing methods often struggle with premature convergence and inefficient exploration in high-dimensional code spaces.

Unlike \"blind\" mutation operators, LoongFlow integrates LLMs into a cognitive \"Plan-Execute-Summarize\" (PES) paradigm, effectively mapping the evolutionary search to a reasoning-heavy process. To sustain long-term architectural coherence, we incorporate a hybrid evolutionary memory system. By synergizing Multi-Island models with MAP-Elites and adaptive Boltzmann selection, this system theoretically balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off, maintaining diverse behavioral niches to prevent optimization stagnation. We instantiate LoongFlow with a General Agent for algorithmic discovery and an ML Agent for pipeline optimization. Extensive evaluations on the AlphaEvolve benchmark and Kaggle competitions demonstrate that LoongFlow outperforms leading baselines (e.g., OpenEvolve, ShinkaEvolve) by up to 60% in evolutionary efficiency while discovering superior solutions.

While several guidelines have been proposed to address fairness, achieving a comprehensive understanding of research solutions for ensuring fairness in software systems remains challenging. Objectives: This paper presents a systematic literature mapping to explore and categorize current advancements in fairness solutions within software engineering, focusing on three key dimensions: research trends, research focus, and viability in industrial contexts. Methods: We develop a classification framework to organize research on software fairness from a fresh perspective, applying it to 95 selected studies and analyzing their potential for industrial adoption. Results: Our findings reveal that software fairness research is expanding, yet it remains heavily focused on methods and algorithms. It primarily focuses on post-processing and group fairness, with less emphasis on early-stage interventions, individual fairness metrics, and understanding bias root causes. Additionally fairness research remains largely academic, with limited industry collaboration and low to medium Technology Readiness Level (TRL), indicating that industrial transferability remains distant. Conclusion: Our results underscore the need to incorporate fairness considerations across all stages of the software development life-cycle and to foster greater collaboration between academia and industry.

However, existing resource management approaches remain largely reactive and cluster-centric, limiting their ability to optimize system-wide behavior under dynamic workloads. These limitations result in inefficient resource utilization, delayed adaptation, and increased operational overhead across distributed environments. This paper presents an AI-driven framework for adaptive resource optimization in multi-cluster cloud systems. The proposed approach integrates predictive learning, policy-aware decision-making, and continuous feedback to enable proactive and coordinated resource management across clusters. By analyzing cross-cluster telemetry and historical execution patterns, the framework dynamically adjusts resource allocation to balance performance, cost, and reliability objectives. A prototype implementation demonstrates improved resource efficiency, faster stabilization during workload fluctuations, and reduced performance variability compared to conventional reactive approaches. The results highlight the effectiveness of intelligent, self-adaptive infrastructure management as a key enabler for scalable and resilient cloud platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8d44\u6e90\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4e91\u96c6\u7fa4\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u63d0\u5347\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u548c\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u8303\u56f4\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u5f00\u9500\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u611f\u77e5\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8de8\u96c6\u7fa4\u9065\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u539f\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u52a0\u5feb\u4e86\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6ce2\u52a8\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u6ce2\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684AI\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u4e91\u96c6\u7fa4\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u5f39\u6027\u7684\u4e91\u5e73\u53f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

In this model, vertices represent agents and undirected edges represent goods; edges have to be oriented towards one of their endpoints, i.e., allocated to one of their adjacent agents. Although EFX orientations (envy-free up to any good) have been extensively studied in this setting, EF orientations (envy-free) remain unexplored. In this work, we initiate their study, mostly under the lens of parameterized complexity, presenting various tractable cases, hardness results, and parameterizations. Our results concern both simple graphs and multigraphs. Interestingly, many of our results transfer to EFX orientations, thus complementing and improving upon previous work; notably, we answer an open question regarding the structural parameterized complexity of the latter problem on graphs of polynomially-bounded valuations. We also show that EF orientations are tractable in cases in which EFX orientations are not, particularly for binary valuations. Lastly, we consider charity in the orientation setting, establishing algorithms for finding the minimum amount of edges that have to be removed from a graph in order for EF(X) orientations to exist.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684EF\u5b9a\u5411\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u590d\u6742\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86EFX\u5b9a\u5411\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5728\u4e8c\u5143\u4f30\u503c\u7b49\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cEF\u5b9a\u5411\u6bd4EFX\u5b9a\u5411\u66f4\u6613\u5904\u7406\u3002\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6148\u5584\u5b9a\u5411\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u586b\u8865EF\u5b9a\u5411\uff08\u65e0\u5ac9\u5992\u5b9a\u5411\uff09\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u5b9a\u5411\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728EFX\u5b9a\u5411\uff08\u65e0\u5ac9\u5992\u81f3\u4efb\u4f55\u7269\u54c1\u5b9a\u5411\uff09\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\u4f46EF\u5b9a\u5411\u5c1a\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u590d\u6742\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u56fe\u548c\u591a\u91cd\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684EF\u5b9a\u5411\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5404\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u60c5\u51b5\u3001\u56f0\u96be\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86EF\u5b9a\u5411\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5728\u4e8c\u5143\u4f30\u503c\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86EFX\u5b9a\u5411\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u4f30\u503c\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6148\u5584\u5b9a\u5411\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u5b9a\u5411\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u5173\u4e8eEFX\u5b9a\u5411\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u4f30\u503c\u56fe\u4e0a\u56de\u7b54\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86EF\u5b9a\u5411\u5728EFX\u5b9a\u5411\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u4e8c\u5143\u4f30\u503c\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6148\u5584\u5b9a\u5411\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Moreover, even if all vehicles on the road were autonomous, pedestrians would still be crossing the streets. We propose social robots as moderators between autonomous vehicles and vulnerable road users (VRU). To this end, we identify four enablers requiring integration: (1) advanced perception, allowing the robot to see the environment; (2) vehicular communications allowing connected vehicles to share intentions and the robot to send guiding commands; (3) social human-robot interaction allowing the robot to effectively communicate with VRUs and drivers; (4) formal specification allowing the robot to understand traffic and plan accordingly. This paper presents an overview of the key enablers and report on a first proof-of-concept integration of the first three enablers envisioning a social robot advising pedestrians in scenarios with a cooperative automated e-bike.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u793e\u4ea4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u4e0e\u884c\u4eba\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8c03\u89e3\u8005\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u5b9e\u73b0\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u521d\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u524d\u4e09\u4e2a\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u4ea4\u901a\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u4e0e\u884c\u4eba\u7b49\u5f31\u52bf\u9053\u8def\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u63a8\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u9ad8\u7ea7\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u8f66\u8f86\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u793e\u4ea4\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u5f62\u5f0f\u89c4\u8303\uff09\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u793e\u4ea4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u8c03\u89e3\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u524d\u4e09\u4e2a\u63a8\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u793e\u4ea4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u4e0e\u534f\u4f5c\u81ea\u52a8\u7535\u52a8\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e3a\u884c\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u5efa\u8bae\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u793e\u4ea4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u4e0e\u5f31\u52bf\u9053\u8def\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\uff08VRU\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8c03\u89e3\u8005\uff0c\u5e76\u6982\u8ff0\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u6240\u9700\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u63a8\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

The framework consists of a clinical task predictor and a skill predictor, which are optimised jointly by refining the two networks simultaneously.

However, they are constrained by several critical challenges, including their inherent \"Black-Box\" characteristics, susceptibility to knowledge hallucination, and limited online learning capacity. These factors compromise their trustworthiness and adaptability. Conversely, cognitive architectures such as Soar offer structured and interpretable reasoning processes, yet their knowledge acquisition is notoriously laborious. To address these complementary challenges, we propose a novel cognitive recommender agent called CogRec which synergizes the strengths of LLMs with the Soar cognitive architecture. CogRec leverages Soar as its core symbolic reasoning engine and leverages an LLM for knowledge initialization to populate its working memory with production rules. The agent operates on a Perception-Cognition-Action(PCA) cycle. Upon encountering an impasse, it dynamically queries the LLM to obtain a reasoned solution. This solution is subsequently transformed into a new symbolic production rule via Soar's chunking mechanism, thereby enabling robust online learning. This learning paradigm allows the agent to continuously evolve its knowledge base and furnish highly interpretable rationales for its recommendations. Extensive evaluations conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that CogRec demonstrates significant advantages in recommendation accuracy, explainability, and its efficacy in addressing the long-tail problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "CogRec\u7ed3\u5408LLMs\u548cSoar\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u89c4\u5219\u8f6c\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728'\u9ed1\u76d2'\u7279\u6027\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800cSoar\u8ba4\u77e5\u67b6\u6784\u867d\u7136\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4f46\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u56f0\u96be\u3002CogRec\u65e8\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "CogRec\u5229\u7528Soar\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u611f\u77e5-\u8ba4\u77e5-\u884c\u52a8\uff08PCA\uff09\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9047\u5230\u969c\u788d\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u67e5\u8be2LLM\u83b7\u53d6\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Soar\u7684\u5206\u5757\u673a\u5236\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u65b0\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cCogRec\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u957f\u5c3e\u95ee\u9898\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "CogRec\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u548cSoar\u8ba4\u77e5\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u5c3e\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Current benchmarks, focused on code correctness, fail to capture the nuanced, interactive behaviors essential for successful human-AI partnership. To bridge this evaluation gap, this paper makes two core contributions. First, we present a foundational taxonomy of desirable agent behaviors for enterprise software engineering, derived from an analysis of 91 sets of user-defined agent rules. This taxonomy defines four key expectations of agent behavior: Adhere to Standards and Processes, Ensure Code Quality and Reliability, Solving Problems Effectively, and Collaborating with the User.\n  Second, recognizing that these expectations are not static, we introduce the Context-Adaptive Behavior (CAB) Framework. This emerging framework reveals how behavioral expectations shift along two empirically-derived axes: the Time Horizon (from immediate needs to future ideals), established through interviews with 15 expert engineers, and the Type of Work (from enterprise production to rapid prototyping, for example), identified through a prompt analysis of a prototyping agent. Together, these contributions offer a human-centered foundation for designing and evaluating the next generation of AI agents, moving the field's focus from the correctness of generated code toward the dynamics of true collaborative intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u548c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u534f\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4eba\u673a\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4ee3\u7801\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4ece\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6f14\u53d8\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5230\u6210\u529f\u4eba\u673a\u5408\u4f5c\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5fae\u5999\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u679091\u7ec4\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f01\u4e1a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7406\u60f3\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u884c\u4e3a\uff08CAB\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u8f74\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\u5de5\u4f5c\uff09\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u884c\u4e3a\u671f\u671b\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u671f\u671b\uff1a\u9075\u5b88\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3001\u786e\u4fdd\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u671f\u671b\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3AI\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5c06\u9886\u57df\u7126\u70b9\u4ece\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u8f6c\u5411\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u3002"}}

However, in clinical practice, multimodal MRI data are often incomplete, making it challenging to fully utilize the available information. Therefore, maximizing the utilization of this incomplete multimodal information presents a crucial research challenge. We present a novel meta-guided multi-modal learning (MGML) framework that comprises two components: meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion and consistency regularization module. The meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion (Meta-AMF) enables the model to effectively integrate information from multiple modalities under varying input conditions. By generating adaptive soft-label supervision signals based on the available modalities, Meta-AMF explicitly promotes more coherent multimodal fusion. In addition, the consistency regularization module enhances segmentation performance and implicitly reinforces the robustness and generalization of the overall framework. Notably, our approach does not alter the original model architecture and can be conveniently integrated into the training pipeline for end-to-end model optimization. We conducted extensive experiments on the public BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets. Compared to multiple state-of-the-art methods from previous years, our method achieved superior performance. On BraTS2020, for the average Dice scores across fifteen missing modality combinations, building upon the baseline, our method obtained scores of 87.55, 79.36, and 62.67 for the whole tumor (WT), the tumor core (TC), and the enhancing tumor (ET), respectively.

ARC-AGI-3 comprises game-like tasks where agents must infer task mechanics through limited interactions, and adapt to increasing complexity as levels progress. Success requires forming hypotheses, testing them, and tracking discovered mechanics. The benchmark has revealed that state-of-the-art LLMs are currently incapable of reliably solving these tasks. Our method combines vision-based frame processing with systematic state-space exploration using graph-structured representations. It segments visual frames into meaningful components, prioritizes actions based on visual salience, and maintains a directed graph of explored states and transitions. By tracking visited states and tested actions, the agent prioritizes actions that provide the shortest path to untested state-action pairs. On the ARC-AGI-3 Preview Challenge, this structured exploration strategy solves a median of 30 out of 52 levels across six games and ranks 3rd on the private leaderboard, substantially outperforming frontier LLM-based agents. These results demonstrate that explicit graph-structured exploration, even without learning, can serve as a strong baseline for interactive reasoning and underscore the importance of systematic state tracking and action prioritization in sparse-feedback environments where current LLMs fail to capture task dynamics.

Over the last decades, machine learning and deep learning models have reported increasing performance across software versions. However, since most files persist across releases and retain their defect labels, standard evaluation rewards label-persistence bias rather than reasoning about code changes. To address this issue, we reformulate SDP as a change-aware prediction task, in which models reason over code changes of a file within successive project versions, rather than relying on static file snapshots. Building on this formulation, we propose an LLM-driven, change-aware, multi-agent debate framework. Our experiments on multiple PROMISE projects show that traditional models achieve inflated F1, while failing on rare but critical defect-transition cases. In contrast, our change-aware reasoning and multi-agent debate framework yields more balanced performance across evolution subsets and significantly improves sensitivity to defect introductions. These results highlight fundamental flaws in current SDP evaluation practices and emphasize the need for change-aware reasoning in practical defect prediction.

To address this, dynamic model size selection (DMSS) is an attractive approach: it is content-aware but treats models as black boxes, and could potentially reduce cost by up to 10x without model retraining or modification. Without ground truth labels at runtime, we observe that DMSS methods use two stages per segment: (i) sampling a few models to calculate prediction statistics (e.g., confidences), then (ii) selection of the model size from those statistics. Prior systems fail to generalize to diverse workloads, particularly to mobile videos and lower accuracy targets. We identify that the failure modes stem from inefficient sampling whose cost exceeds its benefit, and inaccurate per-segment accuracy prediction.\n  In this work, we present RedunCut, a new DMSS system that addresses both: It uses a measurement-driven planner that estimates the cost-benefit tradeoff of sampling, and a lightweight, data-driven performance model to improve accuracy prediction.

While recent advances in multimodal foundation models have enabled zero-shot object goal navigation, allowing robots to search for arbitrary objects without fine-tuning, existing methods face two key limitations: (1) heavy reliance on precise depth and pose information provided by simulators, which restricts applicability in real-world scenarios; and (2) lack of in-context learning (ICL) capability, making it difficult to quickly adapt to new environments, as in leveraging short videos. To address these challenges, we propose RANGER, a novel zero-shot, open-vocabulary semantic navigation framework that operates using only a monocular camera. Leveraging powerful 3D foundation models, RANGER eliminates the dependency on depth and pose while exhibiting strong ICL capability. By simply observing a short video of a new environment, the system can also significantly improve task efficiency without requiring architectural modifications or fine-tuning.

Firstly, we leverage the DINOv2 backbone with a convolution adapter fine-tuning to enhance model adaptability to cross-view variations. Secondly, we propose a multi-scale channel reallocation module to strengthen the diversity and stability of spatial representations. Finally, we propose an improved aggregation module that integrates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) routing into the feature aggregation process.

This protocol-level standardization enables AI agents and applications to discover, call, and compose capabilities seamlessly across disparate platforms and institutional boundaries. (2) Orchestrated Experiment Lifecycle Management: SCP complements the protocol with a secure service architecture, which comprises a centralized SCP Hub and federated SCP Servers. This architecture manages the complete experiment lifecycle (registration, planning, execution, monitoring, and archival), enforces fine-grained authentication and authorization, and orchestrates traceable, end-to-end workflows that bridge computational and physical laboratories. Based on SCP, we have constructed a scientific discovery platform that offers researchers and agents a large-scale ecosystem of more than 1,600 tool resources. Across diverse use cases, SCP facilitates secure, large-scale collaboration between heterogeneous AI systems and human researchers while significantly reducing integration overhead and enhancing reproducibility.

This paper addresses this gap by investigating how LLM coding tools are used in professional practice, the associated concerns and risks, and the resulting transformations in development workflows, with particular attention to implications for computing education. We conducted a qualitative analysis of 57 curated YouTube videos published between late 2024 and 2025, capturing reflections and experiences shared by practitioners. Following a filtering and quality assessment process, the selected sources were analyzed to compare LLM-based and traditional programming, identify emerging risks, and characterize evolving workflows. Our findings reveal definitions of AI-based coding practices, notable productivity gains, and lowered barriers to entry. Practitioners also report a shift in development bottlenecks toward code review and concerns regarding code quality, maintainability, security vulnerabilities, ethical issues, erosion of foundational problem-solving skills, and insufficient preparation of entry-level engineers. Building on these insights, we discuss implications for computer science and software engineering education and argue for curricular shifts toward problem-solving, architectural thinking, code review, and early project-based learning that integrates LLM tools.

However, conventional control algorithms for trajectory tracking often exhibit limited performance due to the underactuated, nonlinear, and highly coupled dynamics of quadrotor systems. To address these challenges, we propose HBO-PID, a novel control algorithm that integrates the Heteroscedastic Bayesian Optimization (HBO) framework with the classical PID controller to achieve accurate and robust trajectory tracking. By explicitly modeling input-dependent noise variance, the proposed method can better adapt to dynamic and complex environments, and therefore improve the accuracy and robustness of trajectory tracking. To accelerate the convergence of optimization, we adopt a two-stage optimization strategy that allow us to more efficiently find the optimal controller parameters. Through experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Compared to SOTA methods, it improves the position accuracy by 24.7% to 42.9%, and the angular accuracy by 40.9% to 78.4%.", "AI": {"tldr": "HBO-PID\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u4e0ePID\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u56e0\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHBO-PID\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4e0ePID\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u8f93\u5165\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cHBO-PID\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u534724.7%\u81f342.9%\uff0c\u89d2\u5ea6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u534740.9%\u81f378.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "HBO-PID\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178PID\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u89d2\u5ea6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

These procedures require sustained attention, coordinated hand movements, and highly refined motor skills, underscoring the need for objective and systematic methods to evaluate and enhance microsurgical training. Conventional assessment approaches typically rely on expert raters supervising the procedures or reviewing surgical videos, which is an inherently subjective process prone to inter-rater variability, inconsistency, and significant time investment. These limitations highlight the necessity for automated and scalable solutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel AI-driven framework for automated action segmentation and performance assessment in microanastomosis procedures, designed to operate efficiently on edge computing platforms. The proposed system comprises three main components: (1) an object tip tracking and localization module based on YOLO and DeepSORT; (2) an action segmentation module leveraging self-similarity matrix for action boundary detection and unsupervised clustering; and (3) a supervised classification module designed to evaluate surgical gesture proficiency. Experimental validation on a dataset of 58 expert-rated microanastomosis videos demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a frame-level action segmentation accuracy of 92.4% and an overall skill classification accuracy of 85.5% in replicating expert evaluations. These findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to provide objective, real-time feedback in microsurgical education, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training protocols and advancing competency assessment in high-stakes surgical environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5fae\u543b\u5408\u624b\u672f\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5272\u4e0e\u6280\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d8585%\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5ba2\u89c2\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u543b\u5408\u624b\u672f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u3001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eYOLO\u548cDeepSORT\u7684\u5668\u68b0\u5c16\u7aef\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u77e9\u9635\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u4f5c\u8fb9\u754c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u624b\u672f\u624b\u52bf\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u572858\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u5fae\u543b\u5408\u624b\u672f\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e27\u7ea7\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5272\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe92.4%\uff0c\u6280\u80fd\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe85.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684AI\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5fae\u543b\u5408\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5272\u548c\u6280\u80fd\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5fae\u5916\u79d1\u6559\u80b2\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u7684\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u57f9\u8bad\u534f\u8bae\u3002"}}

However, these requirements also increase the complexity of FSMVRP, posing significant challenges, particularly in large-scale and time-constrained environments. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for solving FSMVRP, capable of generating near-optimal solutions within a few seconds. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and develop a novel policy network, termed FRIPN, that seamlessly integrates fleet composition and routing decisions. Our method incorporates specialized input embeddings designed for distinctdecision objectives, including a remaining graph embedding to facilitate effective vehicle employment decisions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on both randomly generated instances and benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits notable advantages in terms of computational efficiency and scalability, particularly in large-scale and time-constrained scenarios.

In recent years, data-driven constrained motion planning algorithms have shown impressive planning speed and success rate. Among them, the latent motion method based on manifold approximation is the most efficient planning algorithm. Due to errors in manifold approximation and the difficulty in accurately identifying collision conflicts within the latent space, time-consuming path validity checks and path replanning are required. In this paper, we propose a method that trains a neural network to predict the minimum distance between the robot and obstacles using latent vectors as inputs.

Traditional methods often rely on atmospheric scattering models, while recent deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, have improved performance by effectively analyzing image features.

Most existing safety alignment methods, such as Safe RLHF and SACPO, typically operate under a risk-neutral paradigm that is insufficient to address the risks arising from deviations from the reference policy and offers limited robustness against rare but potentially catastrophic harmful behaviors. To address this limitation, we propose Risk-aware Stepwise Alignment (RSA), a novel alignment method that explicitly incorporates risk awareness into the policy optimization process by leveraging a class of nested risk measures. Specifically, RSA formulates safety alignment as a token-level risk-aware constrained policy optimization problem and solves it through a stepwise alignment procedure that yields token-level policy updates derived from the nested risk measures. This design offers two key benefits: (1) it mitigates risks induced by excessive model shift away from a reference policy, and (2) it explicitly suppresses low-probability yet high-impact harmful behaviors. Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis on policy optimality under mild assumptions.

Although recent studies have adopted several methods to detect code hallucination, most of these approaches remain limited to coarse-grained detection and lack specialized techniques for fine-grained hallucination localization. This study introduces a novel method, called CoHalLo, which achieves line-level code hallucination localization by probing the hidden-layer vectors from hallucination detection models. CoHalLo uncovers the key syntactic information driving the model's hallucination judgments and locates the hallucinating code lines accordingly. Specifically, we first fine-tune the hallucination detection model on manually annotated datasets to ensure that it learns features pertinent to code syntactic information. Subsequently, we designed a probe network that projects high-dimensional latent vectors onto a low-dimensional syntactic subspace, generating vector tuples and reconstructing the predicted abstract syntax tree (P-AST). By comparing P-AST with the original abstract syntax tree (O-AST) extracted from the input AI-generated code, we identify the key syntactic structures associated with hallucinations. This information is then used to pinpoint hallucinated code lines. To evaluate CoHalLo's performance, we manually collected a dataset of code hallucinations.

Most existing approaches rely on single-frame observation and employ simple concatenation for multi-modal fusion, which limits their ability to capture temporal context and hinders dynamic adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose a DRL-based navigation framework, DRL-TH, which leverages temporal graph attention and hierarchical graph pooling to integrate historical observations and adaptively fuse multi-modal information. Specifically, we introduce a temporal-guided graph attention network (TG-GAT) that incorporates temporal weights into attention scores to capture correlations between consecutive frames, thereby enabling the implicit estimation of scene evolution.

Considering the inherently dynamic nature of video data, we propose two distinct attack objectives: a semantic objective to evaluate video-text alignment and a temporal objective to assess the temporal dynamics. To achieve an effective and efficient attack process, we propose two adversarial attack methods: (i) T2VAttack-S, which identifies semantically or temporally critical words in prompts and replaces them with synonyms via greedy search, and (ii) T2VAttack-I, which iteratively inserts optimized words with minimal perturbation to the prompt. By combining these objectives and strategies, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the adversarial robustness of several state-of-the-art T2V models, including ModelScope, CogVideoX, Open-Sora, and HunyuanVideo.

However, prior real-world RL methods often assume that human interventions are optimal across the entire state space, overlooking the fact that even expert operators cannot consistently provide optimal actions in all states or completely avoid mistakes. Indiscriminately mixing intervention data with robot-collected data inherits the sample inefficiency of RL, while purely imitating intervention data can ultimately degrade the final performance achievable by RL. The question of how to leverage potentially suboptimal and noisy human interventions to accelerate learning without being constrained by them thus remains open. To address this challenge, we propose SiLRI, a state-wise Lagrangian reinforcement learning algorithm for real-world robot manipulation tasks. Specifically, we formulate the online manipulation problem as a constrained RL optimization, where the constraint bound at each state is determined by the uncertainty of human interventions. We then introduce a state-wise Lagrange multiplier and solve the problem via a min-max optimization, jointly optimizing the policy and the Lagrange multiplier to reach a saddle point. Built upon a human-as-copilot teleoperation system, our algorithm is evaluated through real-world experiments on diverse manipulation tasks. Experimental results show that SiLRI effectively exploits human suboptimal interventions, reducing the time required to reach a 90% success rate by at least 50% compared with the state-of-the-art RL method HIL-SERL, and achieving a 100% success rate on long-horizon manipulation tasks where other RL methods struggle to succeed.

Recent approaches focus on generating shifted novel view images from given viewpoints using diffusion models. However, these methods heavily rely on priors such as LiDAR point clouds, 3D bounding boxes, and lane annotations, which demand expensive sensors or labor-intensive labeling, limiting applicability in real-world deployment. In this work, with only images and optional camera poses, we first estimate a global static point cloud and per-frame dynamic point clouds, fusing them into a unified representation. We then employ a deformable 4D Gaussian framework to reconstruct the scene. The initially trained 4D Gaussian model renders degraded and pseudo-images to train a video diffusion model. Subsequently, progressively shifted Gaussian renderings are iteratively refined by the diffusion model,and the enhanced results are incorporated back as training data for 4DGS. This process continues until extrapolation reaches the target viewpoints.

Planning is commonly performed in the input space, but a recent family of methods has introduced planning algorithms that optimize in the learned representation space of the world model, with the promise that abstracting irrelevant details yields more efficient planning. In this work, we characterize models from this family as JEPA-WMs and investigate the technical choices that make algorithms from this class work. We propose a comprehensive study of several key components with the objective of finding the optimal approach within the family. We conducted experiments using both simulated environments and real-world robotic data, and studied how the model architecture, the training objective, and the planning algorithm affect planning success.

However, unlike their homogeneous-ISA counterparts, explicit software support for bridging ISA heterogeneity is required. The lack of a compilation toolchain ready to support heterogeneous-ISA targets has been a major factor hindering research in this exciting emerging area. For any such compiler, \"getting right\" the mechanics involved in state transformation upon migration and doing this efficiently is of critical importance. In particular, any runtime conversion of the current program stack from one architecture to another would be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we design and develop Unifico, a new multi-ISA compiler that generates binaries that maintain the same stack layout during their execution on either architecture. Unifico avoids the need for runtime stack transformation, thus eliminating overheads associated with ISA migration. Additional responsibilities of the Unifico compiler backend include maintenance of a uniform ABI and virtual address space across ISAs. Unifico is implemented using the LLVM compiler infrastructure, and we are currently targeting the x86-64 and ARMv8 ISAs. We have evaluated Unifico across a range of compute-intensive NAS benchmarks and show its minimal impact on overall execution time, where less than 6% (10%) overhead is introduced on average for high-end (low-end) processors. We also analyze the performance impact of Unifico's key design features and demonstrate that they can be further optimized to mitigate this impact.

Here we show that deep learning can leverage the temporal redundancy of satellite time series to detect anomalies at unprecedented sensitivity, by learning to predict what the surface should look like in the absence of change. We train an inpainting model built upon the SATLAS foundation model to reconstruct the last frame of a Sentinel-2 time series from preceding acquisitions, using globally distributed training data spanning diverse climate zones and land cover types. When applied to regions affected by sudden surface changes, the discrepancy between prediction and observation reveals anomalies that traditional change detection methods miss. We validate our approach on earthquake-triggered surface ruptures from the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake sequence, demonstrating detection of a rift feature in Tepehan with higher sensitivity and specificity than temporal median or Reed-Xiaoli anomaly detectors.

Understanding how foundation model (FM) agents understand and act in such environments is therefore critical for enabling reliable map-based reasoning and applications. However, most existing evaluations of spatial ability in FMs rely on static map inputs or text-based queries, overlooking the interactive and experience-driven nature of spatial understanding.In this paper, we propose an interactive evaluation framework to analyze how FM agents explore, remember, and reason in symbolic map environments. Agents incrementally explore partially observable grid-based maps consisting of roads, intersections, and points of interest (POIs), receiving only local observations at each step. Spatial understanding is then evaluated using six kinds of spatial tasks. By systematically varying exploration strategies, memory representations, and reasoning schemes across multiple foundation models, we reveal distinct functional roles of these components. Exploration primarily affects experience acquisition but has a limited impact on final reasoning accuracy. In contrast, memory representation plays a central role in consolidating spatial experience, with structured memories particularly sequential and graph-based representations, substantially improving performance on structure-intensive tasks such as path planning. Reasoning schemes further shape how stored spatial knowledge is used, with advanced prompts supporting more effective multi-step inference. We further observe that spatial reasoning performance saturates across model versions and scales beyond a certain capability threshold, indicating that improvements in map-based spatial understanding require mechanisms tailored to spatial representation and reasoning rather than scaling alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7279\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u5730\u56fe\u6216\u6587\u672c\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a71\u52a8\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u5730\u56fe\uff08\u5305\u542b\u9053\u8def\u3001\u4ea4\u53c9\u70b9\u548c\u5174\u8da3\u70b9\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u516d\u79cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u4e3b\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u7ecf\u9a8c\u83b7\u53d6\u4f46\u5bf9\u6700\u7ec8\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8868\u793a\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\u5728\u6574\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8d77\u6838\u5fc3\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u5982\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63d0\u793a\uff09\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u7248\u672c\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e00\u5b9a\u9608\u503c\u540e\u4f1a\u8d8b\u4e8e\u9971\u548c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6269\u5927\u3002"}}

To support this process, we offer techniques to localize where generations might be misaligned from user intent. We first create a dataset of \"Minimal Intent Aligning Patches\" of repaired LLM generated programs. Each program uses test cases to verify correctness. After creating a dataset of programs, we measure how well various techniques can assign a well-calibrated probability to indicate which parts of code will be edited in a minimal patch (i.e., give a probability that corresponds with empirical odds it is edited). We compare white-box probing (where we propose a technique for efficient arbitrary-span querying), against black-box reflective and self-consistency based approaches.

To enable MPC, control-augmented modelling and system identification of the RAAVEN small uncrewed aircraft is presented. Two formulations of MPC are then showcased. The first schedules a static reference path rate over the MPC horizon, incentivizing a constant inertial speed. The second, with inspiration from model predictive contouring control, dynamically optimizes for the reference path rate over the controller horizon as the system operates. This allows for a weighted tradeoff between path progression and distance from path, two competing objectives in path-following guidance. Both controllers are formulated to operate over general smooth 3D arc-length parameterized curves. The MPC guidance algorithms are flown over several high-curvature test paths, with comparison to a baseline lookahead guidance law. The results showcase the real-world feasibility and superior performance of nonlinear MPC for 3D path-following guidance at ground speeds up to 36 meters per second.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u975e\u7ebf\u6027MPC\u7b97\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u578b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u76843D\u8def\u5f84\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u98de\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u66f2\u7387\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u9ad8\u901f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u56fa\u5b9a\u7ffc\u5c0f\u578b\u65e0\u4eba\u98de\u884c\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9ad8\u66f2\u7387\u8def\u5f84\u4e0b\u76843D\u8def\u5f84\u8ddf\u8e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u975e\u7ebf\u6027MPC\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027MPC\u76843D\u8def\u5f84\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u79cd\u5728MPC\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8c03\u5ea6\u9759\u6001\u53c2\u8003\u8def\u5f84\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u6fc0\u52b1\u6052\u5b9a\u60ef\u6027\u901f\u5ea6\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u53c2\u8003\u8def\u5f84\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u6743\u8861\u8def\u5f84\u8fdb\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8def\u5f84\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u5747\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e00\u822c\u5e73\u6ed13D\u5f27\u957f\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u66f2\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u98de\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027MPC\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u524d\u77bb\u5236\u5bfc\u6cd5\u5219\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08MPC\uff09\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u7ffc\u5c0f\u578b\u65e0\u4eba\u98de\u884c\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf3D\u8def\u5f84\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u901f\uff0836\u7c73/\u79d2\uff09\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u3002"}}

Although U-Net based convolutional neural networks have achieved remarkable progress, their intrinsic locality and largely homogeneous attention formulations often limit the modeling of long-range contextual dependencies, especially in multi-organ scenarios and low-contrast regions. Transformer-based architectures mitigate this issue by leveraging global self-attention, but they usually require higher computational resources and larger training data, which may impede deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments.In this paper, we propose GCA-ResUNet, an efficient medical image segmentation framework equipped with a lightweight and plug-and-play Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) module. The proposed GCA decouples channel-wise context modeling into multiple groups to explicitly account for semantic heterogeneity across channels, and integrates direction-aware coordinate encoding to capture structured spatial dependencies along horizontal and vertical axes. This design enhances global representation capability while preserving the efficiency advantages of CNN backbones. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks, Synapse and ACDC, demonstrate that GCA-ResUNet achieves Dice scores of 86.11% and 92.64%, respectively, outperforming a range of representative CNN and Transformer-based methods, including Swin-UNet and TransUNet. In particular, GCA-ResUNet yields consistent improvements in delineating small anatomical structures with complex boundaries. These results indicate that the proposed approach provides a favorable trade-off between segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical and scalable solution for clinical deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "GCA-ResUNet\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7GCA\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3U-Net\u5728\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GCA-ResUNet\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u5206\u7ec4\u5750\u6807\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08GCA\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7ec4\u901a\u9053\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u65b9\u5411\u611f\u77e5\u5750\u6807\u7f16\u7801\u589e\u5f3a\u5168\u5c40\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Synapse\u548cACDC\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGCA-ResUNet\u7684Dice\u5206\u6570\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523086.11%\u548c92.64%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GCA-ResUNet\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, the majority of these studies use the same datasets for benchmarking, which limits the generalizability of their findings and may not fully capture the diverse challenges present in mathematical tasks. The purpose of the present study is to analyze the performance of LLMs on underrepresented mathematics competition problems. We prompted three leading LLMs, namely GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-2.0-Flash, and DeepSeek-V3, with the Missouri Collegiate Mathematics Competition problems in the areas of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics. The LLMs responses were then compared to the known correct solutions in order to determine the accuracy of the LLM for each problem domain. We also analyzed the LLMs reasoning to explore patterns in errors across problem types and models. DeepSeek-V3 has the best performance in all three categories of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics, both in reasoning and correct final answers. All three LLMs exhibited notably weak performance in Geometry.

To further improve data quality, numerous training data optimization techniques have been proposed; however, their overall effectiveness has not been systematically evaluated. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study, examining five widely-used training data optimization techniques and their pairwise combinations for LLM-based code generation across three benchmarks and four LLMs. Our results show that data synthesis is the most effective technique for improving functional correctness and reducing code smells, although it performs relatively worse on code maintainability compared to data refactoring, cleaning, and selection. Regarding combinations, we find that most combinations do not further improve functional correctness but can effectively enhance code quality (code smells and maintainability). Among all combinations, data synthesis combined with data refactoring achieves the strongest overall performance. Furthermore, our fine-grained analysis reinforces these findings and provides deeper insights into how individual techniques and their combinations influence code generation effectiveness.

Despite strong general language capabilities, LLMs still struggle with spatial transformations and multi-step planning in structured environments. We propose a two-stage approach that decomposes spatial reasoning into atomic building blocks and their composition. First, we apply supervised fine-tuning on elementary spatial transformations, such as rotation, translation, and scaling, to equip the model with basic spatial physics. We then freeze this physics-aware model and train lightweight LoRA adapters within the GRPO framework to learn policies that compose these building blocks for multi-step planning in puzzle-based environments, in a closed-loop manner. To support this pipeline, we synthesize an ASCII-art dataset and construct a corresponding ASCII-based reinforcement learning environment. Our method consistently outperforms baselines, including the generic backbone, physics-aware model, and end-to-end RL models, under both Dynamic environments with explicit state updates and Static environments where the model must rely on its internal state across steps. In addition, the proposed approach converges faster and exhibits more stable training compared to end-to-end reinforcement learning from scratch.

Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated their potential for enhancing the degree of automation in formal verification by, e.g., generating formal specifications as essential to deductive verification, yet exhibit poor scalability due to long-context reasoning limitations and, more importantly, the difficulty of inferring complex, interprocedural specifications. This paper presents Preguss -- a modular, fine-grained framework for automating the generation and refinement of formal specifications. Preguss synergizes between static analysis and deductive verification by steering two components in a divide-and-conquer fashion: (i) potential runtime error-guided construction and prioritization of verification units, and (ii) LLM-aided synthesis of interprocedural specifications at the unit level. We show that Preguss substantially outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based approaches and, in particular, it enables highly automated RTE-freeness verification for real-world programs with over a thousand LoC, with a reduction of 80.6%~88.9% human verification effort.", "AI": {"tldr": "Preguss\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u548cLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u5408\u6210\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u56e0\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u9650\u5236\u548c\u590d\u6742\u8de8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89c4\u8303\u63a8\u65ad\u56f0\u96be\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "Preguss\u7ed3\u5408\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6f14\u7ece\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6cbb\u6cd5\u6307\u5bfc\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a(i) \u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5355\u5143\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c(ii) \u5728\u5355\u5143\u7ea7\u522b\u5229\u7528LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u5408\u6210\u8de8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89c4\u8303\u3002", "result": "Preguss\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u5ea6\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684RTE-freeness\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Preguss\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8f6f\u4ef6\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8680.6%~88.9%\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002"}}

The pipeline can execute the software stack and the simulation up to three times faster than real-time, locally or on GitHub for Continuous Integration/- Continuous Delivery (CI/CD). As the most important input of the pipeline, there is a set of running scenarios. Each scenario allows the initialization of the ego vehicle in different initial conditions (position and speed), as well as the initialization of any other configuration of the stack. This functionality is essential to validate efficiently critical modules, like the one responsible for high-speed overtaking maneuvers or localization, which are among the most challenging aspects of autonomous racing.

The target's geometry and appearance are represented as a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model. However, learning 3DGS requires static scenes, an assumption in contrast to dynamic lighting conditions encountered in spaceborne imagery. The trained 3DGS model can also be used for camera pose estimation through photometric optimization. Therefore, in addition to recovering a geometrically accurate 3DGS model, the photometric accuracy of the rendered images is imperative to downstream pose estimation tasks during the RPO process. This work proposes to incorporate the prior knowledge of the Sun's position, estimated and maintained by the servicer spacecraft, into the training pipeline for improved photometric quality of 3DGS rasterization.

Current MCP evaluation sets suffer from issues such as reliance on external MCP services and a lack of difficulty awareness. To address these limitations, we propose MCPAgentBench, a benchmark based on real-world MCP definitions designed to evaluate the tool-use capabilities of agents. We construct a dataset containing authentic tasks and simulated MCP tools. The evaluation employs a dynamic sandbox environment that presents agents with candidate tool lists containing distractors, thereby testing their tool selection and discrimination abilities.

However, it is unclear how exactly the agentic AI systems address performance concerns in practice. In this paper, we present an empirical study of performance-related pull requests generated by AI agents. Using LLM-assisted detection and BERTopic-based topic modeling, we identified 52 performance-related topics grouped into 10 higher-level categories. Our results show that AI agents apply performance optimizations across diverse layers of the software stack and that the type of optimization significantly affects pull request acceptance rates and review times. We also found that performance optimization by AI agents primarily occurs during the development phase, with less focus on the maintenance phase.

Yet these models primarily describe what they perceive and intend to do, rarely questioning whether their planned actions are safe or appropriate. This work introduces Counterfactual VLA (CF-VLA), a self-reflective VLA framework that enables the model to reason about and revise its planned actions before execution. CF-VLA first generates time-segmented meta-actions that summarize driving intent, and then performs counterfactual reasoning conditioned on both the meta-actions and the visual context. This step simulates potential outcomes, identifies unsafe behaviors, and outputs corrected meta-actions that guide the final trajectory generation. To efficiently obtain such self-reflective capabilities, we propose a rollout-filter-label pipeline that mines high-value scenes from a base (non-counterfactual) VLA's rollouts and labels counterfactual reasoning traces for subsequent training rounds. Experiments on large-scale driving datasets show that CF-VLA improves trajectory accuracy by up to 17.6%, enhances safety metrics by 20.5%, and exhibits adaptive thinking: it only enables counterfactual reasoning in challenging scenarios. By transforming reasoning traces from one-shot descriptions to causal self-correction signals, CF-VLA takes a step toward self-reflective autonomous driving agents that learn to think before they act.", "AI": {"tldr": "CF-VLA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u7684VLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u4fee\u6b63\u8ba1\u5212\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u63cf\u8ff0\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u5f88\u5c11\u8d28\u7591\u8ba1\u5212\u884c\u52a8\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u6216\u9002\u5f53\u6027\u3002", "method": "CF-VLA\u9996\u5148\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u6bb5\u7684\u5143\u52a8\u4f5c\u603b\u7ed3\u9a7e\u9a76\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5143\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u8f93\u51fa\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u5143\u52a8\u4f5c\u6307\u5bfc\u6700\u7ec8\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u3002\u91c7\u7528rollout-filter-label\u6d41\u7a0b\u9ad8\u6548\u83b7\u53d6\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCF-VLA\u5c06\u8f68\u8ff9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8617.6%\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u5347\u4e8620.5%\uff0c\u5e76\u4ec5\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u542f\u7528\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "CF-VLA\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ece\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u63cf\u8ff0\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u671d\u7740\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4ee3\u7406\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ee3\u7406\u5b66\u4f1a\u5728\u884c\u52a8\u524d\u601d\u8003\u3002"}}

However, processing complex three-dimensional (3D) multimodal medical images poses significant challenges - specifically, the effective integration of complementary information and the occasional oversight of subtle yet critical pathological features. To address these issues, we present a novel two-stage fusion framework termed Hilbert-VLM. This framework leverages the HilbertMed-SAM module for precise lesion segmentation, with the generated multimodal enhanced prompts then guiding the VLM toward accurate disease classification. Our key innovation lies in the systematic redesign of the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) architecture: we incorporate Hilbert space-filling curves into the scanning mechanism of the Mamba State Space Model (SSM) to maximize the preservation of spatial locality in 3D data, a property critical for medical image analysis. We also introduce a novel Hilbert-Mamba Cross-Attention (HMCA) mechanism and a scale-aware decoder to capture fine-grained details. Meanwhile, the prompt enhancement module unifies segmentation masks and their corresponding textual attributes into an information-dense prompt to support VLM inference. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the Hilbert-VLM model. On the BraTS2021 segmentation benchmark, it achieves a Dice score of 82.35 percent, with a diagnostic classification accuracy (ACC) of 78.85 percent.

Recent approaches leveraging large language models (LLMs) have shown promise but face limitations. Most rely solely on static analysis, ignoring runtime behaviors. Some attempt to incorporate dynamic signals, but these are often restricted to training or fine-tuning, or injected only once into the repair prompt, without iterative use. This fails to fully capture program execution. Current iterative repair frameworks typically rely on coarse-grained feedback, such as pass/fail results or exception types, and do not leverage fine-grained execution-level information effectively. As a result, models struggle to simulate human stepwise debugging, limiting their effectiveness in multi-step reasoning and complex bug repair.\n  To address these challenges, we propose DynaFix, an execution-level dynamic information-driven APR method that iteratively leverages runtime information to refine the repair process. In each repair round, DynaFix captures execution-level dynamic information such as variable states, control-flow paths, and call stacks, transforming them into structured prompts to guide LLMs in generating candidate patches. If a patch fails validation, DynaFix re-executes the modified program to collect new execution information for the next attempt. This iterative loop incrementally improves patches based on updated feedback, similar to the stepwise debugging practices of human developers. We evaluate DynaFix on the Defects4J v1.2 and v2.0 benchmarks. DynaFix repairs 186 single-function bugs, a 10% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, including 38 bugs previously unrepaired. It achieves correct patches within at most 35 attempts, reducing the patch search space by 70% compared with existing methods, thereby demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency in repairing complex bugs.", "AI": {"tldr": "DynaFix\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5229\u7528\u6267\u884c\u7ea7\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u6539\u8fdbAPR\uff0c\u4fee\u590d\u4e86\u66f4\u591a\u9519\u8bef\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709APR\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u6216\u6709\u9650\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u9010\u6b65\u8c03\u8bd5\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u590d\u6742\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "DynaFix\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6267\u884c\u7ea7\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7684APR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u6355\u83b7\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u53d8\u91cf\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u8c03\u7528\u6808\uff09\u5e76\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u6307\u5bfcLLMs\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u8865\u4e01\u3002", "result": "DynaFix\u5728Defects4J v1.2\u548cv2.0\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4fee\u590d\u4e86186\u4e2a\u5355\u51fd\u6570\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e8610%\uff0c\u5305\u62ec38\u4e2a\u4e4b\u524d\u672a\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8865\u4e01\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8670%\u3002", "conclusion": "DynaFix\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4fee\u590d\u4e86186\u4e2a\u5355\u51fd\u6570\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Defects4J\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u590d\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In robotics, they are particularly valuable because they capture objects in a form that aligns directly with how robots interact with the physical world, enabling core capabilities such as predicting stable grasps, detecting collisions, and simulating dynamics. Although automatic 3D mesh generation methods have shown promising progress in recent years, potentially offering a path toward real-time robot perception, two critical challenges remain. First, generating high-fidelity meshes is prohibitively slow for real-time use, often requiring tens of seconds per object. Second, mesh generation by itself is insufficient. In robotics, a mesh must be contextually grounded, i.e., correctly segmented from the scene and registered with the proper scale and pose. Additionally, unless these contextual grounding steps remain efficient, they simply introduce new bottlenecks. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end system that addresses these challenges, producing a high-quality, contextually grounded 3D mesh from a single RGB-D image in under one second. Our pipeline integrates open-vocabulary object segmentation, accelerated diffusion-based mesh generation, and robust point cloud registration, each optimized for both speed and accuracy.

However, the latent trajectories in these methods often exhibit accumulated velocity errors, leading to semantic inconsistency and loss of structural fidelity. We propose Conditioned Velocity Correction (CVC), a principled framework that reformulates flow-based editing as a distribution transformation problem driven by a known source prior. CVC rethinks the role of velocity in inter-distribution transformation by introducing a dual-perspective velocity conversion mechanism. This mechanism explicitly decomposes the latent evolution into two components: a structure-preserving branch that remains consistent with the source trajectory, and a semantically-guided branch that drives a controlled deviation toward the target distribution. The conditional velocity field exhibits an absolute velocity error relative to the true underlying distribution trajectory, which inherently introduces potential instability and trajectory drift in the latent space. To address this quantifiable deviation and maintain fidelity to the true flow, we apply a posterior-consistent update to the resulting conditional velocity field. This update is derived from Empirical Bayes Inference and Tweedie correction, which ensures a mathematically grounded error compensation over time. Our method yields stable and interpretable latent dynamics, achieving faithful reconstruction alongside smooth local semantic conversion.

The approach consistently outperforms strong multi-agent LLM baselines and provides a practical path toward reliable collaboration in complex workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u534f\u4f5c\u610f\u8bc6\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u5168\u5c40\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08Dec-POMDP\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u96c6\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u6563\u6267\u884c\uff08CTDE\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08GRPO\uff09\u6765\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u534f\u4f5c\u5199\u4f5c\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u5904\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad83\u500d\uff0c\u5199\u4f5c\u7ed3\u6784/\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fbe98.7%\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u6d4b\u8bd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\u4e3a74.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u7684LLM\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u534f\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

In this paper, we examined the energy awareness of agent-authored pull requests (PRs) using a publicly available dataset. We identified 216 energy-explicit PRs and conducted a thematic analysis, deriving a taxonomy of energy-aware work. Our further analysis of the applied optimization techniques shows that most align with established research recommendations. Although building and running these agents is highly energy intensive, encouragingly, the results indicate that they exhibit energy awareness when generating software artifacts.

The main paper has 16 figures", "summary": "The draft IMO MASS Code requires autonomous and remotely supervised maritime vessels to detect departures from their operational design domain, enter a predefined fallback that notifies the operator, permit immediate human override, and avoid changing the voyage plan without approval. Meeting these obligations in the alert-to-takeover gap calls for a short-horizon, human-overridable fallback maneuver. Classical maritime autonomy stacks struggle when the correct action depends on meaning (e.g., diver-down flag means people in the water, fire close by means hazard). We argue (i) that vision-language models (VLMs) provide semantic awareness for such out-of-distribution situations, and (ii) that a fast-slow anomaly pipeline with a short-horizon, human-overridable fallback maneuver makes this practical in the handover window. We introduce Semantic Lookout, a camera-only, candidate-constrained vision-language model (VLM) fallback maneuver selector that selects one cautious action (or station-keeping) from water-valid, world-anchored trajectories under continuous human authority. On 40 harbor scenes we measure per-call scene understanding and latency, alignment with human consensus (model majority-of-three voting), short-horizon risk-relief on fire hazard scenes, and an on-water alert->fallback maneuver->operator handover. Sub-10 s models retain most of the awareness of slower state-of-the-art models. The fallback maneuver selector outperforms geometry-only baselines and increases standoff distance on fire scenes. A field run verifies end-to-end operation. These results support VLMs as semantic fallback maneuver selectors compatible with the draft IMO MASS Code, within practical latency budgets, and motivate future work on domain-adapted, hybrid autonomy that pairs foundation-model semantics with multi-sensor bird's-eye-view perception and short-horizon replanning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faSemantic Lookout\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u540e\u5907\u52a8\u4f5c\u9009\u62e9\u5668\uff0c\u7b26\u5408IMO MASS Code\u8349\u6848\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u77ed\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6ee1\u8db3IMO MASS Code\u8349\u6848\u5bf9\u81ea\u4e3b\u548c\u8fdc\u7a0b\u76d1\u7763\u8239\u8236\u5728\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57df\u5916\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u901a\u77e5\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u3001\u5141\u8bb8\u5373\u65f6\u4eba\u7c7b\u8986\u76d6\u53ca\u907f\u514d\u672a\u7ecf\u6279\u51c6\u7684\u822a\u7a0b\u53d8\u66f4\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Semantic Lookout\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u7684\u5019\u9009\u7ea6\u675f\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u540e\u5907\u52a8\u4f5c\u9009\u62e9\u5668\uff0c\u4ece\u6c34\u6548\u3001\u4e16\u754c\u951a\u5b9a\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u8c28\u614e\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08\u6216\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u4f4d\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u4eba\u7c7b\u6388\u6743\u4e0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u572840\u4e2a\u6e2f\u53e3\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0cSub-10\u79d2\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u8f83\u6162\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540e\u5907\u52a8\u4f5c\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u706b\u707e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002\u5b9e\u5730\u8fd0\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u652f\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b26\u5408IMO MASS Code\u8349\u6848\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u540e\u5907\u52a8\u4f5c\u9009\u62e9\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9884\u7b97\u5185\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u52a8\u529b\u3002"}}

Prior art typically pursues the former, but neglects a key factor that shapes the holistic style -- garment fit. Garment fit delineates how a garment aligns with the body of a wearer and is a fundamental element in fashion design. In this work, we introduce fit-aware VTON and present FitControler, a learnable plug-in that can seamlessly integrate into modern VTON models to enable customized fit control. To achieve this, we highlight two challenges: i) how to delineate layouts of different fits and ii) how to render the garment that matches the layout. FitControler first features a fit-aware layout generator to redraw the body-garment layout conditioned on a set of delicately processed garment-agnostic representations, and a multi-scale fit injector is then used to deliver layout cues to enable layout-driven VTON.

An opinion generation agent produces diverse reasoning perspectives, an evidence verification agent retrieves external knowledge and quantifies factual support, and a consistency arbitration agent integrates logically coherent conclusions. A self-game mechanism is introduced to expand multi-path reasoning trajectories, while a retrieval enhancement module dynamically supplements external knowledge. A composite reward function combining factual consistency and logical coherence is designed, and an improved proximal policy optimization strategy is applied for collaborative training. Experimental results show that the proposed model improves multi-hop reasoning accuracy by 16.8 percent on HotpotQA, 14.3 percent on 2WikiMultihopQA, and 19.2 percent on MeetingBank, while improving consistency by 21.5 percent.

This study presents the first ecosystem-scale longitudinal analysis of software defects across 123 open source quantum repositories from 2012 to 2024, spanning eight functional categories, including full-stack libraries, simulators, annealing, algorithms, compilers, assembly, cryptography, and experimental computing. Using a mixed method approach combining repository mining, static code analysis, issue metadata extraction, and a validated rule-based classification framework, we analyze 32,296 verified bug reports. Results show that full-stack libraries and compilers are the most defect-prone categories due to circuit, gate, and transpilation-related issues, while simulators are mainly affected by measurement and noise modeling errors. Classical bugs primarily impact usability and interoperability, whereas quantum-specific bugs disproportionately degrade performance, maintainability, and reliability. Longitudinal analysis indicates ecosystem maturation, with defect densities peaking between 2017 and 2021 and declining thereafter. High-severity defects cluster in cryptography, experimental computing, and compiler toolchains. Repositories employing automated testing detect more defects and resolve issues faster. A negative binomial regression further shows that automated testing is associated with an approximate 60 percent reduction in expected defect incidence.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel surface fitting algorithm that integrates contact stability while preserving geometric compatibility. Inspired by human grasping behavior, our method disentangles the grasp pose optimization into three sequential steps: (1) rotation optimization to align contact normals, (2) translation refinement to improve the alignment between the gripper frame origin and the object Center of Mass (CoM), and (3) gripper aperture adjustment to optimize contact point distribution. We validate our approach in simulation across 15 objects under both Known-shape (with clean CAD-derived dataset) and Observed-shape (with YCB object dataset) settings, including cross-platform grasp execution on three robot--gripper platforms. We further validate the method in real-world grasp experiments on a UR3e robot. Overall, DISF reduces CoM misalignment while maintaining geometric compatibility, translating into higher grasp success in both simulation and real-world execution compared to baselines.

However, existing 2DGS-based pipelines allocate representation capacity and parameter precision largely oblivious to image structure, limiting their rate-distortion (RD) efficiency at low bitrates. To address this, we propose a structure-guided allocation principle for 2DGS, which explicitly couples image structure with both representation capacity and quantization precision, while preserving native decoding speed. First, we introduce a structure-guided initialization that assigns 2D Gaussians according to spatial structural priors inherent in natural images, yielding a localized and semantically meaningful distribution. Second, during quantization-aware fine-tuning, we propose adaptive bitwidth quantization of covariance parameters, which grants higher precision to small-scale Gaussians in complex regions and lower precision elsewhere, enabling RD-aware optimization, thereby reducing redundancy without degrading edge quality. Third, we impose a geometry-consistent regularization that aligns Gaussian orientations with local gradient directions to better preserve structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves both the representational power and the RD performance of 2DGS while maintaining over 1000 FPS decoding.

Furthermore, Youtu-Agent establishes a hybrid policy optimization system: (1) an \\textbf{Agent Practice} module that enables agents to accumulate experience and improve performance through in-context optimization without parameter updates; and (2) an \\textbf{Agent RL} module that integrates with distributed training frameworks to enable scalable and stable reinforcement learning of any Youtu-Agents in an end-to-end, large-scale manner.

Identical observations may correspond to multiple valid behavior trajectories. The visuomotor policy must correctly extract the appropriate types and levels of information from the history to identify the current task phase. However, naively extending the history window is computationally expensive and may cause severe overfitting. Inspired by the continuous nature of human reasoning and the recoding of working memory, we introduce PAM, a novel visuomotor Policy equipped with Adaptive working Memory. With minimal additional training cost in a two-stage manner, PAM supports a 300-frame history window while maintaining high inference speed. Specifically, a hierarchical frame feature extractor yields two distinct representations for motion primitives and temporal disambiguation. For compact representation, a context router with range-specific queries is employed to produce compact context features across multiple history lengths. And an auxiliary objective of reconstructing historical information is introduced to ensure that the context router acts as an effective bottleneck.

However, these VLMs encounter significant challenges when applied to the remote sensing domain due to the inherent differences between remote sensing images and natural images. Existing remote sensing VLMs often fail to extract fine-grained visual features and suffer from visual forgetting during deep language processing. To address this, we introduce MF-RSVLM, a Multi-Feature Fusion Remote Sensing Vision--Language Model that effectively extracts and fuses visual features for RS understanding. MF-RSVLM learns multi-scale visual representations and combines global context with local details, improving the capture of small and complex structures in RS scenes. A recurrent visual feature injection scheme ensures the language model remains grounded in visual evidence and reduces visual forgetting during generation. Extensive experiments on diverse RS benchmarks show that MF-RSVLM achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across remote sensing classification, image captioning, and VQA tasks.

However, existing methods suffer significant performance decline in real-world scenarios where models are tested under unseen working conditions, while domain adaptation approaches are limited to their reliance on target domain samples. Moreover, most existing studies rely on single-modal sensing signals, overlooking the complementary nature of multi-modal information for improving model generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis. A dual disentanglement framework is developed to decouple modality-invariant and modality-specific features, as well as domain-invariant and domain-specific representations, enabling both comprehensive multi-modal representation learning and robust domain generalization. A cross-domain mixed fusion strategy is designed to randomly mix modality information across domains for modality and domain diversity augmentation. Furthermore, a triple-modal fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively integrate multi-modal heterogeneous information. Extensive experiments are conducted on induction motor fault diagnosis under both unseen constant and time-varying working conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms advanced methods and comprehensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each proposed component and multi-modal fusion.

In peak periods such as holidays, it is often faced with the challenge of high concurrency scenarios because of a large number of users accessing at the same time. The traditional aggregation architecture can not meet the peak user requirements because of its insufficient fault tolerance and low ability. Therefore, the system needs to use microservice architecture for development, and add multiple security methods to ensure that the system can have good stability and data consistency under high concurrency scenarios, and can respond quickly to user requests. This paper introduces the use of B/S architecture and Spring Cloud to design and develop a railway ticket purchase system that can maintain stability and reliability under high concurrency scenarios, and formulate multiple security design methods for the system. This system integrates a range of functions, such as real-time train inquiries, dynamic seat updates, online seat selection, and ticket purchasing, effectively addressing common problems associated with offline ticket purchasing, such as long queues and delayed information. It enables a complete online process from inquiry and booking to payment and refunds. Furthermore, the \"add passenger\" function allows users to purchase tickets for others, extending the convenience of online ticketing to people with limited internet access. The system design prioritizes security and stability, while also focusing on high performance, and achieves these goals through a carefully designed architecture and the integration of multiple middleware components. After the completion of the system development, the core interface of the system is tested, and then the results are analyzed. The test data proves that the system has good ability and stability under high concurrency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u94c1\u8def\u8d2d\u7968\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Spring Cloud\u548c\u591a\u91cd\u5b89\u5168\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u5e76\u53d1\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u805a\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u9ad8\u5e76\u53d1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u56e0\u5bb9\u9519\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u8d2d\u7968\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528B/S\u67b6\u6784\u548cSpring Cloud\u8fdb\u884c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u5ea7\u4f4d\u66f4\u65b0\u3001\u5728\u7ebf\u9009\u5ea7\u7b49\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u591a\u91cd\u5b89\u5168\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9ad8\u5e76\u53d1\u4e0b\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u67e5\u8be2\u5230\u652f\u4ed8\u7684\u5168\u6d41\u7a0b\u5728\u7ebf\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u591a\u91cd\u5b89\u5168\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u5e76\u53d1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

Traditional graph-based planners excel at long-range pathfinding but lack reactivity, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods demonstrate strong collision avoidance but often fail to reach distant goals due to a lack of global context. We propose Hybrid Motion Planning with Deep Reinforcement Learning (HMP-DRL), a hybrid framework that bridges this gap. Our approach utilizes a graph-based global planner to generate a path, which is integrated into a local DRL policy via a sequence of checkpoints encoded in both the state space and reward function. To ensure social compliance, the local planner employs an entity-aware reward structure that dynamically adjusts safety margins and penalties based on the semantic type of surrounding agents.

Most recent methods treat text-guided segmentation as one-shot grounding, where the model predicts pixel prompts in a single forward pass to drive an external segmentor, which limits verification, refocusing and refinement when initial localization is wrong. To address this limitation, we propose RSAgent, an agentic Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) which interleaves reasoning and action for segmentation via multi-turn tool invocations.

The framework comprises three core modules: (1) A Physical Perception Layer that utilizes 10 mechanism-based features derived from electrochemical principles, balancing dimensionality reduction with physical fidelity; (2) A Detection and Attribution Layer that employs Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and SHAP to quantify feature contributions; and (3) A Reasoning and Diagnosis Layer that leverages an LLM as the agent core. This layer constructs a \"numerical-semantic\" bridge, combining SHAP attributions with a mechanism knowledge base to generate comprehensive reports containing fault types, root cause analysis, and maintenance suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that BatteryAgent effectively corrects misclassifications on hard boundary samples, achieving an AUROC of 0.986, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

To address these limitations, we propose PipeFlow, a scalable, pipelined video editing method that introduces three key innovations: First, based on a motion analysis using Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Optical Flow, we identify and propose to skip editing of frames with low motion. Second, we propose a pipelined task scheduling algorithm that splits a video into multiple segments and performs DDIM inversion and joint editing in parallel based on available GPU memory. Lastly, we leverage a neural network-based interpolation technique to smooth out the border frames between segments and interpolate the previously skipped frames. Our method uniquely scales to longer videos by dividing them into smaller segments, allowing PipeFlow's editing time to increase linearly with video length. In principle, this enables editing of infinitely long videos without the growing per-frame computational overhead encountered by other methods.

To capture these constructs, we designed and validated a self-report questionnaire through a 63-participant online study. Results confirm the psychological distinctiveness of these constructs and their explanatory power across two scenarios (kitchen and living room).

Meeting these conflicting requirements remains challenging, as satisfying this combination typically necessitates heavier actuators and bulkier transmission systems, significantly restricting the payload capacity of robot arms. In this letter, we present a lightweight anthropomorphic hand actuated by Bowden cables, which uniquely combines rolling-contact joint optimization with antagonistic cable actuation, enabling single-motor-per-joint control with negligible cable-length deviation. By relocating the actuator module to the torso, the design substantially reduces distal mass while maintaining anthropomorphic scale and dexterity. Additionally, this antagonistic cable actuation eliminates the need for synchronization between motors. Using the proposed methods, the hand assembly with a distal mass of 236g (excluding remote actuators and Bowden sheaths) demonstrated reliable execution of dexterous tasks, exceeding 18N fingertip force and lifting payloads over one hundred times its own mass.

Anisotropic diffusion is a wide family of image denoising approaches with promising performance. However, traditional anisotropic diffusion approaches use explicit diffusion operators which are not well adapted to complex image structures. As a result, their performance is limited compared to recent learning-based approaches. In this work, we describe a trainable anisotropic diffusion framework based on reinforcement learning. By modeling the denoising process as a series of naive diffusion actions with order learned by deep Q-learning, we propose an effective diffusion-based image denoiser. The diffusion actions selected by deep Q-learning at different iterations indeed composite a stochastic anisotropic diffusion process with strong adaptivity to different image structures, which enjoys improvement over the traditional ones.

While large language models possess broad domain knowledge, they often fail to capture dataset-specific patterns critical for prediction tasks. Our approach addresses this by discovering semantic feature descriptions through an iterative process that contrasts groups of items identified via statistical modeling errors, rather than relying solely on the foundational model's domain understanding. We formulate this as a generalized EM algorithm that jointly optimizes semantic feature descriptors and statistical model parameters. The method prompts a frozen foundational model to classify items based on discovered features, treating these judgments as noisy observations of latent binary features that predict real-valued targets through learned statistical relationships. We demonstrate the approach on two domains: house price prediction (hedonic regression) and cold-start collaborative filtering for movie recommendations. On house prices, our model achieves 12\\% median relative error using discovered semantic features from multimodal listing data, substantially outperforming a GPT-5 baseline (38\\% error) that relies on the LLM's general domain knowledge. For Netflix movie embeddings, our model predicts collaborative filtering representations with 0.59 cosine similarity purely from semantic descriptions -- matching the performance that would require approximately 4000 user ratings through traditional collaborative filtering.

Given the real-time and continuous nature of robotic motion control, the strategies for fusing a queue of successive action chunks have a profound impact on the overall performance of VLA models. Existing methods suffer from jitter, stalling, or even pauses in robotic action execution, which not only limits the achievable execution speed but also reduces the overall success rate of task completion. This paper introduces VLA-RAIL (A Real-Time Asynchronous Inference Linker), a novel framework designed to address these issues by conducting model inference and robot motion control asynchronously and guaranteeing smooth, continuous, and high-speed action execution. The core contributions of the paper are two fold: a Trajectory Smoother that effectively filters out the noise and jitter in the trajectory of one action chunk using polynomial fitting and a Chunk Fuser that seamlessly align the current executing trajectory and the newly arrived chunk, ensuring position, velocity, and acceleration continuity between two successive action chunks. We validate the effectiveness of VLA-RAIL on a benchmark of dynamic simulation tasks and several real-world manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that VLA-RAIL significantly reduces motion jitter, enhances execution speed, and improves task success rates, which will become a key infrastructure for the large-scale deployment of VLA models.", "AI": {"tldr": "VLA-RAIL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u5757\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u7684\u6296\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6296\u52a8\u3001\u505c\u6ede\u751a\u81f3\u6682\u505c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6267\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86VLA-RAIL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e73\u6ed1\u5668\uff08\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u62df\u5408\uff09\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u5757\u878d\u5408\u5668\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u52a8\u4f5c\u5757\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVLA-RAIL\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u64cd\u63a7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6296\u52a8\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "VLA-RAIL \u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u5757\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u6296\u52a8\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6267\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u4e3aVLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002"}}

However, since it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to collect large-scale and well-annotated data, the annotation of multi-modal data inevitably contains some noise. This will degrade the retrieval performance of the model. To tackle the problem, numerous robust CMR methods have been developed, including robust learning paradigms, label calibration strategies, and instance selection mechanisms. Unfortunately, they often fail to simultaneously satisfy model performance ceilings, calibration reliability, and data utilization rate. To overcome the limitations, we propose a novel robust cross-modal learning framework, namely Neighbor-aware Instance Refining with Noisy Labels (NIRNL). Specifically, we first propose Cross-modal Margin Preserving (CMP) to adjust the relative distance between positive and negative pairs, thereby enhancing the discrimination between sample pairs. Then, we propose Neighbor-aware Instance Refining (NIR) to identify pure subset, hard subset, and noisy subset through cross-modal neighborhood consensus. Afterward, we construct different tailored optimization strategies for this fine-grained partitioning, thereby maximizing the utilization of all available data while mitigating error propagation.

This paper proposes an informative trajectory planning approach, namely ReSPIRe, for SAT in unknown cluttered environments under considerably inaccurate prior target information and limited sensing field of view. We first develop a novel sigma point-based approximation approach to fast and accurately estimate mutual information reward under non-Gaussian belief distributions, utilizing informative sampling in state and observation spaces to mitigate the computational intractability of integral calculation. To tackle significant uncertainty associated with inadequate prior target information, we propose the hierarchical particle structure in ReSPIRe, which not only extracts critical particles for global route guidance, but also adjusts the particle number adaptively for planning efficiency. Building upon the hierarchical structure, we develop the reusable belief tree search approach to build a policy tree for online trajectory planning under uncertainty, which reuses rollout evaluation to improve planning efficiency. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that ReSPIRe outperforms representative benchmark methods with smaller MI approximation error, higher search efficiency, and more stable tracking performance, while maintaining outstanding computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReSPIRe\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u672a\u77e5\u6742\u4e71\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7sigma\u70b9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u7c92\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u6742\u4e71\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3001\u5148\u9a8c\u76ee\u6807\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u611f\u77e5\u89c6\u91ce\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff08SAT\uff09\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8esigma\u70b9\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5feb\u901f\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u7c92\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5728\u7ebf\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cReSPIRe\u5728\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ReSPIRe\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff08SAT\uff09\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u548c\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Then CREPES-X implements a two-stage hierarchical estimator to meet different requirements, considering speed, accuracy, and robustness. First, we propose a single-frame relative estimator that provides instant relative poses for multi-robot setups through a closed-form solution and robust bearing outlier rejection. Then a multi-frame relative estimator is designed to offer accurate and robust relative states by exploring IMU pre-integration via robocentric relative kinematics with loosely- and tightly-coupled optimization.

However, embedding this semantic hierarchy into the representation learning space to improve fine-grained detection performance remains challenging. Previous studies have applied supervised contrastive learning at different hierarchical levels to group objects under the same parent class while distinguishing sibling subcategories. Nevertheless, they overlook two critical issues: (1) imbalanced data distribution across the label hierarchy causes high-frequency classes to dominate the learning process, and (2) learning semantic relationships among categories interferes with class-agnostic localization. To address these issues, we propose a balanced hierarchical contrastive loss combined with a decoupled learning strategy within the detection transformer (DETR) framework.

Submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "Generating dynamic motions for legged robots remains a challenging problem. While reinforcement learning has achieved notable success in various legged locomotion tasks, producing highly dynamic behaviors often requires extensive reward tuning or high-quality demonstrations. Leveraging reduced-order models can help mitigate these challenges. However, the model discrepancy poses a significant challenge when transferring policies to full-body dynamics environments. In this work, we introduce a continuation-based learning framework that combines simplified model pretraining and model homotopy transfer to efficiently generate and refine complex dynamic behaviors. First, we pretrain the policy using a single rigid body model to capture core motion patterns in a simplified environment. Next, we employ a continuation strategy to progressively transfer the policy to the full-body environment, minimizing performance loss. To define the continuation path, we introduce a model homotopy from the single rigid body model to the full-body model by gradually redistributing mass and inertia between the trunk and legs. The proposed method not only achieves faster convergence but also demonstrates superior stability during the transfer process compared to baseline methods. Our framework is validated on a range of dynamic tasks, including flips and wall-assisted maneuvers, and is successfully deployed on a real quadrupedal robot.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u540c\u4f26\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u817f\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u817f\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u751f\u6210\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u5956\u52b1\u8c03\u6574\u6216\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6f14\u793a\u3002\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u8fc1\u79fb\u65f6\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u5355\u521a\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u540c\u4f26\u8f6c\u79fb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u5c06\u7b56\u7565\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u5168\u8eab\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u60ef\u91cf\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u5b9a\u4e49\u8f6c\u79fb\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u7ffb\u8f6c\u548c\u5899\u58c1\u8f85\u52a9\u673a\u52a8\uff09\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u8fc1\u79fb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e5f\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u540c\u4f26\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

Furthermore, with hardware advancements, a wide range of devices besides graphics processing unit (GPU), such as application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), have been increasingly adopted for model inference. Sparse attention, which leverages the inherent sparsity of attention by skipping computations for insignificant tokens, is an effective approach to mitigate computational costs. However, existing sparse attention methods have two critical limitations: the overhead of sparse pattern prediction and the lack of hardware generality, as most of these methods are designed for GPU. To address these challenges, this study proposes RainFusion2.0, which aims to develop an online adaptive, hardware-efficient, and low-overhead sparse attention mechanism to accelerate both video and image generative models, with robust performance across diverse hardware platforms. Key technical insights include: (1) leveraging block-wise mean values as representative tokens for sparse mask prediction; (2) implementing spatiotemporal-aware token permutation; and (3) introducing a first-frame sink mechanism specifically designed for video generation scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RainFusion2.0 can achieve 80% sparsity while achieving an end-to-end speedup of 1.5~1.8x without compromising video quality.

By testing this mechanism on various planning domains, we observe substantial improvements in planning skills, with later models displaying emergent generalization by discovering much longer plans than the initial models. We then provide theoretical analysis showing that iterative deployment effectively implements reinforcement learning (RL) training in the outer-loop (i.e. not as part of intentional model training), with an implicit reward function. The connection to RL has two important implications: first, for the field of AI safety, as the reward function entailed by repeated deployment is not defined explicitly, and could have unexpected implications to the properties of future model deployments. Second, the mechanism highlighted here can be viewed as an alternative training regime to explicit RL, relying on data curation rather than explicit rewards.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fed\u4ee3\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u7528\u6237\u7b5b\u9009\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03LLMs\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u9690\u542b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5bf9AI\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u8fed\u4ee3\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cdLLMs\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c4\u5212\u9886\u57df\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fed\u4ee3\u90e8\u7f72\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u53ca\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "result": "\u8fed\u4ee3\u90e8\u7f72\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540e\u7eed\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u957f\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u673a\u5236\u9690\u542b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5916\u5faa\u73af\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fed\u4ee3\u90e8\u7f72\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u7cbe\u5fc3\u7b5b\u9009\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Many of these semantic constraints, such as yielding to emergency vehicles, complying with traffic officers' gestures, or stopping for school buses, are intuitive for humans yet difficult to encode explicitly. Although large vision-language models (VLMs) can interpret such semantics, their inference cost makes them impractical for real-time deployment.This work proposes LSRE, a Latent Semantic Rule Encoding framework that converts sparsely sampled VLM judgments into decision boundaries within the latent space of a recurrent world model. By encoding language-defined safety semantics into a lightweight latent classifier, LSRE enables real-time semantic risk assessment at 10 Hz without per-frame VLM queries. Experiments on six semantic-failure scenarios in CARLA demonstrate that LSRE attains semantic risk detection accuracy comparable to a large VLM baseline, while providing substantially earlier hazard anticipation and maintaining low computational latency.

We observe that two main factors in video understanding (i.e., temporal grounding and textual response) form a logical hierarchy: accurate temporal evidence grounding lays the foundation for reliable textual response. However, existing works typically handle these two tasks in a coupled manner without a clear logical structure, leading to sub-optimal objectives. We address this from a factorized learning perspective. We first propose D$^2$VLM, a framework that decouples the learning of these two tasks while also emphasizing their inherent dependency. We adopt a \"grounding then answering with evidence referencing\" paradigm and introduce evidence tokens for evidence grounding, which emphasize event-level visual semantic capture beyond the focus on timestamp representation in existing works. To further facilitate the learning of these two tasks, we introduce a novel factorized preference optimization (FPO) algorithm. Unlike standard preference optimization, FPO explicitly incorporates probabilistic temporal grounding modeling into the optimization objective, enabling preference learning for both temporal grounding and textual response. We also construct a synthetic dataset to address the lack of suitable datasets for factorized preference learning with explicit temporal grounding.

This paper explores an edge ML approach to microrobot locomotion, allowing for on-device, lower latency control under compute, memory, and power constraints. This paper explores the locomotion of a sub-centimeter quadrupedal microrobot via reinforcement learning (RL) and deploys the resulting controller on an ultra-small system-on-chip (SoC), SC$\u03bc$M-3C, featuring an ARM Cortex-M0 microcontroller running at 5 MHz. We train a compact FP32 multilayer perceptron (MLP) policy with two hidden layers ($[128, 64]$) in a massively parallel GPU simulation and enhance robustness by utilizing domain randomization over simulation parameters. We then study integer (Int8) quantization (per-tensor and per-feature) to allow for higher inference update rates on our resource-limited hardware, and we connect hardware power budgets to achievable update frequency via a cycles-per-update model for inference on our Cortex-M0. We propose a resource-aware gait scheduling viewpoint: given a device power budget, we can select the gait mode (trot/intermediate/gallop) that maximizes expected RL reward at a corresponding feasible update frequency. Finally, we deploy our MLP policy on a real-world large-scale robot on uneven terrain, qualitatively noting that domain-randomized training can improve out-of-distribution stability.

While effective for simple actions, this System 1 approach faces a fundamental theoretical bottleneck we identify as the Semantic-Kinematic Impedance Mismatch: the inherent difficulty of grounding semantically dense, discrete linguistic intent into kinematically dense, high-frequency motion data in a single shot. In this paper, we argue that the solution lies in an architectural shift towards Latent System 2 Reasoning. Drawing inspiration from Hierarchical Motor Control in cognitive science, we propose Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR) that reformulates generation as a two-stage Think-then-Act decision process. Central to LMR is a novel Dual-Granularity Tokenizer that disentangles motion into two distinct manifolds: a compressed, semantically rich Reasoning Latent for planning global topology, and a high-frequency Execution Latent for preserving physical fidelity. By forcing the model to autoregressively reason (plan the coarse trajectory) before it moves (instantiates the frames), we effectively bridge the ineffability gap between language and physics. We demonstrate LMR's versatility by implementing it for two representative baselines: T2M-GPT (discrete) and MotionStreamer (continuous). Extensive experiments show that LMR yields non-trivial improvements in both semantic alignment and physical plausibility, validating that the optimal substrate for motion planning is not natural language, but a learned, motion-aligned concept space.

Yet, it remains a challenge to translate such human-led motions into the low-level actions demanded by robotic systems. We observe that given an initial image and task instruction, these models excel at synthesizing sensible object motions. Thus, we introduce Dream2Flow, a framework that bridges video generation and robotic control through 3D object flow as an intermediate representation. Our method reconstructs 3D object motions from generated videos and formulates manipulation as object trajectory tracking. By separating the state changes from the actuators that realize those changes, Dream2Flow overcomes the embodiment gap and enables zero-shot guidance from pre-trained video models to manipulate objects of diverse categories-including rigid, articulated, deformable, and granular.

Errors in depth estimation may propagate through downstream decision making and influence overall traffic safety. Existing physical attacks primarily rely on texture-based patches, which impose strict placement constraints and exhibit limited realism, thereby reducing their effectiveness in complex driving environments. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces a training-free generative adversarial attack framework that generates naturalistic, scene-consistent adversarial objects via a diffusion-based conditional generation process. The framework incorporates a Salient Region Selection module that identifies regions most influential to MDE and a Jacobian Vector Product Guidance mechanism that steers adversarial gradients toward update directions supported by the pre-trained diffusion model. This formulation enables the generation of physically plausible adversarial objects capable of inducing substantial adversarial depth shifts.

Furthermore, fine-grained functional elements like small handles are frequently missed by general object detectors.

Building on the task-agnostic NNGPT/LEMUR framework, this work introduces and validates two key contributions for computer vision. First, we present Few-Shot Architecture Prompting (FSAP), the first systematic study of the number of supporting examples (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) for LLM-based architecture generation. We find that using n = 3 examples best balances architectural diversity and context focus for vision tasks. Second, we introduce Whitespace-Normalized Hash Validation, a lightweight deduplication method (less than 1 ms) that provides a 100x speedup over AST parsing and prevents redundant training of duplicate computer vision architectures. In large-scale experiments across seven computer vision benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CelebA, ImageNette, SVHN, Places365), we generated 1,900 unique architectures. We also introduce a dataset-balanced evaluation methodology to address the challenge of comparing architectures across heterogeneous vision tasks. These contributions provide actionable guidelines for LLM-based architecture search in computer vision and establish rigorous evaluation practices, making automated design more accessible to researchers with limited computational resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86LLM\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u67b6\u6784\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51faFSAP\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u53bb\u91cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u72ec\u7279\u67b6\u6784\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9650\u5236\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u6548\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002LLMs\u4f5c\u4e3aNAS\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u6f5c\u529b\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u67b6\u6784\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51faFew-Shot Architecture Prompting\uff08FSAP\uff09\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u793a\u4f8b\u6570\u91cf\uff08n=1-6\uff09\u5bf9LLM\u751f\u6210\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0n=3\u65f6\u6700\u4f73\u30022. \u5f15\u5165Whitespace-Normalized Hash Validation\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53bb\u91cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08<1ms\uff09\uff0c\u6bd4AST\u89e3\u6790\u5feb100\u500d\u3002", "result": "\u57287\u4e2a\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u751f\u62101,900\u4e2a\u72ec\u7279\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e73\u8861\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5f02\u6784\u4efb\u52a1\u6bd4\u8f83\u96be\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7Few-Shot Architecture Prompting\uff08FSAP\uff09\u548cWhitespace-Normalized Hash Validation\u4e24\u9879\u5173\u952e\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u7684LLM\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4e5f\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

However, while existing methods achieve high scores on automated reward metrics, they often lead to Preference Mode Collapse (PMC)-a specific form of reward hacking where models converge on narrow, high-scoring outputs (e.g., images with monolithic styles or pervasive overexposure), severely degrading generative diversity. In this work, we introduce and quantify this phenomenon, proposing DivGenBench, a novel benchmark designed to measure the extent of PMC. We posit that this collapse is driven by over-optimization along the reward model's inherent biases. Building on this analysis, we propose Directional Decoupling Alignment (D$^2$-Align), a novel framework that mitigates PMC by directionally correcting the reward signal. Specifically, our method first learns a directional correction within the reward model's embedding space while keeping the model frozen. This correction is then applied to the reward signal during the optimization process, preventing the model from collapsing into specific modes and thereby maintaining diversity. Our comprehensive evaluation, combining qualitative analysis with quantitative metrics for both quality and diversity, reveals that D$^2$-Align achieves superior alignment with human preference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faD$^2$-Align\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u4fee\u6b63\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u597d\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5f97\u5206\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5bb9\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u504f\u597d\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\uff08PMC\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u6536\u655b\u4e8e\u72ed\u7a84\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u635f\u5bb3\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Directional Decoupling Alignment\uff08D$^2$-Align\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u8fd9\u4e00\u4fee\u6b63\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u5230\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cD$^2$-Align\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u7684\u66f4\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "D$^2$-Align\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u4fee\u6b63\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u504f\u597d\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\uff08PMC\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u7684\u66f4\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002"}}

Self-distillation methods aim to mitigate this by leveraging inter-class and sample-specific information present in the model's own predictions, but often remain dependent on hard targets, reducing their effectiveness. With this in mind, we propose Bayesian Self-Distillation (BSD), a principled method for constructing sample-specific target distributions via Bayesian inference using the model's own predictions. Unlike existing approaches, BSD does not rely on hard targets after initialization.

Despite advances in humanoid control, bridging high-level multimodal perception with whole-body execution remains a significant bottleneck. Existing methods often struggle to translate heterogeneous instructions -- such as language, music, and trajectories -- into stable, real-time actions. Here we show that UniAct, a two-stage framework integrating a fine-tuned MLLM with a causal streaming pipeline, enables humanoid robots to execute multimodal instructions with sub-500 ms latency. By unifying inputs through a shared discrete codebook via FSQ, UniAct ensures cross-modal alignment while constraining motions to a physically grounded manifold. This approach yields a 19% improvement in the success rate of zero-shot tracking of imperfect reference motions. We validate UniAct on UniMoCap, our 20-hour humanoid motion benchmark, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse real-world scenarios.

This paper presents a comprehensive framework for multi-modal pre-training, identifying the core set of techniques driving progress toward this goal. We dissect the interplay between foundational sensor characteristics and learning strategies, evaluating the role of platform-specific datasets in enabling these advancements. Our central contribution is the formulation of a unified taxonomy for pre-training paradigms: ranging from single-modality baselines to sophisticated unified frameworks that learn holistic representations for advanced tasks like 3D object detection and semantic occupancy prediction.

While foundation models pre-trained on large remote sensing datasets show promise, their learned representations often fail to transfer to domain-specific applications like close-range agricultural monitoring where spectral signatures, spatial scales, and semantic targets differ fundamentally. This report presents Deep Global Clustering (DGC), a conceptual framework for memory-efficient HSI segmentation that learns global clustering structure from local patch observations without pre-training. DGC operates on small patches with overlapping regions to enforce consistency, enabling training in under 30 minutes on consumer hardware while maintaining constant memory usage. On a leaf disease dataset, DGC achieves background-tissue separation (mean IoU 0.925) and demonstrates unsupervised disease detection through navigable semantic granularity. However, the framework suffers from optimization instability rooted in multi-objective loss balancing: meaningful representations emerge rapidly but degrade due to cluster over-merging in feature space. We position this work as intellectual scaffolding - the design philosophy has merit, but stable implementation requires principled approaches to dynamic loss balancing.

However, due to the lack of sufficient training and data to learn to cover low-probability areas, the model will be penalized for failing to generate high-quality images corresponding to these areas. To achieve better generation quality, guidance strategies such as classifier free guidance (CFG) can guide the samples to the high-probability areas during the sampling stage. However, the standard CFG often leads to over-simplified or distorted samples. On the other hand, the alternative line of guiding diffusion model with its bad version is limited by carefully designed degradation strategies, extra training and additional sampling steps. In this paper, we proposed a simple yet effective strategy Internal Guidance (IG), which introduces an auxiliary supervision on the intermediate layer during training process and extrapolates the intermediate and deep layer's outputs to obtain generative results during sampling process. This simple strategy yields significant improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality on various baselines.

Potato yield can be estimated on harvesters using RGB-D cameras, which capture three-dimensional (3D) information of individual tubers moving along the conveyor belt. However, point clouds reconstructed from RGB-D images are incomplete due to self-occlusion, leading to systematic underestimation of tuber weight. To address this, we introduce PointRAFT, a high-throughput point cloud regression network that directly predicts continuous 3D shape properties, such as tuber weight, from partial point clouds. Rather than reconstructing full 3D geometry, PointRAFT infers target values directly from raw 3D data. Its key architectural novelty is an object height embedding that incorporates tuber height as an additional geometric cue, improving weight prediction under practical harvesting conditions. PointRAFT was trained and evaluated on 26,688 partial point clouds collected from 859 potato tubers across four cultivars and three growing seasons on an operational harvester in Japan. On a test set of 5,254 point clouds from 172 tubers, PointRAFT achieved a mean absolute error of 12.0 g and a root mean squared error of 17.2 g, substantially outperforming a linear regression baseline and a standard PointNet++ regression network. With an average inference time of 6.3 ms per point cloud, PointRAFT supports processing rates of up to 150 tubers per second, meeting the high-throughput requirements of commercial potato harvesters. Beyond potato weight estimation, PointRAFT provides a versatile regression network applicable to a wide range of 3D phenotyping and robotic perception tasks.

Contemporary trackers in this domain rely on the motion of objects rather than appearance for association. Nevertheless, they struggle to maintain object identities when targets undergo frequent and strong occlusions. The high similarity of object appearances makes integrating appearance-based association nontrivial for agricultural scenarios. To solve this problem we propose CropTrack, a novel MOT framework based on the combination of appearance and motion information.

Recent works have demonstrated that the iterative denoising process of DiT models involves substantial redundant computation across steps. To effectively reduce the redundant computation in DiT, we propose CorGi (Contribution-Guided Block-Wise Interval Caching), training-free DiT inference acceleration framework that selectively reuses the outputs of transformer blocks in DiT across denoising steps. CorGi caches low-contribution blocks and reuses them in later steps within each interval to reduce redundant computation while preserving generation quality. For text-to-image tasks, we further propose CorGi+, which leverages per-block cross-attention maps to identify salient tokens and applies partial attention updates to protect important object details.

Our work investigates this potential in the context of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) by introducing a unified and extensible evaluation framework to probe MLLMs as zero-shot agents by bridging traditional navigation datasets into a standardized benchmark, named VLN-MME. We simplify the evaluation with a highly modular and accessible design. This flexibility streamlines experiments, enabling structured comparisons and component-level ablations across diverse MLLM architectures, agent designs, and navigation tasks. Crucially, enabled by our framework, we observe that enhancing our baseline agent with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and self-reflection leads to an unexpected performance decrease. This suggests MLLMs exhibit poor context awareness in embodied navigation tasks; although they can follow instructions and structure their output, their 3D spatial reasoning fidelity is low. VLN-MME lays the groundwork for systematic evaluation of general-purpose MLLMs in embodied navigation settings and reveals limitations in their sequential decision-making capabilities.

This challenge arises when there is a significant disparity in the number of images belonging to a particular class, such as the presence or absence of a specific disease, as compared to the number of images belonging to other classes.

Researchers have employed various approaches in recent years to detect COVID-19 infected individuals accurately and quickly, with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms at the forefront. However, the lack of sufficient and balanced data remains a significant obstacle to these methods. This study addresses the challenge by proposing a progressive generative adversarial network to generate synthetic data to supplement the real ones. The proposed method suggests a weighted approach to combine synthetic data with real ones before inputting it into a deep network classifier. A multi-objective meta-heuristic population-based optimization algorithm is employed to optimize the hyper-parameters of the classifier. The proposed model exhibits superior cross-validated metrics compared to existing methods when applied to a large and imbalanced chest X-ray image dataset of COVID-19.

Existing benchmarks evaluate their capabilities under ideal, well-lit conditions, yet robust 24/7 operation demands performance under a wide range of visual degradations, including low-light conditions at night or in dark environments--a core necessity that has been largely overlooked. To address this underexplored challenge, we present DarkEQA, an open-source benchmark for evaluating EQA-relevant perceptual primitives under multi-level low-light conditions. DarkEQA isolates the perception bottleneck by evaluating question answering from egocentric observations under controlled degradations, enabling attributable robustness analysis. A key design feature of DarkEQA is its physical fidelity: visual degradations are modeled in linear RAW space, simulating physics-based illumination drop and sensor noise followed by an ISP-inspired rendering pipeline.

Existing training-free methods attempt to resolve this by either importing priors from costly external foundation models (e.g., SAM, DINO) or by applying static, hand-crafted heuristics to CLIP's internal features. These approaches are either computationally expensive or sub-optimal. We propose the Attention Refinement Module (ARM), a lightweight, learnable module that effectively unlocks and refines CLIP's internal potential. Unlike static-fusion methods, ARM learns to adaptively fuse hierarchical features. It employs a semantically-guided cross-attention block, using robust deep features (K, V) to select and refine detail-rich shallow features (Q), followed by a self-attention block. The key innovation lies in a ``train once, use anywhere\" paradigm. Trained once on a general-purpose dataset (e.g., COCO-Stuff), ARM acts as a universal plug-and-play post-processor for diverse training-free frameworks.

Given a monocular video, SpaceTimePilot can independently alter the camera viewpoint and the motion sequence within the generative process, re-rendering the scene for continuous and arbitrary exploration across space and time. To achieve this, we introduce an effective animation time-embedding mechanism in the diffusion process, allowing explicit control of the output video's motion sequence with respect to that of the source video. As no datasets provide paired videos of the same dynamic scene with continuous temporal variations, we propose a simple yet effective temporal-warping training scheme that repurposes existing multi-view datasets to mimic temporal differences. This strategy effectively supervises the model to learn temporal control and achieve robust space-time disentanglement. To further enhance the precision of dual control, we introduce two additional components: an improved camera-conditioning mechanism that allows altering the camera from the first frame, and CamxTime, the first synthetic space-and-time full-coverage rendering dataset that provides fully free space-time video trajectories within a scene. Joint training on the temporal-warping scheme and the CamxTime dataset yields more precise temporal control. We evaluate SpaceTimePilot on both real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating clear space-time disentanglement and strong results compared to prior work.

While video object editing offers a promising path for data augmentation, existing methods often struggle to maintain both high visual fidelity and temporal coherence. In this work, we propose \\textbf{Mirage}, a one-step video diffusion model for photorealistic and coherent asset editing in driving scenes. Mirage builds upon a text-to-video diffusion prior to ensure temporal consistency across frames. However, 3D causal variational autoencoders often suffer from degraded spatial fidelity due to compression, and directly passing 3D encoder features to decoder layers breaks temporal causality. To address this, we inject temporally agnostic latents from a pretrained 2D encoder into the 3D decoder to restore detail while preserving causal structures. Furthermore, because scene objects and inserted assets are optimized under different objectives, their Gaussians exhibit a distribution mismatch that leads to pose misalignment. To mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage data alignment strategy combining coarse 3D alignment and fine 2D refinement, thereby improving alignment and providing cleaner supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mirage achieves high realism and temporal consistency across diverse editing scenarios. Beyond asset editing, Mirage can also generalize to other video-to-video translation tasks, serving as a reliable baseline for future research.

Current state-of-the-art FER models tend to have weak generalization when tested on diverse data, leading to deteriorated performance in the real world and hindering FER as a research domain. Though researchers have proposed complex architectures to address this generalization issue, they require training cross-domain to obtain generalizable results, which is inherently contradictory for real-world application. Our model, MotivNet, achieves competitive performance across datasets without cross-domain training by using Meta-Sapiens as a backbone. Sapiens is a human vision foundational model with state-of-the-art generalization in the real world through large-scale pretraining of a Masked Autoencoder. We propose MotivNet as an additional downstream task for Sapiens and define three criteria to evaluate MotivNet's viability as a Sapiens task: benchmark performance, model similarity, and data similarity. Throughout this paper, we describe the components of MotivNet, our training approach, and our results showing MotivNet is generalizable across domains. We demonstrate that MotivNet can be benchmarked against existing SOTA models and meets the listed criteria, validating MotivNet as a Sapiens downstream task, and making FER more incentivizing for in-the-wild application.

While RGB-based methods have achieved strong performance with CNNs and Transformers, their effectiveness degrades under fast motion, low-light, or high dynamic range conditions due to limitations of frame cameras. Event cameras offer complementary advantages such as high temporal resolution and low latency, yet lack color and texture, making them insufficient on their own. To address this, recent research has explored multimodal fusion of RGB and event data; however, many existing approaches are computationally expensive and focus primarily on spatial fusion, neglecting the temporal dynamics inherent in event streams. In this work, we propose MambaSeg, a novel dual-branch semantic segmentation framework that employs parallel Mamba encoders to efficiently model RGB images and event streams. To reduce cross-modal ambiguity, we introduce the Dual-Dimensional Interaction Module (DDIM), comprising a Cross-Spatial Interaction Module (CSIM) and a Cross-Temporal Interaction Module (CTIM), which jointly perform fine-grained fusion along both spatial and temporal dimensions. This design improves cross-modal alignment, reduces ambiguity, and leverages the complementary properties of each modality.

Current deep learning for Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR) faces limitations: supervised methods suffer from spectral blurring due to \"regression-to-the-mean\", while unsupervised ones risk structural hallucinations. Denoising Diffusion Models (DDPMs) offer realism but rely on slow, stochastic iterative sampling, unsuitable for clinical use. To resolve this, we propose the Physically-Grounded Manifold Projection (PGMP) framework. First, our Anatomically-Adaptive Physics Simulation (AAPS) pipeline synthesizes high-fidelity training pairs via Monte Carlo spectral modeling and patient-specific digital twins, bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Second, our DMP-Former adapts the Direct x-Prediction paradigm, reformulating restoration as a deterministic manifold projection to recover clean anatomy in a single forward pass, eliminating stochastic sampling. Finally, a Semantic-Structural Alignment (SSA) module anchors the solution using priors from medical foundation models (MedDINOv3), ensuring clinical plausibility. Experiments on synthetic and multi-center clinical datasets show PGMP outperforms state-of-the-art methods on unseen anatomy, setting new benchmarks in efficiency and diagnostic reliability.

However, they suffer from a critical vulnerability: an over-reliance on language priors, which can lead to visual ungrounded hallucinations, especially when processing counterfactual videos that defy common sense. This limitation, stemming from the intrinsic data imbalance between text and video, is challenging to address due to the substantial cost of collecting and annotating counterfactual data. To address this, we introduce DualityForge, a novel counterfactual data synthesis framework that employs controllable, diffusion-based video editing to transform real-world videos into counterfactual scenarios. By embedding structured contextual information into the video editing and QA generation processes, the framework automatically produces high-quality QA pairs together with original-edited video pairs for contrastive training. Based on this, we build DualityVidQA, a large-scale video dataset designed to reduce MLLM hallucinations. In addition, to fully exploit the contrastive nature of our paired data, we propose Duality-Normalized Advantage Training (DNA-Train), a two-stage SFT-RL training regime where the RL phase applies pair-wise $\\ell_1$ advantage normalization, thereby enabling a more stable and efficient policy optimization. Experiments on DualityVidQA-Test demonstrate that our method substantially reduces model hallucinations on counterfactual videos, yielding a relative improvement of 24.0% over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline. Moreover, our approach achieves significant gains across both hallucination and general-purpose benchmarks, indicating strong generalization capability.

While effective for scenes that are approximately coplanar or exhibit minimal parallax, these approaches often result in ghosting, structural bending, and stretching distortions in non-overlapping regions when applied to real three-dimensional scenes characterized by multiple depth layers and occlusions. Such challenges are exacerbated in multi-view accumulations and 360\u00b0 closed-loop stitching scenarios. In response, this study introduces a spatially lifted panoramic stitching framework that initially elevates each input image into a dense three-dimensional point representation within a unified coordinate system, facilitating global cross-view fusion augmented by confidence metrics. Subsequently, a unified projection center is established in three-dimensional space, and an equidistant cylindrical projection is employed to map the fused data onto a single panoramic manifold, thereby producing a geometrically consistent 360\u00b0 panoramic layout. Finally, hole filling is conducted within the canvas domain to address unknown regions revealed by viewpoint transitions, restoring continuous texture and semantic coherence. This framework reconceptualizes stitching from a two-dimensional warping paradigm to a three-dimensional consistency paradigm and is designed to flexibly incorporate various three-dimensional lifting and completion modules. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method substantially mitigates geometric distortions and ghosting artifacts in scenarios involving significant parallax and complex occlusions, yielding panoramic results that are more natural and consistent.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e09\u7ef4\u5168\u666f\u62fc\u63a5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u7ef4\u70b9\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u62fc\u63a5\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e09\u7ef4\u573a\u666f\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u591a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5c42\u548c\u906e\u6321\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u975e\u91cd\u53e0\u533a\u57df\u7684\u9b3c\u5f71\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5f2f\u66f2\u548c\u62c9\u4f38\u5931\u771f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u7d2f\u79ef\u548c360\u00b0\u95ed\u73af\u62fc\u63a5\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u5168\u666f\u62fc\u63a5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u5c06\u6bcf\u5f20\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u5347\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e09\u7ef4\u70b9\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u589e\u5f3a\u5168\u5c40\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u878d\u5408\u3002\u968f\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u7b49\u8ddd\u5706\u67f1\u6295\u5f71\u5c06\u878d\u5408\u6570\u636e\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5355\u4e2a\u5168\u666f\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u753b\u5e03\u57df\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u5b54\u6d1e\u586b\u5145\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u70b9\u8f6c\u6362\u63ed\u793a\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u663e\u8457\u89c6\u5dee\u548c\u590d\u6742\u906e\u6321\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u5931\u771f\u548c\u91cd\u5f71\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u62fc\u63a5\u4ece\u4e8c\u7ef4\u53d8\u5f62\u8303\u5f0f\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u60f3\u4e3a\u4e09\u7ef4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5728\u663e\u8457\u89c6\u5dee\u548c\u590d\u6742\u906e\u6321\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5931\u771f\u548c\u91cd\u5f71\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u7684360\u00b0\u5168\u666f\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

By leveraging language-guided concept disentanglement, EndoRare separates pathognomonic lesion features from non-diagnostic attributes, encoding the former into a learnable prototype embedding while varying the latter to ensure diversity. We validated the framework across four rare pathologies (calcifying fibrous tumor, juvenile polyposis syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome). Synthetic images were judged clinically plausible by experts and, when used for data augmentation, significantly enhanced downstream AI classifiers, improving the true positive rate at low false-positive rates. Crucially, a blinded reader study demonstrated that novice endoscopists exposed to EndoRare-generated cases achieved a 0.400 increase in recall and a 0.267 increase in precision.

We develop and validate Virtual-Eyes, a clinically motivated 16-bit CT quality-control pipeline, and measure its differential impact on generalist foundation models versus specialist models.

Virtual-Eyes improves RAD-DINO slice-level AUC from 0.576 to 0.610 and patient-level AUC from 0.646 to 0.683 (mean pooling) and from 0.619 to 0.735 (max pooling), with improved calibration (Brier score 0.188 to 0.112). In contrast, Sybil and ResNet-18 degrade under Virtual-Eyes (Sybil AUC 0.886 to 0.837; ResNet-18 AUC 0.571 to 0.596) with evidence of context dependence and shortcut learning, and Merlin shows limited transferability (AUC approximately 0.507 to 0.567) regardless of preprocessing.

This task is critical for understanding egocentric human behavior. However, achieving such segmentation robustly is challenging due to ambiguities inherent in egocentric videos and biases present in training data. Consequently, existing methods often struggle, learning spurious correlations from skewed object-action pairings in datasets and fundamental visual confounding factors of the egocentric perspective, such as rapid motion and frequent occlusions. To address these limitations, we introduce Causal Ego-REferring Segmentation (CERES), a plug-in causal framework that adapts strong, pre-trained RVOS backbones to the egocentric domain. CERES implements dual-modal causal intervention: applying backdoor adjustment principles to counteract language representation biases learned from dataset statistics, and leveraging front-door adjustment concepts to address visual confounding by intelligently integrating semantic visual features with geometric depth information guided by causal principles, creating representations more robust to egocentric distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CERES achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ego-RVOS benchmarks, highlighting the potential of applying causal reasoning to build more reliable models for broader egocentric video understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "CERES\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\u5e72\u9884\u89e3\u51b3Ego-RVOS\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Ego-RVOS\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u56e0\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u9891\u56fa\u6709\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "CERES\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u95e8\u8c03\u6574\u539f\u5219\u62b5\u6d88\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u524d\u95e8\u8c03\u6574\u6982\u5ff5\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5bf9\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u89d2\u626d\u66f2\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "CERES\u5728Ego-RVOS\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "CERES\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Ego-RVOS\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we introduce DermaVQA-DAS, an extension of the DermaVQA dataset that supports two complementary tasks: closed-ended question answering (QA) and dermatological lesion segmentation. Central to this work is the Dermatology Assessment Schema (DAS), a novel expert-developed framework that systematically captures clinically meaningful dermatological features in a structured and standardized form. DAS comprises 36 high-level and 27 fine-grained assessment questions, with multiple-choice options in English and Chinese. Leveraging DAS, we provide expert-annotated datasets for both closed QA and segmentation and benchmark state-of-the-art multimodal models. For segmentation, we evaluate multiple prompting strategies and show that prompt design impacts performance: the default prompt achieves the best results under Mean-of-Max and Mean-of-Mean evaluation aggregation schemes, while an augmented prompt incorporating both patient query title and content yields the highest performance under majority-vote-based microscore evaluation, achieving a Jaccard index of 0.395 and a Dice score of 0.566 with BiomedParse. For closed-ended QA, overall performance is strong across models, with average accuracies ranging from 0.729 to 0.798; o3 achieves the best overall accuracy (0.798), closely followed by GPT-4.1 (0.796), while Gemini-1.5-Pro shows competitive performance within the Gemini family (0.783).

In this work, we introduce SenseNova-MARS, a novel Multimodal Agentic Reasoning and Search framework that empowers VLMs with interleaved visual reasoning and tool-use capabilities via reinforcement learning (RL).

We consider kernels decomposed into orthogonal even and odd components. Even components cause image content to diffuse isotropically while preserving the center of mass, analogously to rest or potential energy with zero net momentum. Odd kernels cause directional displacement of the center of mass, analogously to kinetic energy with non-zero momentum. The speed of information displacement is linearly related to the ratio of odd vs total kernel energy. Even-Odd properties are analyzed in the spectral domain via the discrete cosine transform (DCT), where the structure of small convolutional filters (e.g. $3 \\times 3$ pixels) is dominated by low-frequency bases, specifically the DC $\u03a3$ and gradient components $\\nabla$, which define the fundamental modes of information propagation.

However, flagship smartphone cameras have been slow to adopt generative models because strong generation can lead to undesirable hallucinations. For substantially degraded LR images, as seen in academia, strong generation is required and hallucinations are more tolerable because of the wide gap between LR and HR images. In contrast, in consumer photography, the LR image has substantially higher fidelity, requiring only minimal hallucination-free generation. We hypothesize that generation in SISR is controlled by the stringency and richness of the FM's conditioning feature. First, text features are high level features, which often cannot describe subtle textures in an image. Additionally, Smartphone LR images are at least $12MP$, whereas SISR networks built on T2IDiff FM are designed to perform inference on much smaller images ($<1MP$). As a result, SISR inference has to be performed on small patches, which often cannot be accurately described by text feature. To address these shortcomings, we introduce an SISR network built on a FM with lower-level feature conditioning, specifically DINOv2 features, which we call a Feature-to-Image Diffusion (F2IDiff) Foundation Model (FM). Lower level features provide stricter conditioning while being rich descriptors of even small patches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faF2IDiff\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528DINOv2\u4f4e\u5c42\u6b21\u7279\u5f81\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edfT2IDiff\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u6444\u5f71\u4e2d\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771fLR\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u65d7\u8230\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u76f8\u673a\u56e0\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u800c\u8fdf\u8fdf\u672a\u91c7\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u3002\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u6444\u5f71\u4e2d\uff0cLR\u56fe\u50cf\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u65e0\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edfT2IDiff\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u5c0f\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u7eb9\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eDINOv2\u7279\u5f81\u7684F2IDiff\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u5c42\u6b21\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u4e25\u683c\u4e14\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u4ee5\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edfT2IDiff\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684F2IDiff\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u5c42\u6b21\u7279\u5f81\uff08DINOv2\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771fLR\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfT2IDiff\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eDINOv2\u7279\u5f81\u7684F2IDiff\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfT2IDiff\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u6444\u5f71\u4e2d\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771fLR\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u5c42\u6b21\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002"}}

This high latency critically prevents the immediate, non-verbal feedback required for a realistic listener. To address this, we present DyStream, a flow matching-based autoregressive model that could generate video in real-time from both speaker and listener audio. Our method contains two key designs: (1) we adopt a stream-friendly autoregressive framework with flow-matching heads for probabilistic modeling, and (2) We propose a causal encoder enhanced by a lookahead module to incorporate short future context (e.g., 60 ms) to improve quality while maintaining low latency. Our analysis shows this simple-and-effective method significantly surpass alternative causal strategies, including distillation and generative encoder. Extensive experiments show that DyStream could generate video within 34 ms per frame, guaranteeing the entire system latency remains under 100 ms.

Conventional methods for assessing surgical proficiency typically rely on expert supervision, either through onsite observation or retrospective analysis of recorded procedures. However, these approaches are inherently subjective, susceptible to inter-rater variability, and require substantial time and effort from expert surgeons. These demands are often impractical in low- and middle-income countries, thereby limiting the scalability and consistency of such methods across training programs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel AI-driven framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis performance. The system integrates a video transformer architecture based on TimeSformer, improved with hierarchical temporal attention and weighted spatial attention mechanisms, to achieve accurate action recognition within surgical videos. Fine-grained motion features are then extracted using a YOLO-based object detection and tracking method, allowing for detailed analysis of instrument kinematics. Performance is evaluated along five aspects of microanastomosis skill, including overall action execution, motion quality during procedure-critical actions, and general instrument handling.

We introduce a framework, analogous to prior work on measuring compositionality in representation learning, to test for compositionality in the ViT encoder. Crucial to drawing this analogy is the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), which is a simple yet effective tool for obtaining input-dependent primitives in the vision setting. By examining the ability of composed representations to reproduce original image representations, we empirically test the extent to which compositionality is respected in the representation space.

They struggle with three key challenges: single-scale optimization missing multi-scale structures, discrete search spaces hindering smooth structure evolution, and separated structure-parameter optimization causing computational inefficiency. We propose RGTN (Renormalization Group guided Tensor Network search), a physics-inspired framework transforming TN-SS via multi-scale renormalization group flows. Unlike fixed-scale discrete search methods, RGTN uses dynamic scale-transformation for continuous structure evolution across resolutions. Its core innovation includes learnable edge gates for optimization-stage topology modification and intelligent proposals based on physical quantities like node tension measuring local stress and edge information flow quantifying connectivity importance. Starting from low-complexity coarse scales and refining to finer ones, RGTN finds compact structures while escaping local minima via scale-induced perturbations.

This study introduces a pipeline that integrates YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for anomaly detection in chest X-ray images with a large language model (LLM) to generate natural-language radiology reports.

Current dominant approaches rely heavily on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, SFT suffers from catastrophic forgetting and domain dependency, while RL is often hindered by training instability and rigid reliance on predefined reward functions. Although recent training-free methods circumvent these training burdens, they are fundamentally limited by a static inference paradigm. These methods typically rely on a single-pass \"generate-then-segment\" chain, which suffers from insufficient reasoning depth and lacks the capability to self-correct linguistic hallucinations or spatial misinterpretations. In this paper, we challenge these limitations and propose EVOL-SAM3, a novel zero-shot framework that reformulates reasoning segmentation as an inference-time evolutionary search process. Instead of relying on a fixed prompt, EVOL-SAM3 maintains a population of prompt hypotheses and iteratively refines them through a \"Generate-Evaluate-Evolve\" loop. We introduce a Visual Arena to assess prompt fitness via reference-free pairwise tournaments, and a Semantic Mutation operator to inject diversity and correct semantic errors. Furthermore, a Heterogeneous Arena module integrates geometric priors with semantic reasoning to ensure robust final selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVOL-SAM3 not only substantially outperforms static baselines but also significantly surpasses fully supervised state-of-the-art methods on the challenging ReasonSeg benchmark in a zero-shot setting.

While traditional video codecs like H.264 and HEVC achieve high compression ratios, they are designed primarily for pixel-domain reconstruction and lack native support for machine learning-centric latent representations, limiting their integration into deep learning pipelines. In this work, we present a Multi-Scale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MS-VQ-VAE) designed to generate compact, high-fidelity latent representations of low-resolution video, suitable for efficient storage, transmission, and client-side decoding. Our architecture extends the VQ-VAE-2 framework to a spatiotemporal setting, introducing a two-level hierarchical latent structure built with 3D residual convolutions. The model is lightweight (approximately 18.5M parameters) and optimized for 64x64 resolution video clips, making it appropriate for deployment on edge devices with constrained compute and memory resources. To improve perceptual reconstruction quality, we incorporate a perceptual loss derived from a pre-trained VGG16 network. Trained on the UCF101 dataset using 2-second video clips (32 frames at 16 FPS), on the test set we achieve 25.96 dB PSNR and 0.8375 SSIM. On validation, our model improves over the single-scale baseline by 1.41 dB PSNR and 0.0248 SSIM.

Existing methods mainly based on graphics or prompt extension struggle to generalize beyond simple simulated environments or learn implicit physical reasoning. The scarcity of training data with rich physics interactions and phenomena is also a problem. In this paper, we first introduce a Physics-Augmented video data construction Pipeline, PhyAugPipe, that leverages a vision-language model (VLM) with chain-of-thought reasoning to collect a large-scale training dataset, PhyVidGen-135K. Then we formulate a principled Physics-aware Groupwise Direct Preference Optimization, PhyGDPO, framework that builds upon the groupwise Plackett-Luce probabilistic model to capture holistic preferences beyond pairwise comparisons. In PhyGDPO, we design a Physics-Guided Rewarding (PGR) scheme that embeds VLM-based physics rewards to steer optimization toward physical consistency. We also propose a LoRA-Switch Reference (LoRA-SR) scheme that eliminates memory-heavy reference duplication for efficient training.

Consequently, they fail to reflect the complexity of real-world conditions, such as changes in illumination, weather, etc., that are critical to evaluating model robustness and generalization in safety-critical applications. To address these limitations, we present RGBT-Ground, the first large-scale visual grounding benchmark built for complex real-world scenarios. It consists of spatially aligned RGB and Thermal infrared (TIR) image pairs with high-quality referring expressions, corresponding object bounding boxes, and fine-grained annotations at the scene, environment, and object levels. This benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation and facilitates the study of robust grounding under diverse and challenging conditions. Furthermore, we establish a unified visual grounding framework that supports both uni-modal (RGB or TIR) and multi-modal (RGB-TIR) visual inputs. Based on it, we propose RGBT-VGNet, a simple yet effective baseline for fusing complementary visual modalities to achieve robust grounding. We conduct extensive adaptations to the existing methods on RGBT-Ground.

A straightforward approach is to boost CDVQA performance with generic vision-language models via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Despite recent progress, we observe that a significant portion of failures do not stem from clearly incorrect predictions, but from decision ambiguity, where the model assigns similar confidence to the correct answer and strong distractors. To formalize this challenge, we define Decision-Ambiguous Samples (DAS) as instances with a small probability margin between the ground-truth answer and the most competitive alternative. We argue that explicitly optimizing DAS is crucial for improving the discriminability and robustness of CDVQA models. To this end, we propose DARFT, a Decision-Ambiguity-guided Reinforcement Fine-Tuning framework that first mines DAS using an SFT-trained reference policy and then applies group-relative policy optimization on the mined subset. By leveraging multi-sample decoding and intra-group relative advantages, DARFT suppresses strong distractors and sharpens decision boundaries without additional supervision.

Existing slice discovery methods are primarily developed for image classification, limiting their applicability to multi-instance tasks such as detection, segmentation, and pose estimation. In real-world scenarios, error slices often arise from corner cases involving complex visual relationships, where existing instance-level approaches lacking fine-grained reasoning struggle to yield meaningful insights. Moreover, current benchmarks are typically tailored to specific algorithms or biased toward image classification, with artificial ground truth that fails to reflect real model failures. To address these limitations, we propose SliceLens, a hypothesis-driven framework that leverages LLMs and VLMs to generate and verify diverse failure hypotheses through grounded visual reasoning, enabling reliable identification of fine-grained and interpretable error slices. We further introduce FeSD (Fine-grained Slice Discovery), the first benchmark specifically designed for evaluating fine-grained error slice discovery across instance-level vision tasks, featuring expert-annotated and carefully refined ground-truth slices with precise grounding to local error regions. Extensive experiments on both existing benchmarks and FeSD demonstrate that SliceLens achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Precision@10 by 0.42 (0.73 vs. 0.31) on FeSD, and identifies interpretable slices that facilitate actionable model improvements, as validated through model repair experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "SliceLens\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLMs\u548cVLMs\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9519\u8bef\u5207\u7247\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5207\u7247\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5206\u5272\u3001\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u53cd\u6620\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5207\u7247\u57fa\u51c6\uff08FeSD\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728FeSD\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cSliceLens\u7684Precision@10\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.73\uff08\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf0.31\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u590d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u8bc6\u522b\u5207\u7247\u7684\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SliceLens\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5047\u8bbe\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u5207\u7247\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u590d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, existing GUI agents rely on discrete click predictions (x,y), which prohibits free-form, closed-loop trajectories (e.g. dragging a progress bar) that require continuous, on-the-fly perception and adjustment. In this work, we develop ShowUI-$\u03c0$, the first flow-based generative model as GUI dexterous hand, featuring the following designs: (i) Unified Discrete-Continuous Actions, integrating discrete clicks and continuous drags within a shared model, enabling flexible adaptation across diverse interaction modes; (ii) Flow-based Action Generation for drag modeling, which predicts incremental cursor adjustments from continuous visual observations via a lightweight action expert, ensuring smooth and stable trajectories; (iii) Drag Training data and Benchmark, where we manually collect and synthesize 20K drag trajectories across five domains (e.g. PowerPoint, Adobe Premiere Pro), and introduce ScreenDrag, a benchmark with comprehensive online and offline evaluation protocols for assessing GUI agents' drag capabilities. Our experiments show that proprietary GUI agents still struggle on ScreenDrag (e.g. Operator scores 13.27, and the best Gemini-2.5-CUA reaches 22.18). In contrast, ShowUI-$\u03c0$ achieves 26.98 with only 450M parameters, underscoring both the difficulty of the task and the effectiveness of our approach.

However, model compression may affect robustness, especially under natural corruption. Therefore, it is important to consider robustness evaluation while validating computer vision systems. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of compression techniques - quantization, pruning, and weight clustering applied individually and in combination to convolutional neural networks (ResNet-50, VGG-19, and MobileNetV2). Using the CIFAR-10-C and CIFAR 100-C datasets, we analyze the trade-offs between robustness, accuracy, and compression ratio.

Existing studies mainly focus on exploring more parameter-efficient strategies or more effective representation learning schemes. However, these methods either sacrifice fine-tuning performance or introduce excessive trainable parameters, failing to strike a balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a novel tuning method named collaborative low-rank adaptation (CLoRA) in this paper. CLoRA consists of base-space sharing and sample-agnostic diversity enhancement (SADE) components. To maintain parameter efficiency while expanding the learning capacity of low-rank modules (LRMs), base-space sharing allows all LRMs to share a set of down/up-projection spaces. In CLoRA, the low-rank matrices obtained from the shared spaces collaboratively construct each LRM. Since the representations extracted by these matrices may contain redundant information, SADE is employed to regularize the similarities among them to encourage diverse representations in the training process. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used image and point cloud datasets to evaluate the performance of CLoRA.

It is very critical for roadside infrastructure system to interpret natural languages and localize relevant target objects in complex traffic environments.

In this paper, we introduce a novel task of 3D Visual Grounding for Outdoor Monitoring Scenarios, which enables infrastructure-level understanding of traffic scenes beyond the ego-vehicle perspective. To support this task, we construct MoniRefer, the first real-world large-scale multi-modal dataset for roadside-level 3D visual grounding. The dataset consists of about 136,018 objects with 411,128 natural language expressions collected from multiple complex traffic intersections in the real-world environments. To ensure the quality and accuracy of the dataset, we manually verified all linguistic descriptions and 3D labels for objects. Additionally, we also propose a new end-to-end method, named Moni3DVG, which utilizes the rich appearance information provided by images and geometry and optical information from point cloud for multi-modal feature learning and 3D object localization.

However, the presence of numerous outliers among the feature points can significantly affect the matching results, reducing the accuracy and robustness of the process. Furthermore, a challenge arises when dealing with a large proportion of outliers: how to ensure the extraction of high-quality information while reducing errors caused by negative samples. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel method called Layer-by-Layer Hierarchical Attention Network, which enhances the precision of feature point matching in computer vision by addressing the issue of outliers. Our method incorporates stage fusion, hierarchical extraction, and an attention mechanism to improve the network's representation capability by emphasizing the rich semantic information of feature points. Specifically, we introduce a layer-by-layer channel fusion module, which preserves the feature semantic information from each stage and achieves overall fusion, thereby enhancing the representation capability of the feature points. Additionally, we design a hierarchical attention module that adaptively captures and fuses global perception and structural semantic information using an attention mechanism. Finally, we propose two architectures to extract and integrate features, thereby improving the adaptability of our network. We conduct experiments on two public datasets, namely YFCC100M and SUN3D, and the results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques in both outlier removal and camera pose estimation.

However, existing research still suffers from two main limitations. First, current work predominantly focuses on environments such as mountainous or forest areas, while paying insufficient attention to urban rescue scenes, which are more frequent and structurally complex. Second, existing detection systems include a limited number of classes, such as flames and smoke, and lack a comprehensive system covering key targets crucial for command decisions, such as fire trucks and firefighters. To address the above issues, this paper first constructs a new dataset named \"FireRescue\" for rescue command, which covers multiple rescue scenarios, including urban, mountainous, forest, and water areas, and contains eight key categories such as fire trucks and firefighters, with a total of 15,980 images and 32,000 bounding boxes. Secondly, to tackle the problems of inter-class confusion and missed detection of small targets caused by chaotic scenes, diverse targets, and long-distance shooting, this paper proposes an improved model named FRS-YOLO. On the one hand, the model introduces a plug-and-play multidi-mensional collaborative enhancement attention module, which enhances the discriminative representation of easily confused categories (e.g., fire trucks vs. ordinary trucks) through cross-dimensional feature interaction. On the other hand, it integrates a dynamic feature sampler to strengthen high-response foreground features, thereby mitigating the effects of smoke occlusion and background interference.

However, the sequential token-by-token decoding mechanism inherent in traditional autoregressive models leads to low inference efficiency.In this paper, we propose RadAR, an efficient and parallelizable framework designed to accelerate autoregressive visual generation while preserving its representational capacity. Our approach is motivated by the observation that visual tokens exhibit strong local dependencies and spatial correlations with their neighbors--a property not fully exploited in standard raster-scan decoding orders. Specifically, we organize the generation process around a radial topology: an initial token is selected as the starting point, and all other tokens are systematically grouped into multiple concentric rings according to their spatial distances from this center. Generation then proceeds in a ring-wise manner, from inner to outer regions, enabling the parallel prediction of all tokens within the same ring. This design not only preserves the structural locality and spatial coherence of visual scenes but also substantially increases parallelization. Furthermore, to address the risk of inconsistent predictions arising from simultaneous token generation with limited context, we introduce a nested attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically refines implausible outputs during the forward pass, thereby mitigating error accumulation and preventing model collapse. By integrating radial parallel prediction with dynamic output correction, RadAR significantly improves generation efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "RadAR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f84\u5411\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u5d4c\u5957\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u52a0\u901f\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u56e0\u987a\u5e8f\u89e3\u7801\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRadAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5f84\u5411\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec4\u7ec7\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u5185\u5230\u5916\u73af\u72b6\u5e76\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5d4c\u5957\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u4fee\u6b63\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "RadAR\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "RadAR\u901a\u8fc7\u5f84\u5411\u5e76\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8f93\u51fa\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

To address these limitations, we introduce EchoFoley, a new task designed for video-grounded sound generation with both event level local control and hierarchical semantic control. Our symbolic representation for sounding events specifies when, what, and how each sound is produced within a video or instruction, enabling fine-grained controls like sound generation, insertion, and editing.

Project Page: https://unic-lift.github.io/", "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced novel-view synthesis. Recent methods extend multi-view 2D segmentation to 3D, enabling instance/semantic segmentation for better scene understanding. A key challenge is the inconsistency of 2D instance labels across views, leading to poor 3D predictions. Existing methods use a two-stage approach in which some rely on contrastive learning with hyperparameter-sensitive clustering, while others preprocess labels for consistency. We propose a unified framework that merges these steps, reducing training time and improving performance by introducing a learnable feature embedding for segmentation in Gaussian primitives. This embedding is then efficiently decoded into instance labels through a novel \"Embedding-to-Label\" process, effectively integrating the optimization. While this unified framework offers substantial benefits, we observed artifacts at the object boundaries. To address the object boundary issues, we propose hard-mining samples along these boundaries. However, directly applying hard mining to the feature embeddings proved unstable. Therefore, we apply a linear layer to the rasterized feature embeddings before calculating the triplet loss, which stabilizes training and significantly improves performance.

However, adapting SAM2 to MIS presents several challenges, including the need for extensive annotated medical data for fine-tuning and high-quality manual prompts, which are both labor-intensive and require intervention from medical experts. To address these challenges, we introduce OFL-SAM2, a prompt-free SAM2 framework for label-efficient MIS. Our core idea is to leverage limited annotated samples to train a lightweight mapping network that captures medical knowledge and transforms generic image features into target features, thereby providing additional discriminative target representations for each frame and eliminating the need for manual prompts. Crucially, the mapping network supports online parameter update during inference, enhancing the model's generalization across test sequences. Technically, we introduce two key components: (1) an online few-shot learner that trains the mapping network to generate target features using limited data, and (2) an adaptive fusion module that dynamically integrates the target features with the memory-attention features generated by frozen SAM2, leading to accurate and robust target representation.

CAC quantification relies on the accurate delineation of calcified lesions, but is oftentimes affected by artifacts introduced by cardiac and respiratory motion. ECG-gated cardiac CTs substantially reduce motion artifacts, but their use in population screening and routine imaging remains limited due to gating requirements and lack of insurance coverage. Although identification of incidental CAC from non-gated chest CT is increasingly considered for it offers an accessible and widely available alternative, this modality is limited by more severe motion artifacts. We present ProDM (Property-aware Progressive Correction Diffusion Model), a generative diffusion framework that restores motion-free calcified lesions from non-gated CTs. ProDM introduces three key components: (1) a CAC motion simulation data engine that synthesizes realistic non-gated acquisitions with diverse motion trajectories directly from cardiac-gated CTs, enabling supervised training without paired data; (2) a property-aware learning strategy incorporating calcium-specific priors through a differentiable calcium consistency loss to preserve lesion integrity; and (3) a progressive correction scheme that reduces artifacts gradually across diffusion steps to enhance stability and calcium fidelity. Experiments on real patient datasets show that ProDM significantly improves CAC scoring accuracy, spatial lesion fidelity, and risk stratification performance compared with several baselines.

Its main challenge is to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem of old knowledge while training on new data. Existing L-ReID methods typically re-extract new features for all historical gallery images for inference after each update, known as \"re-indexing\". However, historical gallery data typically suffers from direct saving due to the data privacy issue and the high re-indexing costs for large-scale gallery images. As a result, it inevitably leads to incompatible retrieval between query features extracted by the updated model and gallery features extracted by those before the update, greatly impairing the re-identification performance. To tackle the above issue, this paper focuses on a new task called Re-index Free Lifelong person Re-IDentification (RFL-ReID), which requires performing lifelong person re-identification without re-indexing historical gallery images. Therefore, RFL-ReID is more challenging than L-ReID, requiring continuous learning and balancing new and old knowledge in diverse streaming data, and making the features output by the new and old models compatible with each other. To this end, we propose a Bidirectional Continuous Compatible Representation (Bi-C2R) framework to continuously update the gallery features extracted by the old model to perform efficient L-ReID in a compatible manner. We verify our proposed Bi-C2R method through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, which demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve leading performance on both the introduced RFL-ReID task and the traditional L-ReID task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faBi-C2R\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec8\u8eab\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u5386\u53f2\u56fe\u5e93\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u6cd5\u91cd\u65b0\u7d22\u5f15\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec8\u8eab\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\uff08L-ReID\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u56fe\u5e93\u6570\u636e\u56e0\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u65e0\u6cd5\u91cd\u65b0\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65b0\u65e7\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u5411\u8fde\u7eed\u517c\u5bb9\u8868\u793a\uff08Bi-C2R\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\u65e7\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u56fe\u5e93\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u9ad8\u6548L-ReID\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u591a\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cBi-C2R\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728RFL-ReID\u548cL-ReID\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Bi-C2R\u6846\u67b6\u5728RFL-ReID\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4f20\u7edfL-ReID\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u9886\u5148\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing methods circumvent this with a mask-based inpainting paradigm, where an incomplete visual conditioning forces models to simultaneously hallucinate missing content and sync lips, leading to visual artifacts, identity drift, and poor synchronization. In this work, we propose a novel self-bootstrapping framework that reframes visual dubbing from an ill-posed inpainting task into a well-conditioned video-to-video editing problem. Our approach employs a Diffusion Transformer, first as a data generator, to synthesize ideal training data: a lip-altered companion video for each real sample, forming visually aligned video pairs. A DiT-based audio-driven editor is then trained on these pairs end-to-end, leveraging the complete and aligned input video frames to focus solely on precise, audio-driven lip modifications. This complete, frame-aligned input conditioning forms a rich visual context for the editor, providing it with complete identity cues, scene interactions, and continuous spatiotemporal dynamics. Leveraging this rich context fundamentally enables our method to achieve highly accurate lip sync, faithful identity preservation, and exceptional robustness against challenging in-the-wild scenarios. We further introduce a timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning strategy as a necessary component to disentangle conflicting editing objectives across diffusion timesteps, thereby facilitating stable training and yielding enhanced lip synchronization and visual fidelity.

Existing methods often struggle to accurately recover temporal dynamics and fine-grained spatial structures, resulting in the loss of subtle motion cues crucial for distinguishing similar actions. To address this, we propose FineTec, a unified framework for Fine-grained action recognition under Temporal Corruption. FineTec first restores a base skeleton sequence from corrupted input using context-aware completion with diverse temporal masking. Next, a skeleton-based spatial decomposition module partitions the skeleton into five semantic regions, further divides them into dynamic and static subgroups based on motion variance, and generates two augmented skeleton sequences via targeted perturbation. These, along with the base sequence, are then processed by a physics-driven estimation module, which utilizes Lagrangian dynamics to estimate joint accelerations. Finally, both the fused skeleton position sequence and the fused acceleration sequence are jointly fed into a GCN-based action recognition head. Extensive experiments on both coarse-grained (NTU-60, NTU-120) and fine-grained (Gym99, Gym288) benchmarks show that FineTec significantly outperforms previous methods under various levels of temporal corruption. Specifically, FineTec achieves top-1 accuracies of 89.1% and 78.1% on the challenging Gym99-severe and Gym288-severe settings, respectively, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.

A key challenge in training such a model lies in the absence of multi-view consistent edited images for supervision. We address this with (i) a SAM2-based recoloring strategy that generates reliable, cross-view-consistent supervision, and (ii) an asymmetric input strategy that pairs a recolored reference view with raw auxiliary views, encouraging the network to fuse and align disparate observations. At inference, our model effectively handles images edited by 2D methods such as InstructPix2Pix, despite not being exposed to such edits during training. For large-scale quantitative evaluation, we introduce DL3DV-Edit-Bench, a benchmark built on the DL3DV test split, featuring 20 diverse scenes, 4 edit types and 100 edits in total.

Various approaches, including regularization techniques, semantic priors, and geometric constraints, have been implemented to address this challenge. Latest diffusion-based methods have demonstrated substantial improvements by generating novel views from new camera poses to augment training data, surpassing earlier regularization and prior-based techniques. Despite this progress, we identify three critical limitations in these state-of-the-art approaches: inadequate coverage beyond known view peripheries, geometric inconsistencies across generated views, and computationally expensive pipelines. We introduce GaMO (Geometry-aware Multi-view Outpainter), a framework that reformulates sparse-view reconstruction through multi-view outpainting. Instead of generating new viewpoints, GaMO expands the field of view from existing camera poses, which inherently preserves geometric consistency while providing broader scene coverage. Our approach employs multi-view conditioning and geometry-aware denoising strategies in a zero-shot manner without training. Extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet++ demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across 3, 6, and 9 input views, outperforming prior methods in PSNR and LPIPS, while achieving a $25\\times$ speedup over SOTA diffusion-based methods with processing time under 10 minutes.
