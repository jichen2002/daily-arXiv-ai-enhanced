To close this gap, we introduce ProSoftArena, a benchmark and platform specifically for evaluating multimodal agents in professional software environments. We establish the first capability hierarchy tailored to agent use of professional software and construct a benchmark of 436 realistic work and research tasks spanning 6 disciplines and 13 core professional applications. To ensure reliable and reproducible assessment, we build an executable real-computer environment with an execution-based evaluation framework and uniquely incorporate a human-in-the-loop evaluation paradigm. Extensive experiments show that even the best-performing agent attains only a 24.4\\% success rate on L2 tasks and completely fails on L3 multi-software workflow. In-depth analysis further provides valuable insights for addressing current agent limitations and more effective design principles, paving the way to build more capable agents in professional software settings.

To address this, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has mandated that no single UPI app should exceed 30 percent of total transaction volume. Enforcing this cap, however, poses a significant computational challenge: how to redistribute user transactions across apps without causing widespread user inconvenience while maintaining capacity limits? In this paper, we formalize this problem as the Minimum Edge Activation Flow (MEAF) problem on a bipartite network of users and apps, where activating an edge corresponds to a new app installation. The objective is to ensure a feasible flow respecting app capacities while minimizing additional activations. We further prove that Minimum Edge Activation Flow is NP-Complete. To address the computational challenge, we propose scalable heuristics, named Decoupled Two-Stage Allocation Strategy (DTAS), that exploit flow structure and capacity reuse. Experiments on large semi-synthetic transaction network data show that DTAS finds solutions close to the optimal ILP within seconds, offering a fast and practical way to enforce transaction caps fairly and efficiently.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes DTAS, a heuristic to fairly redistribute UPI transactions under a 30% cap, proving its efficiency and practicality through experiments.", "motivation": "The motivation stems from the need to prevent a duopoly in India's digital payment ecosystem by enforcing a 30% transaction volume cap on UPI apps, which requires redistributing transactions without causing user inconvenience.", "method": "The paper formalizes the problem as the Minimum Edge Activation Flow (MEAF) problem on a bipartite network and proposes the DTAS heuristic, which exploits flow structure and capacity reuse.", "result": "Experiments show that DTAS achieves near-optimal solutions quickly, making it a viable method for enforcing transaction caps.", "conclusion": "The paper concludes that the proposed Decoupled Two-Stage Allocation Strategy (DTAS) effectively addresses the computational challenge of redistributing UPI transactions to enforce the 30% cap, providing a practical and efficient solution."}}

However, such paradigm shift introduces critical security vulnerabilities stemming from the ''embodiment gap'', a discord between the LLM's abstract reasoning and the physical, context-dependent nature of robotics. While security for text-based LLMs is an active area of research, existing solutions are often insufficient to address the unique threats for the embodied robotic agents, where malicious outputs manifest not merely as harmful text but as dangerous physical actions. In this work, we present a systematic survey, summarizing the emerging threat landscape and corresponding defense strategies for LLM-controlled robotics. Specifically, we discuss a comprehensive taxonomy of attack vectors, covering topics such as jailbreaking, backdoor attacks, and multi-modal prompt injection. In response, we analyze and categorize a range of defense mechanisms, from formal safety specifications and runtime enforcement to multi-LLM oversight and prompt hardening. Furthermore, we review key datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate the robustness of these embodied systems.

This is a well-known graph modification problem with applications in computation biology and social network analysis.\n  All current parameterized algorithms use a similar strategy, which is to find a $P_4$ and explore the local structure around it to perform an efficient recursive branching.\n  The best known algorithm achieves running time $O^*(2.303^k)$ and requires an automated search of the branching cases due to their complexity.\n  Since it appears difficult to further improve the current strategy, we devise a new approach using modular decompositions. We solve each module and the quotient graph independently, with the latter being the core problem. This reduces the problem to solving on a prime graph, in which all modules are trivial. We then use a characterization of Chudnovsky et al. stating that any large enough prime graph has one of seven structures as an induced subgraph. These all have many $P_4$s, with the quantity growing linearly with the graph size, and we show that these allow a recursive branch tree algorithm to achieve running time $O^*((2 + \u03b5)^k)$ for any $\u03b5> 0$.\n  This appears to be the first algorithmic application of the prime graph characterization and it could be applicable to other modification problems.

Once trained on a set of stroke patches, a U-Net based regression model can render any input image in a variety of distinct, evocative and customizable styles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u7b14\u753b\u8865\u4e01\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7U-Net\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u56fe\u50cf\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6e32\u67d3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u6216\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7b14\u753b\u7ec4\u6210\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eU-Net\u7684\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7b14\u753b\u8865\u4e01\u96c6\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u7b14\u753b\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u3001\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u65b9\u5411\u3001\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u989c\u8272\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "result": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u591a\u79cd\u72ec\u7279\u3001\u5bcc\u6709\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u4e14\u53ef\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u6e32\u67d3\u4efb\u4f55\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7b14\u753b\u8865\u4e01\u96c6\u548cU-Net\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6e32\u67d3\u3002"}}

While Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) like Dense-Unet have shown promise in removing these artifacts via inpainting, they often require large labeled datasets which are scarce in the medical domain. Inspired by recent advancements in Masked Autoencoders (MAE) for 3D point clouds, we propose \\textbf{Dense-MAE}, a novel self-supervised learning framework for volumetric medical data. We introduce a pre-training strategy that randomly masks 3D patches of the vessel lumen and trains the Dense-Unet to reconstruct the missing geometry. This forces the encoder to learn high-level latent features of arterial topology without human annotation.

We present a novel XRL framework for generating textual explanations, converting them into a set of transparent rules, improving their quality, and evaluating them. Expert's knowledge can be incorporated into this framework, and an automatic predicate generator is also proposed to determine the semantic information of a state. Textual explanations are generated using a Large Language Model (LLM) and a clustering technique to identify frequent conditions. These conditions are then converted into rules to evaluate their properties, fidelity, and performance in the deployed environment. Two refinement techniques are proposed to improve the quality of explanations and reduce conflicting information. Experiments were conducted in three open-source environments to enable reproducibility, and in a telecom use case to evaluate the industrial applicability of the proposed XRL framework. This framework addresses the limitations of an existing method, Autonomous Policy Explanation, and the generated transparent rules can achieve satisfactory performance on certain tasks.

Existing multimodal approaches typically fuse Natural Code Sequence (NCS) representations from pretrained language models with Code Property Graph (CPG) representations from graph neural networks, often under the implicit assumption that adding a modality necessarily yields extra information. In practice, sequence and graph representations can be redundant, and fluctuations in the quality of the graph modality can dilute the discriminative signal of the dominant modality. To address this, we propose TaCCS-DFA, a framework that introduces Fisher information as a geometric measure of how sensitive feature directions are to the classification decision, enabling task-oriented complementary fusion. TaCCS-DFA online estimates a low-rank principal Fisher subspace and restricts cross-modal attention to task-sensitive directions, thereby retrieving structural features from CPG that complement the sequence modality; meanwhile, an adaptive gating mechanism dynamically adjusts the contribution of the graph modality for each sample to suppress noise propagation. Our analysis shows that, under an isotropic perturbation assumption, the proposed mechanism admits a tighter risk bound than conventional full-spectrum attention. Experiments on BigVul, Devign, and ReVeal show that TaCCS-DFA achieves strong performance across multiple backbones. With CodeT5 as the backbone, TaCCS-DFA reaches an F1 score of 87.80\\% on the highly imbalanced BigVul dataset, improving over a strong baseline Vul-LMGNNs by 6.3 percentage points while maintaining low calibration error and computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "TaCCS-DFA\u901a\u8fc7Fisher\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u6dfb\u52a0\u6a21\u6001\u5fc5\u7136\u5e26\u6765\u989d\u5916\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u4e14\u56fe\u6a21\u6001\u8d28\u91cf\u6ce2\u52a8\u53ef\u80fd\u7a00\u91ca\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5224\u522b\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTaCCS-DFA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528Fisher\u4fe1\u606f\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f4e\u79e9\u4e3bFisher\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u654f\u611f\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u56fe\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u5728BigVul\u3001Devign\u548cReVeal\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cTaCCS-DFA\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4ee5CodeT5\u4e3a\u9aa8\u5e72\u65f6\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe87.80%\uff0c\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebfVul-LMGNNs\u63d0\u53476.3\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "TaCCS-DFA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165Fisher\u4fe1\u606f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, conventional handover triggers based on instantaneous channel measurements are prone to failures and the ping-pong effect due to outdated or inaccurate channel state information. To address this, we introduce Deep-SIC, a knowledge-based channel prediction model that employs a Transformer-based approach to predict channel quality and optimise handover decisions. Deep-SIC is a unique model that utilises Partially Decoded Data (PDD), a byproduct of successive interference cancellation (SIC) in NOMA, as a feedback signal to improve its predictions continually. This special purpose enables learners to learn quickly and stabilise their learning. Our model learns 68\\% faster than existing state-of-the-art algorithms, such as Graph-NOMA, while offering verifiable guarantees of stability and resilience to user mobility (Theorem~2). When simulated at the system level, it can be shown that our strategy can substantially enhance network performance: the handover failure rate can be reduced by up to 40\\%, and the ping-pong effect can be mitigated, especially at vehicular speeds (e.g., 60 km/h). Moreover, Deep-SIC has a 20\\% smaller normalised root mean square error (NRMSE) in low-SNR situations than state-of-the-art algorithms with linear computational complexity, $O(K)$.

Traditional physical world models (PWM) focus on quantifiable physical attributes such as space and motion, failing to meet the needs of social intelligence modeling. In contrast, the Mental World Model (MWM), as a structured representation of humans' internal mental states, has become the critical cognitive foundation for embodied agents to achieve natural human-machine collaboration and dynamic social adaptation. However, current MWM research faces significant bottlenecks: such as fragmented conceptual framework with vague boundaries between MWM and PWM, disjointed reasoning mechanisms for the technical pathways and applicable scenarios of different Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning paradigms, and detachment between evaluation and practice.\n  To address these issues, this review systematically synthesizes over 100 authoritative studies to provide a comprehensive overview of MWM research for embodied AI. Its core contributions are threefold: First, it constructs a complete theoretical framework for MWM for the first time. Specifically, it distinguishes the essential differences between MWM and PWMs. Second, it systematically defines the key components of MWM through two paradigms for mental element representation. Third, it comprehensively analyzes two core ToM reasoning paradigms with 19 ToM methods. Finally, it also clarifies the integration trend of neuro-symbolic hybrid architectures, and synthesizes 26 ToM evaluation benchmarks.

Existing approaches either retain full interaction histories via passive context extension, leading to substantial redundancy, or rely on iterative reasoning to filter noise, incurring high token costs. To address this challenge, we introduce SimpleMem, an efficient memory framework based on semantic lossless compression. We propose a three-stage pipeline designed to maximize information density and token utilization: (1) \\textit{Semantic Structured Compression}, which applies entropy-aware filtering to distill unstructured interactions into compact, multi-view indexed memory units; (2) \\textit{Recursive Memory Consolidation}, an asynchronous process that integrates related units into higher-level abstract representations to reduce redundancy; and (3) \\textit{Adaptive Query-Aware Retrieval}, which dynamically adjusts retrieval scope based on query complexity to construct precise context efficiently. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method consistently outperforms baseline approaches in accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and inference cost, achieving an average F1 improvement of 26.4% while reducing inference-time token consumption by up to 30-fold, demonstrating a superior balance between performance and efficiency.

By using sandboxed execution, detailed failure reporting, and iterative regeneration or patching of failing tests, the framework autonomously improves test quality and expands coverage. Integrated into a CI/CD-compatible pipeline, it leverages reinforcement signals from coverage metrics and execution outcomes to guide refinement. Empirical evaluations on microservice based applications show up to a 60% reduction in invalid tests, 30% coverage improvement, and significantly reduced human effort compared to single-model baselines demonstrating that multi-agent, feedback-driven loops can evolve software testing into an autonomous, continuously learning quality assurance ecosystem for self-healing, high-reliability codebases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u73af\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u65e0\u6548\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6267\u884c\u611f\u77e5\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u9759\u6001\u3001\u5355\u6b21\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ecf\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u65e0\u6548\u3001\u5197\u4f59\u6216\u4e0d\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ed\u73af\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7406\u3001\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u4ee3\u7406\u4ee5\u53ca\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u534f\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u3001\u6267\u884c\u3001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6536\u655b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u65e0\u6548\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8660%\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8630%\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3001\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6f14\u53d8\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u4e3b\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u4fee\u590d\u3001\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u3002"}}

We are motivated by the problem of load-balancing in large-scale LEO satellite networks, which can be modelled as a torus, where the traffic is known to be sparse and localized to certain hotspot areas.

The design focuses on adaptive traffic filtering and lightweight policy enforcement instead of complex analytical models, making it suitable for medium-sized network environments. The prototype gateway was deployed in a real office with around 70 total devices, including 28 IoT units such as sensors, cameras, and smart controllers. Over ten days of continuous operation, the system reduced successful spoofing incidents by 87% and improved recovery time after deauthentication by 42%, while increasing network latency by only 3.1% and reducing throughput by less than 4% compared to a baseline WPA3 configuration.

This observation has led researchers towards identifying elementary building blocks of motion known as movement primitives, which are well-suited for generating motor commands in autonomous systems, such as robots. In this survey, we provide an encyclopedic overview of movement primitive approaches and applications in chronological order. Concretely, we present movement primitive frameworks as a way of representing robotic control trajectories acquired through human demonstrations. Within the area of robotics, movement primitives can encode basic motions at the trajectory level, such as how a robot would grasp a cup or the sequence of motions necessary to toss a ball. Furthermore, movement primitives have been developed with the desirable analytical properties of a spring-damper system, probabilistic coupling of multiple demonstrations, using neural networks in high-dimensional systems, and more, to address difficult challenges in robotics. Although movement primitives have widespread application to a variety of fields, the goal of this survey is to inform practitioners on the use of these frameworks in the context of robotics. Specifically, we aim to (i) present a systematic review of major movement primitive frameworks and examine their strengths and weaknesses; (ii) highlight applications that have successfully made use of movement primitives; and (iii) examine open questions and discuss practical challenges when applying movement primitives in robotics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u57fa\u5143\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u5e94\u7528\u53ca\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u7269\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8fd0\u52a8\u542f\u53d1\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8bc6\u522b\u8fd0\u52a8\u57fa\u5143\uff0c\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u547d\u4ee4\u3002", "method": "\u6309\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u57fa\u5143\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u767e\u79d1\u5168\u4e66\u5f0f\u6982\u8ff0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f39\u7c27\u963b\u5c3c\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u6982\u7387\u8026\u5408\u6f14\u793a\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u57fa\u5143\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u57fa\u5143\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u4e3b\u8981\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

As is well known, the problem can be solved in $O(nm)$ time using Thompson's algorithm. Moreover, recent studies have shown that the matching problem for regular expressions extended with a practical extension called lookaround can be solved in the same time complexity. In this work, we consider three well-known extensions to regular expressions called backreference, intersection and complement, and we show that, unlike in the case of lookaround, the matching problem for regular expressions extended with any of the three (for backreference, even when restricted to one capturing group) cannot be solved in $O(n^{2-\\varepsilon} \\mathrm{poly}(m))$ time for any constant $\\varepsilon > 0$ under the Orthogonal Vectors Conjecture. Moreover, we study the matching problem for regular expressions extended with complement in more detail, which is also known as extended regular expression (ERE) matching. We show that there is no ERE matching algorithm that runs in $O(n^{\u03c9-\\varepsilon} \\mathrm{poly}(m))$ time ($2 \\le \u03c9< 2.3716$ is the exponent of square matrix multiplication) for any constant $\\varepsilon > 0$ under the $k$-Clique Hypothesis, and there is no combinatorial ERE matching algorithm that runs in $O(n^{3-\\varepsilon} \\mathrm{poly}(m))$ time for any constant $\\varepsilon > 0$ under the Combinatorial $k$-Clique Hypothesis. This shows that the $O(n^3 m)$-time algorithm introduced by Hopcroft and Ullman in 1979 and recently improved by Bille et al. to run in $O(n^\u03c9m)$ time using fast matrix multiplication was already optimal in a sense, and sheds light on why the theoretical computer science community has struggled to improve the time complexity of ERE matching with respect to $n$ and $m$ for more than 45 years.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u6269\u5c55\u6b63\u5219\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u67d0\u4e9b\u6269\u5c55\u64cd\u4f5c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u672a\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u6b63\u5219\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u6269\u5c55\u64cd\u4f5c\uff08\u5982\u53cd\u5411\u5f15\u7528\u3001\u4ea4\u96c6\u548c\u8865\u96c6\uff09\u5bf9\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u957f\u671f\u4ee5\u6765\u65e0\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdbERE\u5339\u914d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Orthogonal Vectors Conjecture\u548ck-Clique Hypothesis\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6269\u5c55\u6b63\u5219\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u6269\u5c55\u6b63\u5219\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728O(n^{2-\u03b5} poly(m))\u6216O(n^{\u03c9-\u03b5} poly(m))\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u5df2\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6b63\u5219\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u53cd\u5411\u5f15\u7528\u3001\u4ea4\u96c6\u548c\u8865\u96c6\u64cd\u4f5c\u540e\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5185\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6269\u5c55\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

For more information visit https://orchestral-ai.com", "summary": "The rapid proliferation of LLM agent frameworks has forced developers to choose between vendor lock-in through provider-specific SDKs and complex multi-package ecosystems that obscure control flow and hinder reproducibility. Integrating tool calling across multiple LLM providers remains a core engineering challenge due to fragmented APIs, incompatible message formats, and inconsistent streaming and tool-calling behavior, making it difficult to build portable, reliable agent systems. We introduce Orchestral, a lightweight Python framework that provides a unified, type-safe interface for building LLM agents across major providers while preserving the simplicity required for scientific computing and production deployment. Orchestral defines a single universal representation for messages, tools, and LLM usage that operates seamlessly across providers, eliminating manual format translation and reducing framework-induced complexity. Automatic tool schema generation from Python type hints removes the need for handwritten descriptors while maintaining type safety across provider boundaries.

While O-RAN enables multi-vendor interoperability and cloud-native deployments, its fast-changing specifications and interfaces pose major challenges for researchers and practitioners. Manual navigation of these complex documents is labor-intensive and error-prone, slowing system design, integration, and deployment. To address this challenge, we adopt Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Contextual RAG), a strategy in which candidate answer choices guide document retrieval and chunk-specific context to improve large language model (LLM) performance. This improvement over traditional RAG achieves more targeted and context-aware retrieval, which improves the relevance of documents passed to the LLM, particularly when the query alone lacks sufficient context for accurate grounding. Our framework is designed for dynamic domains where data evolves rapidly and models must be continuously updated or redeployed, all without requiring LLM fine-tuning. We evaluate this framework using the ORANBenchmark-13K dataset, and compare three LLMs, namely, Llama3.2, Qwen2.5-7B, and Qwen3.0-4B, across both Direct Question Answering (Direct Q&A) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies. We show that Contextual RAG consistently improves accuracy over standard RAG and base prompting, while maintaining competitive runtime and CO2 emissions.

To synergize semantic understanding with dynamic predictive capabilities, we present InternVLA-A1.

This hybrid training strategy effectively harnesses the diversity of synthetic simulation data while minimizing the sim-to-real gap.

The density of a (sub)graph is the number of edges divided by the number of vertices. This problem was recently introduced and shown to be NP-hard for $\u03c4\\in \\{2/3, 3/4, 1 + 1/25\\}$, but polynomial-time solvable for $\u03c4\\in \\{0,1/2,1\\}$ [Bazgan et al., JCSS 2025]. We provide a complete dichotomy with respect to the target density $\u03c4$:\n  1. If $2\u03c4\\in \\mathbb{N}$ (half-integral target density) or $\u03c4< 2/3$, then $\u03c4$-BDED is polynomial-time solvable.\n  2. Otherwise, $\u03c4$-BDED is NP-hard.\n  We complement the NP-hardness with fixed-parameter tractability with respect to the treewidth of $G$.

Accurately recognizing human emotional states is crucial for facilitating smooth communication between humans and machines. Despite some progress in multimodal sentiment analysis research, numerous challenges remain. The first challenge is the limited and insufficiently rich features extracted from single modality data. Secondly, most studies focus only on the consistency of inter-modal feature information, neglecting the differences between features, resulting in inadequate feature information fusion. In this paper, we first extract multi-channel features to obtain more comprehensive feature information. We employ dual-channel features in both the visual and auditory modalities to enhance intra-modal feature representation. Secondly, we propose a symmetric mutual promotion (SMP) inter-modal feature fusion method. This method combines symmetric cross-modal attention mechanisms and self-attention mechanisms, where the cross-modal attention mechanism captures useful information from other modalities, and the self-attention mechanism models contextual information. This approach promotes the exchange of useful information between modalities, thereby strengthening inter-modal interactions. Furthermore, we integrate intra-modal features and inter-modal fused features, fully leveraging the complementarity of inter-modal feature information while considering feature information differences. Experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e92\u4fc3\uff08SMP\uff09\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u901a\u9053\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b-\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u8ba1\u7b97\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u5148\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u901a\u9053\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u542c\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u901a\u9053\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e92\u4fc3\uff08SMP\uff09\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u79f0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u6709\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4ea4\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e92\u4fc3\uff08SMP\uff09\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

To this end, we focus on a task of translating live-stream chat messages and manually construct LiveChatBench, a benchmark consisting of 1,000 Korean-English parallel sentence pairs. Experiments on five mobile devices demonstrate that, although serving a large and heterogeneous user base requires careful consideration of highly constrained deployment settings and model selection, the proposed approach nevertheless achieves performance comparable to commercial models such as GPT-5.1 on the well-targeted task.

While several techniques have been proposed to address this, limited empirical evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of applying them to LLM-based industry applications. To fill this gap, we analyzed a chatbot application in an industrial context at Schuberg Philis, a Dutch IT services company. We then selected four techniques, namely Small and Large Model Collaboration, Prompt Optimization, Quantization, and Batching, applied them to the application in eight variations, and then conducted experiments to study their impact on energy consumption, accuracy, and response time compared to the unoptimized baseline.\n  Our results show that several techniques, such as Prompt Optimization and 2-bit Quantization, managed to reduce energy use significantly, sometimes by up to 90%. However, these techniques especially impacted accuracy negatively, to a degree that is not acceptable in practice. The only technique that achieved significant and strong energy reductions without harming the other qualities substantially was Small and Large Model Collaboration via Nvidia's Prompt Task and Complexity Classifier (NPCC) with prompt complexity thresholds.

These tools must support efficient evaluation of key performance metrics such as coverage and radio-frequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) exposure, inform network design decisions, and ensure compliance with safety regulations. Moreover, base station (BS) placement is a crucial task in the network design, where satisfying coverage requirements is essential. To address these, based on our previous work, we first propose a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) that predicts location specific received signal strength (RSS), and EMF exposure simultaneously from the network topology, as images. As a network designing application, we propose a Deep Q Network (DQN) framework, using the trained cGAN, for optimal base station (BS) deployment in the network. Compared to conventional ray tracing simulations, the proposed cGAN reduces inference and deployment time from several hours to seconds. Unlike a standalone cGAN, which provides static performance maps, the proposed GAN-DQN framework enables sequential decision making under coverage and exposure constraints, learning effective deployment strategies that directly solve the BS placement problem. Thus making it well suited for real time design and adaptation in dynamic scenarios in order to satisfy pre defined network specific heterogeneous performance goals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408cGAN\u548cDQN\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u53165G/6G\u57fa\u7ad9\u90e8\u7f72\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u77405G\u7f51\u7edc\u5feb\u901f\u6269\u5c55\u548c6G\u6280\u672f\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u4eff\u771f\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u5c04\u9891\u7535\u78c1\u573a\u66b4\u9732\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u7ad9\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\uff08cGAN\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u63a5\u6536\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff08RSS\uff09\u548c\u7535\u78c1\u573a\uff08EMF\uff09\u66b4\u9732\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6Q\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DQN\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u7ad9\u90e8\u7f72\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5c04\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4eff\u771f\uff0ccGAN\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece\u51e0\u5c0f\u65f6\u7f29\u77ed\u5230\u79d2\u7ea7\uff1bGAN-DQN\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u66b4\u9732\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u7ad9\u90e8\u7f72\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684cGAN-DQN\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u57fa\u7ad9\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4ece\u51e0\u5c0f\u65f6\u7f29\u77ed\u5230\u51e0\u79d2\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

We formalize these complexities into a new class of problems, dubbed Spatio-Temporal Efficacy-optimized Allocation for Multi-robot systems (STEAM). STEAM builds upon trait-based frameworks that model robots using their capabilities (e.g., payload and speed), but goes beyond the typical binary success-failure model by explicitly modeling the efficacy of allocations as trait-efficacy maps. These maps encode how the aggregated capabilities assigned to a task determine performance. Further, STEAM accommodates spatio-temporal constraints, including a user-specified time budget (i.e., maximum makespan). To solve STEAM problems, we contribute a novel algorithm named Efficacy-optimized Incremental Task Allocation Graph Search (E-ITAGS) that simultaneously optimizes task performance and respects time budgets by interleaving task allocation, scheduling, and path planning. Motivated by the fact that trait-efficacy maps are difficult, if not impossible, to specify, E-ITAGS efficiently learns them using a realizability-aware active learning module. Our approach is realizability-aware since it explicitly accounts for the fact that not all combinations of traits are realizable by the robots available during learning. Further, we derive experimentally-validated bounds on E-ITAGS' suboptimality with respect to efficacy. Detailed numerical simulations and experiments using an emergency response domain demonstrate that E-ITAGS generates allocations of higher efficacy compared to baselines, while respecting resource and spatio-temporal constraints. We also show that our active learning approach is sample efficient and establishes a principled tradeoff between data and computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "STEAM\u95ee\u9898\u901a\u8fc7E-ITAGS\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u3001\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u8d28-\u6548\u80fd\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6548\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e14\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "\u590d\u6742\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u5f02\u6784\u56e2\u961f\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u3001\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u56e2\u961f\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002STEAM\u95ee\u9898\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6548\u80fd\u6620\u5c04\u6765\u8d85\u8d8a\u5178\u578b\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u6210\u529f-\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "STEAM\u95ee\u9898\u901a\u8fc7E-ITAGS\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u7ec7\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u3001\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u5c0a\u91cd\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u7b97\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fd8\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u8d28-\u6548\u80fd\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "E-ITAGS\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5206\u914d\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "E-ITAGS\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c0a\u91cd\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

Existing work often responds with \"no results\" or relaxes constraints using ad hoc rules, which can violate user intent by discarding requirements the user cares about most. We frame infeasibility handling as a preference-aware query repair problem: when a query is unsatisfiable, the agent should relax the least important constraints to the user. We propose three LLM-based methods for inferring relative constraint importance from dialogue: (1) local weighting, (2) global one-shot weighting, and (3) pairwise ranking. Experiments show local weighting achieves the best preference alignment, while global weighting performs best on correct constraint relaxation.

While previous research has proposed green tactics for ML-enabled systems, their empirical evaluation within RAG systems remains largely unexplored. This study presents a controlled experiment investigating five practical techniques aimed at reducing energy consumption in RAG systems. Using a production-like RAG system developed at our collaboration partner, the Software Improvement Group, we evaluated the impact of these techniques on energy consumption, latency, and accuracy.\n  Through a total of 9 configurations spanning over 200 hours of trials using the CRAG dataset, we reveal that techniques such as increasing similarity retrieval thresholds, reducing embedding sizes, applying vector indexing, and using a BM25S reranker can significantly reduce energy usage, up to 60% in some cases. However, several techniques also led to unacceptable accuracy decreases, e.g., by up to 30% for the indexing strategies. Notably, finding an optimal retrieval threshold and reducing embedding size substantially reduced energy consumption and latency with no loss in accuracy, making these two techniques truly energy-efficient.

However, the inherent topology dynamics of low earth orbit satellite networks and the uncertain network scales bring an inevitable requirement that resource chains for E2E service provisioning must be efficiently re-planned. Therefore, achieving highly adaptive resource management is of great significance in practical deployment applications. This paper first designs a regional resource management (RRM) mode and further formulates the RRM problem that can provide a unified decision space independent of the network scale. Subsequently, leveraging the RRM mode and deep reinforcement learning framework, we develop a topology feature-based dynamic and adaptive resource management algorithm to combat the varying network scales. The proposed algorithm successfully takes into account the fixed output dimension of the neural network and the changing resource chains for E2E service provisioning.

A key assumption in these works is that the goal region is reachable; an assumption that often fails in practice when environments are disconnected. Motivated by this limitation, we consider known 3D environments comprising objects, also called blocks, that form distinct navigable support surfaces (planes), and that are either non-movable (e.g., tables) or movable (e.g., boxes). These surfaces may be mutually disconnected due to height differences, holes, or lateral separations. Our focus is on tasks where the robot must reach a goal region residing on an elevated plane that is unreachable. Rather than declaring such tasks infeasible, an effective strategy is to enable the robot to interact with the environment, rearranging movable objects to create new traversable connections; a problem known as Navigation Among Movable Objects (NAMO). Existing NAMO planners typically address 2D environments, where obstacles are pushed aside to clear a path. These methods cannot directly handle the considered 3D setting; in such cases, obstacles must be placed strategically to bridge these physical disconnections. We address this challenge by developing BRiDGE (Block-based Reconfiguration in Disconnected 3D Geometric Environments), a sampling-based planner that incrementally builds trees over robot and object configurations to compute feasible plans specifying which objects to move, where to place them, and in what order, while accounting for a limited number of movable objects. To accelerate planning, we introduce non-uniform sampling strategies. We show that our method is probabilistically complete and we provide extensive numerical and hardware experiments validating its effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "BRiDGE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd3D\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79fb\u52a8\u7269\u4f53\u89e3\u51b3\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\u4e0d\u53ef\u8fbe\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bfc\u822a\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5047\u8bbe\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\u53ef\u8fbe\uff0c\u4f46\u57283D\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e38\u56e0\u7269\u7406\u65ad\u5f00\u800c\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u79fb\u52a8\u7269\u4f53\u521b\u5efa\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u901a\u884c\u8fde\u63a5\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86BRiDGE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u6784\u5efa\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u6811\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u3001\u653e\u7f6e\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u8ba1\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86BRiDGE\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u503c\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "conclusion": "BRiDGE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6982\u7387\u5b8c\u5907\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u52a0\u901f\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863D\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\u4e0d\u53ef\u8fbe\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This paper presents PerspectiveCoach, a large language model (LLM)-powered conversational tool designed to guide developers through structured perspective-taking exercises and deepen critical reflection on how software design decisions affect marginalized communities. Through a controlled study with 18 front-end developers (balanced by sex), who interacted with the tool using a real case of online gender-based harassment, we examine how PerspectiveCoach supports ethical reasoning and engagement with user perspectives. Qualitative analysis revealed increased self-awareness, broadened perspectives, and more nuanced ethical articulation, while a complementary human-human study contextualized these findings. Text similarity analyses demonstrated that participants in the human-PerspectiveCoach study improved the fidelity of their restatements over multiple attempts, capturing both surface-level and semantic aspects of user concerns.

While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown strong performance, it often fails to adapt to real-world short-term distribution shifts, which arise as different batches of goods arrive sequentially, causing performance drops. We argue that the short-term lookahead information available in modern logistics systems is key to mitigating this issue, especially during distribution shifts. We formulate online 3D-BP with lookahead parcels as a Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem and adapt the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework to solve it. Our framework employs a dynamic exploration prior that automatically balances a learned RL policy and a robust random policy based on the lookahead characteristics.

Pruning has emerged as a promising direction for reducing ViT complexity. However, existing approaches either (i) produce a single pruned model shared across all devices, ignoring device heterogeneity, or (ii) rely on fine-tuning with device-local data, which is often infeasible due to limited on-device resources and strict privacy constraints. As a result, current methods fall short of enabling task-customized ViT pruning in privacy-preserving mobile computing settings. This paper introduces TAP-ViTs, a novel task-adaptive pruning framework that generates device-specific pruned ViT models without requiring access to any raw local data. Specifically, to infer device-level task characteristics under privacy constraints, we propose a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based metric dataset construction mechanism. Each device fits a lightweight GMM to approximate its private data distribution and uploads only the GMM parameters. Using these parameters, the cloud selects distribution-consistent samples from public data to construct a task-representative metric dataset for each device. Based on this proxy dataset, we further develop a dual-granularity importance evaluation-based pruning strategy that jointly measures composite neuron importance and adaptive layer importance, enabling fine-grained, task-aware pruning tailored to each device's computational budget.

This principle is equally critical in prompt engineering, where designing effective prompts for large language models constitutes a complex optimization challenge. A structured optimization approach requires automated or semi-automated procedures to develop improved prompts, thereby reducing manual effort, improving performance, and yielding an interpretable process. However, current prompt optimization methods often induce prompt drift, where new prompts fix prior failures but impair performance on previously successful tasks. Additionally, generating prompts from scratch can compromise interpretability. To address these limitations, this study proposes the Hierarchical Attribution Prompt Optimization (HAPO) framework, which introduces three innovations: (1) a dynamic attribution mechanism targeting error patterns in training data and prompting history, (2) semantic-unit optimization for editing functional prompt segments, and (3) multimodal-friendly progression supporting both end-to-end LLM and LLM-MLLM workflows. Applied in contexts like single/multi-image QA (e.g., OCRV2) and complex task analysis (e.g., BBH), HAPO demonstrates enhanced optimization efficiency, outperforming comparable automated prompt optimization methods and establishing an extensible paradigm for scalable prompt engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "HAPO\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5f52\u56e0\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5355\u5143\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u5f52\u56e0\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\uff08HAPO\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u52a8\u6001\u5f52\u56e0\u673a\u5236\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5355\u5143\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u53cb\u597d\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "result": "HAPO\u5728\u5355/\u591a\u56fe\u50cfQA\u548c\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "HAPO\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5f52\u56e0\u673a\u5236\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5355\u5143\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u53cb\u597d\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Traditional safety frameworks treat contact as unsafe, restricting robots to collision avoidance and limiting their ability to function in dense, everyday settings. As the number of objects grows, model-based approaches for safe manipulation become computationally intractable; meanwhile, learned methods typically tie safety to the task at hand, making them hard to transfer to new tasks without retraining. In this work we introduce Dense Contact Barrier Functions(DCBF). Our approach bypasses the computational complexity of explicitly modeling multi-object dynamics by instead learning a composable, object-centric function that implicitly captures the safety constraints arising from physical interactions. Trained offline on interactions with a few objects, the learned DCBFcomposes across arbitrary object sets at runtime, producing a single global safety filter that scales linearly and transfers across tasks without retraining.

This work is under review", "summary": "Textual reasoning has recently been widely adopted in Blind Image Quality Assessment (BIQA). However, it remains unclear how textual information contributes to quality prediction and to what extent text can represent the score-related image contents. This work addresses these questions from an information-flow perspective by comparing existing BIQA models with three paradigms designed to learn the image-text-score relationship: Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and Autoencoder. Our experiments show that the score prediction performance of the existing model significantly drops when only textual information is used for prediction. Whereas the Chain-of-Thought paradigm introduces little improvement in BIQA performance, the Self-Consistency paradigm significantly reduces the gap between image- and text-conditioned predictions, narrowing the PLCC/SRCC difference to 0.02/0.03. The Autoencoder-like paradigm is less effective in closing the image-text gap, yet it reveals a direction for further optimization.

Moreover, we demonstrate that learning signals can be derived from user simulator behavior in MultiSessionCollab to train agents to generate more comprehensive reflections and update their memory more effectively.

By tightly coupling radio sensing with communication functions, ISAC unlocks new capabilities for situational awareness, localization, tracking, and network adaptation. At the same time, the increasing scale, heterogeneity, and dynamics of future wireless systems demand self-organizing network intelligence capable of autonomously managing resources, topology, and services. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly learning-driven and data-centric methods, has become a key enabler for realizing this vision. This survey provides a comprehensive and system-level review of AI-native ISAC-enabled self-organizing wireless networks. We develop a unified taxonomy that spans: (i) ISAC signal models and sensing modalities, (ii) network state abstraction and perception from sensing-aware radio data, (iii) learning-driven self-organization mechanisms for resource allocation, topology control, and mobility management, and (iv) cross-layer architectures integrating sensing, communication, and network intelligence. We further examine emerging learning paradigms, including deep reinforcement learning, graph-based learning, multi-agent coordination, and federated intelligence that enable autonomous adaptation under uncertainty, mobility, and partial observability. Practical considerations such as sensing-communication trade-offs, scalability, latency, reliability, and security are discussed alongside representative evaluation methodologies and performance metrics.

We evaluated MLLM architectures on knee osteoarthritis (OA) radiograph classification, which remains underrepresented in existing medical MLLM benchmarks, even though knee OA affects an estimated 300 to 400 million people worldwide. Through systematic ablation studies manipulating the vision encoder, the connector, and the large language model (LLM) across diverse training strategies, we measured each component's contribution to diagnostic accuracy. In our classification task, a trained vision encoder alone could outperform full MLLM pipelines in classification accuracy and fine-tuning the LLM provided no meaningful improvement over prompt-based guidance. And LoRA fine-tuning on a small, class-balanced dataset (500 images) gave better results than training on a much larger but class-imbalanced set (5,778 images), indicating that data balance and quality can matter more than raw scale for this task. These findings suggest that for domain-specific medical classification, LLMs are more effective as interpreters and report generators rather than as primary classifiers.

TAAF constructs a time-indexed KG from trace events to capture relationships among entities such as threads, CPUs, and system resources. An LLM then interprets query-specific subgraphs to answer natural-language questions, reducing the need for manual inspection and deep system expertise. To evaluate TAAF, we introduce TraceQA-100, a benchmark of 100 questions grounded in real kernel traces. Experiments across three LLMs and multiple temporal settings show that TAAF improves answer accuracy by up to 31.2%, particularly in multi-hop and causal reasoning tasks.

Enhancing the ability to transmit medical images and data from rural areas to urban hospitals via wireless networks is critical. However, bandwidth limitations, unreliable networks, and concerns over data security and privacy hinder efficient transmission. Additionally, the high data volume of medical content and the limited battery life of IoT devices pose further challenges. To address these challenges, data compression techniques such as Autoencoders (AEs) offer promising solutions by significantly reducing the communication overhead without sacrificing essential image quality or details. Additionally, spectrum allocation mechanisms in rural areas are often inefficient, leading to poor resource utilization. Auction theory presents a dynamic and adaptive approach to optimize spectrum allocation. This paper proposes a novel hybrid framework that integrates AE-based data compression with auction-based spectrum allocation, addressing both communication efficiency and spectrum utilization in rural wireless networks.

Traditional long-range forecasting, whether statistical or dynamical, has predominantly focused on predicting a single, spatially-averaged seasonal value, lacking the spatial detail essential for regional-level resource management. To address this gap, we introduce a novel deep learning framework that reframes gridded monsoon prediction as a spatio-temporal computer vision task. We treat multi-variable, pre-monsoon atmospheric and oceanic fields as a sequence of multi-channel images, effectively creating a video-like input tensor. Using 85 years of ERA5 reanalysis data for predictors and IMD rainfall data for targets, we employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based architecture to learn the complex mapping from the five-month pre-monsoon period (January-May) to a high-resolution gridded rainfall pattern for the subsequent monsoon season. Our framework successfully produces distinct forecasts for each of the four monsoon months (June-September) as well as the total seasonal average, demonstrating its utility for both intra-seasonal and seasonal outlooks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5b63\u98ce\u9884\u6d4b\u89c6\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u5316\u964d\u96e8\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u533a\u57df\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u957f\u671f\u9884\u62a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u533a\u57df\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7f51\u683c\u5316\u5b63\u98ce\u9884\u6d4b\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u65f6\u7a7a\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u752885\u5e74\u7684ERA5\u518d\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u548cIMD\u964d\u96e8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u524d\u5b63\u98ce\u671f\u5927\u6c14\u548c\u6d77\u6d0b\u573a\u89c6\u4e3a\u591a\u901a\u9053\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CNN\uff09\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u4e94\u4e2a\u6708\u524d\u5b63\u98ce\u671f\uff081\u6708\u81f35\u6708\uff09\u5230\u540e\u7eed\u5b63\u98ce\u5b63\u8282\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f51\u683c\u5316\u964d\u96e8\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5730\u4e3a\u5b63\u98ce\u5b63\u8282\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u6708\u4efd\uff086\u6708\u81f39\u6708\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u6574\u4e2a\u5b63\u8282\u5e73\u5747\u503c\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b63\u8282\u5185\u548c\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u5c55\u671b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5730\u4e3a\u5370\u5ea6\u590f\u5b63\u98ce\uff08ISM\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u5316\u964d\u96e8\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8986\u76d6\u4e86\u6574\u4e2a\u5b63\u98ce\u5b63\u8282\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u9010\u6708\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u533a\u57df\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

As a result, tracking aggressive trajectories accurately could be challenging due to the existence of residual physics during controller synthesis. This paper presents a self-supervised residual learning and trajectory optimization framework to address the aforementioned challenges. At first, unknown dynamic effects on the closed-loop model are learned and treated as residuals of the nominal dynamics, jointly forming a hybrid model. We show that learning with analytic gradients can be achieved using only trajectory-level data while enjoying accurate long-horizon prediction with an arbitrary integration step size. Subsequently, a trajectory optimizer is developed to compute the optimal reference trajectory with the residual physics along it minimized. It ends up with trajectories that are friendly to the following control level. The agile flight of quadrotors illustrates that by utilizing the hybrid dynamics, the proposed optimizer outputs aggressive motions that can be precisely tracked.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u672a\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u7cbe\u786e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u6fc0\u8fdb\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u98de\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5408\u6210\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6b8b\u5dee\u7269\u7406\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6fc0\u8fdb\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5b66\u4e60\u95ed\u73af\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u89c6\u4e3a\u6807\u79f0\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5229\u7528\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u548c\u89e3\u6790\u68af\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u610f\u79ef\u5206\u6b65\u957f\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u957f\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u968f\u540e\u5f00\u53d1\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6b8b\u5dee\u7269\u7406\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u53c2\u8003\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u8f93\u51fa\u53ef\u7cbe\u786e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u6fc0\u8fdb\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u98de\u884c\u5668\u7684\u654f\u6377\u98de\u884c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u7cbe\u786e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u6fc0\u8fdb\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u98de\u884c\u5668\u7684\u654f\u6377\u98de\u884c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

Minor revision resubmitted; decision pending", "summary": "Routine clinical imaging of the retina using optical coherence tomography (OCT) is performed with large slice spacing, resulting in highly anisotropic images and a sparsely scanned retina. Most learning-based methods circumvent the problems arising from the anisotropy by using 2D approaches rather than performing volumetric analyses. These approaches inherently bear the risk of generating inconsistent results for neighboring B-scans. For example, 2D retinal layer segmentations can have irregular surfaces in 3D. Furthermore, the typically used convolutional neural networks are bound to the resolution of the training data, which prevents their usage for images acquired with a different imaging protocol. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently emerged as a tool to store voxelized data as a continuous representation. Using coordinates as input, INRs are resolution-agnostic, which allows them to be applied to anisotropic data. In this paper, we propose two frameworks that make use of this characteristic of INRs for dense 3D analyses of retinal OCT volumes. 1) We perform inter-B-scan interpolation by incorporating additional information from en-face modalities, that help retain relevant structures between B-scans. 2) We create a resolution-agnostic retinal atlas that enables general analysis without strict requirements for the data. Both methods leverage generalizable INRs, improving retinal shape representation through population-based training and allowing predictions for unseen cases. Our resolution-independent frameworks facilitate the analysis of OCT images with large B-scan distances, opening up possibilities for the volumetric evaluation of retinal structures and pathologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5229\u7528\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\uff08INRs\uff09\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd3D\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u7f51\u819cOCT\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5904\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u534f\u8bae\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5bb9\u79ef\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e38\u89c4\u4e34\u5e8aOCT\u6210\u50cf\u56e0\u5927\u5207\u7247\u95f4\u8ddd\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf2D\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u76f8\u90bbB-scan\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002INRs\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8868\u793a\u7279\u6027\u4e3a\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "method": "1) \u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408en-face\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u989d\u5916\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884cB-scan\u95f4\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559B-scan\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u7ed3\u6784\u30022) \u521b\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u4e25\u683c\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5206\u6790\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684INRs\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6539\u5584\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u5f62\u72b6\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u5927B-scan\u95f4\u8ddd\u7684OCT\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u75c5\u7406\u7684\u5bb9\u79ef\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\uff08INRs\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u7f51\u819cOCT\u4f53\u79ef\u7684\u5bc6\u96c63D\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf2D\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u5f62\u72b6\u8868\u793a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u6210\u50cf\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

Ensuring system reliability thus demands accurate root cause localization. While many traditional graph-based and deep learning approaches have been explored for this task, they often rely heavily on pre-defined schemas that struggle to adapt to evolving operational contexts. Consequently, a number of LLM-based methods have recently been proposed. However, these methods still face two major limitations: shallow, symptom-centric reasoning that undermines accuracy, and a lack of cross-alert reuse that leads to redundant reasoning and high latency. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of how Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) localize the root causes of failures, drawing insights from professionals across multiple organizations. Our investigation reveals that expert root cause analysis exhibits three key characteristics: recursiveness, multi-dimensional expansion, and cross-modal reasoning. Motivated by these findings, we introduce AMER-RCL, an agentic memory enhanced recursive reasoning framework for root cause localization in microservices. AMER-RCL employs the Recursive Reasoning RCL engine, a multi-agent framework that performs recursive reasoning on each alert to progressively refine candidate causes, while Agentic Memory incrementally accumulates and reuses reasoning from prior alerts within a time window to reduce redundant exploration and lower inference latency. Experimental results demonstrate that AMER-RCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both localization accuracy and inference efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "AMER-RCL\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9012\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u6839\u56e0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6d45\u5c42\u548c\u8de8\u8b66\u62a5\u5197\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d7SRE\u4e13\u5bb6\u5206\u6790\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6839\u56e0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAMER-RCL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9012\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u548c\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u8b66\u62a5\u548c\u8de8\u8b66\u62a5\u8bb0\u5fc6\u91cd\u7528\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eAMER-RCL\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "AMER-RCL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6839\u56e0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, given the variability of network traffic across network environments and traffic series timescales, it is essential to identify effective deployment choices and modeling directions for network traffic prediction. This study systematically identify and evaluates twelve advanced TSF models -- including transformer-based and traditional DL approaches, each with unique advantages for network traffic prediction -- against three statistical baselines on four real traffic datasets, across multiple time scales and horizons, assessing performance, robustness to anomalies, data gaps, external factors, data efficiency, and resource efficiency in terms of time, memory, and energy.

Existing meta-learning-based approaches require a shared representation of environmental structures, which lack flexibility for realistic non-structural disturbances. Besides, representation error and the distribution shifts can lead to heavy degradation in prediction accuracy. This work presents a generalizable disturbance estimation framework that builds on meta-learning and feedback-calibrated online adaptation. By extracting features from a finite time window of past observations, a unified representation that effectively captures general non-structural disturbances can be learned without predefined structural assumptions. The online adaptation process is subsequently calibrated by a state-feedback mechanism to attenuate the learning residual originating from the representation and generalizability limitations. Theoretical analysis shows that simultaneous convergence of both the online learning error and the disturbance estimation error can be achieved. Through the unified meta-representation, our framework effectively estimates multiple rapidly changing disturbances, as demonstrated by quadrotor flight experiments.

Recent approaches leverage vision and language foundation models to directly solve dense tasks through multi-view renderings and text queries. While promising, these pipelines require expensive inference over multiple renderings, depend heavily on large language-model (LLM) prompt engineering for captions, and fail to exploit the inherent 3D geometry of shapes. We address this gap by introducing an encoder-only 3D model that produces language-aligned patch-level features directly from point clouds. Our pre-training approach builds on existing data engines that generate part-annotated 3D shapes by pairing multi-view SAM regions with VLM captioning. Using this data, we train a point cloud transformer encoder in two stages: (1) distillation of dense 2D features from visual encoders such as DINOv2 into 3D patches, and (2) alignment of these patch embeddings with part-level text embeddings through a multi-positive contrastive objective. Our 3D encoder achieves zero-shot 3D part segmentation with fast single-pass inference without any test-time multi-view rendering, while significantly outperforming previous rendering-based and feed-forward approaches across several 3D part segmentation benchmarks.

As a result, improvements in human-like behavior are largely driven by scale or broad supervised training, rather than targeted alignment. We introduce Human Aligning LLMs (HAL), a framework for aligning language models to conversational human-likeness using an interpretable, data-driven reward. HAL derives explicit conversational traits from contrastive dialogue data, combines them into a compact scalar score, and uses this score as a transparent reward signal for alignment with standard preference optimization methods. Using this approach, we align models of varying sizes without affecting their overall performance. In large-scale human evaluations, models aligned with HAL are more frequently perceived as human-like in conversation. Because HAL operates over explicit, interpretable traits, it enables inspection of alignment behavior and diagnosis of unintended effects.

Yet, the intrinsic complexity and dynamic runtime interactions of such systems inevitably give rise to anomalies. Ensuring system reliability therefore hinges on effective root cause analysis (RCA), which entails not only localizing the source of anomalies but also characterizing the underlying failures in a timely and interpretable manner. Recent advances in intelligent RCA techniques, particularly those powered by large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated promising capabilities, as LLMs reduce reliance on handcrafted features while offering cross-platform adaptability, task generalization, and flexibility. However, existing LLM-based methods still suffer from two critical limitations: (a) limited exploration diversity, which undermines accuracy, and (b) heavy dependence on large-scale LLMs, which results in slow inference. To overcome these challenges, we propose SpecRCA, a speculative root cause analysis framework for microservices that adopts a \\textit{hypothesize-then-verify} paradigm. SpecRCA first leverages a hypothesis drafting module to rapidly generate candidate root causes, and then employs a parallel root cause verifier to efficiently validate them. Preliminary experiments on the AIOps 2022 dataset demonstrate that SpecRCA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing approaches, highlighting its potential as a practical solution for scalable and interpretable RCA in complex microservice environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "SpecRCA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5047\u8bbe-\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f02\u5e38\u9891\u53d1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "SpecRCA\u91c7\u7528\u5047\u8bbe-\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5757\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u6839\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u5757\u9ad8\u6548\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "\u5728AIOps 2022\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSpecRCA\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SpecRCA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5047\u8bbe-\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91caRCA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Among the various approaches, Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) protocols have been widely adopted for their structured and collision-free communication capabilities. Nevertheless, despite extensive research in this area, current solutions often exhibit suboptimal performance, particularly in dynamic environments where node activity levels fluctuate over time.\n  This paper introduces a novel fully distributed TDMA-based scheduling protocol that intelligently maximizes the utilization of communication resources. The proposed approach adaptively reallocates underutilized time slots, originally assigned to temporarily inactive nodes, to those experiencing higher communication demands. This dynamic reallocation not only improves channel utilization but also reduces idle periods, thereby enhancing overall network efficiency. To further enhance performance, we incorporate a lightweight probabilistic mechanism that governs the temporal leasing of unused slots. This mechanism balances the trade-off between slot availability and transmission reliability, minimizing packet loss while preserving fairness and stability within the network.\n  Simulations across a range of network scenarios demonstrate that our protocol significantly improves throughput, latency, and reliability in resource-constrained environments.

This combination enables greater patient independence while allowing caregivers to maintain real-time supervision and early intervention capability.\n  Two-point calibration of the biophysical sensors against clinical reference devices resulted in root mean square errors of at most 2 bpm for heart rate, 0.5 degree Celsius for skin temperature, and 1 percent for SpO2. Experimental evaluation involved twenty participants with mobility impairments executing a total of 500 indoor navigation commands. The achieved command recognition accuracies were 99 percent for joystick control, 97 percent plus or minus 2 percent for speech, and 95 percent plus or minus 3 percent for hand gesture, with an average closed-loop latency of 20 plus or minus 0.5 milliseconds.

This paper develops a lightweight computer vision framework that reconciles the efficiency of 2D detection with the necessity of 3D context by reformulating volumetric Computer Tomography (CT) data as sequential video streams. This video-viewpoint paradigm is applied to the time-sensitive task of Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) detection using the Hemorica dataset. To ensure operational efficiency, we benchmarked multiple generations of the YOLO architecture (v8, v10, v11 and v12) in their Nano configurations, selecting the version with the highest mAP@50 to serve as the slice-level backbone. A ByteTrack algorithm is then introduced to enforce anatomical consistency across the $z$-axis. To address the initialization lag inherent in video trackers, a hybrid inference strategy and a spatiotemporal consistency filter are proposed to distinguish true pathology from transient prediction noise. Experimental results on independent test data demonstrate that the proposed framework serves as a rigorous temporal validator, increasing detection Precision from 0.703 to 0.779 compared to the baseline 2D detector, while maintaining high sensitivity. By approximating 3D contextual reasoning at a fraction of the computational cost, this method provides a scalable solution for real-time patient prioritization in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile stroke units and IoT-enabled remote clinics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c063D CT\u6570\u636e\u89c6\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408YOLO\u548cByteTrack\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9885\u5185\u51fa\u8840\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a3D CNN\u7684\u9ad8\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u76843D\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u5c063D CT\u6570\u636e\u89c6\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u4ee3YOLO Nano\u67b6\u6784\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5207\u7247\u7ea7\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408ByteTrack\u7b97\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u89e3\u5256\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4ece0.703\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.779\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c063D CT\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7YOLO\u67b6\u6784\u548cByteTrack\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9885\u5185\u51fa\u8840\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u533b\u7597\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, as interactions progress, repository context must be continuously preserved and updated to integrate newly validated information. Meanwhile, the expanding session history increases cognitive burden, often leading to forgetting and the reintroduction of previously resolved errors. Existing memory management approaches show promise but remain limited by natural language-centric representations. To overcome these limitations, we propose CodeMEM, an AST-guided dynamic memory management system tailored for repository-level iterative code generation. Specifically, CodeMEM introduces the Code Context Memory component that dynamically maintains and updates repository context through AST-guided LLM operations, along with the Code Session Memory that constructs a code-centric representation of interaction history and explicitly detects and mitigates forgetting through AST-based analysis. Experimental results on the instruction-following benchmark CodeIF-Bench and the code generation benchmark CoderEval demonstrate that CodeMEM achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving instruction following by 12.2% for the current turn and 11.5% for the session level, and reducing interaction rounds by 2-3, while maintaining competitive inference latency and token efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "CodeMEM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2aAST\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ed3\u5e93\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4ed3\u5e93\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u91cd\u5165\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CodeMEM\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u542bCode Context Memory\u548cCode Session Memory\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u901a\u8fc7AST\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684LLM\u64cd\u4f5c\u52a8\u6001\u7ef4\u62a4\u4ed3\u5e93\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8eAST\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6784\u5efa\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5386\u53f2\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728CodeIF-Bench\u548cCoderEval\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCodeMEM\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u8f6e\u6b21\u51cf\u5c11\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u4e8612.2%\u548c11.5%\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e862-3\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "conclusion": "CodeMEM\u901a\u8fc7AST\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4ed3\u5e93\u7ea7\u8fed\u4ee3\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u4ea4\u4e92\u8f6e\u6b21\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

Yet existing VideoQA benchmarks struggle to capture this multimodal reasoning and are largely not open-ended, given the difficulty of evaluating free-form answers. In this paper, we introduce a novel open-ended multi-modal VideoQA benchmark, MovieRecapsQA created using movie recap videos--a distinctive type of YouTube content that summarizes a film by presenting its key events through synchronized visual (recap video) and textual (recap summary) modalities. Using the recap summary, we generate $\\approx 8.2$ K question-answer (QA) pairs (aligned with movie-subtitles) and provide the necessary \"facts\" needed to verify an answer in a reference-free manner. To our knowledge, this is the first open-ended VideoQA benchmark that supplies explicit textual context of the input (video and/or text); which we use for evaluation. Our benchmark provides videos of multiple lengths (i.e., recap-segments, movie-segments) and categorizations of questions (by modality and type) to enable fine-grained analysis. We evaluate the performance of seven state-of-the-art MLLMs using our benchmark and observe that: 1) visual-only questions remain the most challenging; 2) models default to textual inputs whenever available; 3) extracting factually accurate information from video content is still difficult for all models; and 4) proprietary and open-source models perform comparably on video-dependent questions.", "AI": {"tldr": "MovieRecapsQA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001VideoQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u5f71\u56de\u987e\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210QA\u5bf9\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u6700\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VideoQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e14\u591a\u4e3a\u975e\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u7b54\u6848\u3002MovieRecapsQA\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u7535\u5f71\u56de\u987e\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210QA\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u663e\u5f0f\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5305\u542b\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u9891\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e03\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u6700\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4e14\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63d0\u53d6\u89c6\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "MovieRecapsQA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5f00\u7aef\u591a\u6a21\u6001VideoQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u5f71\u56de\u987e\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7ea68.2K\u4e2aQA\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b54\u6848\u6240\u9700\u7684\u2018\u4e8b\u5b9e\u2019\u3002\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u9891\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u6700\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4e14\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ece\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u51c6\u786e\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u56f0\u96be\u3002"}}

However, the wide range and high variability of permeability prevent existing methods from providing reliable predictions. For the first time in subsurface spatial prediction, this study presents a quantum-enhanced long short-term memory with attention (QLSTMA) model that incorporates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the recurrent cell. Using quantum entanglement and superposition principles, the QLSTMA significantly improves the ability to predict complex geological parameters such as permeability. Two quantization structures, QLSTMA with Shared Gates (QLSTMA-SG) and with Independent Gates (QLSTMA-IG), are designed to investigate and evaluate the effects of quantum structure configurations and the number of qubits on model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the 8-qubit QLSTMA-IG model significantly outperforms the traditional long short-term memory with attention (LSTMA), reducing Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 19% and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) by 20%, with particularly strong performance in regions featuring complex well-logging data. These findings validate the potential of quantum-classical hybrid neural networks for reservoir prediction, indicating that increasing the number of qubits yields further accuracy gains despite the reliance on classical simulations.

We close this gap with a practical sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) framework that utilizes dense tactile feedback combined with joint torque sensing to explicitly regulate physical interactions. To enable effective sim-to-real transfer, we introduce (i) a computationally fast tactile simulation that computes distances between dense virtual tactile units and the object via parallel forward kinematics, providing high-rate, high-resolution touch signals needed by RL; (ii) a current-to-torque calibration that eliminates the need for torque sensors on dexterous hands by mapping motor current to joint torque; and (iii) actuator dynamics modeling to bridge the actuation gaps with randomization of non-ideal effects such as backlash, torque-speed saturation. Using an asymmetric actor-critic PPO pipeline trained entirely in simulation, our policies deploy directly to a five-finger hand. The resulting policies demonstrated two essential skills: (1) command-based, controllable grasp force tracking, and (2) reorientation of objects in the hand, both of which were robustly executed without fine-tuning on the robot. By combining tactile and torque in the observation space with effective sensing/actuation modeling, our system provides a practical solution to achieve reliable dexterous manipulation.

Such image manipulations can be produced using traditional image editing tools (known as \"shallowfakes\") or advanced artificial intelligence techniques (\"deepfakes\"). While numerous studies have focused on image manipulation localization on either shallowfake images or deepfake videos, few approaches address both cases. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using a deep learning network to localize manipulations in both shallow- and deep-fake images, and proposed a solution for such purpose. To precisely differentiate between authentic and manipulated pixels, we leverage the Vision Mamba network to extract feature maps that clearly describe the boundaries between tampered and untouched regions.

To do so, partial policies are represented as logical rules, and online reasoning is performed to guide the training process through two mechanisms: (i) biasing the action distribution during exploration, and (ii) rescaling Q-values during exploitation. This neuro-symbolic integration enhances interpretability and trustworthiness while accelerating convergence, particularly in sparse-reward environments and tasks with long planning horizons. We empirically validate our methodology on challenging variants of gridworld environments, both in the fully observable and partially observable setting. We show improved performance over a state-of-the-art reward machine baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u89c4\u5219\u52a0\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u8d85\u51fa\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6311\u6218\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u90e8\u5206\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u903b\u8f91\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5728\u7ebf\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\uff08\u63a2\u7d22\u65f6\u504f\u7f6e\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u91cd\u65b0\u7f29\u653eQ\u503c\uff09\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7f51\u683c\u4e16\u754c\u73af\u5883\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\u53d8\u4f53\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5668\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u73af\u5883\u548c\u957f\u89c4\u5212\u89c6\u91ce\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

The dataset is designed to capture the most frequent issues identified by users, which are critical for improving software quality.

Generating them from a single photograph in a controllable manner is particularly challenging. Existing image-animation techniques are restricted to simple, low-frequency motions and operate only in narrow domains with repetitive textures like water and smoke. In contrast, large-scale video diffusion models are not tailored for cinemagraph constraints and lack the specialized data required to generate seamless, controlled loops. We present DreamLoop, a controllable video synthesis framework dedicated to generating cinemagraphs from a single photo without requiring any cinemagraph training data. Our key idea is to adapt a general video diffusion model by training it on two objectives: temporal bridging and motion conditioning. This strategy enables flexible cinemagraph generation. During inference, by using the input image as both the first- and last- frame condition, we enforce a seamless loop. By conditioning on static tracks, we maintain a static background.

However, existing research on MAD suffers from two fundamental limitations: evaluations are conducted under fragmented and inconsistent settings, hindering fair comparison, and are largely restricted to single-modality scenarios that rely on textual inputs only. To address these gaps, we introduce M3MAD-Bench, a unified and extensible benchmark for evaluating MAD methods across Multi-domain tasks, Multi-modal inputs, and Multi-dimensional metrics. M3MAD-Bench establishes standardized protocols over five core task domains: Knowledge, Mathematics, Medicine, Natural Sciences, and Complex Reasoning, and systematically covers both pure text and vision-language datasets, enabling controlled cross-modality comparison. We evaluate MAD methods on nine base models spanning different architectures, scales, and modality capabilities. Beyond accuracy, M3MAD-Bench incorporates efficiency-oriented metrics such as token consumption and inference time, providing a holistic view of performance--cost trade-offs. Extensive experiments yield systematic insights into the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of MAD across text-only and multimodal scenarios.

However, existing approaches (e.g., simulator-based and neural-based) cannot effectively realize the digital network twin, in terms of fidelity, synchronicity, and tractability. In this paper, we propose oneTwin, the first online digital twin system, for the prediction of physical layer metrics. We architect the oneTwin system with two primary components: an enhanced simulator and a neural radio radiance field (NRRF). On the one hand, we achieve the enhanced simulator by designing a material tuning algorithm that incrementally optimizes the building materials to minimize the twin-to-real gap. On the other hand, we achieve the NRRF by designing a neural learning algorithm that continually updates its DNNs based on both online and simulated data from the enhanced simulator. We implement oneTwin system using Sionna RT as the simulator and developing new DNNs as the NRRF, under a public cellular network. Extensive experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art solutions, oneTwin achieves real-time updating (0.98s), with 36.39% and 57.50% reductions of twin-to-real gap under in-distribution and out-of-distribution test datasets, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "oneTwin\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5728\u7ebf\u6570\u5b57\u53cc\u80de\u80ce\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548cNRRF\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u5b57\u7f51\u7edc\u53cc\u80de\u80ce\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u65b9\u6848\uff09\u5728\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u5b57\u7f51\u7edc\u53cc\u80de\u80ce\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u6570\u5b57\u53cc\u80de\u80ce\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "oneTwin\u7cfb\u7edf\u7531\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6784\u6210\uff1a\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548cNRRF\u3002\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u6750\u6599\u8c03\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u7b51\u6750\u6599\uff0cNRRF\u5219\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0DNN\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528Sionna RT\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684DNN\u4f5c\u4e3aNRRF\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0coneTwin\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\uff080.98\u79d2\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8636.39%\u548c57.50%\u7684\u53cc\u80de\u80ce\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "oneTwin\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u8f90\u5c04\u573a\uff08NRRF\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u7f51\u7edc\u53cc\u80de\u80ce\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u7f51\u7edc\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We introduce a soft-rigid co-design framework that leverages non-Newtonian fluid-based soft responsive materials to enhance humanoid safety. The material remains compliant during normal interaction but rapidly stiffens under impact, absorbing and dissipating fall-induced forces. Physics-based simulations guide protector placement and thickness and enable learning of active fall policies.

Although numerous detection methods have been proposed, their accuracy often degrades when applied to images generated by novel or unseen generative models, highlighting the challenge of achieving strong generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel detection paradigm based on channel removal reconstruction. Specifically, we observe that when the green (G) channel is removed from real images and reconstructed, the resulting reconstruction errors differ significantly from those of AI-generated images. Building upon this insight, we propose G-channel Removed Reconstruction Error (GRRE), a simple yet effective method that exploits this discrepancy for robust AI-generated image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRRE consistently achieves high detection accuracy across multiple generative models, including those unseen during training. Compared with existing approaches, GRRE not only maintains strong robustness against various perturbations and post-processing operations but also exhibits superior cross-model generalization.

Conventional optimization-based controllers can enforce physical constraints, but they struggle to produce feasible solutions quickly when many obstacles are present. Diffusion models can generate diverse trajectories around obstacles, yet prior approaches lacked a general and efficient way to condition them on scene structure. In this paper, we show that combining diffusion-based warm-starting conditioned with a latent object-centric representation of the scene and with a collision-aware model predictive controller (MPC) yields reliable and efficient motion generation under strict time limits. Our approach conditions a diffusion transformer on the system state, task, and surroundings, using an object-centric slot attention mechanism to provide a compact obstacle representation suitable for control. The sampled trajectories are refined by an optimal control problem that enforces rigid-body dynamics and signed-distance collision constraints, producing feasible motions in real time. On benchmark tasks, this hybrid method achieved markedly higher success rates and lower latency than sampling-based planners or either component alone.

ReTreVal constructs a structured reasoning tree with adaptive depth based on problem complexity, where each node undergoes iterative self-critique and refinement guided by explicit LLM-generated feedback. A dual validation mechanism evaluates reasoning quality, coherence, and correctness at each node while persistently storing insights from successful reasoning paths and failure patterns in a reflexion memory buffer, enabling cross-problem learning. Critique-based pruning retains only the top-k highest-scoring nodes at each level, controlling computational cost while preserving high-quality solution paths. We evaluate ReTreVal against ReAct, Reflexion, and Self-Refine across 500 mathematical problems and creative writing tasks using Qwen 2.5 7B as the underlying LLM, and demonstrate that ReTreVal consistently outperforms existing methods through its combination of structured exploration, critique-driven refinement, and cross-problem memory, making it particularly effective for tasks requiring exploratory reasoning, rigorous verification, and knowledge transfer.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReTreVal\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u6279\u5224\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u8de8\u95ee\u9898\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u9886\u57df\u5982\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u66ff\u4ee3\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u8de8\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "ReTreVal\u6574\u5408\u4e86Tree-of-Thoughts\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6279\u5224\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u53cd\u601d\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u95ee\u9898\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u6811\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u81ea\u6211\u6279\u5224\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "\u5728500\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cReTreVal\u4f7f\u7528Qwen 2.5 7B\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e95\u5c42LLM\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eReAct\u3001Reflexion\u548cSelf-Refine\u3002", "conclusion": "ReTreVal\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u6279\u5224\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u8de8\u95ee\u9898\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u4e25\u683c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

However, current 3D mesh saliency GT acquisition methods are generally consistent with 2D image methods, ignoring the differences between 3D geometry topology and 2D image array. Current VR eye-tracking pipelines rely on single ray sampling and Euclidean smoothing, triggering texture attention and signal leakage across gaps. This paper proposes a robust framework to address these limitations. We first introduce a view cone sampling (VCS) strategy, which simulates the human foveal receptive field via Gaussian-distributed ray bundles to improve sampling robustness for complex topologies. Furthermore, a hybrid Manifold-Euclidean constrained diffusion (HCD) algorithm is developed, fusing manifold geodesic constraints with Euclidean scales to ensure topologically-consistent saliency propagation. By mitigating \"topological short-circuits\" and aliasing, our framework provides a high-fidelity 3D attention acquisition paradigm that aligns with natural human perception, offering a more accurate and robust baseline for 3D mesh saliency research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u76843D\u7f51\u683c\u663e\u8457\u6027GT\u83b7\u53d6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7VCS\u548cHCD\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f3D\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u83b7\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76843D\u7f51\u683c\u663e\u8457\u6027GT\u83b7\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e2D\u56fe\u50cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e863D\u51e0\u4f55\u62d3\u6251\u4e0e2D\u56fe\u50cf\u9635\u5217\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u7684VR\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6d41\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u5c04\u7ebf\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7eb9\u7406\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u6cc4\u6f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u89c6\u56fe\u9525\u91c7\u6837\uff08VCS\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u6d41\u5f62-\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7ea6\u675f\u6269\u6563\uff08HCD\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002VCS\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5c04\u7ebf\u675f\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e2d\u592e\u51f9\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1bHCD\u878d\u5408\u6d41\u5f62\u6d4b\u5730\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u62d3\u6251\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7VCS\u548cHCD\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u201c\u62d3\u6251\u77ed\u8def\u201d\u548c\u6df7\u53e0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u76843D\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u83b7\u53d6\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a3D\u7f51\u683c\u663e\u8457\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165VCS\u7b56\u7565\u548cHCD\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u67093D\u7f51\u683c\u663e\u8457\u6027GT\u83b7\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u76843D\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u83b7\u53d6\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u81ea\u7136\u611f\u77e5\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

In this study, we present a systematic analysis of logical reasoning under controlled increases in logical complexity, and reveal a previously unrecognized phenomenon, which we term Logical Phase Transitions: rather than degrading smoothly, logical reasoning performance remains stable within a regime but collapses abruptly beyond a critical logical depth, mirroring physical phase transitions such as water freezing beyond a critical temperature threshold. Building on this insight, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Curriculum Tuning, a principled framework that adaptively aligns natural language with logical symbols to establish a shared representation, and reshapes training dynamics around phase-transition boundaries to progressively strengthen reasoning at increasing logical depths. Experiments on five benchmarks show that our approach effectively mitigates logical reasoning collapse at high complexity, yielding average accuracy gains of +1.26 in naive prompting and +3.95 in CoT, while improving generalization to unseen logical compositions.

With the rising computational cost of training large-scale deep models, dataset distillation has emerged as a promising approach for constructing compact synthetic datasets that retain the knowledge of their large original counterparts. However, traditional optimization-based methods often suffer from high computational overhead, memory constraints, and the generation of unrealistic, noise-like images with limited architectural generalization. Recent non-optimization methods alleviate some of these issues by constructing distilled data from real image patches, but the used rigid patch selection strategies can still discard critical information about the main objects. To solve this problem, we first leverage Grounded SAM2 to identify foreground objects and compute per-image foreground occupancy, from which we derive a category-wise patch decision threshold.

However, existing regression-based approaches often overlook inherent geometric priors, resulting in suboptimal training efficiency and limited localization accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel homography-guided pose estimator network for fine-grained visual localization between multi-view images and standard-definition (SD) maps. We construct input pairs that satisfy a homography constraint by projecting ground-view features into the BEV domain and enforcing semantic alignment with map features. Then we leverage homography relationships to guide feature fusion and restrict the pose outputs to a valid feasible region, which significantly improves training efficiency and localization accuracy compared to prior methods relying on attention-based fusion and direct 3-DoF pose regression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to unify BEV semantic reasoning with homography learning for image-to-map localization. Furthermore, by explicitly modeling homography transformations, the proposed framework naturally supports cross-resolution inputs, enhancing model flexibility.

The core limitation lies in the prevalent ``track-then-descend'' paradigm, which treats the platform as a passive target and forces the quadcopter to perform complex, sequential maneuvers. This paper challenges that paradigm by introducing a bi-directional cooperative landing framework that redefines the roles of the vehicle and the platform. The essential innovation is transforming the problem from a single-agent tracking challenge into a coupled system optimization. Our key insight is that the mobile platform is not merely a target, but an active agent in the landing process. It proactively tilts its surface to create an optimal, stable terminal attitude for the approaching quadcopter. This active cooperation fundamentally breaks the sequential model by parallelizing the alignment and descent phases. Concurrently, the quadcopter's planning pipeline focuses on generating a time-optimal and dynamically feasible trajectory that minimizes energy consumption. This bi-directional coordination allows the system to execute the recovery in an agile manner, characterized by aggressive trajectory tracking and rapid state synchronization within transient windows. The framework's effectiveness, validated in dynamic scenarios, significantly improves the efficiency, precision, and robustness of autonomous quadrotor recovery in complex and time-constrained missions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u5411\u5408\u4f5c\u7740\u9646\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u53f0\u4e3b\u52a8\u503e\u659c\u548c\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7740\u9646\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7740\u9646\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u4e3a\u5176\u5c06\u5e73\u53f0\u89c6\u4e3a\u88ab\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u673a\u52a8\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u4ece\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6311\u6218\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u53cc\u5411\u5408\u4f5c\u7740\u9646\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u53f0\u4e3b\u52a8\u503e\u659c\u8868\u9762\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u7740\u9646\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u89c4\u5212\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u4f18\u4e14\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3b\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u590d\u6742\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7d27\u8feb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u5408\u4f5c\u7740\u9646\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u53f0\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7740\u9646\u6548\u7387\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we identify and quantify a fundamental functional perception gap: the inability of current vision encoders to decode functional tracer biodistribution independent of morphological priors. Identifying Positron Emission Tomography (PET) as the quintessential modality to investigate this disconnect, we introduce PET-Bench, the first large-scale functional imaging benchmark comprising 52,308 hierarchical QA pairs from 9,732 multi-site, multi-tracer PET studies. Extensive evaluation of 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a critical safety hazard termed the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) hallucination trap. We observe that standard CoT prompting, widely considered to enhance reasoning, paradoxically decouples linguistic generation from visual evidence in PET, producing clinically fluent but factually ungrounded diagnoses. To resolve this, we propose Atomic Visual Alignment (AVA), a simple fine-tuning strategy that enforces the mastery of low-level functional perception prior to high-level diagnostic reasoning. Our results demonstrate that AVA effectively bridges the perception gap, transforming CoT from a source of hallucination into a robust inference tool and improving diagnostic accuracy by up to 14.83%.

Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at capturing spatial-temporal dependencies in sensor data, their black-box nature and the limited work on graph-based explainable models for water networks hinder practical adoption. We propose an explainable GNN framework that integrates mutual information to identify critical network regions and fuzzy logic to provide clear, rule-based explanations for node classification tasks. After benchmarking several GNN architectures, we selected the generalized graph convolution network (GENConv) for its superior performance and developed a fuzzy-enhanced variant that offers intuitive explanations for classified leak locations. Our fuzzy graph neural network (FGENConv) achieved Graph F1 scores of 0.889 for detection and 0.814 for localization, slightly below the crisp GENConv 0.938 and 0.858, respectively. Yet it compensates by providing spatially localized, fuzzy rule-based explanations.

There is a developing regulatory landscape for this kind of novel technology. Regulatory requirements are expected to be application specific, and may need to be tailored to each specific use case.\n  We draw on emerging guidance for both Digital Twin development and the use of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) in Air Traffic Management (ATM) to present an assurance framework. This framework defines actionable goals and the evidence required to demonstrate that a Digital Twin accurately represents its physical counterpart and also provides sufficient functionality across target use cases. It provides a structured approach for researchers to assess, understand and document the strengths and limitations of the Digital Twin, whilst also identifying areas where fidelity could be improved. Furthermore, it serves as a foundation for engagement with stakeholders and regulators, supporting discussions around the regulatory needs for future applications, and contributing to the emerging guidance through a concrete, working example of a Digital Twin.\n  The framework leverages a methodology known as Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance (TEA) to develop an assurance case.

In these challenging environments, the platform must rely exclusively on inertial sensors, leading to pure inertial navigation. However, the inherent noise and other error terms of the inertial sensors in such real-world scenarios will cause the navigation solution to drift over time. Although conventional deep-learning models have emerged as a possible approach to inertial navigation, they are inherently black-box in nature. Furthermore, they struggle to learn effectively with limited supervised sensor data and often fail to preserve physical principles. To address these limitations, we propose PiDR, a physics-informed inertial dead-reckoning framework for autonomous platforms in situations of pure inertial navigation. PiDR offers transparency by explicitly integrating inertial navigation principles into the network training process through the physics-informed residual component. PiDR plays a crucial role in mitigating abrupt trajectory deviations even under limited or sparse supervision. We evaluated PiDR on real-world datasets collected by a mobile robot and an autonomous underwater vehicle. We obtained more than 29% positioning improvement in both datasets, demonstrating the ability of PiDR to generalize different platforms operating in various environments and dynamics.

Extended version of our ICCV 2025 highlight paper [arXiv:2503.07940]. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.07940", "summary": "Some deep learning-based point cloud registration methods struggle with zero-shot generalization, often requiring dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning or retraining for new environments. We identify three critical limitations: (a) fixed user-defined parameters (e.g., voxel size, search radius) that fail to generalize across varying scales, (b) learned keypoint detectors exhibit poor cross-domain transferability, and (c) absolute coordinates amplify scale mismatches between datasets. To address these three issues, we present BUFFER-X, a training-free registration framework that achieves zero-shot generalization through: (a) geometric bootstrapping for automatic hyperparameter estimation, (b) distribution-aware farthest point sampling to replace learned detectors, and (c) patch-level coordinate normalization to ensure scale consistency. Our approach employs hierarchical multi-scale matching to extract correspondences across local, middle, and global receptive fields, enabling robust registration in diverse environments. For efficiency-critical applications, we introduce BUFFER-X-Lite, which reduces total computation time by 43% (relative to BUFFER-X) through early exit strategies and fast pose solvers while preserving accuracy.

Existing post-training approaches for VLA models are typically offline, single-robot, or task-specific, limiting effective on-policy adaptation and scalable learning from real-world interaction. We introduce a Scalable Online Post-training (SOP) system that enables online, distributed, multi-task post-training of generalist VLA models directly in the physical world. SOP tightly couples execution and learning through a closed-loop architecture in which a fleet of robots continuously streams on-policy experience and human intervention signals to a centralized cloud learner, and asynchronously receives updated policies. This design supports prompt on-policy correction, scales experience collection through parallel deployment, and preserves generality during adaptation. SOP is agnostic to the choice of post-training algorithm; we instantiate it with both interactive imitation learning (HG-DAgger) and reinforcement learning (RECAP). Across a range of real-world manipulation tasks including cloth folding, box assembly, and grocery restocking, we show that SOP substantially improves the performance of large pretrained VLA models while maintaining a single shared policy across tasks. Effective post-training can be achieved within hours of real-world interaction, and performance scales near-linearly with the number of robots in the fleet. These results suggest that tightly coupling online learning with fleet-scale deployment is instrumental to enabling efficient, reliable, and scalable post-training of generalist robot policies in the physical world.", "AI": {"tldr": "SOP\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u3001\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u901a\u7528VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5feb\u901f\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u79bb\u7ebf\u3001\u5355\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6216\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08SOP\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u7ebf\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u3001\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u95ed\u73af\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8230\u961f\u6301\u7eed\u6d41\u5f0f\u4f20\u8f93\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "SOP\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u51e0\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185\u5373\u53ef\u89c1\u6548\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6570\u91cf\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u90e8\u7f72\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

Recent work has made significant progress, but its reliance on large-scale datasets and complex decoders has limited its efficiency and generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and data-centric framework for zero-shot monocular depth estimation. We first adopt DINOv3 as the visual encoder to obtain high-quality dense features. Secondly, to address the inherent drawbacks of the complex structure of the DPT, we design the Simple Depth Transformer (SDT), a compact transformer-based decoder. Compared to the DPT, it uses a single-path feature fusion and upsampling process to reduce the computational overhead of cross-scale feature fusion, achieving higher accuracy while reducing the number of parameters by approximately 85%-89%. Furthermore, we propose a quality-based filtering strategy to filter out harmful samples, thereby reducing dataset size while improving overall training quality. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that our framework surpasses the DPT in accuracy.

Common remedies such as context compression or retrieval-augmented prompting introduce trade-offs between information fidelity and reasoning stability. We present InfiAgent, a general-purpose framework that keeps the agent's reasoning context strictly bounded regardless of task duration by externalizing persistent state into a file-centric state abstraction. At each step, the agent reconstructs context from a workspace state snapshot plus a fixed window of recent actions. Experiments on DeepResearch and an 80-paper literature review task show that, without task-specific fine-tuning, InfiAgent with a 20B open-source model is competitive with larger proprietary systems and maintains substantially higher long-horizon coverage than context-centric baselines. These results support explicit state externalization as a practical foundation for stable long-horizon agents.

However, the nonlinear programs approximating the OCPs are inherently nonconvex due to the coupling between the dynamics and the event timing, and therefore, they are challenging to solve. Most approaches address this challenge by predefining waypoint times or just using nonconvex trajectory optimization, which simplifies the problem but often yields suboptimal solutions. To significantly improve the numerical properties, we propose a formulation with a time-scaling direct multiple shooting scheme that partitions the prediction horizon into segments aligned with characteristic time constraints. Moreover, we develop a fast semidefinite-programming-based convex relaxation that exploits the sparsity pattern of the lifted formulation. Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate the solution optimality and computational efficiency.

However, most existing approaches rely heavily on degradation-specific representations, often resulting in oversmoothing and artifacts. To address this, we propose ClearAIR, a novel AiOIR framework inspired by Human Visual Perception (HVP) and designed with a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine restoration strategy. First, leveraging the global priority of early HVP, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model for overall evaluation. Unlike conventional IQA, our method integrates cross-modal understanding to more accurately characterize complex, composite degradations. Building upon this overall assessment, we then introduce a region awareness and task recognition pipeline. A semantic cross-attention, leveraging semantic guidance unit, first produces coarse semantic prompts. Guided by this regional context, a degradation-aware module implicitly captures region-specific degradation characteristics, enabling more precise local restoration. Finally, to recover fine details, we propose an internal clue reuse mechanism. It operates in a self-supervised manner to mine and leverage the intrinsic information of the image itself, substantially enhancing detail restoration.

Existing explainability approaches in robotics typically either focus on individual modules, which can be difficult to query from the perspective of high-level behaviour, or employ monolithic approaches, which do not exploit the modularity of robotic architectures. We present HEXAR (Hierarchical EXplainability Architecture for Robots), a novel framework that provides a plug-in, hierarchical approach to generate explanations about robotic systems. HEXAR consists of specialised component explainers using diverse explanation techniques (e.g., LLM-based reasoning, causal models, feature importance, etc) tailored to specific robot modules, orchestrated by an explainer selector that chooses the most appropriate one for a given query. We implement and evaluate HEXAR on a TIAGo robot performing assistive tasks in a home environment, comparing it against end-to-end and aggregated baseline approaches across 180 scenario-query variations. We observe that HEXAR significantly outperforms baselines in root cause identification, incorrect information exclusion, and runtime, offering a promising direction for transparent autonomous systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "HEXAR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u591a\u9879\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u76ca\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u8fc7\u4e8e\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece\u9ad8\u5c42\u884c\u4e3a\u89d2\u5ea6\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5f25\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "HEXAR\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u89e3\u91ca\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u5668\uff0c\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6a21\u5757\u751f\u6210\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728TIAGo\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684180\u79cd\u573a\u666f-\u67e5\u8be2\u53d8\u4f53\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cHEXAR\u5728\u6839\u56e0\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u6392\u9664\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u548c\u805a\u5408\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "HEXAR\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6839\u56e0\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u6392\u9664\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u900f\u660e\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Code:https://github.com/ChangPtR/AbdMLLM", "summary": "Visual abductive reasoning (VAR) is a challenging task that requires AI systems to infer the most likely explanation for incomplete visual observations. While recent MLLMs develop strong general-purpose multimodal reasoning capabilities, they fall short in abductive inference, as compared to human beings. To bridge this gap, we draw inspiration from the interplay between verbal and pictorial abduction in human cognition, and propose to strengthen abduction of MLLMs by mimicking such dual-mode behavior. Concretely, we introduce AbductiveMLLM comprising of two synergistic components: REASONER and IMAGINER. The REASONER operates in the verbal domain. It first explores a broad space of possible explanations using a blind LLM and then prunes visually incongruent hypotheses based on cross-modal causal alignment. The remaining hypotheses are introduced into the MLLM as targeted priors, steering its reasoning toward causally coherent explanations. The IMAGINER, on the other hand, further guides MLLMs by emulating human-like pictorial thinking. It conditions a text-to-image diffusion model on both the input video and the REASONER's output embeddings to \"imagine\" plausible visual scenes that correspond to verbal explanation, thereby enriching MLLMs' contextual grounding. The two components are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on standard VAR benchmarks show that AbductiveMLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming traditional solutions and advanced MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "AbductiveMLLM\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u540c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347MLLMs\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u5728\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u4e0d\u53ca\u4eba\u7c7b\uff0c\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e2d\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u6eaf\u56e0\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347MLLMs\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAbductiveMLLM\uff0c\u5305\u542bREASONER\uff08\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u57df\u4e2d\u63a2\u7d22\u5e76\u4fee\u526a\u5047\u8bbe\uff09\u548cIMAGINER\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\uff09\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u4ee5\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65b9\u5f0f\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6VAR\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAbductiveMLLM\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u5148\u8fdbMLLMs\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "AbductiveMLLM\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408REASONER\u548cIMAGINER\u7684\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\uff08VAR\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The controller is formulated in the dual quaternion framework and operates at the velocity level, assuming direct command of angular and linear velocities, as is standard in many aerial vehicles and omnidirectional mobile robots. Gaussian Process (GP) regression is integrated into a geometric feedback law to learn and compensate online for unknown, state-dependent disturbances and modeling imperfections affecting both attitude and position, while preserving the algebraic structure and coupling properties inherent to rigid-body motion.\n  The proposed approach does not rely on explicit parametric models of the unknown effects, making it well-suited for robotic systems subject to sensor-induced disturbances, unmodeled actuation couplings, and environmental uncertainties. A Lyapunov-based analysis establishes probabilistic ultimate boundedness of the pose tracking error under bounded GP uncertainty, providing formal stability guarantees for the learning-based controller.\n  Simulation results demonstrate accurate and smooth trajectory tracking in the presence of realistic, localized disturbances, including correlated rotational and translational effects arising from magnetometer perturbations.

To address this, a progressive Earth vision-language understanding and generation framework is proposed, including a multi-task dataset (EarthVLSet) and a semantic-guided network (EarthVLNet). Focusing on city planning applications, EarthVLSet includes 10.9k sub-meter resolution remote sensing images, land-cover masks, and 761.5k textual pairs involving both multiple-choice and open-ended visual question answering (VQA) tasks. In an object-centric way, EarthVLNet is proposed to progressively achieve semantic segmentation, relational reasoning, and comprehensive understanding. The first stage involves land-cover segmentation to generate object semantics for VQA guidance. Guided by pixel-wise semantics, the object awareness based large language model (LLM) performs relational reasoning and knowledge summarization to generate the required answers. As for optimization, the numerical difference loss is proposed to dynamically add difference penalties, addressing the various objects' statistics. Three benchmarks, including semantic segmentation, multiple-choice, and open-ended VQA demonstrated the superiorities of EarthVLNet, yielding three future directions: 1) segmentation features consistently enhance VQA performance even in cross-dataset scenarios; 2) multiple-choice tasks show greater sensitivity to the vision encoder than to the language decoder; and 3) open-ended tasks necessitate advanced vision encoders and language decoders for an optimal performance.

However, existing methods are largely confined to a single type of style condition, which limits their scope of application. Additionally, their lack of high-quality datasets leads to style inconsistency and temporal flicker. To address these limitations, we introduce DreamStyle, a unified framework for video stylization, supporting (1) text-guided, (2) style-image-guided, and (3) first-frame-guided video stylization, accompanied by a well-designed data curation pipeline to acquire high-quality paired video data.

Unlike existing siloed tools where pattern software guarantees sewable outputs but understands nothing about drape, and physics simulation predicts behaviour but cannot automatically fix patterns, Textile IR provides the semantic glue for integration through a seven-layer Verification Ladder -- from cheap syntactic checks (pattern closure, seam compatibility) to expensive physics validation (drape simulation, stress analysis). The architecture enables bidirectional feedback: simulation failures suggest pattern modifications; material substitutions update sustainability estimates in real time; uncertainty propagates across the pipeline with explicit confidence bounds. We formalise fashion engineering as constraint satisfaction over three domains and demonstrate how Textile IR's scene-graph representation enables AI systems to manipulate garments as structured programs rather than pixel arrays. The framework addresses the compound uncertainty problem: when measurement errors in material testing, simulation approximations, and LCA database gaps combine, sustainability claims become unreliable without explicit uncertainty tracking. We propose six research priorities and discuss deployment considerations for fashion SMEs where integrated workflows reduce specialised engineering requirements.

We propose a novel approach that adapts any state-of-the-art image-based (depth) estimation model for video processing by integrating a new temporal module - trainable on a single GPU in a few days. Our architecture StableDPT builds upon an off-the-shelf Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder and enhances the Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT) head. The core of our contribution lies in the temporal layers within the head, which use an efficient cross-attention mechanism to integrate information from keyframes sampled across the entire video sequence.

However, compared with the commonly used Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining, IHC staining involves complex procedures and is both time-consuming and expensive, which limits its widespread clinical use. Virtual staining converts H&E images to IHC images, offering a cost-effective alternative to clinical IHC staining.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel topology-aware framework for H&E-to-IHC virtual staining.

Inspired by this cognitive efficiency, we propose SketchThinker-R1, which incentivizes sketch-style reasoning ability in large multimodal models. Our method consists of three primary stages. In the Sketch-Mode Cold Start stage, we convert standard long reasoning process into sketch-style reasoning and finetune base multimodal model, instilling initial sketch-style reasoning capability. Next, we train SketchJudge Reward Model, which explicitly evaluates thinking process of model and assigns higher scores to sketch-style reasoning. Finally, we conduct Sketch-Thinking Reinforcement Learning under supervision of SketchJudge to further generalize sketch-style reasoning ability. Experimental evaluation on four benchmarks reveals that our SketchThinker-R1 achieves over 64% reduction in reasoning token cost without compromising final answer accuracy.

Although recent DETR-based detectors benefit from global context modeling, they exhibit notable performance degradation on IRSTD. We revisit this phenomenon and reveal that the target-relevant embeddings of IRST are inevitably overwhelmed by dominant background features due to the self-attention mechanism, leading to unreliable query initialization and inaccurate target localization. To address this issue, we propose SEF-DETR, a novel framework that refines query initialization for IRSTD. Specifically, SEF-DETR consists of three components: Frequency-guided Patch Screening (FPS), Dynamic Embedding Enhancement (DEE), and Reliability-Consistency-aware Fusion (RCF).

We present several key adaptations to diffusion models, which are important in this discrete setting. Notably, we show that a location-aware palette with our 2D gray code ordering improves performance. Adding a final tanh activation function is crucial for discrete data. On optimizing diffusion parameters, the sigmoid loss weighting consistently outperforms alternatives, regardless of the prediction type used, and we settle on x-prediction. While our current model does not yet surpass leading mask-based architectures, it narrows the performance gap and introduces unique capabilities, such as principled ambiguity modeling, that these models lack.

The challenges of multi-modal vehicle ReID arise from the uncertainty of modality quality distribution induced by inherent discrepancies across modalities, resulting in distinct conflicting fusion requirements for data with balanced and unbalanced quality distributions. Existing methods handle all multi-modal data within a single fusion model, overlooking the different needs of the two data types and making it difficult to decouple the conflict between intra-class consistency and inter-modal heterogeneity. To this end, we propose Disentangle Collaboration and Guidance Fusion Representations for Multi-modal Vehicle ReID (DCG-ReID). Specifically, to disentangle heterogeneous quality-distributed modal data without mutual interference, we first design the Dynamic Confidence-based Disentangling Weighting (DCDW) mechanism: dynamically reweighting three-modal contributions via interaction-derived modal confidence to build a disentangled fusion framework. Building on DCDW, we develop two scenario-specific fusion strategies: (1) for balanced quality distributions, Collaboration Fusion Module (CFM) mines pairwise consensus features to capture shared discriminative information and boost intra-class consistency; (2) for unbalanced distributions, Guidance Fusion Module (GFM) implements differential amplification of modal discriminative disparities to reinforce dominant modality advantages, guide auxiliary modalities to mine complementary discriminative info, and mitigate inter-modal divergence to boost multi-modal joint decision performance.

Existing VAU approaches often rely on fine-tuned multimodal large language models (MLLMs) or external modules such as video captioners, which introduce costly annotations, complex training pipelines, and high inference overhead. In this work, we introduce PrismVAU, a lightweight yet effective system for real-time VAU that leverages a single off-the-shelf MLLM for anomaly scoring, explanation, and prompt optimization. PrismVAU operates in two complementary stages: (1) a coarse anomaly scoring module that computes frame-level anomaly scores via similarity to textual anchors, and (2) an MLLM-based refinement module that contextualizes anomalies through system and user prompts. Both textual anchors and prompts are optimized with a weakly supervised Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) framework. Extensive experiments on standard VAD benchmarks demonstrate that PrismVAU delivers competitive detection performance and interpretable anomaly explanations -- without relying on instruction tuning, frame-level annotations, and external modules or dense processing -- making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "PrismVAU \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5b9e\u65f6\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u7406\u89e3\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684 VAU \u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6ce8\u91ca\u3001\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u3002PrismVAU \u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "PrismVAU \u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u951a\u70b9\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e27\u7ea7\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u6570\u7684\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u6a21\u5757\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e MLLM \u7684\u7ec6\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002\u6587\u672c\u951a\u70b9\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u901a\u8fc7\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff08APE\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6 VAD \u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPrismVAU \u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u3001\u5e27\u7ea7\u6ce8\u91ca\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "conclusion": "PrismVAU \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u7406\u89e3\uff08VAU\uff09\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u3001\u5e27\u7ea7\u6ce8\u91ca\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u6a21\u5757\u3002"}}

Though deep learning models have excellent fault detection capabilities, almost all methods either are too large and heavy for edge computing devices or involve biased estimation of accuracy due to ineffective learning techniques. We propose a new solar panel fault detection model called HybridSolarNet. It integrates EfficientNet-B0 with Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). We implemented it on the Kaggle Solar Panel Images competition dataset with a tight split-before-augmentation protocol. It avoids leakage in accuracy estimation. We introduced focal loss and cosine annealing. Ablation analysis validates that accuracy boosts due to added benefits from CBAM (+1.53%) and that there are benefits from recognition of classes with imbalanced samples via focal loss. Overall average accuracy on 5-fold stratified cross-validation experiments on the given competition dataset topped 92.37% +/- 0.41 and an F1-score of 0.9226 +/- 0.39 compared to baselines like VGG19, requiring merely 16.3 MB storage, i.e., 32 times less. Its inference speed measured at 54.9 FPS with GPU support makes it a successful candidate for real-time UAV implementation.

Although Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is widely used to enhance MLLM reasoning, surprisingly, its direct application to CVQA often degrades performance, especially in small-scale models. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that standard CoT in CVQA suffers from state entanglement, spurious transitions, and exploration inefficiency, with small models particularly vulnerable in resource-constrained settings. To address these issues, we propose a novel comic reasoning framework, designed to produce more faithful and transferable reasoning chains in small MLLMs. Specifically, our framework combines modular CoT generation with GRPO-based reinforcement fine-tuning and a novel structured reward. Beyond comic VQA, we further evaluate our approach on a broader class of humor-centric and abstract visual reasoning tasks, including meme understanding and editorial cartoon interpretation.

While intermediate fusion mitigates data volume compared to raw sharing, existing frameworks typically rely on spatial compression or static confidence maps, which inefficiently transmit spatially redundant features from non-critical background regions. To address this, we propose Risk-intent Selective detection (RiSe), an interaction-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from identifying visible regions to prioritizing risk-critical ones. Specifically, we introduce a Potential Field-Trajectory Correlation Model (PTCM) grounded in potential field theory to quantitatively assess kinematic risks. Complementing this, an Intention-Driven Area Prediction Module (IDAPM) leverages ego-motion priors to proactively predict and filter key Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) areas essential for decision-making. By integrating these components, RiSe implements a semantic-selective fusion scheme that transmits high-fidelity features only from high-interaction regions, effectively acting as a feature denoiser.

We present ReCCur (Recursive Corner-Case Curation), a low-compute framework that converts noisy web imagery into auditable fine-grained labels via a multi-agent recursive pipeline. First, large-scale data acquisition and filtering expands a domain vocabulary with a vision-language model (VLM), crawls the web, and enforces tri-modal (image, description, keyword) consistency with light human spot checks to yield refined candidates. Next, mixture-of-experts knowledge distillation uses complementary encoders (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2, BEiT) for kNN voting with dual-confidence activation and uncertainty sampling, converging to a high-precision set. Finally, region-evidence VLM adversarial labeling pairs a proposer (multi-granularity regions and semantic cues) with a validator (global and local chained consistency) to produce explainable labels and close the loop.

SA-ResGS improves both the reliability of uncertainty estimates and their effectiveness for supervision by generating Self-Augmented point clouds (SA-Points) via triangulation between a training view and a rasterized extrapolated view, enabling efficient scene coverage estimation. While improving scene coverage through physically guided view selection, SA-ResGS also addresses the challenge of under-supervised Gaussians, exacerbated by sparse and wide-baseline views, by introducing the first residual learning strategy tailored for 3D Gaussian Splatting. This targeted supervision enhances gradient flow in high-uncertainty Gaussians by combining uncertainty-driven filtering with dropout- and hard-negative-mining-inspired sampling. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a physically grounded view selection strategy that promotes efficient and uniform scene coverage; (2) an uncertainty-aware residual supervision scheme that amplifies learning signals for weakly contributing Gaussians, improving training stability and uncertainty estimation across scenes with diverse camera distributions; (3) an implicit unbiasing of uncertainty quantification as a consequence of constrained view selection and residual supervision, which together mitigate conflicting effects of wide-baseline exploration and sparse-view ambiguity in NBV planning.

In these frameworks, a reverse generative process reconstructs physical fields from standard Gaussian noise conditioned on unseen geometries. The proposed approaches operate directly on point-cloud representations of computational domains (e.g., grid vertices of finite-volume meshes) and therefore avoid the limitations of pixelation used to project geometries onto uniform lattices. In contrast to graph neural network-based diffusion models, Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet do not exhibit high-frequency noise artifacts in the predicted fields. Moreover, unlike such approaches, which require auxiliary intermediate networks to condition geometry, the proposed frameworks rely solely on PointNet, resulting in a simple and unified architecture. The performance of the proposed frameworks is evaluated on steady incompressible flow past a cylinder, using a geometric dataset constructed by varying the cylinder's cross-sectional shape and orientation across samples.

Existing approaches either suppress blur as noise and lose discriminative structure, or apply full image restoration that increases latency and limits deployment on resource constrained devices. We propose DFRCP, a Dynamic Fuzzy Robust Convolutional Pyramid, as a plug in upgrade to YOLOv11 for blur robust detection. DFRCP enhances the YOLOv11 feature pyramid by combining large scale and medium scale features while preserving native representations, and by introducing Dynamic Robust Switch units that adaptively inject fuzzy features to strengthen global perception under jitter. Fuzzy features are synthesized by rotating and nonlinearly interpolating multiscale features, then merged through a transparency convolution that learns a content adaptive trade off between original and fuzzy cues. We further develop a CUDA parallel rotation and interpolation kernel that avoids boundary overflow and delivers more than 400 times speedup, making the design practical for edge deployment. We train with paired supervision on a private wheat pest damage dataset of about 3,500 images, augmented threefold using two blur regimes, uniform image wide motion blur and bounding box confined rotational blur.

Although segmentation serves as the foundation for pixel-level understanding, existing approaches face two major challenges. First, they introduce implicit segmentation tokens and require simultaneous fine-tuning of both the MLLM and external pixel decoders, which increases the risk of catastrophic forgetting and limits generalization to out-of-domain scenarios. Second, most methods rely on single-pass reasoning and lack the capability to iteratively refine segmentation results, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel agentic MLLM, named IBISAgent, that reformulates segmentation as a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making process. IBISAgent enables MLLMs to generate interleaved reasoning and text-based click actions, invoke segmentation tools, and produce high-quality masks without architectural modifications. By iteratively performing multi-step visual reasoning on masked image features, IBISAgent naturally supports mask refinement and promotes the development of pixel-level visual reasoning capabilities. We further design a two-stage training framework consisting of cold-start supervised fine-tuning and agentic reinforcement learning with tailored, fine-grained rewards, enhancing the model's robustness in complex medical referring and reasoning segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IBISAgent consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods.

Under domain shifts, the model becomes overly sensitive to fine-grained cues, leading to the suppression of critical features and a significant drop in performance. Cognitive studies suggest that humans classify objects by leveraging both common and specific attributes, enabling accurate differentiation between fine-grained categories. However, current deep learning models have yet to incorporate this mechanism effectively. Inspired by this mechanism, we propose Concept-Feature Structuralized Generalization (CFSG). This model explicitly disentangles both the concept and feature spaces into three structured components: common, specific, and confounding segments. To mitigate the adverse effects of varying degrees of distribution shift, we introduce an adaptive mechanism that dynamically adjusts the proportions of common, specific, and confounding components. In the final prediction, explicit weights are assigned to each pair of components. Extensive experiments on three single-source benchmark datasets demonstrate that CFSG achieves an average performance improvement of 9.87% over baseline models and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by an average of 3.08%.

MLLMs still suffer from visually ungrounded hallucinations, often relying on language priors rather than image evidence. While many prior mitigation strategies operate on the text side, they leave the visual representation unchanged and do not exploit the rich hierarchy of features encoded across vision layers. Existing multi-layer fusion methods partially address this limitation but remain static, applying the same layer mixture regardless of the query. In this work, we introduce TGIF (Text-Guided Inter-layer Fusion), a lightweight module that treats encoder layers as depth-wise \"experts\" and predicts a prompt-dependent fusion of visual features. TGIF follows the principle of direct external fusion, requires no vision-encoder updates, and adds minimal overhead. Integrated into LLaVA-1.5-7B, TGIF provides consistent improvements across hallucination, OCR, and VQA benchmarks, while preserving or improving performance on ScienceQA, GQA, and MMBench.

Meanwhile, closed-source systems (e.g., Nano Banana) have demonstrated strong reasoning-driven image generation, highlighting a substantial gap to current open-source models. We argue that closing this gap requires not merely better visual generators, but executable reasoning: decomposing high-level intents into grounded, verifiable plans that directly steer the generative process. To this end, we propose Unified Thinker, a task-agnostic reasoning architecture for general image generation, designed as a unified planning core that can plug into diverse generators and workflows. Unified Thinker decouples a dedicated Thinker from the image Generator, enabling modular upgrades of reasoning without retraining the entire generative model. We further introduce a two-stage training paradigm: we first build a structured planning interface for the Thinker, then apply reinforcement learning to ground its policy in pixel-level feedback, encouraging plans that optimize visual correctness over textual plausibility.

We introduce LSP-DETR (Local Star Polygon DEtection TRansformer), a fully end-to-end framework that uses a lightweight transformer with linear complexity to process substantially larger images without additional computational cost. Nuclei are represented as star-convex polygons, and a novel radial distance loss function allows the segmentation of overlapping nuclei to emerge naturally, without requiring explicit overlap annotations or handcrafted post-processing.

However, their inherently multiple step inference process imposes substantial computational overhead, hindering real-world deployment. Accelerating diffusion models is therefore essential, yet determining how to combine multiple model acceleration techniques remains a significant challenge.

First, we present DiffBench, a comprehensive benchmark that implements a three stage automated evaluation pipeline across diverse diffusion architectures, optimization combinations and deployment scenarios. Second, we propose DiffAgent, an agent that generates optimal acceleration strategies and codes for arbitrary diffusion models. DiffAgent employs a closed-loop workflow in which a planning component and a debugging component iteratively refine the output of a code generation component, while a genetic algorithm extracts performance feedback from the execution environment to guide subsequent code refinements.

Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that AnatomiX achieves superior anatomical reasoning and delivers over 25% improvement in performance on anatomy grounding, phrase grounding, grounded diagnosis and grounded captioning tasks compared to existing approaches.

We formalize this discrepancy as Conduction Aphasia, a phenomenon where models accurately interpret multimodal inputs but struggle to translate that understanding into faithful and controllable synthesis. To address this, we propose UniCorn, a simple yet elegant self-improvement framework that eliminates the need for external data or teacher supervision. By partitioning a single UMM into three collaborative roles: Proposer, Solver, and Judge, UniCorn generates high-quality interactions via self-play and employs cognitive pattern reconstruction to distill latent understanding into explicit generative signals. To validate the restoration of multimodal coherence, we introduce UniCycle, a cycle-consistency benchmark based on a Text to Image to Text reconstruction loop. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniCorn achieves comprehensive and substantial improvements over the base model across six general image generation benchmarks. Notably, it achieves SOTA performance on TIIF(73.8), DPG(86.8), CompBench(88.5), and UniCycle while further delivering substantial gains of +5.0 on WISE and +6.5 on OneIG.

We introduce LTX-2, an open-source foundational model capable of generating high-quality, temporally synchronized audiovisual content in a unified manner. LTX-2 consists of an asymmetric dual-stream transformer with a 14B-parameter video stream and a 5B-parameter audio stream, coupled through bidirectional audio-video cross-attention layers with temporal positional embeddings and cross-modality AdaLN for shared timestep conditioning. This architecture enables efficient training and inference of a unified audiovisual model while allocating more capacity for video generation than audio generation. We employ a multilingual text encoder for broader prompt understanding and introduce a modality-aware classifier-free guidance (modality-CFG) mechanism for improved audiovisual alignment and controllability.

However, due to the limitations of current AIGC models, most models can only serve as individual components within specific application scenarios and are not capable of completing tasks end-to-end in real-world applications. In real-world applications, editing experts often work with a wide variety of images and video inputs, producing multimodal outputs -- a video typically includes audio, text, and other elements. This level of integration across multiple modalities is something current models are unable to achieve effectively. However, the rise of agent-based systems has made it possible to use AI tools to tackle complex content generation tasks. To deal with the complex scenarios, in this paper, we propose a MultiMedia-Agent designed to automate complex content creation. Our agent system includes a data generation pipeline, a tool library for content creation, and a set of metrics for evaluating preference alignment. Notably, we introduce the skill acquisition theory to model the training data curation and agent training. We designed a two-stage correlation strategy for plan optimization, including self-correlation and model preference correlation. Additionally, we utilized the generated plans to train the MultiMedia-Agent via a three stage approach including base/success plan finetune and preference optimization. The comparison results demonstrate that the our approaches are effective and the MultiMedia-Agent can generate better multimedia content compared to novel models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMultiMedia-Agent\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3AIGC\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u96c6\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAIGC\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5b8c\u6210\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5174\u8d77\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u5de5\u5177\u5e93\u548c\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u6280\u80fd\u83b7\u53d6\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5173\u8054\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u81ea\u5173\u8054\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u597d\u5173\u8054\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u5212\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u57fa\u7840/\u6210\u529f\u8ba1\u5212\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMultiMedia-Agent\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u4f18\u8d28\u7684\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MultiMedia-Agent\u5728\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u4f18\u8d28\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u51fa\u3002"}}

To better assess our method's capabilities, we curate a high-quality 4K synthetic benchmark from five different games, spanning diverse scenes with rich geometric and appearance details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfiniDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks across relative and metric depth estimation tasks, particularly excelling in fine-detail regions.

Previous methods, which rely on part-aware optimization, manual assembly, or 2D image generation, often produce unrealistic or incoherent 3D assets due to the challenges of intricate part-level manipulation and limited out-of-domain generation. In contrast, Muses leverages the 3D skeleton, a fundamental representation of biological forms, to explicitly and rationally compose diverse elements. This skeletal foundation formalizes 3D content creation as a structure-aware pipeline of design, composition, and generation. Muses begins by constructing a creatively composed 3D skeleton with coherent layout and scale through graph-constrained reasoning. This skeleton then guides a voxel-based assembly process within a structured latent space, integrating regions from different objects. Finally, image-guided appearance modeling under skeletal conditions is applied to generate a style-consistent and harmonious texture for the assembled shape. Extensive experiments establish Muses' state-of-the-art performance in terms of visual fidelity and alignment with textual descriptions, and potential on flexible 3D object editing.
