In pursuit of low latency, some recently proposed BFT consensus protocols employ a leaderless optimistic fast path, in which clients broadcast their requests directly to replicas without first serializing requests at a leader, resulting in an end-to-end commit latency of 2 message delays ($2\u0394$) during fault-free, synchronous periods. However, such a fast path only works if there is no contention: concurrent contending requests can cause replicas to diverge if they receive conflicting requests in different orders, triggering costly recovery procedures.\n  In this work, we present Aspen, a leaderless BFT protocol that achieves a near-optimal latency of $2\u0394+ \\varepsilon$, where $\\varepsilon$ indicates a short waiting delay. Aspen removes the no-contention condition by utilizing a best-effort sequencing layer based on loosely synchronized clocks and network delay estimates. Aspen requires $n = 3f + 2p + 1$ replicas to cope with up to $f$ Byzantine nodes. The $2p$ extra nodes allow Aspen's fast path to proceed even if up to $p$ replicas diverge due to unpredictable network delays. When its optimistic conditions do not hold, Aspen falls back to PBFT-style protocol, guaranteeing safety and liveness under partial synchrony. In experiments with wide-area distributed replicas, Aspen commits requests in less than 75 ms, a 1.2 to 3.3$\\times$ improvement compared to previous protocols, while supporting 19,000 requests per second.", "AI": {"tldr": "Aspen\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u7684BFT\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5feb\u901f\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u5907\u7528\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff082\u0394+\u03b5\uff09\u548c\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0819,000\u8bf7\u6c42/\u79d2\uff09\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u534f\u8bae\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740BFT\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u9762\u5411\u7528\u6237\u7684\u8bb8\u53ef\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u652f\u4ed8\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e00\u4e9bBFT\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u65e0\u7ade\u4e89\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b02\u0394\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7ade\u4e89\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u526f\u672c\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u89e6\u53d1\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6062\u590d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "Aspen\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u7684BFT\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e50\u89c2\u5feb\u901f\u8def\u5f84\u548cPBFT\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u5907\u7528\u534f\u8bae\u3002\u4e50\u89c2\u5feb\u901f\u8def\u5f84\u5229\u7528\u677e\u6563\u540c\u6b65\u65f6\u949f\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f30\u8ba1\u6765\u907f\u514d\u7ade\u4e89\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u526f\u672c\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u800c\u5907\u7528\u534f\u8bae\u5219\u5728\u4e50\u89c2\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e7f\u57df\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u526f\u672c\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cAspen\u7684\u8bf7\u6c42\u63d0\u4ea4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5c0f\u4e8e75\u6beb\u79d2\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u534f\u8bae\u63d0\u5347\u4e861.2\u52303.3\u500d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u6bcf\u79d219,000\u6b21\u8bf7\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "Aspen\u534f\u8bae\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u677e\u6563\u540c\u6b65\u65f6\u949f\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u52aa\u529b\u6392\u5e8f\u5c42\uff0c\u79fb\u9664\u4e86\u65e0\u7ade\u4e89\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff082\u0394+\u03b5\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u534f\u8bae\u63d0\u5347\u4e861.2\u52303.3\u500d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, deploying MoE models on such edge-based GPU-NDP systems faces three critical challenges: 1) severe load imbalance across NDP units due to non-uniform expert selection and expert parallelism, 2) insufficient GPU utilization during expert computation within NDP units, and 3) extensive data pre-profiling necessitated by unpredictable expert activation patterns for pre-fetching. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient inference framework featuring three key optimizations. First, the underexplored tensor parallelism in MoE inference is exploited to partition and compute large expert parameters across multiple NDP units simultaneously towards edge low-batch scenarios. Second, a load-balancing-aware scheduling algorithm distributes expert computations across NDP units and GPU to maximize resource utilization. Third, a dataset-free pre-fetching strategy proactively loads frequently accessed experts to minimize activation delays.

We start with an intrinsic Gaussian curvature-based surface exaggeration technique, which, when coupled with texture, tends to produce over-smoothed renders. To address this, we resort to 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), which has recently been shown to produce realistic free-viewpoint avatars. Given a multiview sequence, we extract a FLAME mesh, solve a curvature-weighted Poisson equation, and obtain its exaggerated form. However, directly deforming the Gaussians yields poor results, necessitating the synthesis of pseudo-ground-truth caricature images by warping each frame to its exaggerated 2D representation using local affine transformations. We then devise a training scheme that alternates real and synthesized supervision, enabling a single Gaussian collection to represent both natural and exaggerated avatars. This scheme improves fidelity, supports local edits, and allows continuous control over the intensity of the caricature.

This paper presents a year-long case study of an eight-person student development team tasked with designing and implementing a virtual reality game that simulates a university campus and provides program-related educational content. We analyze how the team adapted Scrum practices (sprint structure, roles, backlog management) to fit semester rhythms, exams, travel, and part-time availability, and how communication and coordination were maintained in a hybrid on-site/remote environment. Using qualitative observations and artifacts from Discord, Notion, and GitHub, as well as contribution metrics and a custom communication effectiveness index (score: 0.76/1.00), we evaluate three dimensions: (1) the effectiveness of collaboration tools, (2) the impact of hybrid work on communication and productivity, and (3) the feasibility of aligning Scrum with academic timelines. Our findings show that (i) lightweight, tool-mediated coordination enabled stable progress even during remote periods; (ii) one-week sprints and flexible ceremonies helped reconcile Scrum with academic obligations; and (iii) shared motivation, role clarity, and compatible working styles were as critical as process mechanics.

A popular means of representing the trajectory in continuous time is via a Gaussian process (GP) prior, with the prior's mean and covariance functions generated by a linear time-varying (LTV) stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by white noise. When the state comprises elements of Lie groups, previous works have resorted to a patchwork of local GPs each with a linear time-invariant SDE kernel, which while effective in practice, lacks theoretical elegance. Here we revisit the full LTV GP approach to continuous-time trajectory estimation, deriving a global GP prior on Lie groups via the Magnus expansion, which offers a more elegant and general solution.

Previous approaches such as AlphaGo and its successors, have predominantly relied on model-based Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In this work, we present QZero, a novel model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that forgoes search during training and learns a Nash equilibrium policy through self-play and off-policy experience replay. Built upon entropy-regularized Q-learning, QZero utilizes a single Q-value network to unify policy evaluation and improvement. Starting tabula rasa without human data and trained for 5 months with modest compute resources (7 GPUs), QZero achieved a performance level comparable to that of AlphaGo. This demonstrates, for the first time, the efficiency of using model-free reinforcement learning to master the game of Go, as well as the feasibility of off-policy reinforcement learning in solving large-scale and complex environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "QZero\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u5bf9\u5f08\u548c\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u638c\u63e1\u56f4\u68cb\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8eAlphaGo\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u56f4\u68cb\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6218\u7565\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u957f\u671f\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u6b64\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982AlphaGo\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff08MCTS\uff09\uff0cQZero\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "QZero\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316Q\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u5bf9\u5f08\u548c\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u7ecf\u9a8c\u56de\u653e\u5b66\u4e60\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "QZero\u57285\u4e2a\u6708\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9002\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff087\u5757GPU\uff09\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u4e0eAlphaGo\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "QZero\u9996\u6b21\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u638c\u63e1\u56f4\u68cb\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

Polyphony is designed to be complementary to other adaptive mechanisms like congestion control and traffic engineering, but targets different aspects of network operation that have previously been considered static. By contrast to Polyphony, prior model-free optimization methods work best when there are only a few relevant degrees of freedom and where workloads and measurements are stable, assumptions not present in modern data center networks.\n  Polyphony develops novel methods for measuring, predicting, and controlling network quality of service metrics for a dynamically changing workload. First, we monitor and aggregate workloads on a network-wide basis; we use the result as input to an approximate counterfactual prediction engine that estimates the effect of potential network configuration changes on network quality of service; we apply the best candidate and repeat in a closed-loop manner aimed at rapidly and stably converging to a configuration that meets operator goals. Using CloudLab on a simple topology, we observe that Polyphony converges to tight SLOs within ten minutes, and re-stabilizes after large workload shifts within fifteen minutes, while the prior state of the art fails to adapt.", "AI": {"tldr": "Polyphony \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u73af\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5c3e\u90e8\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u548c\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u6d41\u91cf\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u5c3e\u90e8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "Polyphony \u91c7\u7528\u7f51\u7edc\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u805a\u5408\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9884\u6d4b\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u4ee5\u95ed\u73af\u65b9\u5f0f\u5feb\u901f\u8c03\u6574\u7f51\u7edc\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5728 CloudLab \u7684\u7b80\u5355\u62d3\u6251\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPolyphony \u80fd\u5728 10 \u5206\u949f\u5185\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u4e25\u683c\u7684 SLO\uff0c\u5e76\u5728 15 \u5206\u949f\u5185\u9002\u5e94\u5927\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "Polyphony \u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u76d1\u6d4b\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u7f51\u7edc\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u5c3e\u90e8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

A major challenge is to relight the avatars to match any scene illumination. For high quality relighting, existing methods require subjects to be captured under complex time-multiplexed illumination, such as one-light-at-a-time (OLAT). We propose a new generalized relightable 3D Gaussian head model that can relight any subject observed in a single- or multi-view images without requiring OLAT data for that subject. Our core idea is to learn a mapping from flat-lit 3DGS avatars to corresponding relightable Gaussian parameters for that avatar. Our model consists of two stages: a first stage that models flat-lit 3DGS avatars without OLAT lighting, and a second stage that learns the mapping to physically-based reflectance parameters for high-quality relighting. This two-stage design allows us to train the first stage across diverse existing multi-view datasets without OLAT lighting ensuring cross-subject generalization, where we learn a dataset-specific lighting code for self-supervised lighting alignment. Subsequently, the second stage can be trained on a significantly smaller dataset of subjects captured under OLAT illumination. Together, this allows our method to generalize well and relight any subject from the first stage as if we had captured them under OLAT lighting.

Our module ChunkShapley constructs offline labels by (i) single-chunk probing with teacher-forced likelihood to estimate signed, weighted effects, (ii) a surrogate game that captures saturation and interference, (iii) exact Shapley computation for small retrieval sets, and (iv) bounded post-verification that selects a decoding-optimal coalition using the frozen generator. We distill verified $KEEP$ or $DROP$ decisions and retrieval triggering into a single model via discrete control tokens.

In this field test, Lidar Teach and Repeat provides an ideal autonomy solution for transporting cargo in this way. A one-tonne path-to-flight rover was driven in a semi-autonomous remote-control mode to create a network of safe paths. Once the route was taught, the rover immediately repeated the entire network of paths autonomously while carrying cargo. The closed-loop performance is accurate enough to align the vehicle to the cargo and pick it up.

However, unlike biological evolution, most LLM-evolution frameworks are formulated as static optimization problems, overlooking the open-ended adversarial dynamics that characterize real-world evolutionary processes. Here, we study Digital Red Queen (DRQ), a simple self-play algorithm that embraces these so-called \"Red Queen\" dynamics via continual adaptation to a changing objective. DRQ uses an LLM to evolve assembly-like programs, called warriors, which compete against each other for control of a virtual machine in the game of Core War, a Turing-complete environment studied in artificial life and connected to cybersecurity. In each round of DRQ, the model evolves a new warrior to defeat all previous ones, producing a sequence of adapted warriors. Over many rounds, we observe that warriors become increasingly general (relative to a set of held-out human warriors). Interestingly, warriors also become less behaviorally diverse across independent runs, indicating a convergence pressure toward a general-purpose behavioral strategy, much like convergent evolution in nature. This result highlights a potential value of shifting from static objectives to dynamic Red Queen objectives.

However, as the number of erased concepts grows, these methods often become inefficient and ineffective, since each concept requires a separate set of fine-tuned parameters and may degrade the overall generation quality. In this work, we propose a supertype-subtype concept hierarchy that organizes erased concepts into a parent-child structure. Each erased concept is treated as a child node, and semantically related concepts (e.g., macaw, and bald eagle) are grouped under a shared parent node, referred to as a supertype concept (e.g., bird). Rather than erasing concepts individually, we introduce an effective and efficient group-wise suppression method, where semantically similar concepts are grouped and erased jointly by sharing a single set of learnable parameters. During the erasure phase, standard diffusion regularization is applied to preserve denoising process in unmasked regions. To mitigate the degradation of supertype generation caused by excessive erasure of semantically related subtypes, we propose a novel method called Supertype-Preserving Low-Rank Adaptation (SuPLoRA), which encodes the supertype concept information in the frozen down-projection matrix and updates only the up-projection matrix during erasure. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of SuPLoRA in mitigating generation performance degradation.

These re-routing mechanisms rely on pre-installed static re-routing rules at the nodes (the routers), which depend only on local failure information, namely on the failed links incident to the node. Ideally, a network is perfectly resilient: the re-routing rules ensure that packets are always successfully routed to their destinations as long as the source and the destination are still physically connected in the underlying network after the failures. Unfortunately, there are examples where achieving perfect resilience is not possible. Surprisingly, only very little is known about the algorithmic aspect of when and how perfect resilience can be achieved.\n  We investigate the computational complexity of analyzing such local fast re-routing mechanisms. Our main result is a negative one: we show that even checking whether a given set of static re-routing rules ensures perfect resilience is coNP-complete. We also show coNP-completeness of the so-called ideal resilience, a weaker notion of resilience often considered in the literature. Additionally, we investigate other fundamental variations of the problem.

In this paper, we present a universal generative pipeline, CHORD, for CHOReographing Dynamic objects and scenes and synthesizing this type of phenomena. Traditional rule-based graphics pipelines to create these dynamics are based on category-specific heuristics, yet are labor-intensive and not scalable. Recent learning-based methods typically demand large-scale datasets, which may not cover all object categories in interest. Our approach instead inherits the universality from the video generative models by proposing a distillation-based pipeline to extract the rich Lagrangian motion information hidden in the Eulerian representations of 2D videos. Our method is universal, versatile, and category-agnostic. We demonstrate its effectiveness by conducting experiments to generate a diverse range of multi-body 4D dynamics, show its advantage compared to existing methods, and demonstrate its applicability in generating robotics manipulation policies.

The dataset covers three proficiency levels - beginner, intermediate, and advanced - and includes both class-based and function-based problem types with detailed problem specifications and comprehensive test suites. To facilitate widespread adoption, we also developed RunCodeEval, an open-source execution framework that provides researchers with a ready-to-use evaluation pipeline for CodeEval.

This paper revisits a fundamental yet seldom systematically studied question: how VLM choice and competence translate to downstream VLA policies performance? We introduce VLM4VLA, a minimal adaptation pipeline that converts general-purpose VLMs into VLA policies using only a small set of new learnable parameters for fair and efficient comparison. Despite its simplicity, VLM4VLA proves surprisingly competitive with more sophisticated network designs. Through extensive empirical studies on various downstream tasks across three benchmarks, we find that while VLM initialization offers a consistent benefit over training from scratch, a VLM's general capabilities are poor predictors of its downstream task performance. This challenges common assumptions, indicating that standard VLM competence is necessary but insufficient for effective embodied control. We further investigate the impact of specific embodied capabilities by fine-tuning VLMs on seven auxiliary embodied tasks (e.g., embodied QA, visual pointing, depth estimation). Contrary to intuition, improving a VLM's performance on specific embodied skills does not guarantee better downstream control performance. Finally, modality-level ablations identify the visual module in VLM, rather than the language component, as the primary performance bottleneck. We demonstrate that injecting control-relevant supervision into the vision encoder of the VLM yields consistent gains, even when the encoder remains frozen during downstream fine-tuning.

This signal is integrated into a subjective reward function to study how self-awareness affects the agent's learning abilities.

In such scenarios, NTNs, and specifically UAVs, are promising candidates to provide on-demand and rapid connectivity on the ground, serving as aerial base stations. In this paper, we implement a setup in which a rotary-wing UAV, equipped with a Starlink Mini terminal, provides Internet connectivity to an emergency ground user in the absence of cellular coverage via LEO satellites. The UAV functions as a Wi-Fi access point, while backhauling the ground traffic through the Starlink constellation. We evaluate the system via both network simulations in ns-3 and real-world flight experiments in a rural environment, in terms of throughput, latency, coverage, and energy consumption under static and dynamic flight conditions. Our results demonstrate that the system can maintain a stable uplink throughput of approximately 30 Mbps up to approximately 200 meters, and with minimal impact on the UAV battery lifetime. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of deploying commercial LEO satellite terminals on UAVs as a practical solution for emergency connectivity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u642d\u8f7dStarlink Mini\u7ec8\u7aef\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LEO\u536b\u661f\u4e3a\u65e0\u8702\u7a9d\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u5e94\u6025\u5730\u9762\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5730\u9762\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u519c\u6751\u6216\u53d7\u635f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u5bf9\u516c\u5171\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u707e\u5bb3\u6551\u63f4\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a7a\u4e2d\u57fa\u7ad9\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u6309\u9700\u5feb\u901f\u8fde\u63a5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7ns-3\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u98de\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u98de\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9ad8\u8fbe\u7ea6200\u7c73\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u80fd\u7ef4\u6301\u7ea630 Mbps\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e0a\u884c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7535\u6c60\u5bff\u547d\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u5546\u7528LEO\u536b\u661f\u7ec8\u7aef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e94\u6025\u8fde\u63a5\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u65e0\u8702\u7a9d\u8986\u76d6\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4e0a\u884c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff08\u7ea630 Mbps\uff09\u4e14\u5bf9\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7535\u6c60\u5bff\u547d\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5c0f\u3002"}}

Existing UAV navigation approaches rely on simplified simulators and supervised perception pipelines, and lack embodied agents interacting with physically realistic fire environments. We introduce FIRE-VLM, the first end-to-end vision-language model (VLM) guided reinforcement learning (RL) framework trained entirely within a high-fidelity, physics-grounded wildfire digital twin. Built from USGS Digital Elevation Model (DEM) terrain, LANDFIRE fuel inventories, and semi-physical fire-spread solvers, this twin captures terrain-induced runs, wind-driven acceleration, smoke plume occlusion, and dynamic fuel consumption. Within this environment, a PPO agent with dual-view UAV sensing is guided by a CLIP-style VLM. Wildfire-specific semantic alignment scores, derived from a single prompt describing active fire and smoke plumes, are integrated as potential-based reward shaping signals. Our contributions are: (1) a GIS-to-simulation pipeline for constructing wildfire digital twins; (2) a VLM-guided RL agent for UAV firefront tracking; and (3) a wildfire-aware reward design that combines physical terms with VLM semantics. Across five digital-twin evaluation tasks, our VLM-guided policy reduces time-to-detection by up to 6 times, increases time-in-FOV, and is, to our knowledge, the first RL-based UAV wildfire monitoring system demonstrated in kilometer-scale, physics-grounded digital-twin fires.", "AI": {"tldr": "FIRE-VLM\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u548cVLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684RL\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u91ce\u706b\u76d1\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u5343\u7c73\u7ea7\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u611f\u77e5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u706b\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6781\u7aef\u89c6\u89c9\u9000\u5316\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u91ce\u706b\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408GIS\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u91ce\u706b\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5229\u7528CLIP\u98ce\u683c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5f15\u5bfcPPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u89c6\u89d2\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u706b\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u9879\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cVLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u68c0\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed\u81f36\u500d\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u89c6\u91ce\u5185\u505c\u7559\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u5343\u7c73\u7ea7\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u91ce\u706b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86RL\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u76d1\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "FIRE-VLM\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u91ce\u706b\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To address these issues, this study leverages deep learning-based image recognition for automated classification of white shrimp immediately after harvest.

In practical situations on inference tasks, the model's parameters have uncertainty because they are often learned from data, and thus we want to compute the degree of uncertainty in the inference outcome. One possible approach is to regard the inference outcome as a random variable by introducing distributions for the parameters and evaluate the variance of the outcome. Unfortunately, the tractability of computing such a variance is hardly known. Motivated by this, we consider the problem of computing the variance of WMC and investigate this problem's tractability. First, we derive a polynomial time algorithm to evaluate the WMC variance when the input is given as a structured d-DNNF.

Guided by a taxonomy spanning 90+ scientific and engineering domains, our discovery stage starts from a recall-oriented pool of over 500,000 public repositories and progressively filters it to 52,550 executable tool candidates under license- and quality-aware criteria. Deploy-Master transforms heterogeneous open-source repositories into runnable, containerized capabilities grounded in execution rather than documentation claims. In a single day, we performed 52,550 build attempts and constructed reproducible runtime environments for 50,112 scientific tools. Each successful tool is validated by a minimal executable command and registered in SciencePedia for search and reuse, enabling direct human use and optional agent-based invocation.\n  Beyond delivering runnable tools, we report a deployment trace at the scale of 50,000 tools, characterizing throughput, cost profiles, failure surfaces, and specification uncertainty that become visible only at scale.

However, traditional approaches exhibit limited adaptability in dynamic environments. To address these limitations, this paper proposes OFF-EMMA, a novel end-to-end multimodal framework designed to overcome the deficiencies of insufficient spatial perception and unstable reasoning in visual-language-action (VLA) models for off-road autonomous driving scenarios. The framework explicitly annotates input images through the design of a visual prompt block and introduces a chain-of-thought with self-consistency (COT-SC) reasoning strategy to enhance the accuracy and robustness of trajectory planning. The visual prompt block utilizes semantic segmentation masks as visual prompts, enhancing the spatial understanding ability of pre-trained visual-language models for complex terrains. The COT- SC strategy effectively mitigates the error impact of outliers on planning performance through a multi-path reasoning mechanism. Experimental results on the RELLIS-3D off-road dataset demonstrate that OFF-EMMA significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing the average L2 error of the Qwen backbone model by 13.3% and decreasing the failure rate from 16.52% to 6.56%.", "AI": {"tldr": "OFF-EMMA enhances off-road autonomous driving with improved spatial perception and reasoning, reducing errors and failure rates significantly.", "motivation": "To address the limitations of traditional approaches in dynamic off-road environments, particularly insufficient spatial perception and unstable reasoning in VLA models.", "method": "The framework employs a visual prompt block for enhanced spatial perception and a COT-SC reasoning strategy for robust trajectory planning.", "result": "Experimental results show a 13.3% reduction in average L2 error and a decrease in failure rate from 16.52% to 6.56% on the RELLIS-3D dataset.", "conclusion": "OFF-EMMA significantly improves trajectory planning accuracy and robustness in off-road terrains, outperforming existing methods with notable reductions in error and failure rates."}}

Previous approaches, such as rule-based systems, face significant limitations, including poor interpretability, inconsistent adherence to guidelines, and narrow domain applicability. To address this, we develop and validate CPGPrompt, an auto-prompting system that converts narrative clinical guidelines into large language models (LLMs).\n  Our framework translates CPGs into structured decision trees and utilizes an LLM to dynamically navigate them for patient case evaluation. Synthetic vignettes were generated across three domains (headache, lower back pain, and prostate cancer) and distributed into four categories to test different decision scenarios. System performance was assessed on both binary specialty-referral decisions and fine-grained pathway-classification tasks.\n  The binary specialty referral classification achieved consistently strong performance across all domains (F1: 0.85-1.00), with high recall (1.00 $\\pm$ 0.00). In contrast, multi-class pathway assignment showed reduced performance, with domain-specific variations: headache (F1: 0.47), lower back pain (F1: 0.72), and prostate cancer (F1: 0.77).

However, associating mobile devices to cells to maximize overall network performance, a.k.a. cell (re)selection, remains a key challenge for mobile operators. Today, cell (re)selection parameters are typically configured manually based on operator experience and rarely adapted to dynamic network conditions. In this work, we ask: Can an agent automatically learn and adapt cell (re)selection parameters to consistently improve network performance? We present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework called CellPilot that adaptively tunes cell (re)selection parameters by learning spatiotemporal patterns of mobile network dynamics. Our study with real-world data demonstrates that even a lightweight RL agent can outperform conventional heuristic reconfigurations by up to 167%, while generalizing effectively across different network scenarios. These results indicate that data-driven approaches can significantly improve cell (re)selection configurations and enhance mobile network performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "CellPilot\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u5c0f\u533a\u9009\u62e9\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5c0f\u533a\uff08\u91cd\uff09\u9009\u62e9\u53c2\u6570\u901a\u5e38\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u7ecf\u9a8c\u624b\u52a8\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a2\u7d22\u81ea\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6CellPilot\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u79fb\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u5c0f\u533a\uff08\u91cd\uff09\u9009\u62e9\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7RL\u4ee3\u7406\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u91cd\u65b0\u914d\u7f6e\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe167%\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u5c0f\u533a\uff08\u91cd\uff09\u9009\u62e9\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u79fb\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We examine how often tests are included, when they are introduced during the PR lifecycle and how test-containing PRs differ from non-test PRs in terms of size, turnaround time, and merge outcomes. Across agents, test-containing PRs are more common over time and tend to be larger and take longer to complete, while merge rates remain largely similar.

Performance of string instruments, such as violin and cello, presents a significant challenge due to the precise control required over bow angle and pressure to produce the desired sound. While prior robotic cellists focus on accurate bowing trajectories, these works often rely on expensive motion capture techniques, and fail to sightread music in a human-like way.\n  We propose a novel end-to-end MIDI score to robotic motion pipeline which converts musical input directly into collision-aware bowing motions for a UR5e robot cellist. Through use of Universal Robot Freedrive feature, our robotic musician can achieve human-like sound without the need for motion capture. Additionally, this work records live joint data via Real-Time Data Exchange (RTDE) as the robot plays, providing labeled robotic playing data from a collection of five standard pieces to the research community. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in comparison to human performers, we introduce the Musical Turing Test, in which a collection of 132 human participants evaluate our robot's performance against a human baseline. Human reference recordings are also released, enabling direct comparison for future studies. This evaluation technique establishes the first benchmark for robotic cello performance.

Crucially, can VLMs detect when a reasoning process is wrong and identify its error type? To answer this, we present MMErroR, a multi-modal benchmark of 2,013 samples, each embedding a single coherent reasoning error. These samples span 24 subdomains across six top-level domains, ensuring broad coverage and taxonomic richness. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on answer correctness, MMErroR targets a process-level, error-centric evaluation that requires models to detect incorrect reasoning and classify the error type within both visual and linguistic contexts. We evaluate 20 advanced VLMs, even the best model (Gemini-3.0-Pro) classifies the error in only 66.47\\% of cases, underscoring the challenge of identifying erroneous reasoning. Furthermore, the ability to accurately identify errors offers valuable insights into the capabilities of multi-modal reasoning models.

However, whether LFMs can provide truly personalized treatment recommendations remains an open question. Recent research has revealed multiple challenges for personalization, including the fundamental generalizability paradox: models achieving high accuracy in one clinical study perform at chance level in others, demonstrating that personalization and external validity exist in tension. This exemplifies broader contradictions in AI-driven healthcare: the privacy-performance paradox, scale-specificity paradox, and the automation-empathy paradox. As another challenge, the degree of causal understanding required for personalized recommendations, as opposed to mere predictive capacities of LFMs, remains an open question. N-of-1 trials -- crossover self-experiments and the gold standard for individual causal inference in personalized medicine -- resolve these tensions by providing within-person causal evidence while preserving privacy through local experimentation. Despite their impressive capabilities, this paper argues that LFMs cannot replace N-of-1 trials. We argue that LFMs and N-of-1 trials are complementary: LFMs excel at rapid hypothesis generation from population patterns using multimodal data, while N-of-1 trials excel at causal validation for a given individual. We propose a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of both to enable personalization and navigate the identified paradoxes: LFMs generate ranked intervention candidates with uncertainty estimates, which trigger subsequent N-of-1 trials. Clarifying the boundary between prediction and causation and explicitly addressing the paradoxical tensions are essential for responsible AI integration in personalized medicine.", "AI": {"tldr": "LFMs\u867d\u5f3a\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u66ff\u4ee3N-of-1\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8LFMs\u80fd\u5426\u63d0\u4f9b\u771f\u6b63\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff08\u5982\u6cdb\u5316\u6096\u8bba\u3001\u9690\u79c1-\u6027\u80fd\u6096\u8bba\u7b49\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LFMs\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u548cN-of-1\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "LFMs\u65e0\u6cd5\u66ff\u4ee3N-of-1\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f46\u4e24\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u7597\u3002", "conclusion": "LFMs\u548cN-of-1\u8bd5\u9a8c\u662f\u4e92\u8865\u7684\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u64c5\u957f\u57fa\u4e8e\u7fa4\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u64c5\u957f\u4e2a\u4f53\u56e0\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u3002"}}

This paper introduces Locomotion Beyond Feet, a comprehensive system for whole-body humanoid locomotion across extremely challenging terrains, including low-clearance spaces under chairs, knee-high walls, knee-high platforms, and steep ascending and descending stairs. Our approach addresses two key challenges: contact-rich motion planning and generalization across diverse terrains. To this end, we combine physics-grounded keyframe animation with reinforcement learning.

This paper introduces Guardians of the Hair (HairGuard), a framework designed to recover fine-grained soft boundary details in 3D vision tasks. Specifically, we first propose a novel data curation pipeline that leverages image matting datasets for training and design a depth fixer network to automatically identify soft boundary regions. With a gated residual module, the depth fixer refines depth precisely around soft boundaries while maintaining global depth quality, allowing plug-and-play integration with state-of-the-art depth models. For view synthesis, we perform depth-based forward warping to retain high-fidelity textures, followed by a generative scene painter that fills disoccluded regions and eliminates redundant background artifacts within soft boundaries. Finally, a color fuser adaptively combines warped and inpainted results to produce novel views with consistent geometry and fine-grained details.

We introduce PointWorld, a large pre-trained 3D world model that unifies state and action in a shared 3D space as 3D point flows: given one or few RGB-D images and a sequence of low-level robot action commands, PointWorld forecasts per-pixel displacements in 3D that respond to the given actions. By representing actions as 3D point flows instead of embodiment-specific action spaces (e.g., joint positions), this formulation directly conditions on physical geometries of robots while seamlessly integrating learning across embodiments. To train our 3D world model, we curate a large-scale dataset spanning real and simulated robotic manipulation in open-world environments, enabled by recent advances in 3D vision and simulated environments, totaling about 2M trajectories and 500 hours across a single-arm Franka and a bimanual humanoid. Through rigorous, large-scale empirical studies of backbones, action representations, learning objectives, partial observability, data mixtures, domain transfers, and scaling, we distill design principles for large-scale 3D world modeling. With a real-time (0.1s) inference speed, PointWorld can be efficiently integrated in the model-predictive control (MPC) framework for manipulation. We demonstrate that a single pre-trained checkpoint enables a real-world Franka robot to perform rigid-body pushing, deformable and articulated object manipulation, and tool use, without requiring any demonstrations or post-training and all from a single image captured in-the-wild.

Recent research has attempted to improve safety by training models to reason over safety rules before responding. However, a key issue lies in determining what form of safety reasoning effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, which is difficult to explicitly design or directly obtain. To address this, we propose \\textbf{STAR-S} (\\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{TA}ught \\textbf{R}easoning based on \\textbf{S}afety rules), a framework that integrates the learning of safety rule reasoning into a self-taught loop. The core of STAR-S involves eliciting reasoning and reflection guided by safety rules, then leveraging fine-tuning to enhance safety reasoning. Repeating this process creates a synergistic cycle. Improvements in the model's reasoning and interpretation of safety rules allow it to produce better reasoning data under safety rule prompts, which is then utilized for further training. Experiments show that STAR-S effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, outperforming baselines.

Current benchmarks typically fluctuate between isolated code snippets and black-box evaluations. We present RepoReason, a white-box diagnostic benchmark centered on abductive assertion verification. To eliminate memorization while preserving authentic logical depth, we implement an execution-driven mutation framework that utilizes the environment as a semantic oracle to regenerate ground-truth states. Furthermore, we establish a fine-grained diagnostic system using dynamic program slicing, quantifying reasoning via three orthogonal metrics: $ESV$ (reading load), $MCL$ (simulation depth), and $DFI$ (integration width). Comprehensive evaluations of frontier models (e.g., Claude-4.5-Sonnet, DeepSeek-v3.1-Terminus) reveal a prevalent aggregation deficit, where integration width serves as the primary cognitive bottleneck.

However, this co-optimization of body and control is challenging, because controllers need some time to adapt to the evolving morphology - which may make it difficult for new and promising designs to enter the evolving population. A solution to this is to add intra-life learning, defined as an additional controller optimization loop, to each individual in the evolving population. A related problem is the lack of diversity often seen in evolving populations as evolution narrows the search down to a few promising designs too quickly. This problem can be mitigated by implementing full generational replacement, where offspring robots replace the whole population. This solution for increasing diversity usually comes at the cost of lower performance compared to using elitism. In this work, we show that combining such generational replacement with intra-life learning can increase diversity while retaining performance. We also highlight the importance of performance metrics when studying learning in morphologically evolving robots, showing that evaluating according to function evaluations versus according to generations of evolution can give different conclusions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee3\u9645\u66ff\u6362\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5185\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e14\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e2d\u5f62\u6001\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5171\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u9002\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u79cd\u7fa4\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4ee3\u9645\u66ff\u6362\u548c\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5185\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u5bf9\u7ed3\u8bba\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4ee3\u9645\u66ff\u6362\u548c\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5185\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u589e\u52a0\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e14\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4ee3\u9645\u66ff\u6362\u548c\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5185\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u52a0\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u5f62\u6001\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, effective code generation requires models to understand and apply a wide range of language concepts. If the concepts exercised in benchmarks are not representative of those used in real-world projects, evaluations may yield incomplete. Despite this concern, the representativeness of code concepts in benchmarks has not been systematically examined.\n  To address this gap, we present the first empirical study that analyzes the representativeness of code generation benchmarks through the lens of Knowledge Units (KUs) - cohesive sets of programming language capabilities provided by language constructs and APIs. We analyze KU coverage in two widely used Python benchmarks, HumanEval and MBPP, and compare them with 30 real-world Python projects. Our results show that each benchmark covers only half of the identified 20 KUs, whereas projects exercise all KUs with relatively balanced distributions. In contrast, benchmark tasks exhibit highly skewed KU distributions.\n  To mitigate this misalignment, we propose a prompt-based LLM framework that synthesizes KU-based tasks to rebalance benchmark KU distributions and better align them with real-world usage. Using this framework, we generate 440 new tasks and augment existing benchmarks. The augmented benchmarks substantially improve KU coverage and achieve over a 60% improvement in distributional alignment. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on these augmented benchmarks reveal consistent and statistically significant performance drops (12.54-44.82%), indicating that existing benchmarks overestimate LLM performance due to their limited KU coverage. Our findings provide actionable guidance for building more realistic evaluations of LLM code-generation capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684KU\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6846\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u9ad8\u4f30LLM\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ef\u80fd\u672a\u5145\u5206\u4ee3\u8868\u771f\u5b9e\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u5355\u5143\uff08KU\uff09\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684Python\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08HumanEval\u548cMBPP\uff09\u4e0e30\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9ePython\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684LLM\u6846\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee5\u91cd\u65b0\u5e73\u8861\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684KU\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ec5\u8986\u76d620\u4e2aKU\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u534a\uff0c\u800c\u771f\u5b9e\u9879\u76ee\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u6240\u6709KU\u4e14\u5206\u5e03\u66f4\u5747\u8861\u3002\u589e\u5f3a\u540e\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86KU\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0860%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5bf9LLM\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u9ad8\u4f30\uff0812.54-44.82%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u5355\u5143\uff08KU\uff09\u8986\u76d6\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u9ad8\u4f30\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6846\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86KU\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684LLM\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

This creates a body-brain optimization problem, where both morphology and control must be optimized together. A common approach is to include controller optimization for each morphology, but starting from scratch for every new body may require a high controller learning budget. We address this by using Bayesian optimization for controller optimization, exploiting its sample efficiency and strong exploration capabilities, and using sample inheritance as a form of Lamarckian inheritance. Under a deliberately low controller learning budget for each morphology, we investigate two types of sample inheritance: (1) transferring all the parent's samples to the offspring to be used as prior without evaluating them, and (2) reevaluating the parent's best samples on the offspring. Both are compared to a baseline without inheritance. Our results show that reevaluation performs best, with prior-based inheritance also outperforming no inheritance. Analysis reveals that while the learning budget is too low for a single morphology, generational inheritance compensates for this by accumulating learned adaptations across generations. Furthermore, inheritance mainly benefits offspring morphologies that are similar to their parents. Finally, we demonstrate the critical role of the environment, with more challenging environments resulting in more stable walking gaits. Our findings highlight that inheritance mechanisms can boost performance in evolutionary robotics without needing large learning budgets, offering an efficient path toward more capable robot design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u4f4e\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u5408\u6837\u672c\u7ee7\u627f\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u7236\u4ee3\u6837\u672c\uff09\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u73af\u5883\u6311\u6218\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u6b65\u6001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u65b0\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u7b97\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6837\u672c\u7ee7\u627f\u65b9\u5f0f\uff1a1\uff09\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u7236\u4ee3\u6837\u672c\u8f6c\u79fb\u7ed9\u540e\u4ee3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\u800c\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u540e\u4ee3\u4e0a\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u7236\u4ee3\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u7236\u4ee3\u6700\u4f73\u6837\u672c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5148\u9a8c\u7ee7\u627f\u4e5f\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u7ee7\u627f\u3002\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ee7\u627f\u673a\u5236\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u4ee3\u79ef\u7d2f\u5b66\u4e60\u9002\u5e94\u6765\u8865\u507f\u4f4e\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u4e14\u4e3b\u8981\u5bf9\u4e0e\u7236\u4ee3\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u540e\u4ee3\u5f62\u6001\u6709\u76ca\u3002\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u73af\u5883\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u884c\u8d70\u6b65\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ee7\u627f\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

The primate world is dynamic, and the macaque ventral visual pathways, specifically the inferior temporal (IT) cortex not only supports object recognition but also encodes object motion velocity during naturalistic video viewing. Does IT's temporal responses reflect nothing more than time-unfolded feedforward transformations, framewise features with shallow temporal pooling, or do they embody richer dynamic computations? We tested this by comparing macaque IT responses during naturalistic videos against static, recurrent, and video-based ANN models. Video models provided modest improvements in neural predictivity, particularly at later response stages, raising the question of what kind of dynamics they capture. To probe this, we applied a stress test: decoders trained on naturalistic videos were evaluated on \"appearance-free\" variants that preserve motion but remove shape and texture. IT population activity generalized across this manipulation, but all ANN classes failed.

While process-level reward models offer a promising direction, existing LLM-based judges often produce noisy and inconsistent signals because they lack fine-grained, task-specific rubrics to distinguish high-level planning from low-level execution. In this work, we introduce SCRIBE (Skill-Conditioned Reward with Intermediate Behavioral Evaluation), a reinforcement learning framework that intervenes at a novel mid-level abstraction. SCRIBE grounds reward modeling in a curated library of skill prototypes, transforming open-ended LLM evaluation into a constrained verification problem. By routing each subgoal to a corresponding prototype, the reward model is equipped with precise, structured rubrics that substantially reduce reward variance.\n  Experimental results show that SCRIBE achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of reasoning and tool-use benchmarks. In particular, it improves the AIME25 accuracy of a Qwen3-4B model from 43.3% to 63.3%, and significantly increases success rates in complex multi-turn tool interactions.\n  Further analysis of training dynamics reveals a co-evolution across abstraction levels, where mastery of mid-level skills consistently precedes the emergence of effective high-level planning behaviors. Finally, we demonstrate that SCRIBE is additive to low-level tool optimizations, providing a scalable and complementary pathway toward more autonomous and reliable tool-using agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "SCRIBE \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6280\u80fd\u6761\u4ef6\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u4e2d\u95f4\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee3\u7406\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "SCRIBE \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e2d\u95f4\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5c06\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5efa\u7acb\u5728\u6280\u80fd\u539f\u578b\u5e93\u4e0a\uff0c\u5c06\u5f00\u653e\u5f0fLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cSCRIBE \u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5de5\u5177\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "SCRIBE \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4f7f\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u66f4\u52a0\u81ea\u4e3b\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u3002"}}

This study investigates whether LLMs exhibit bias in team composition and task assignment by analyzing the combined effects of candidates' country and pronouns. Using three LLMs and 3,000 simulated decisions, we find systematic disparities: demographic attributes significantly shaped both selection likelihood and task allocation, even when accounting for expertise-related factors.

Existing safeguarding concepts, such as Online Verification (OV), provide safety layers that detect infeasible planning outputs. However, they lack an active mechanism to ensure safe operation in the event that the main planner fails. This paper presents a first step toward an active safety extension for fail-operational Autonomous Driving (AD). We deploy a lightweight sampling-based trajectory planner on an automotive-grade, embedded platform running a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). The planner continuously computes trajectories under constrained computational resources, forming the foundation for future emergency planning architectures. Experimental results demonstrate deterministic timing behavior with bounded latency and minimal jitter, validating the feasibility of trajectory planning on safety-certifiable hardware. The study highlights both the potential and the remaining challenges of integrating active fallback mechanisms as an integral part of next-generation safeguarding frameworks.

We propose visual word puzzles as a challenging alternative, as they require discovering implicit visual cues, generating and revising hypotheses, and mapping perceptual evidence to non-literal concepts in ways that are difficult to solve via literal grounding, OCR-heavy shortcuts, or simple retrieval-style matching. We introduce Eye-Q, a multilingual benchmark designed to assess this form of complex visual understanding. Eye-Q contains 1,343 puzzles in which a model observes a conceptually dense scene with a brief description and must infer a specific target word or phrase. The puzzles are intentionally unstructured and cue-implicit, with distractors and contextual relationships that demand selective attention, abstraction, and associative inference.

Currently, reasoning strategies are autonomously selected by LRMs themselves. However, such autonomous selection often produces inefficient or even erroneous reasoning paths. To make reasoning more reliable and flexible, it is important to develop methods for controlling reasoning strategies. Existing methods struggle to control fine-grained reasoning strategies due to conceptual entanglement in LRMs' hidden states. To address this, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose strategy-entangled hidden states into a disentangled feature space. To identify the few strategy-specific features from the vast pool of SAE features, we propose SAE-Steering, an efficient two-stage feature identification pipeline. SAE-Steering first recalls features that amplify the logits of strategy-specific keywords, filtering out over 99\\% of features, and then ranks the remaining features by their control effectiveness. Using the identified strategy-specific features as control vectors, SAE-Steering outperforms existing methods by over 15\\% in control effectiveness.

Instead of repetitively scanning embedded photoreceivers, this design uses a stereo vision setup comprising two DVS cameras looking sideways through the skin. Such a design produces events as changes in brightness are detected, and estimates press positions on the 2D skin surface through triangulation, utilizing Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to find the center of mass of contact events resulting from pressing actions. The system is evaluated over a 4620 mm2 probed area of the skin using a meander raster scan. Across 95 % of the presses visible to both cameras, the press localization achieved a Root-Mean-Squared Error (RMSE) of 4.66 mm. The results highlight the potential of this approach for wide-area flexible and responsive tactile sensors in soft robotics and interactive environments. Moreover, we examined how the system performs when the amount of event data is strongly reduced. Using stochastic down-sampling, the event stream was reduced to 1/1024 of its original size. Under this extreme reduction, the average localization error increased only slightly (from 4.66 mm to 9.33 mm), and the system still produced valid press localizations for 85 % of the trials. This reduction in pass rate is expected, as some presses no longer produce enough events to form a reliable cluster for triangulation. These results show that the sensing approach remains functional even with very sparse event data, which is promising for reducing power consumption and computational load in future implementations. The system exhibits a detection latency distribution with a characteristic width of 31 ms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eDVS\u548c\u67d4\u6027\u6ce2\u5bfc\u76ae\u80a4\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7acb\u4f53\u89c6\u89c9\u548cDBSCAN\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6309\u538b\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u73af\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u9762\u79ef\u3001\u67d4\u6027\u76ae\u80a4\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u73af\u5883\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u91c7\u7528\u7acb\u4f53\u89c6\u89c9\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2aDVS\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u901a\u8fc7\u76ae\u80a4\u4fa7\u89c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u89d2\u6d4b\u91cf\u548cDBSCAN\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f30\u8ba1\u6309\u538b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u57284620 mm\u00b2\u7684\u76ae\u80a4\u63a2\u6d4b\u533a\u57df\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u572895%\u7684\u53ef\u89c1\u6309\u538b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a4.66 mm\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u51cf\u5c11\u81f31/1024\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u4ec5\u5c0f\u5e45\u589e\u52a0\u81f39.33 mm\uff0c\u4e1485%\u7684\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4ecd\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002\u68c0\u6d4b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4e3a31 ms\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff08DVS\uff09\u548c\u67d4\u6027\u7845\u80f6\u5149\u5b66\u6ce2\u5bfc\u76ae\u80a4\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5728\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53ca\u4ea4\u4e92\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u964d\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u3002"}}

Previous work has shown that increasing inference steps can disrupt safety mechanisms and lead MLLMs to generate attacker-desired harmful content. However, most existing attacks focus on increasing the complexity of the modified visual task itself and do not explicitly leverage the model's own reasoning incentives. This leads to them underperforming on reasoning models (Models with Chain-of-Thoughts) compared to non-reasoning ones (Models without Chain-of-Thoughts). If a model can think like a human, can we influence its cognitive-stage decisions so that it proactively completes a jailbreak? To validate this idea, we propose GAMBI} (Gamified Adversarial Multimodal Breakout via Instructional Traps), a novel multimodal jailbreak framework that decomposes and reassembles harmful visual semantics, then constructs a gamified scene that drives the model to explore, reconstruct intent, and answer as part of winning the game. The resulting structured reasoning chain increases task complexity in both vision and text, positioning the model as a participant whose goal pursuit reduces safety attention and induces it to answer the reconstructed malicious query. Extensive experiments on popular reasoning and non-reasoning MLLMs demonstrate that GAMBIT achieves high Attack Success Rates (ASR), reaching 92.13% on Gemini 2.5 Flash, 91.20% on QvQ-MAX, and 85.87% on GPT-4o, significantly outperforming baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "GAMBI\u901a\u8fc7\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u573a\u666f\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b8c\u6210\u8d8a\u72f1\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u589e\u52a0\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u63a8\u7406\u6fc0\u52b1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Chain-of-Thoughts\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u82e5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u50cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e00\u6837\u601d\u8003\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u8ba4\u77e5\u9636\u6bb5\u51b3\u7b56\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b8c\u6210\u8d8a\u72f1\uff1f", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGAMBI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u91cd\u7ec4\u6709\u5bb3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u91cd\u6784\u610f\u56fe\u5e76\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e3b\u6d41\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u975e\u63a8\u7406MLLMs\u4e0a\uff0cGAMBI\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe92.13%\uff08Gemini 2.5 Flash\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "GAMBI\uff08Gamified Adversarial Multimodal Breakout via Instructional Traps\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8d8a\u72f1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u91cd\u7ec4\u6709\u5bb3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u91cd\u6784\u610f\u56fe\u5e76\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u975e\u63a8\u7406MLLMs\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe92.13%\uff08Gemini 2.5 Flash\uff09\u300191.20%\uff08QvQ-MAX\uff09\u548c85.87%\uff08GPT-4o\uff09\u3002"}}

However, they typically function as semantic reasoners, lacking an intrinsic understanding of the specific robot's physical capabilities. This limitation is particularly critical in interactive navigation, where robots must actively modify cluttered environments to create traversable paths. Existing VLM-based navigators are predominantly confined to passive obstacle avoidance, failing to reason about when and how to interact with objects to clear blocked paths. To bridge this gap, we propose Counterfactual Interactive Navigation via Skill-aware VLM (CoINS), a hierarchical framework that integrates skill-aware reasoning and robust low-level execution. Specifically, we fine-tune a VLM, named InterNav-VLM, which incorporates skill affordance and concrete constraint parameters into the input context and grounds them into a metric-scale environmental representation. By internalizing the logic of counterfactual reasoning through fine-tuning on the proposed InterNav dataset, the model learns to implicitly evaluate the causal effects of object removal on navigation connectivity, thereby determining interaction necessity and target selection. To execute the generated high-level plans, we develop a comprehensive skill library through reinforcement learning, specifically introducing traversability-oriented strategies to manipulate diverse objects for path clearance. A systematic benchmark in Isaac Sim is proposed to evaluate both the reasoning and execution aspects of interactive navigation.

This paper presents an approach for architecting such systems using design patterns derived from enterprise distributed systems standards, formal methods, and industry practice. We classify these patterns into three tiers: LLM Agents (task-specific automation), Agentic AI (adaptive goal-seekers), and Agentic Communities (organizational frameworks where AI agents and human participants coordinate through formal roles, protocols, and governance structures). We focus on Agentic Communities - coordination frameworks encompassing LLM Agents, Agentic AI entities, and humans - most relevant for enterprise and industrial applications. Drawing on established coordination principles from distributed systems, we ground these patterns in a formal framework that specifies collaboration agreements where AI agents and humans fill roles within governed ecosystems.

These privileges reduce the default isolation provided by containers and introduce significant security risks. Security risk identification for OT container deployments is challenged by hybrid IT/OT architectures, fragmented stakeholder knowledge, and continuous system changes. Existing approaches lack reproducibility, interpretability across contexts, and technical integration with deployment artefacts. We propose a model-based approach, implemented as the Container Security Risk Ontology (CSRO), which integrates five key domains: adversarial behaviour, contextual assumptions, attack scenarios, risk assessment rules, and container security artefacts. Our evaluation of CSRO in a case study demonstrates that the end-to-end formalisation of risk calculation, from artefact to risk level, enables automated and reproducible risk identification. While CSRO currently focuses on technical, container-level treatment measures, its modular and flexible design provides a solid foundation for extending the approach to host-level and organisational risk factors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCSRO\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e94\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0OT\u5bb9\u5668\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728OT\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bb9\u5668\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u5347\u6743\u9650\u4ee5\u8bbf\u95ee\u4f4e\u7ea7\u7f51\u7edc\u63a5\u53e3\u6216\u6267\u884c\u7ba1\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8fd9\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5bb9\u5668\u7684\u9ed8\u8ba4\u9694\u79bb\u6027\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u91cd\u5927\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3001\u8de8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u6784\u4ef6\u7684\u6280\u672f\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u5bb9\u5668\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u672c\u4f53\uff08CSRO\uff09\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u4e94\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\uff1a\u5bf9\u6297\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5047\u8bbe\u3001\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u5bb9\u5668\u5b89\u5168\u6784\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30CSRO\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4ece\u6784\u4ef6\u5230\u98ce\u9669\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u98ce\u9669\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "CSRO\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e3b\u673a\u7ea7\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u76ee\u524d\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6280\u672f\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5bb9\u5668\u7ea7\u5904\u7406\u63aa\u65bd\u3002"}}

The common practice of fully fine-tuning the vision encoder on driving datasets potentially limits its generalization by causing the model to specialize too heavily in the training data. This work challenges the necessity of this training paradigm. We propose FROST-Drive, a novel E2E architecture designed to preserve and leverage the powerful generalization capabilities of a pretrained vision encoder from a Vision-Language Model (VLM). By keeping the encoder's weights frozen, our approach directly transfers the rich, generalized world knowledge from the VLM to the driving task. Our model architecture combines this frozen encoder with a transformer-based adapter for multimodal fusion and a GRU-based decoder for smooth waypoint generation. Furthermore, we introduce a custom loss function designed to directly optimize for Rater Feedback Score (RFS), a metric that prioritizes robust trajectory planning. We conduct extensive experiments on Waymo Open E2E Dataset, a large-scale datasets deliberately curated to capture the long-tail scenarios, demonstrating that our frozen-encoder approach significantly outperforms models that employ full fine-tuning. Our results provide substantial evidence that preserving the broad knowledge of a capable VLM is a more effective strategy for achieving robust, generalizable driving performance than intensive domain-specific adaptation.

Despite this vulnerability, conventional defense mechanisms remain ineffective as they overlook the unique reasoning dynamics of LRMs. In this work, we find that the emergence of safe-reminding phrases within thinking steps plays a pivotal role in ensuring LRM safety. Motivated by this finding, we propose SafeRemind, a decoding-time defense method that dynamically injects safe-reminding phrases into thinking steps. By leveraging entropy triggers to intervene at decision-locking points, SafeRemind redirects potentially harmful trajectories toward safer outcomes without requiring any parameter updates. Extensive evaluations across five LRMs and six benchmarks demonstrate that SafeRemind substantially enhances safety, achieving improvements of up to 45.5%p while preserving core reasoning utility.", "AI": {"tldr": "SafeRemind\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6ce8\u5165\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u9192\u77ed\u8bed\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534745.5%\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u9192\u77ed\u8bed\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SafeRemind\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u71b5\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u9501\u5b9a\u70b9\u52a8\u6001\u6ce8\u5165\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u9192\u77ed\u8bed\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSafeRemind\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe45.5%\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "SafeRemind\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6ce8\u5165\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u9192\u77ed\u8bed\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6838\u5fc3\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While researchers have extensively analysed ITS data to automate or assist specific activities such as issue assignments, duplicate detection, or priority prediction, developer studies on ITSs remain rare. Particularly, little is known about the challenges Software Engineering (SE) teams encounter in ITSs and when certain practices and workarounds (such as leaving issue fields like \"priority\" empty) are considered problematic. To fill this gap, we conducted an in-depth interview study with 26 experienced SE practitioners from different organisations and industries. We asked them about general problems encountered, as well as the relevance of 31 ITS smells (aka potentially problematic practices) discussed in the literature. By applying Thematic Analysis to the interview notes, we identified 14 common problems including issue findability, zombie issues, workflow bloat, and lack of workflow enforcement. Participants also stated that many of the ITS smells do not occur or are not problematic. Our results suggest that ITS problems and smells are highly dependent on context factors such as ITS configuration, workflow stage, and team size. We also discuss potential tooling solutions to configure, monitor, and visualise ITS smells to cope with these challenges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0ITS\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u4e0d\u826f\u5b9e\u8df5\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5df2\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5206\u6790ITS\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6216\u8f85\u52a9\u7279\u5b9a\u6d3b\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u914d\u3001\u91cd\u590d\u68c0\u6d4b\u6216\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9ITS\u4e2d\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7814\u7a76\u4ecd\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5173\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u56e2\u961f\u5728ITS\u4e2d\u9047\u5230\u7684\u6311\u6218\u53ca\u67d0\u4e9b\u5b9e\u8df5\u548c\u53d8\u901a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u7559\u7a7a\u201c\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u201d\u7b49\u5b57\u6bb5\uff09\u4f55\u65f6\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4e86\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u884c\u4e1a\u768426\u4f4d\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u8bbf\u8c08\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u6790\u6cd5\u5bf9\u8bbf\u8c08\u8bb0\u5f55\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e8614\u4e2a\u5e38\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u67e5\u627e\u6027\u3001\u50f5\u5c38\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u81c3\u80bf\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u6267\u884c\u7b49\u3002\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8fd8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8bb8\u591aITS\u4e0d\u826f\u5b9e\u8df5\u5e76\u672a\u51fa\u73b0\u6216\u4e0d\u6784\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cITS\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u4e0d\u826f\u5b9e\u8df5\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5982ITS\u914d\u7f6e\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u56e2\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u914d\u7f6e\u3001\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e0d\u826f\u5b9e\u8df5\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Existing Latent Action Models attempt to leverage video data but often suffer from visual entanglement, capturing noise rather than manipulation skills. To address this, we propose Contrastive Latent Action Pretraining (CLAP), a framework that aligns the visual latent space from videos with a proprioceptive latent space from robot trajectories. By employing contrastive learning, CLAP maps video transitions onto a quantized, physically executable codebook. Building on this representation, we introduce a dual-formulation VLA framework offering both CLAP-NTP, an autoregressive model excelling at instruction following and object generalization, and CLAP-RF, a Rectified Flow-based policy designed for high-frequency, precise manipulation. Furthermore, we propose a Knowledge Matching (KM) regularization strategy to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLAP significantly outperforms strong baselines, enabling the effective transfer of skills from human videos to robotic execution.

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves accuracy but incurs prohibitive latency for real-time query correction. A potential solution is to output an answer before reasoning to reduce latency; however, under autoregressive decoding, the early answer is independent of subsequent reasoning, preventing the model from leveraging its reasoning capability to improve accuracy. To address this issue, we propose Sandwich Reasoning (SandwichR), a novel approach that explicitly aligns a fast initial answer with post-hoc reasoning, enabling low-latency query correction without sacrificing reasoning-aware accuracy. SandwichR follows an Answer-Reasoning-Answer paradigm, producing an initial correction, an explicit reasoning process, and a final refined correction. To align the initial answer with post-reasoning insights, we design a consistency-aware reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: a dedicated consistency reward enforces alignment between the initial and final corrections, while margin-based rejection sampling prioritizes borderline samples where reasoning drives the most impactful corrective gains. Additionally, we construct a high-quality query correction dataset, addressing the lack of specialized benchmarks for complex query correction. Experimental results demonstrate that SandwichR achieves SOTA accuracy comparable to standard CoT while delivering a 40-70% latency reduction, resolving the latency-accuracy trade-off in online search.", "AI": {"tldr": "SandwichR\u901a\u8fc7Answer-Reasoning-Answer\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u6821\u6b63\u4e2d\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf-\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u641c\u7d22\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u67e5\u8be2\u6821\u6b63\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e14\u4e25\u683c\u5b9e\u65f6\uff0cChain-of-Thought\uff08CoT\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u867d\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4f46\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002SandwichR\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5ef6\u8fdf-\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "SandwichR\u91c7\u7528Answer-Reasoning-Answer\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e13\u7528\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u521d\u59cb\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u6821\u6b63\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSandwichR\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6CoT\u76f8\u5f53\u7684SOTA\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8640-70%\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u6821\u6b63\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "SandwichR\u901a\u8fc7\u5176Answer-Reasoning-Answer\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u6821\u6b63\u4e2d\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf-\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6CoT\u76f8\u5f53\u7684SOTA\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002"}}

A Comprehensive Embodied World Model Evaluation Turing Test", "comment": null, "summary": "As world models gain momentum in Embodied AI, an increasing number of works explore using video foundation models as predictive world models for downstream embodied tasks like 3D prediction or interactive generation. However, before exploring these downstream tasks, video foundation models still have two critical questions unanswered: (1) whether their generative generalization is sufficient to maintain perceptual fidelity in the eyes of human observers, and (2) whether they are robust enough to serve as a universal prior for real-world embodied agents. To provide a standardized framework for answering these questions, we introduce the Embodied Turing Test benchmark: WoW-World-Eval (Wow,wo,val). Building upon 609 robot manipulation data, Wow-wo-val examines five core abilities, including perception, planning, prediction, generalization, and execution. We propose a comprehensive evaluation protocol with 22 metrics to assess the models' generation ability, which achieves a high Pearson Correlation between the overall score and human preference (>0.93) and establishes a reliable foundation for the Human Turing Test. On Wow-wo-val, models achieve only 17.27 on long-horizon planning and at best 68.02 on physical consistency, indicating limited spatiotemporal consistency and physical reasoning. For the Inverse Dynamic Model Turing Test, we first use an IDM to evaluate the video foundation models' execution accuracy in the real world. However, most models collapse to $\\approx$ 0% success, while WoW maintains a 40.74% success rate. These findings point to a noticeable gap between the generated videos and the real world, highlighting the urgency and necessity of benchmarking World Model in Embodied AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7WoW-World-Eval\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9700\u52a0\u5f3a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u5177\u8eab\u4efb\u52a1\u524d\uff0c\u5176\u751f\u6210\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Embodied Turing Test\u57fa\u51c6\uff1aWoW-World-Eval\uff08Wow-wo-val\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e609\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e94\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5305\u542b22\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u89c4\u5212\u4e0a\u4ec5\u5f9717.27\u5206\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6700\u9ad8\u5f9768.02\u5206\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002IDM\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63a5\u8fd10%\uff0c\u800cWoW\u4fdd\u630140.74%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u5728\u5177\u8eabAI\u4e2d\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7d27\u8feb\u6027\u548c\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Previous work successfully demonstrated that automated planners, using general domain-independent heuristics, are able to generate personalized treatments, when the domain and problems are modeled using a general domain description language (\\pddlp). Unfortunately, this process was limited in practice to consider no more than seven medications. In clinical terms, this is a non-starter. In this paper, we explore the use of automatically-generated domain- and problem-specific heuristics to be used with general search, as a method of scaling up medication planning to levels allowing closer work with clinicians. Specifically, we specify the domain programmatically (specifying an initial state and a successor generation procedure), and use an LLM to generate a problem specific heuristic that can be used by a fixed search algorithm (GBFS).

Reinforcement learning (RL) has been investigated for improving the quality of image editing, but it faces three key challenges: (1) limited reasoning exploration confined to denoising stochasticity, (2) biased reward fusion, and (3) unstable VLM-based instruction rewards. In this work, we propose ThinkRL-Edit, a reasoning-centric RL framework that decouples visual reasoning from image synthesis and expands reasoning exploration beyond denoising. To the end, we introduce Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based reasoning sampling with planning and reflection stages prior to generation in online sampling, compelling the model to explore multiple semantic hypotheses and validate their plausibility before committing to a visual outcome. To avoid the failures of weighted aggregation, we propose an unbiased chain preference grouping strategy across multiple reward dimensions. Moreover, we replace interval-based VLM scores with a binary checklist, yielding more precise, lower-variance, and interpretable rewards for complex reasoning.

However, existing reward designs are often imperfect proxies for true human judgment, making models prone to reward hacking--producing unrealistic or low-quality images that nevertheless achieve high reward scores. In this work, we systematically analyze reward hacking behaviors in text-to-image (T2I) RL post-training. We investigate how both aesthetic/human preference rewards and prompt-image consistency rewards individually contribute to reward hacking and further show that ensembling multiple rewards can only partially mitigate this issue. Across diverse reward models, we identify a common failure mode: the generation of artifact-prone images. To address this, we propose a lightweight and adaptive artifact reward model, trained on a small curated dataset of artifact-free and artifact-containing samples. This model can be integrated into existing RL pipelines as an effective regularizer for commonly used reward models.

We systematically evaluate how depth backbones and feature engineering affect a monocular Pseudo-LiDAR pipeline on the KITTI validation split. Specifically, we compare NeWCRFs (supervised metric depth) against Depth Anything V2 Metric-Outdoor (Base) under an identical pseudo-LiDAR generation and PointRCNN detection protocol. NeWCRFs yields stronger downstream 3D detection, achieving 10.50\\% AP$_{3D}$ at IoU$=0.7$ on the Moderate split using grayscale intensity (Exp~2). We further test point-cloud augmentations using appearance cues (grayscale intensity) and semantic cues (instance segmentation confidence). Contrary to the expectation that semantics would substantially close the gap, these features provide only marginal gains, and mask-based sampling can degrade performance by removing contextual geometry.

While existing research focuses on mitigating language priors or high-level statistical biases, they often overlook the internal complexities of the visual encoding process. We identify that visual statistical bias, arising from the inherent Bag-of-Patches behavior of Vision Encoders under weak structural supervision, acts as a contributing factor of object hallucinations. Under this bias, models prioritize local texture features within individual patches over holistic geometric structures. This tendency may induce spurious visual confidence and result in hallucinations. To address this, we introduce a training-free algorithm called Structure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding (SDCD), which performs contrastive calibration of the output distribution by introducing a shuffled structure-disrupted view. By penalizing tokens that maintain high confidence under this structure-less view, SDCD effectively suppresses the texture-driven bias. Experimental results demonstrate that SDCD significantly mitigates hallucinations across multiple benchmarks and enhances the overall multimodal capabilities of LVLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "SDCD\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u6253\u4e71\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11LVLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u89c6\u89c9\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5Structure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding (SDCD)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u6253\u4e71\u7684\u89c6\u56fe\u5bf9\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "result": "SDCD\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LVLMs\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SDCD\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u6253\u4e71\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u4e86LVLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, sparse and irregular point distributions provide limited appearance evidence, making geometry-only features insufficient to distinguish objects with similar shapes but distinct appearances (e.g., color, texture, material). We propose Gaussian-to-Point (G2P), which transfers appearance-aware attributes from 3D Gaussian Splatting to point clouds for more discriminative and appearance-consistent segmentation. Our G2P address the misalignment between optimized Gaussians and original point geometry by establishing point-wise correspondences. By leveraging Gaussian opacity attributes, we resolve the geometric ambiguity that limits existing models.

Among other things, explainablility for deep neural networks has been a topic of intensive research due to the meteoric rise in prominence of deep neural networks and their \"black-box\" nature. xAI approaches can be characterized along different dimensions such as their scope (global versus local explanations) or underlying methodologies (statistic-based versus rule-based strategies). Methods generating global explanations aim to provide reasoning process applicable to all possible output classes while local explanation methods focus only on a single, specific class. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a well-known statistical technique, identifies important features of a network. Deep neural network rule extraction method constructs IF-THEN rules that link input conditions to a class. Another approach focuses on generating counterfactuals which help explain how small changes to an input can affect the model's predictions. However, these techniques primarily focus on the input-output relationship and thus neglect the structure of the network in explanation generation.   In this work, we propose xDNN(ASP), an explanation generation system for deep neural networks that provides global explanations. Given a neural network model and its training data, xDNN(ASP) extracts a logic program under answer set semantics that-in the ideal case-represents the trained model, i.e., answer sets of the extracted program correspond one-to-one to input-output pairs of the network. We demonstrate experimentally, using two synthetic datasets, that not only the extracted logic program maintains a high-level of accuracy in the prediction task, but it also provides valuable information for the understanding of the model such as the importance of features as well as the impact of hidden nodes on the prediction.

While effective over short horizons this approach does not separate observation reconstruction with dynamics modeling and offers no explicit representation of the latent causes governing motion. As a result, existing methods exhibit compounding drift, mean-pose collapse, and poorly calibrated uncertainty when rolled forward beyond the training regime. Here we propose a Semantic Belief-State World Model (SBWM) that reframes human motion prediction as latent dynamical simulation on the human body manifold. Rather than predicting poses directly, SBWM maintains a recurrent probabilistic belief state whose evolution is learned independently of pose reconstruction and explicitly aligned with the SMPL-X anatomical parameterization. This alignment imposes a structural information bottleneck that prevents the latent state from encoding static geometry or sensor noise, forcing it to capture motion dynamics, intent, and control-relevant structure. Inspired by belief-state world models developed for model-based reinforcement learning, SBWM adapts stochastic latent transitions and rollout-centric training to the domain of human motion. In contrast to RSSM-based, transformer, and diffusion approaches optimized for reconstruction fidelity, SBWM prioritizes stable forward simulation. We demonstrate coherent long-horizon rollouts, and competitive accuracy at substantially lower computational cost.

Indeed, ASP has made this vision true in many application domains. However, will current ASP solving techniques scale up for large configuration problems?

We show the potential and limits of current ASP technology, focusing on methods that address the so-called grounding bottleneck, i.e., the sharp increase of memory demands in the size of the problem instances. To push the limits, we investigated the incremental solving approach, which proved effective in practice. However, even in the incremental approach, memory demands impose significant limits.

However, existing methods typically compress optical features to match thermal feature dimensions for cross-modal alignment and fusion, which not only causes the loss of high-frequency information that is beneficial for thermal super-resolution, but also introduces physically inconsistent artifacts such as texture distortions and edge blurring by overlooking differences in the imaging physics between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose PCNet to achieve cross-resolution mutual enhancement between optical and thermal modalities, while physically constraining the optical guidance process via thermal conduction to enable robust thermal UAV image super-resolution. In particular, we design a Cross-Resolution Mutual Enhancement Module (CRME) to jointly optimize thermal image super-resolution and optical-to-thermal modality conversion, facilitating effective bidirectional feature interaction across resolutions while preserving high-frequency optical priors. Moreover, we propose a Physics-Driven Thermal Conduction Module (PDTM) that incorporates two-dimensional heat conduction into optical guidance, modeling spatially-varying heat conduction properties to prevent inconsistent artifacts. In addition, we introduce a temperature consistency loss that enforces regional distribution consistency and boundary gradient smoothness to ensure generated thermal images align with real-world thermal radiation principles.

This paper empirically examines whether current agents can leverage such world models as tools to enhance their cognition. Across diverse agentic and visual question answering tasks, we observe that some agents rarely invoke simulation (fewer than 1%), frequently misuse predicted rollouts (approximately 15%), and often exhibit inconsistent or even degraded performance (up to 5%) when simulation is available or enforced. Attribution analysis further indicates that the primary bottleneck lies in the agents' capacity to decide when to simulate, how to interpret predicted outcomes, and how to integrate foresight into downstream reasoning.

An observation behind CloudMatch is that cloud patterns exhibit structural diversity and contextual variability across different scenes and within the same scene category. Our key insight is that enforcing prediction consistency across diversely augmented views, incorporating both inter-scene and intra-scene mixing, enables the model to capture the structural diversity and contextual richness of cloud patterns. Specifically, CloudMatch generates one weakly augmented view along with two complementary strongly augmented views for each unlabeled image: one integrates inter-scene patches to simulate contextual variety, while the other employs intra-scene mixing to preserve semantic coherence.

However, extending this paradigm to financial decision is challenged by the market's stochastic nature: rewards are verifiable but inherently noisy, causing standard RL to degenerate into reward hacking. To address this, we propose Trade-R1, a model training framework that bridges verifiable rewards to stochastic environments via process-level reasoning verification. Our key innovation is a verification method that transforms the problem of evaluating reasoning over lengthy financial documents into a structured Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) task.

While recent gloss-free SLT methods have made strides in translating manual gestures, they frequently overlook the semantic criticality of facial expressions, resulting in ambiguity when distinct concepts share identical manual articulations. To address this, we present **EASLT** (**E**motion-**A**ware **S**ign **L**anguage **T**ranslation), a framework that treats facial affect not as auxiliary information, but as a robust semantic anchor. Unlike methods that relegate facial expressions to a secondary role, EASLT incorporates a dedicated emotional encoder to capture continuous affective dynamics. These representations are integrated via a novel *Emotion-Aware Fusion* (EAF) module, which adaptively recalibrates spatio-temporal sign features based on affective context to resolve semantic ambiguities. Extensive evaluations on the PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks demonstrate that EASLT establishes advanced performance among gloss-free methods, achieving BLEU-4 scores of 26.15 and 22.80, and BLEURT scores of 61.0 and 57.8, respectively.

In this paper, we identify a phenomenon termed length shift where models increasingly generate unnecessary reasoning on trivial inputs during training.

Detecting AI-generated images has thus become a critical challenge, particularly in terms of generalizing to unseen generative models. Existing methods using frozen pre-trained CLIP models show promise in generalization but treat the image encoder as a basic feature extractor, failing to fully exploit its potential. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of the frozen CLIP image encoder (CLIP-ViT), revealing that it effectively clusters real images in a high-level, abstract feature space. However, it does not truly possess the ability to distinguish between real and AI-generated images. Based on this analysis, we propose a Masking-based Pre-trained model Fine-Tuning (MPFT) strategy, which introduces a Texture-Aware Masking (TAM) mechanism to mask textured areas containing generative model-specific patterns during fine-tuning. This approach compels CLIP-ViT to attend to the \"distributional deviations\"from authentic images for AI-generated image detection, thereby achieving enhanced generalization performance.

However, existing studies largely overlook the complex environmental factors encountered in real world scenarios-such as illumination, background, and camera viewpoint-which can substantially increase the difficulty of test images. As a result, models trained under laboratory conditions often fall short of practical deployment requirements. To bridge this gap, in this paper, an environment-robust FSS setting is introduced that explicitly incorporates challenging test cases arising from complex environments-such as motion blur, small objects, and camouflaged targets-to enhance model's robustness under realistic, dynamic conditions. An environment robust FSS benchmark (ER-FSS) is established, covering eight datasets across multiple real world scenarios. In addition, an Adaptive Attention Distillation (AAD) method is proposed, which repeatedly contrasts and distills key shared semantics between known (support) and unknown (query) images to derive class-specific attention for novel categories.

Stone inscription images pose severe challenges for binarization due to poor contrast between etched characters and the stone background, non-uniform surface degradation, distracting artifacts, and highly variable text density and layouts. These conditions frequently cause existing binarization techniques to fail and struggle to isolate coherent character regions. Many approaches sub-divide the image into patches to improve text fragment resolution and improve binarization performance. With this in mind, we present a robust and adaptive patching strategy to binarize challenging Indic inscriptions. The patches from our approach are used to train an Attention U-Net for binarization. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on subtle structural cues, while our dynamic sampling and patch selection method ensures that the model learns to overcome surface noise and layout irregularities. We also introduce a carefully annotated, pixel-precise dataset of Indic stone inscriptions at the character-fragment level. We demonstrate that our novel patching mechanism significantly boosts binarization performance across classical and deep learning baselines. Despite training only on single script Indic dataset, our model exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to other Indic and non-indic scripts, highlighting its robustness and script-agnostic generalization capabilities. By producing clean, structured representations of inscription content, our method lays the foundation for downstream tasks such as script identification, OCR, and historical text analysis.

Key difficulties include modeling complex multi-scale evolution, correcting inter-frame feature misalignment caused by displacement, and efficiently capturing long-range spatiotemporal context without sacrificing spatial fidelity. To address these issues, we present the Multi-scale Feature Communication Rectified Flow (RF) Network (MFC-RFNet), a generative framework that integrates multi-scale communication with guided feature fusion. To enhance multi-scale fusion while retaining fine detail, a Wavelet-Guided Skip Connection (WGSC) preserves high-frequency components, and a Feature Communication Module (FCM) promotes bidirectional cross-scale interaction. To correct inter-frame displacement, a Condition-Guided Spatial Transform Fusion (CGSTF) learns spatial transforms from conditioning echoes to align shallow features. The backbone adopts rectified flow training to learn near-linear probability-flow trajectories, enabling few-step sampling with stable fidelity. Additionally, lightweight Vision-RWKV (RWKV) blocks are placed at the encoder tail, the bottleneck, and the first decoder layer to capture long-range spatiotemporal dependencies at low spatial resolutions with moderate compute. Evaluations on four public datasets (SEVIR, MeteoNet, Shanghai, and CIKM) demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines, yielding clearer echo morphology at higher rain-rate thresholds and sustained skill at longer lead times.

This paper presents CrackSegFlow, a controllable flow-matching synthesis framework that generates photorealistic crack images conditioned on binary masks while preserving strict mask-image alignment. The generator combines topology-preserving mask injection with boundary-gated modulation to maintain thin-structure continuity and suppress texture-driven false positives. A second class-conditional flow-matching model synthesizes crack masks with explicit control over crack coverage, enabling balanced, topology-diverse paired data without additional manual annotation. We further inject crack masks into crack-free backgrounds to diversify illumination and surface artifacts and reduce false positives caused by shadows, joints, and pavement markings. Experiments on five benchmarks spanning four asphalt datasets and the crack class of a concrete-domain dataset demonstrate consistent improvements under an established hybrid CNN--Transformer segmentation backbone and a fixed training protocol.

Existing models can produce high-quality short clips but often fail to preserve entity identity and appearance when scenes change or when entities reappear after long temporal gaps. We present VideoMemory, an entity-centric framework that integrates narrative planning with visual generation through a Dynamic Memory Bank. Given a structured script, a multi-agent system decomposes the narrative into shots, retrieves entity representations from memory, and synthesizes keyframes and videos conditioned on these retrieved states. The Dynamic Memory Bank stores explicit visual and semantic descriptors for characters, props, and backgrounds, and is updated after each shot to reflect story-driven changes while preserving identity. This retrieval-update mechanism enables consistent portrayal of entities across distant shots and supports coherent long-form generation. To evaluate this setting, we construct a 54-case multi-shot consistency benchmark covering character-, prop-, and background-persistent scenarios.

However, applying VLMs to 6-DoF endoscopic camera localization presents several challenges: 1) the lack of large-scale, high-quality, densely annotated, and localization-oriented vision-language datasets in real-world medical settings; 2) limited capability for fine-grained pose regression; and 3) high computational latency when extracting temporal features from past frames. To address these issues, we first construct BREATH dataset, the largest in-vivo endoscopic localization dataset to date, collected in the complex human airway. Building on this dataset, we propose BREATH-VL, a hybrid framework that integrates semantic cues from VLMs with geometric information from vision-based registration methods for accurate 6-DoF pose estimation. Our motivation lies in the complementary strengths of both approaches: VLMs offer generalizable semantic understanding, while registration methods provide precise geometric alignment. To further enhance the VLM's ability to capture temporal context, we introduce a lightweight context-learning mechanism that encodes motion history as linguistic prompts, enabling efficient temporal reasoning without expensive video-level computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the vision-language module delivers robust semantic localization in challenging surgical scenes. Building on this, our BREATH-VL outperforms state-of-the-art vision-only localization methods in both accuracy and generalization, reducing translational error by 25.5% compared with the best-performing baseline, while achieving competitive computational latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "BREATH-VL\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u5dee\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u76f8\u673a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u59ff\u6001\u56de\u5f52\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86BREATH-VL\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u518c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u7f16\u7801\u8fd0\u52a8\u5386\u53f2\u3002", "result": "BREATH-VL\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u51cf\u5c1125.5%\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "BREATH-VL\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u518c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e866-DoF\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u76f8\u673a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8625.5%\u7684\u5e73\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002"}}

Compared with labor-intensive per-model on-device calibration, a digital-twin pipeline built on optical simulation offers a substantial advantage in generating large-scale labeled data. However, complex imaging conditions induce a domain gap between simulation and real-world images, limiting the generalization of simulation-trained models. To address this, we propose augmenting a simulation baseline with minimal unlabeled real-world images captured at random misalignment positions, mitigating the gap from a domain adaptation perspective. We introduce Domain Adaptive Active Alignment (DA3), which utilizes an autoregressive domain transformation generator and an adversarial-based feature alignment strategy to distill real-world domain information via self-supervised learning. This enables the extraction of domain-invariant image degradation features to facilitate robust misalignment prediction. Experiments on two lens types reveal that DA3 improves accuracy by 46% over a purely simulation pipeline. Notably, it approaches the performance achieved with precisely labeled real-world data collected on 3 lens samples, while reducing on-device data collection time by 98.7%.

However, existing CIR methods suffer from representation space fragmentation: queries and targets comprise heterogeneous modalities and are processed by distinct encoders, forcing models to bridge misaligned representation spaces only through post-hoc alignment, which fundamentally limits retrieval performance. This architectural asymmetry manifests as three distinct, well-separated clusters in the feature space, directly demonstrating how heterogeneous modalities create fundamentally misaligned representation spaces from initialization. In this work, we propose CSMCIR, a unified representation framework that achieves efficient query-target alignment through three synergistic components. First, we introduce a Multi-level Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting strategy that guides Multimodal Large Language Models to generate discriminative, semantically compatible captions for target images, establishing modal symmetry. Building upon this, we design a symmetric dual-tower architecture where both query and target sides utilize the identical shared-parameter Q-Former for cross-modal encoding, ensuring consistent feature representations and further reducing the alignment gap. Finally, this architectural symmetry enables an entropy-based, temporally dynamic Memory Bank strategy that provides high-quality negative samples while maintaining consistency with the evolving model state.

RadDiff builds on a proposer-ranker framework from VisDiff, and incorporates four innovations inspired by real diagnostic workflows: (1) medical knowledge injection through domain-adapted vision-language models; (2) multimodal reasoning that integrates images with their clinical reports; (3) iterative hypothesis refinement across multiple reasoning rounds; and (4) targeted visual search that localizes and zooms in on salient regions to capture subtle findings. To evaluate RadDiff, we construct RadDiffBench, a challenging benchmark comprising 57 expert-validated radiology study pairs with ground-truth difference descriptions.

While hyperspectral image offers a powerful alternative by capturing fine-grained spectral signatures, progress in hyperspectral camouflaged object detection (HCOD) has been critically hampered by the absence of a dedicated, large-scale benchmark. To spur innovation, we introduce HyperCOD, the first challenging benchmark for HCOD. Comprising 350 high-resolution hyperspectral images, It features complex real-world scenarios with minimal objects, intricate shapes, severe occlusions, and dynamic lighting to challenge current models. The advent of foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) presents a compelling opportunity. To adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for HCOD, we propose HyperSpectral Camouflage-aware SAM (HSC-SAM). HSC-SAM ingeniously reformulates the hyperspectral image by decoupling it into a spatial map fed to SAM's image encoder and a spectral saliency map that serves as an adaptive prompt. This translation effectively bridges the modality gap. Extensive experiments show that HSC-SAM sets a new state-of-the-art on HyperCOD and generalizes robustly to other public HSI datasets. The HyperCOD dataset and our HSC-SAM baseline provide a robust foundation to foster future research in this emerging area.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u4f2a\u88c5\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6HyperCOD\u548c\u9002\u914dSAM\u7684HSC-SAM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3RGB-based camouflaged object detection\u5728\u989c\u8272\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u7ebf\u7d22\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u4f2a\u88c5\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08HCOD\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHSC-SAM\uff0c\u5c06\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u56fe\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u663e\u8457\u6027\u56fe\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u8f93\u5165SAM\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "HSC-SAM\u5728HyperCOD\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u516c\u5171HSI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "HyperCOD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cHSC-SAM\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u5174\u9886\u57df\u7684\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

This paradigm is severely limited by 1) the implicit coupling of planning and execution, 2) the lack of object-level control granularity, and 3) the reliance on unstructured, pixel-centric modeling. To address these limitations, we propose I2E, a novel \"Decompose-then-Action\" paradigm that revisits image editing as an actionable interaction process within a structured environment. I2E utilizes a Decomposer to transform unstructured images into discrete, manipulable object layers and then introduces a physics-aware Vision-Language-Action Agent to parse complex instructions into a series of atomic actions via Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Further, we also construct I2E-Bench, a benchmark designed for multi-instance spatial reasoning and high-precision editing.

By requiring the model to reconstruct a masked continuous segment from a set of challenging distractors, MVP forces the model to attend to the sequential logic and temporal context of events. To support scalable training, we introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline capable of transforming arbitrary video corpora into MVP training samples, and further employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a fine-grained reward function to enhance the model's understanding of video context and temporal properties.

Training these AI models requires a large amount of training data that is costly to acquire and annotate, especially in high-variance, low-volume manufacturing environments. A popular approach to reduce the need for real data is the use of synthetic data that is generated by leveraging computer-aided design (CAD) models available in the industry. However, in the agricultural industry these models are not readily available, increasing the difficulty in leveraging synthetic data. In this paper, we present different techniques for substituting CAD files to create synthetic datasets.

We introduce a performance-aware, closed-loop solution in the NNGPT ecosystem of projects that enables LLMs to autonomously engineer optimal transformations by internalizing empirical performance cues. We fine-tune LLMs with Low-Rank Adaptation on a novel repository of more than 6,000 empirically evaluated PyTorch augmentation functions, each annotated solely by downstream model accuracy. Training uses pairwise performance ordering (better-worse transformations), enabling alignment through empirical feedback without reinforcement learning, reward models, or symbolic objectives. This reduces the need for exhaustive search, achieving up to 600x times fewer evaluated candidates than brute-force discovery while maintaining competitive peak accuracy and shifting generation from random synthesis to task-aligned design. Ablation studies show that structured Chain-of-Thought prompting introduces syntactic noise and degrades performance, whereas direct prompting ensures stable optimization in performance-critical code tasks. Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that the model internalizes semantic performance cues rather than memorizing syntax. These results show that LLMs can exhibit task-level reasoning through non-textual feedback loops, bypassing explicit symbolic rewards.", "AI": {"tldr": "NNGPT\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6027\u80fd\u611f\u77e5\u95ed\u73af\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f7fLLMs\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u5316\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u80fd\u7ebf\u7d22\u81ea\u4e3b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u66b4\u529b\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u611f\u77e5\u589e\u5f3a\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9650\u5236\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6216\u66b4\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\uff08Low-Rank Adaptation\uff09\u5bf9LLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u542b6000\u591a\u4e2a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684PyTorch\u589e\u5f3a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b0\u5b58\u50a8\u5e93\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0b\u6e38\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u6ce8\u91ca\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u91c7\u7528\u6210\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u6392\u5e8f\uff08\u66f4\u597d-\u66f4\u5dee\u53d8\u6362\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u9a8c\u53cd\u9988\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u7b26\u53f7\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7a77\u4e3e\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5019\u9009\u6570\u91cf\u6bd4\u66b4\u529b\u53d1\u73b0\u5c11600\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u5cf0\u503c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u4ece\u968f\u673a\u5408\u6210\u8f6c\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u6cd5\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u5173\u952e\u4ee3\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLMs\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u6587\u672c\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u5c55\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7ed5\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u7b26\u53f7\u5956\u52b1\u3002"}}

Among these parameters, Gaussian means are particularly difficult to predict, so depth is usually estimated first and then unprojected to obtain the Gaussian sphere centers. Existing methods typically rely solely on a single warp to estimate depth probability, which hinders their ability to fully leverage cross-view geometric cues, resulting in unstable and coarse depth maps. To address this limitation, we propose IDESplat, which iteratively applies warp operations to boost depth probability estimation for accurate Gaussian mean prediction. First, to eliminate the inherent instability of a single warp, we introduce a Depth Probability Boosting Unit (DPBU) that integrates epipolar attention maps produced by cascading warp operations in a multiplicative manner. Next, we construct an iterative depth estimation process by stacking multiple DPBUs, progressively identifying potential depth candidates with high likelihood. As IDESplat iteratively boosts depth probability estimates and updates the depth candidates, the depth map is gradually refined, resulting in accurate Gaussian means. We conduct experiments on RealEstate10K, ACID, and DL3DV. IDESplat achieves outstanding reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art performance with real-time efficiency. On RE10K, it outperforms DepthSplat by 0.33 dB in PSNR, using only 10.7% of the parameters and 70% of the memory.

Researchers are burdened with tracking numerous experiments, design choices, and their effects on performance, often relying on ad-hoc, manual workflows that are inherently slow and error-prone. We introduce EvalBlocks, a modular, plug-and-play framework for efficient evaluation of foundation models during development. Built on Snakemake, EvalBlocks supports seamless integration of new datasets, foundation models, aggregation methods, and evaluation strategies.

However, screenshots are tokenized into thousands of visual tokens (e.g., about 4700 for 2K resolution), incurring significant computational overhead and diluting attention. In contrast, humans typically focus on regions of interest when interacting with UI. In this work, we pioneer the task of efficient UI grounding. Guided by practical analysis of the task's characteristics and challenges, we propose FocusUI, an efficient UI grounding framework that selects patches most relevant to the instruction while preserving positional continuity for precise grounding. FocusUI addresses two key challenges: (1) Eliminating redundant tokens in visual encoding. We construct patch-level supervision by fusing an instruction-conditioned score with a rule-based UI-graph score that down-weights large homogeneous regions to select distinct and instruction-relevant visual tokens. (2) Preserving positional continuity during visual token selection. We find that general visual token pruning methods suffer from severe accuracy degradation on UI grounding tasks due to broken positional information. We introduce a novel PosPad strategy, which compresses each contiguous sequence of dropped visual tokens into a single special marker placed at the sequence's last index to preserve positional continuity. Comprehensive experiments on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that FocusUI surpasses GUI-specific baselines. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, FocusUI-7B achieves a performance improvement of 3.7% over GUI-Actor-7B.

Currently, obtaining accurate segmentation outcomes is critically reliant on large-scale datasets with high-quality annotations. However, noisy annotations are frequently encountered owing to the complex morphological structures of organs in medical images and variations among different annotators, which can substantially limit the efficacy of segmentation models. Motivated by the fact that medical imaging annotator can correct labeling errors during segmentation based on prior knowledge, we propose an end-to-end Staged Voxel-Level Deep Reinforcement Learning (SVL-DRL) framework for robust medical image segmentation under noisy annotations. This framework employs a dynamic iterative update strategy to automatically mitigate the impact of erroneous labels without requiring manual intervention. The key advancements of SVL-DRL over existing works include: i) formulating noisy annotations as a voxel-dependent problem and addressing it through a novel staged reinforcement learning framework which guarantees robust model convergence; ii) incorporating a voxel-level asynchronous advantage actor-critic (vA3C) module that conceptualizes each voxel as an autonomous agent, which allows each agent to dynamically refine its own state representation during training, thereby directly mitigating the influence of erroneous labels; iii) designing a novel action space for the agents, along with a composite reward function that strategically combines the Dice value and a spatial continuity metric to significantly boost segmentation accuracy while maintain semantic integrity.

Existing Direct Preference Otimization (DPO) methods rely on multi-sample ranking and task-specific critic models, which is inefficient and often yields ambiguous global supervision. To address these limitations, we propose LocalDPO, a novel post-training framework that constructs localized preference pairs from real videos and optimizes alignment at the spatio-temporal region level. We design an automated pipeline to efficiently collect preference pair data that generates preference pairs with a single inference per prompt, eliminating the need for external critic models or manual annotation. Specifically, we treat high-quality real videos as positive samples and generate corresponding negatives by locally corrupting them with random spatio-temporal masks and restoring only the masked regions using the frozen base model. During training, we introduce a region-aware DPO loss that restricts preference learning to corrupted areas for rapid convergence.

However, the robustness of their reasoning chains remains questionable. In this paper, we identify a critical failure mode termed textual inertia, where once a textual hallucination occurs in the thinking process, models tend to blindly adhere to the erroneous text while neglecting conflicting visual evidence. To systematically investigate this, we propose the LogicGraph Perturbation Protocol that structurally injects perturbations into the reasoning chains of diverse LMMs spanning both native reasoning architectures and prompt-driven paradigms to evaluate their self-reflection capabilities. The results reveal that models successfully self-correct in less than 10% of cases and predominantly succumb to blind textual error propagation. To mitigate this, we introduce Active Visual-Context Refinement, a training-free inference paradigm which orchestrates an active visual re-grounding mechanism to enforce fine-grained verification coupled with an adaptive context refinement strategy to summarize and denoise the reasoning history.

In this study, we propose a novel multimodal approach that leverages pixel-wise two-dimensional (2D) representations to encode visual property variations from SITS more effectively. Specifically, we generate recurrence plots from pixel-based vegetation index time series (NDVI, EVI, and SAVI) as an alternative to using raw pixel values, creating more informative representations. Additionally, we introduce PIxel-wise Multimodal Contrastive (PIMC), a new multimodal self-supervision approach that produces effective encoders based on two-dimensional pixel time series representations and remote sensing imagery (RSI). To validate our approach, we assess its performance on three downstream tasks: pixel-level forecasting and classification using the PASTIS dataset, and land cover classification on the EuroSAT dataset. Moreover, we compare our results to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on all downstream tasks. Our experimental results show that the use of 2D representations significantly enhances feature extraction from SITS, while contrastive learning improves the quality of representations for both pixel time series and RSI. These findings suggest that our multimodal method outperforms existing models in various Earth observation tasks, establishing it as a robust self-supervision framework for processing both SITS and RSI.

However, this language-like formulation overlooks key properties of vision, particularly the hierarchical and residual network designs that have long been essential for convergence and efficiency in visual models. To bring \"vision\" back to vision, we propose the Residual Tokenizer (ResTok), a 1D visual tokenizer that builds hierarchical residuals for both image tokens and latent tokens. The hierarchical representations obtained through progressively merging enable cross-level feature fusion at each layer, substantially enhancing representational capacity. Meanwhile, the semantic residuals between hierarchies prevent information overlap, yielding more concentrated latent distributions that are easier for AR modeling. Cross-level bindings consequently emerge without any explicit constraints. To accelerate the generation process, we further introduce a hierarchical AR generator that substantially reduces sampling steps by predicting an entire level of latent tokens at once rather than generating them strictly token-by-token. Extensive experiments demonstrate that restoring hierarchical residual priors in visual tokenization significantly improves AR image generation, achieving a gFID of 2.34 on ImageNet-256 with only 9 sampling steps.

Non-commercial approaches still suffer audio-visual asynchrony, poor lip-speech alignment, and unimodal degradation, which can be stemmed from weak audio-visual correspondence modeling, limited generalization, and scarce high-quality dense-caption data. To address these issues, we introduce Klear and delve into three axes--model architecture, training strategy, and data curation. Architecturally, we adopt a single-tower design with unified DiT blocks and an Omni-Full Attention mechanism, achieving tight audio-visual alignment and strong scalability. Training-wise, we adopt a progressive multitask regime--random modality masking to joint optimization across tasks, and a multistage curriculum, yielding robust representations, strengthening A-V aligned world knowledge, and preventing unimodal collapse. For datasets, we present the first large-scale audio-video dataset with dense captions, and introduce a novel automated data-construction pipeline which annotates and filters millions of diverse, high-quality, strictly aligned audio-video-caption triplets. Building on this, Klear scales to large datasets, delivering high-fidelity, semantically and temporally aligned, instruction-following generation in both joint and unimodal settings while generalizing robustly to out-of-distribution scenarios.

Despite this, existing human motion synthesis methods fall short: some ignore hand motions entirely, while others generate full-body motions only for narrowly scoped tasks under highly constrained settings. A key obstacle is the lack of large-scale datasets that jointly capture diverse full-body motion with detailed hand articulation. While some datasets capture both, they are limited in scale and diversity. Conversely, large-scale datasets typically focus either on body motion without hands or on hand motions without the body. To overcome this, we curate and unify existing hand motion datasets with large-scale body motion data to generate full-body sequences that capture both hand and body. We then propose the first diffusion-based unconditional full-body motion prior, FUSION, which jointly models body and hand motion. Despite using a pose-based motion representation, FUSION surpasses state-of-the-art skeletal control models on the Keypoint Tracking task in the HumanML3D dataset and achieves superior motion naturalness. Beyond standard benchmarks, we demonstrate that FUSION can go beyond typical uses of motion priors through two applications: (1) generating detailed full-body motion including fingers during interaction given the motion of an object, and (2) generating Self-Interaction motions using an LLM to transform natural language cues into actionable motion constraints. For these applications, we develop an optimization pipeline that refines the latent space of our diffusion model to generate task-specific motions. Experiments on these tasks highlight precise control over hand motion while maintaining plausible full-body coordination.

Murat Tekalp"], "title": "Pad\u00e9 Neurons for Efficient Neural Models", "comment": "Accepted for Publication in IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING; 13 pages, 8 figures", "summary": "Neural networks commonly employ the McCulloch-Pitts neuron model, which is a linear model followed by a point-wise non-linear activation. Various researchers have already advanced inherently non-linear neuron models, such as quadratic neurons, generalized operational neurons, generative neurons, and super neurons, which offer stronger non-linearity compared to point-wise activation functions. In this paper, we introduce a novel and better non-linear neuron model called Pad\u00e9 neurons (Paons), inspired by Pad\u00e9 approximants. Paons offer several advantages, such as diversity of non-linearity, since each Paon learns a different non-linear function of its inputs, and layer efficiency, since Paons provide stronger non-linearity in much fewer layers compared to piecewise linear approximation. Furthermore, Paons include all previously proposed neuron models as special cases, thus any neuron model in any network can be replaced by Paons. We note that there has been a proposal to employ the Pad\u00e9 approximation as a generalized point-wise activation function, which is fundamentally different from our model. To validate the efficacy of Paons, in our experiments, we replace classic neurons in some well-known neural image super-resolution, compression, and classification models based on the ResNet architecture with Paons. Our comprehensive experimental results and analyses demonstrate that neural models built by Paons provide better or equal performance than their classic counterparts with a smaller number of layers.

While these models typically assess visual quality, motion quality, and text alignment, they often overlook key structural distortions, such as abnormal object appearances and interactions, which can degrade the overall quality of the generative video. To address this gap, we introduce REACT, a frame-level reward model designed specifically for structural distortions evaluation in generative videos. REACT assigns point-wise scores and attribution labels by reasoning over video frames, focusing on recognizing distortions. To support this, we construct a large-scale human preference dataset, annotated based on our proposed taxonomy of structural distortions, and generate additional data using a efficient Chain-of-Thought (CoT) synthesis pipeline. REACT is trained with a two-stage framework: ((1) supervised fine-tuning with masked loss for domain knowledge injection, followed by (2) reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and pairwise rewards to enhance reasoning capability and align output scores with human preferences. During inference, a dynamic sampling mechanism is introduced to focus on frames most likely to exhibit distortion. We also present REACT-Bench, a benchmark for generative video distortion evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that REACT complements existing reward models in assessing structutal distortion, achieving both accurate quantitative evaluations and interpretable attribution analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "REACT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u7ed3\u6784\u5931\u771f\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5e27\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5931\u771f\uff08\u5982\u5f02\u5e38\u5bf9\u8c61\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5931\u771f\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u7ed3\u5408\u63a9\u7801\u635f\u5931\u6ce8\u5165\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b2\uff09\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408GRPO\u548c\u6210\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\u805a\u7126\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u771f\u7684\u5e27\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cREACT\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u6784\u5931\u771f\u65b9\u9762\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "REACT\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce an annotation-efficient segmentation approach that reframes the pixel-level task into a binary region classification problem. Image regions are generated using a fully unsupervised, interpretable Modular Adaptive Region Growing technique, guided by image-specific Adaptive Thresholding and enhanced by a Region Merging process that consolidates fragmented areas into coherent segments.

This decoupling undermines reliability in strategic spatial decision-making. To address this, we present GeoReason, a framework designed to synchronize internal thinking with final decisions. We first construct GeoReason-Bench, a logic-driven dataset containing 4,000 reasoning trajectories synthesized from geometric primitives and expert knowledge. We then formulate a two-stage training strategy: (1) Supervised Knowledge Initialization to equip the model with reasoning syntax and domain expertise, and (2) Consistency-Aware Reinforcement Learning to refine deductive reliability. This second stage integrates a novel Logical Consistency Reward, which penalizes logical drift via an option permutation strategy to anchor decisions in verifiable reasoning traces.

Although recent deep models improve robustness compared to classical signal-processing approaches, many methods increase computational cost and parameter count, and attention-based temporal modeling introduces quadratic scaling with respect to the temporal length. This paper proposes ToTMNet, a lightweight rPPG architecture that replaces temporal attention with an FFT-accelerated Toeplitz temporal mixing layer. The Toeplitz operator provides full-sequence temporal receptive field using a linear number of parameters in the clip length and can be applied in near-linear time using circulant embedding and FFT-based convolution. ToTMNet integrates the global Toeplitz temporal operator into a compact gated temporal mixer that combines a local depthwise temporal convolution branch with gated global Toeplitz mixing, enabling efficient long-range temporal filtering while only having 63k parameters. Experiments on two datasets, UBFC-rPPG (real videos) and SCAMPS (synthetic videos), show that ToTMNet achieves strong heart-rate estimation accuracy with a compact design. On UBFC-rPPG intra-dataset evaluation, ToTMNet reaches 1.055 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.996. In a synthetic-to-real setting (SCAMPS to UBFC-rPPG), ToTMNet reaches 1.582 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.994. Ablation results confirm that the gating mechanism is important for effectively using global Toeplitz mixing, especially under domain shift. The main limitation of this preprint study is the use of only two datasets; nevertheless, the results indicate that Toeplitz-structured temporal mixing is a practical and efficient alternative to attention for rPPG.", "AI": {"tldr": "ToTMNet\u7528FFT\u52a0\u901f\u7684Toeplitz\u65f6\u5e8f\u6df7\u5408\u66ff\u4ee3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u8f7b\u91cf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8fdc\u7a0b\u65f6\u5e8f\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff0c\u5728\u5fc3\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u65f6\u5e8f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8fd8\u5e26\u6765\u4e8c\u6b21\u65b9\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faToTMNet\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7rPPG\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528FFT\u52a0\u901f\u7684Toeplitz\u65f6\u5e8f\u6df7\u5408\u5c42\u66ff\u4ee3\u65f6\u5e8f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u6df1\u5ea6\u65f6\u5e8f\u5377\u79ef\u5206\u652f\u548c\u5168\u5c40Toeplitz\u6df7\u5408\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728UBFC-rPPG\u548cSCAMPS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cToTMNet\u4ee5\u4ec563k\u53c2\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5fc3\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08UBFC-rPPG\uff1a1.055 bpm MAE\uff0cPearson 0.996\uff1bSCAMPS\u5230UBFC-rPPG\uff1a1.582 bpm MAE\uff0cPearson 0.994\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "Toeplitz\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u6df7\u5408\u662frPPG\u4e2d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4ecd\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In this work, we revisit visual localization with a 2D image-based representation and propose to augment each image with estimated depth maps to capture the geometric structure. Supported by the effective use of dense matchers, this representation is not only easy to build and maintain, but achieves highest accuracy in challenging conditions. With compact compression and a GPU-accelerated LO-RANSAC implementation, the whole pipeline is efficient in both storage and computation and allows for a flexible trade-off between accuracy and highest memory efficiency. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy on various standard benchmarks and outperforms existing memory-efficient methods at comparable map sizes.
