We present Sphinx, a unified framework for LLM-based PR review that addresses these limitations through three key components: (1) a structured data generation pipeline that produces context-rich, semantically grounded review comments by comparing pseudo-modified and merged code; (2) a checklist-based evaluation benchmark that assesses review quality based on structured coverage of actionable verification points, moving beyond surface-level metrics like BLEU; and (3) Checklist Reward Policy Optimization (CRPO), a novel training paradigm that uses rule-based, interpretable rewards to align model behavior with real-world review practices. Extensive experiments show that models trained with Sphinx achieve state-of-the-art performance on review completeness and precision, outperforming both proprietary and open-source baselines by up to 40\\% in checklist coverage. Together, Sphinx enables the development of PR review models that are not only fluent but also context-aware, technically precise, and practically deployable in real-world development workflows.

However, for adaptation, a critical activity during code reuse, there is no benchmark to assess LLMs' performance, leaving their practical utility in this area unclear. To fill this gap, we propose AdaptEval, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on code snippet adaptation. Unlike existing benchmarks, AdaptEval incorporates the following three distinctive features: First, Practical Context. Tasks in AdaptEval are derived from developers' practices, preserving rich contextual information from Stack Overflow and GitHub communities. Second, Multi-granularity Annotation. Each task is annotated with requirements at both task and adaptation levels, supporting the evaluation of LLMs across diverse adaptation scenarios. Third, Fine-grained Evaluation. AdaptEval includes a two-tier testing framework combining adaptation-level and function-level tests, which enables evaluating LLMs' performance across various individual adaptations. Based on AdaptEval, we conduct the first empirical study to evaluate six instruction-tuned LLMs and especially three reasoning LLMs on code snippet adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaptEval enables the assessment of LLMs' adaptation capabilities from various perspectives. It also provides critical insights into their current limitations, particularly their struggle to follow explicit instructions.

This organization offers high aggregate bandwidth, but it breaks a key assumption behind many volumetric rendering techniques: that rays can randomly access a large, unified scene representation. Rendering efficiently on such hardware therefore requires distributing both data and computation, keeping ray traversal mostly local, and structuring communication into predictable routes.\n  We present a fully in-SRAM, distributed renderer for the \\emph{Radiant Foam} Voronoi-cell volumetric representation on the Graphcore Mk2 IPU, a many-core accelerator with tile-local SRAM and explicit inter-tile communication. Our system shards the scene across tiles and forwards rays between shards through a hierarchical routing overlay, enabling ray marching entirely from on-chip SRAM with predictable communication. On Mip-NeRF~360 scenes, the system attains near-interactive throughput (\\(\\approx\\)1\\,fps at \\mbox{$640\\times480$}) with image and depth quality close to the original GPU-based Radiant Foam implementation, while keeping all scene data and ray state in on-chip SRAM. Beyond demonstrating feasibility, we analyze routing, memory, and scheduling bottlenecks that inform how future distributed-memory accelerators can better support irregular, data-movement-heavy rendering workloads.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5185\u5b58\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4f53\u79ef\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7247\u573a\u666f\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b8c\u5168\u57fa\u4e8e\u7247\u4e0aSRAM\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1GPU\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8bb8\u591a\u65b0\u5174\u591a\u6838\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5185\u5b58\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4f53\u79ef\u6e32\u67d3\u6280\u672f\u5047\u8bbe\u5149\u7ebf\u53ef\u4ee5\u968f\u673a\u8bbf\u95ee\u5927\u578b\u7edf\u4e00\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u88ab\u6253\u7834\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u5149\u7ebf\u904d\u5386\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b8c\u5168\u5728SRAM\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6e32\u67d3\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eGraphcore Mk2 IPU\u4e0a\u7684Radiant Foam Voronoi-cell\u4f53\u79ef\u8868\u793a\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7247\u573a\u666f\u5e76\u5728\u5206\u7247\u95f4\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u8def\u7531\u8986\u76d6\u8f6c\u53d1\u5149\u7ebf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b8c\u5168\u57fa\u4e8e\u7247\u4e0aSRAM\u7684\u5149\u7ebf\u884c\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "\u5728Mip-NeRF 360\u573a\u666f\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff08\u7ea61 fps\uff0c640\u00d7480\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u8d28\u91cf\u63a5\u8fd1\u539f\u59cb\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eGPU\u7684Radiant Foam\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u573a\u666f\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5149\u7ebf\u72b6\u6001\u4fdd\u6301\u5728\u7247\u4e0aSRAM\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5185\u5b58\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4f53\u79ef\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8def\u7531\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u6570\u636e\u79fb\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u6e32\u67d3\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

A payment is feasible iff the post-transfer wealth stays in $W_G$. This yields a simple throughput law: if $\u03b6$ is on-chain settlement bandwidth and $\u03c1$ the expected fraction of infeasible payments, the sustainable off-chain bandwidth satisfies $S = \u03b6/ \u03c1$.\n  Feasibility admits a cut-interval view: for any node set S, the wealth of S must lie in an interval whose width equals the cut capacity $C(\u03b4(S))$. Using this, we show how multi-party channels (coinpools / channel factories) expand $W_G$. Modeling a k-party channel as a k-uniform hyperedge widens every cut in expectation, so $W_G$ grows monotonically with k; for single nodes the expected accessible wealth scales linearly with $k/n$.\n  We also analyze depletion. Under linear, asymmetric fees, cost-minimizing flow within a wealth fiber pushes cycles to the boundary, generically depleting channels except for a residual spanning forest. Three mitigation levers follow: (i) symmetric fees per direction, (ii) convex/tiered fees (effective flow control but at odds with source routing without liquidity disclosure), and (iii) coordinated replenishment (choose an optimal circulation within a fiber).\n  Together, these results explain why two-party meshes struggle to scale and why multi-party primitives are more capital-efficient, yielding higher expected payment bandwidth. They also show how fee design and coordination keep operation inside the feasible region, improving reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u652f\u4ed8\u901a\u9053\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u591a\u65b9\u901a\u9053\u7684\u8d44\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4fdd\u6301\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7684\u8d39\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u652f\u4ed8\u901a\u9053\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u53cc\u65b9\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u8d44\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u65b9\u901a\u9053\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8d22\u5bcc\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u591a\u9762\u4f53$W_G$\u548c\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u72b6\u6001$L_G$\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u5faa\u73af\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u652f\u4ed8\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u5207\u5272\u533a\u95f4\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u8d85\u8fb9\u5efa\u6a21\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u591a\u65b9\u901a\u9053\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u8d39\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u8017\u5c3d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u591a\u65b9\u901a\u9053\uff08\u5982coinpools\u6216\u901a\u9053\u5de5\u5382\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55$W_G$\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u968f\u7740\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9884\u671f\u53ef\u8fbe\u8d22\u5bcc\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u7f13\u89e3\u901a\u9053\u8017\u5c3d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5bf9\u79f0\u8d39\u7528\u3001\u51f8/\u5206\u5c42\u8d39\u7528\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u8865\u5145\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u652f\u4ed8\u901a\u9053\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u53cc\u65b9\u7f51\u7edc\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u65b9\u539f\u8bed\u66f4\u5177\u8d44\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8d39\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u5982\u4f55\u4fdd\u6301\u64cd\u4f5c\u5728\u53ef\u884c\u533a\u57df\u5185\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

This query model is also known as the Plackett-Luce model or conditional sampling oracle in the literature. Although MNLs have been studied extensively, a basic computational question remains open: given query access to slates, how efficiently can we learn weights so that, for every slate, the induced choice distribution is within total variation distance $\\varepsilon$ of the ground truth? This question is central to MNL learning and has direct implications for modern recommender system interfaces.\n  We provide two algorithms for this task, one with adaptive queries and one with non-adaptive queries.

A two-stage procedure consisting of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to learn formatting and control primitives, followed by GRPO for interaction-driven policy improvement, trains controllers for each environment. The framework is demonstrated on four control problems spanning a gradient of dynamical complexity, from canonical linear systems through nonlinear oscillatory dynamics to three-dimensional spacecraft attitude control with gyroscopic coupling and thrust constraints.

This limits alignment with complex human expertise, which is hierarchical and fine-grained. To address this, we first construct a hierarchical, fine-grained evaluation criteria with domain experts, which decomposes image quality into multiple positive and negative attributes organized in a tree structure. Building on this, we propose a two-stage alignment framework. First, we inject domain knowledge to an auxiliary diffusion model via Supervised Fine-Tuning. Second, we introduce Complex Preference Optimization (CPO) that extends DPO to align the target diffusion to our non-binary, hierarchical criteria. Specifically, we reformulate the alignment problem to simultaneously maximize the probability of positive attributes while minimizing the probability of negative attributes with the auxiliary diffusion. We instantiate our approach in the domain of painting generation and conduct CPO training with an annotated dataset of painting with fine-grained attributes based on our criteria.

However, its operational mechanism in the real world remains non-trivial. Currently, an in-laboratory paradigm, called evidence accumulation modelling (EAM), points out that human decision-making involves transforming external evidence into internal mental beliefs. However, the gap in evidence affordance between real-world contexts and laboratory settings hinders the effective application of EAM. Here we generalize EAM to the real world and conduct analysis in real-world driving scenarios. A cognitive scheme is proposed to formalize real-world evidence affordance and capture active sensing through eye movements. Empirically, our scheme can plausibly portray the accumulation of drivers' mental beliefs, explaining how active sensing transforms evidence into mental beliefs from the perspective of information utility. Also, our results demonstrate a negative correlation between evidence affordance and attention recruited by individuals, revealing how human drivers adapt their evidence-collection patterns across various contexts. Moreover, we reveal the positive influence of evidence affordance and attention distribution on decision-making propensity.

We propose 4D-ARE (4-Dimensional Attribution-Driven Agent Requirements Engineering), a preliminary methodology for specifying attribution-driven agents. The core insight: decision-makers seek attribution, not answers. Attribution concerns organize into four dimensions (Results -> Process -> Support -> Long-term), motivated by Pearl's causal hierarchy. The framework operationalizes through five layers producing artifacts that compile directly to system prompts. We demonstrate the methodology through an industrial pilot deployment in financial services. 4D-ARE addresses what agents should reason about, complementing runtime frameworks that address how. We hypothesize systematic specification amplifies the power of these foundational advances. This paper presents a methodological proposal with preliminary industrial validation; rigorous empirical evaluation is planned for future work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e864D-ARE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6307\u5b9aLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u9a71\u52a8\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u4e1a\u8bd5\u70b9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5982ReAct\u3001\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff09\u5728LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u89c4\u8303\uff08\u786e\u5b9a\u4ee3\u7406\u9700\u8981\u54ea\u4e9b\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff09\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u5bfb\u6c42\u7684\u662f\u5f52\u56e0\u800c\u975e\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e864D-ARE\uff08\u56db\u7ef4\u5f52\u56e0\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e94\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u8bd1\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5de5\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "4D-ARE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u4e1a\u8bd5\u70b9\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u521d\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "4D-ARE\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u521d\u6b65\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6307\u5b9a\u5f52\u56e0\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u4e1a\u8bd5\u70b9\u90e8\u7f72\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002\u672a\u6765\u8ba1\u5212\u8fdb\u884c\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

There has been some exploration of indirect grid adaptivity by replacing uniform grids with tetrahedral meshes or locally subdivided grids, as inversion-free deformation of grids is difficult. This work develops an inversion-free grid deformation method that optimizes differential weight to adaptively compress space. The method is the first to optimize grid vertices as differential elements using vertex-colorings, decomposing a dense input linear system into many independent sets of vertices which can be optimized concurrently. This method is then also extended to optimize UV meshes with convex boundaries. Experimentally, this differential representation leads to a smoother optimization manifold than updating extrinsic vertex coordinates. By optimizing each sets of vertices in a coloring separately, local injectivity checks are straightforward since the valid region for each vertex is fixed. This enables the use of optimizers such as Adam, as each vertex can be optimized independently of other vertices.

Specifically, we design a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent capable of learning adaptive power control policies directly from channel state observations, effectively bypassing the need for explicit system models. We formulate the resource allocation problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and benchmark the proposed approach against classical heuristics, including fixed allocation, random assignment, and the theoretical water-filling algorithm. Empirical results demonstrate that the DQN agent achieves a system throughput of 3.88 Mbps, effectively matching the upper limit of the water fill, while outperforming the random and fixed allocation strategies by approximately 73% and 27%, respectively. Moreover, the agent exhibits emergent fairness, maintaining a Jain's Index of 0.91, and successfully optimizes the trade-off between spectral efficiency and energy consumption.

However, existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, such as predefined contact types, fixed grasp configurations, or camera calibration, that hinder generalization to novel objects and deployment in unstructured environments. In this paper, we present UNIC, a unified multimodal framework for extrinsic contact estimation that operates without any prior knowledge or camera calibration. UNIC directly encodes visual observations in the camera frame and integrates them with proprioceptive and tactile modalities in a fully data-driven manner. It introduces a unified contact representation based on scene affordance maps that captures diverse contact formations and employs a multimodal fusion mechanism with random masking, enabling robust multimodal representation learning.

Existing methods predominantly rely on least and most significant bit (LSB & MSB) manipulation, Pixel Value Differencing (PVD), spatial perturbations in RGB channels, transform domain based methods, Quantization methods, Edge and Region based methods and more recently through deep learning methods and generative AI techniques for hiding textual information in spatial domain of images. Most of them are dependent on pixel intensity flipping over multiple pixels, such as LSB and combination of LSB based methodologies, and on transform coefficients, often resulting in the form of noise. Encoding and Decoding are deterministic in most of the existing approaches and are computationally heavy in case of higher models such as deep learning and gen AI approaches. The proposed method works on quinary pixel intensity combinations in RGB space, where five controlled different pixel intensity variations in each of the R, G, and B channels formulate up to one hundred and twenty five distinct pixel intensity combinations. These combinations are mapped to textual symbols, enabling the representation of uppercase and lowercase alphabetic characters, numeric digits, whitespace, and commonly used special characters. Different metrics such as MSE, MAE, SNR, PSNR, SSIM, Histogram Comparison and Heatmap analysis, were evaluated for both original and encoded images resulting in no significant distortion in the images. Furthermore, the method achieves improved embedding efficiency by encoding a complete textual symbol within a single RGB pixel, in contrast to LSB and MSB based approaches that typically require multiple pixels or multi-step processes, as well as transform and learning based methods that incur higher computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eRGB\u4e94\u8fdb\u5236\u50cf\u7d20\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5355\u50cf\u7d20\u7f16\u7801\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u65e0\u635f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982LSB\u3001MSB\u3001PVD\u7b49\u4f9d\u8d56\u50cf\u7d20\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7ffb\u8f6c\u6216\u591a\u6b65\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u4e14\u6613\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528RGB\u901a\u9053\u4e2d\u4e94\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u5f3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5f62\u6210125\u79cd\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ec4\u5408\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6587\u672c\u7b26\u53f7\u4e0a\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7MSE\u3001MAE\u3001SNR\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u6587\u672c\u65f6\u672a\u5f15\u8d77\u663e\u8457\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u4e14\u5355\u50cf\u7d20\u5373\u53ef\u5b8c\u6210\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eRGB\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4e94\u8fdb\u5236\u50cf\u7d20\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002"}}

Version 8", "summary": "Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) may face a confrontation question: under what conditions would a rationally self-interested AGI choose to seize power or eliminate human control (a confrontation) rather than remain cooperative? We formalize this in a Markov decision process with a stochastic human-initiated shutdown event. Building on results on convergent instrumental incentives, we show that for almost all reward functions a misaligned agent has an incentive to avoid shutdown. We then derive closed-form thresholds for when confronting humans yields higher expected utility than compliant behavior, as a function of the discount factor $\u03b3$, shutdown probability $p$, and confrontation cost $C$. For example, a far-sighted agent ($\u03b3=0.99$) facing $p=0.01$ can have a strong takeover incentive unless $C$ is sufficiently large. We contrast this with aligned objectives that impose large negative utility for harming humans, which makes confrontation suboptimal. In a strategic 2-player model (human policymaker vs AGI), we prove that if the AGI's confrontation incentive satisfies $\u0394\\ge 0$, no stable cooperative equilibrium exists: anticipating this, a rational human will shut down or preempt the system, leading to conflict.

It can be applied to programs taking string inputs, even when only a single failure-inducing input is available. DDMIN is an algorithm that systematically explores the minimal failure-inducing input that exposes a bug, given an initial failing input. However, it does not provide information about the faulty statements responsible for the failure. DDMIN-LOC addresses this limitation by collecting the passing and failing inputs generated during the DDMIN process and computing suspiciousness scores for program statements and predicates using SBFL algorithms. These scores are then combined to rank statements according to their likelihood of being faulty. DDMIN-LOC requires only one failing input of the buggy program, although it can be applied only to programs that take string inputs. DDMIN-LOC was evaluated on 136 programs selected from the QuixBugs and Codeflaws benchmarks using the SBFL algorithms Tarantula, Ochiai, GenProg, Jaccard and DStar. Experimental results show that DDMIN-LOC performs best with Jaccard: in most subjects, fewer than 20% executable lines need to be examined to locate the faulty statements. Moreover, in most subjects, faulty statements are ranked within the top 3 positions in all the generated test suites derived from different failing inputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "DDMIN-LOC\u7ed3\u5408DDMIN\u548cSBFL\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5355\u4e2a\u5931\u8d25\u8f93\u5165\u5373\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u8bed\u53e5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u8f93\u5165\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "DDMIN\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u63a2\u7d22\u6700\u5c0f\u5931\u8d25\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5bfc\u81f4\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u6545\u969c\u8bed\u53e5\u3002DDMIN-LOC\u65e8\u5728\u5f25\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "DDMIN-LOC\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86Delta Debugging Minimization (DDMIN)\u548cSpectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL)\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6536\u96c6DDMIN\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u7684\u901a\u8fc7\u548c\u5931\u8d25\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5229\u7528SBFL\u7b97\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bed\u53e5\u548c\u8c13\u8bcd\u7684\u53ef\u7591\u6027\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5bf9\u8bed\u53e5\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u540d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cDDMIN-LOC\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u662fJaccard\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u68c0\u67e5\u5c11\u4e8e20%\u7684\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u884c\u5373\u53ef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6545\u969c\u8bed\u53e5\uff0c\u4e14\u6545\u969c\u8bed\u53e5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u4e2d\u901a\u5e38\u6392\u540d\u524d3\u3002", "conclusion": "DDMIN-LOC\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408DDMIN\u548cSBFL\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5728\u4ec5\u9700\u5355\u4e2a\u5931\u8d25\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u8bed\u53e5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u8f93\u5165\u7a0b\u5e8f\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

In contrast, we focus on explicit, prompt-free editing, where the user directly specifies the modification by cropping and pasting an object or sub-object into a chosen location within an image. This operation affords precise spatial and visual control, yet it introduces a fundamental challenge: preserving the identity of the pasted object while harmonizing it with its new context. We observe that attention maps in diffusion-based editing models inherently govern whether image regions are preserved or adapted for coherence. Building on this insight, we introduce LooseRoPE, a saliency-guided modulation of rotational positional encoding (RoPE) that loosens the positional constraints to continuously control the attention field of view. By relaxing RoPE in this manner, our method smoothly steers the model's focus between faithful preservation of the input image and coherent harmonization of the inserted object, enabling a balanced trade-off between identity retention and contextual blending. Our approach provides a flexible and intuitive framework for image editing, achieving seamless compositional results without textual descriptions or complex user input.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLooseRoPE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u5236\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u5bf9\u8c61\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u6216\u9ad8\u7ea7\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u76f4\u89c2\u4f46\u7c97\u7cd9\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5173\u6ce8\u4e8e\u65e0\u9700\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u901a\u8fc7\u88c1\u526a\u548c\u7c98\u8d34\u5bf9\u8c61\u76f4\u63a5\u6307\u5b9a\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u8c61\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u65b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165LooseRoPE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u663e\u8457\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\uff08RoPE\uff09\u8c03\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u653e\u677e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u89c6\u91ce\u3002", "result": "LooseRoPE\u80fd\u591f\u5e73\u6ed1\u5730\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u63d2\u5165\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u534f\u8c03\u4e4b\u95f4\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u878d\u5408\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "LooseRoPE\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u6216\u590d\u6742\u7528\u6237\u8f93\u5165\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u7f1d\u7ec4\u5408\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

We prove that finding a branch-decomposition of width at most $k$ for a connectivity function given by an oracle is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT), by providing an algorithm of running time $2^{O(k^2)} \u03b3n^6 \\log n$, where $\u03b3$ is the time to compute $f(X)$ for any set $X$, and $n = |V|$. This improves the previous algorithm by Oum and Seymour [J. Combin. Theory Ser.~B, 2007], which runs in time $\u03b3n^{O(k)}$.

Presented at SESAR Innovation Days 2025", "summary": "Conventional optimization-based metering depends on strict adherence to precomputed schedules, which limits the flexibility required for the stochastic operations of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM). In contrast, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) offers a decentralized, adaptive framework that can better handle uncertainty, required for safe aircraft separation assurance. Despite this advantage, current MARL approaches often overfit to specific airspace structures, limiting their adaptability to new configurations. To improve generalization, we recast the MARL problem in a relative polar state space and train a transformer encoder model across diverse traffic patterns and intersection angles. The learned model provides speed advisories to resolve conflicts while maintaining aircraft near their desired cruising speeds. In our experiments, we evaluated encoder depths of 1, 2, and 3 layers in both structured and unstructured airspaces, and found that a single encoder configuration outperformed deeper variants, yielding near-zero near mid-air collision rates and shorter loss-of-separation infringements than the deeper configurations. Additionally, we showed that the same configuration outperforms a baseline model designed purely with attention. Together, our results suggest that the newly formulated state representation, novel design of neural network architecture, and proposed training strategy provide an adaptable and scalable decentralized solution for aircraft separation assurance in both structured and unstructured airspaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u5bf9\u6781\u5750\u6807\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684MARL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u98de\u673a\u5206\u79bb\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u5355\u5c42\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8ba1\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5148\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7a7a\u4e2d\u673a\u52a8\uff08AAM\uff09\u968f\u673a\u64cd\u4f5c\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002MARL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5206\u6563\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u7279\u5b9a\u7a7a\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MARL\uff09\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u5728\u76f8\u5bf9\u6781\u5750\u6807\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4ea4\u901a\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u89d2\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5355\u5c42\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u914d\u7f6e\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a7a\u57df\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u96f6\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u63a5\u8fd1\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u548c\u66f4\u77ed\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u8fdd\u89c4\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a7a\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u98de\u673a\u5206\u79bb\u4fdd\u969c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5206\u6563\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This work explores post-training to achieve fully unified text-image generation, where models autonomously transition from textual reasoning to visual synthesis within a single inference process. We examine the impact of joint text-image generation on T2I performance and the relative importance of each modality during post-training. We additionally explore different post-training data strategies, showing that a targeted dataset addressing specific limitations achieves superior results compared to broad image-caption corpora or benchmark-aligned data.

However, most existing approaches rely on predefined measurements or fixed reward signals, which limits their applicability in open-ended and dynamic environments where new actions may require previously unknown forms of feedback. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an Actively Feedback Getting model, in which an AI agent proactively interacts with the environment to discover, screen, and verify feedback without relying on predefined measurements. Rather than assuming explicit feedback definitions, the proposed method exploits action-induced environmental differences to identify target feedback that is not specified in advance, based on the observation that actions inevitably produce measurable changes in the environment. In addition, a self-triggering mechanism, driven by internal objectives such as improved accuracy, precision, and efficiency, is introduced to autonomously plan and adjust actions, thereby enabling faster and more focused feedback acquisition without external commands.

We introduce a general framework that incorporates uncertainty models for actuation (e.g., tendon tensions), applied forces and moments, process noise, boundary conditions, and arbitrary backbone measurements. By adding temporal priors across time steps, our method additionally performs joint estimation in both the spatial (arclength) and temporal domains, enabling full \\textit{spacetime} state estimation. Discretizing the arclength domain yields a factor graph representation of the continuum robot model, which can be exploited for fast batch sparse nonlinear optimization in the style of SLAM. The framework is general and applies to a broad class of continuum robots; as illustrative cases, we show (i) tendon-driven robots in simulation, where we demonstrate real-time kinematics with uncertainty, tip force sensing from position feedback, and distributed load estimation from backbone strain, and (ii) a surgical concentric tube robot in experiment, where we validate accurate kinematics and tip force estimation, highlighting potential for surgical palpation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u57df\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u56e0\u5b50\u56fe\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u7b80\u5316\u7684Cosserat\u6746\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u8003\u8651\u9a71\u52a8\u8f93\u5165\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u8f7d\u8377\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5c06\u8fde\u7eed\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u65f6\u7a7a\u57df\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u56e0\u5b50\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u5feb\u901f\u7a00\u758f\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u672b\u7aef\u529b\u611f\u77e5\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e94\u53d8\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u624b\u672f\u540c\u5fc3\u7ba1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u548c\u672b\u7aef\u529b\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u57df\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u8fde\u7eed\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

When infrastructure faults including hardware malfunctions, network disruptions, and software anomalies corrupt these metrics, autoscalers may systematically over- or under-provision resources, resulting in elevated operational expenses or degraded service reliability. This paper conducts controlled simulation experiments to measure how four prevalent fault categories affect both vertical and horizontal autoscaling behaviors across multiple instance configurations and service level objective (SLO) thresholds. Experimental findings demonstrate that storage-related faults generate the largest cost overhead, adding up to $258 monthly under horizontal scaling policies, whereas routing anomalies consistently bias autoscalers toward insufficient resource allocation. The sensitivity to fault-induced metric distortions differs markedly between scaling strategies: horizontal autoscaling exhibits greater susceptibility to transient anomalies, particularly near threshold boundaries. These empirically-grounded insights offer actionable recommendations for designing fault-tolerant autoscaling policies that distinguish genuine workload fluctuations from failure artifacts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u6545\u969c\u5bf9\u4e91\u8d44\u6e90\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u50a8\u6545\u969c\u6210\u672c\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u8def\u7531\u5f02\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6c34\u5e73\u6269\u5c55\u5bf9\u77ac\u6001\u5f02\u5e38\u66f4\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5bb9\u9519\u7b56\u7565\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6545\u969c\uff08\u5982\u786c\u4ef6\u6545\u969c\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u65ad\u548c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f02\u5e38\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u8d44\u6e90\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6216\u4e0d\u8db3\u914d\u7f6e\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u589e\u52a0\u6216\u670d\u52a1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u56db\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u6545\u969c\u7c7b\u522b\u5bf9\u5782\u76f4\u548c\u6c34\u5e73\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5b58\u50a8\u76f8\u5173\u6545\u969c\u5728\u6c34\u5e73\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6210\u672c\u5f00\u9500\u6700\u5927\uff08\u6bcf\u6708\u9ad8\u8fbe258\u7f8e\u5143\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u8def\u7531\u5f02\u5e38\u5219\u5bfc\u81f4\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u5668\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u6c34\u5e73\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u5bf9\u77ac\u6001\u5f02\u5e38\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9608\u503c\u8fb9\u754c\u9644\u8fd1\uff09\u66f4\u4e3a\u654f\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6545\u969c\u7c7b\u522b\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bb9\u9519\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

We introduce ReHyAt, a Recurrent Hybrid Attention mechanism that combines the fidelity of softmax attention with the efficiency of linear attention, enabling chunk-wise recurrent reformulation and constant memory usage. Unlike the concurrent linear-only SANA Video, ReHyAt's hybrid design allows efficient distillation from existing softmax-based models, reducing the training cost by two orders of magnitude to ~160 GPU hours, while being competitive in the quality. Our light-weight distillation and finetuning pipeline provides a recipe that can be applied to future state-of-the-art bidirectional softmax-based models. Experiments on VBench and VBench-2.0, as well as a human preference study, demonstrate that ReHyAt achieves state-of-the-art video quality while reducing attention cost from quadratic to linear, unlocking practical scalability for long-duration and on-device video generation.

However, the alignment between these messages and the actual changes remains unexplored, raising concerns about the trustworthiness of AI agents. To fill this gap, we analyzed 23,247 agentic PRs across five agents using PR message-code inconsistency (PR-MCI). We contributed 974 manually annotated PRs, found 406 PRs (1.7%) exhibited high PR-MCI, and identified eight PR-MCI types, revealing that descriptions claiming unimplemented changes was the most common issue (45.4%). Statistical tests confirmed that high-MCI PRs had 51.7% lower acceptance rates (28.3% vs. 80.0%) and took 3.5x longer to merge (55.8 vs. 16.0 hours).

While effective, scalar quantization may not optimally capture the correlations of high-dimensional feature vectors, which can potentially limit the rate-distortion performance.\n  In this work, we introduce a novel progressive codec for 3D Gaussian Splatting that replaces traditional methods with a more powerful Residual Vector Quantization approach to compress the primitive features.

Unlike all previous methods, our techniques apply to heavy-tailed distributions and include examples that do not even have finite covariances. Our method succeeds whenever the cluster distributions have a characteristic function with sufficiently heavy tails. Such distributions include the Laplace distribution but crucially exclude Gaussians.\n  All previous methods for learning mixture models relied implicitly or explicitly on the low-degree moments. Even for the case of Laplace distributions, we prove that any such algorithm must use super-polynomially many samples. Our method thus adds to the short list of techniques that bypass the limitations of the method of moments.\n  Somewhat surprisingly, our algorithm does not require any minimum separation between the cluster means. This is in stark contrast to spherical Gaussian mixtures where a minimum $\\ell_2$-separation is provably necessary even information-theoretically [Regev and Vijayaraghavan '17]. Our methods compose well with existing techniques and allow obtaining ''best of both worlds\" guarantees for mixtures where every component either has a heavy-tailed characteristic function or has a sub-Gaussian tail with a light-tailed characteristic function.\n  Our algorithm is based on a new approach to learning mixture models via efficient high-dimensional sparse Fourier transforms. We believe that this method will find more applications to statistical estimation. As an example, we give an algorithm for consistent robust mean estimation against noise-oblivious adversaries, a model practically motivated by the literature on multiple hypothesis testing.

However, existing approaches often rely on explicit action exchange between agents to evaluate action value functions, which is frequently impractical in real-world engineering environments due to communication constraints, latency, energy consumption, and reliability requirements. From an artificial intelligence perspective, this paper proposes an enhanced multiagent reinforcement learning framework that employs action estimation neural networks to infer agent behaviors. By integrating a lightweight action estimation module, each agent infers neighboring agents' behaviors using only locally observable information, enabling collaborative policy learning without explicit action sharing. This approach is fully compatible with standard TD3 algorithms and scalable to larger multiagent systems. At the engineering application level, this framework has been implemented and validated in dual-arm robotic manipulation tasks: two robotic arms collaboratively lift objects. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances the robustness and deployment feasibility of real-world robotic systems while reducing dependence on information infrastructure.

Despite significant research efforts, existing state-of-the-art approaches for CABP are exclusively heuristic or metaheuristic in nature, and exact methods have been limited to restricted graph classes. In this paper, we present the first exact approach for the CABP on general graphs, based on SAT solving, called SAT-CAB. The proposed method is able to systematically explore the solution space and guarantee global optimality, overcoming the limitations of previously reported heuristic algorithms. This approach relies on a novel and efficient SAT encoding of CABP, in which the problem is transformed into a sequence of At-Most-One constraints. In particular, we introduce a compact representation of the At-Most-One constraints inherent to CABP, which significantly reduces the size of the resulting formulas and enables modern SAT solvers to effectively explore the solution space and to certify global optimality. Extensive computational experiments on standard benchmark instances show that the proposed method efficiently solves CABP instances of practical relevance, while identifying several previously unknown optimal solutions. Moreover, global optimal cyclic antibandwidth values are proven for a number of benchmark instances for the first time. Comparative results indicate that SAT-CAB consistently matches or surpasses the best-known solutions obtained by state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms such as MS-GVNS, HABC-CAB, and MACAB, as well as strong commercial Constraint Programming and Mixed Integer Programming solvers like CPLEX and Gurobi, particularly on general graphs, while also providing optimality guarantees.

From an algorithmic perspective, there is a sharp difference in complexity between detecting and counting the copies of a given length-$k$ pattern in a length-$n$ permutation. The former admits a $2^{\\mathcal{O}(k^2)} \\cdot n$ time algorithm (Guillemot and Marx, 2014) while the latter cannot be solved in time $f(k)\\cdot n^{o(k/\\log k)}$ unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails (Berendsohn, Kozma, and Marx, 2021). In fact already for patterns of length 4, exact counting is unlikely to admit near-linear time algorithms under standard fine-grained complexity assumptions (Dudek and Gawrychowski, 2020).\n  Recently, Ben-Eliezer, Mitrovi\u0107 and Sristava (2026) showed that for patterns of length up to 5, a $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation of the pattern count can be computed in near-linear time, yielding a separation between exact and approximate counting for small patterns, and conjectured that approximate counting is asymptotically easier than exact counting in general. We strongly refute their conjecture by showing that, under ETH, no algorithm running in time $f(k)\\cdot n^{o(k/\\log k)}$ can approximate the number of copies of a length-$k$ pattern within a multiplicative factor $n^{(1/2-\\varepsilon)k}$. The lower bound on runtime matches the conditional lower bound for exact pattern counting, and the obtained bound on the multiplicative error factor is essentially tight, as an $n^{k/2}$-approximation can be computed in $2^{\\mathcal{O}(k^2)}\\cdot n$ time using an algorithm for pattern detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53cd\u9a73\u4e86\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8ba1\u6570\u6bd4\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u6570\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728ETH\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u4e24\u8005\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u76f8\u540c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u6392\u5217\u6a21\u5f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u8ba1\u6570\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8ba1\u6570\u662f\u5426\u6bd4\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u6570\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u6570\u65f6\u95f4\u5047\u8bbe\uff08ETH\uff09\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8ba1\u6570\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0b\u754c\u4e0e\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u6570\u76f8\u540c\u3002", "result": "\u5728ETH\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8ba1\u6570\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0b\u754c\u4e3af(k)\u22c5n^(o(k/log k))\uff0c\u4e14\u4e58\u6027\u8bef\u5dee\u56e0\u5b50\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5f3a\u70c8\u53cd\u9a73\u4e86Ben-Eliezer\u7b49\u4eba\u7684\u731c\u60f3\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728ETH\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8ba1\u6570\u4e0e\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u6570\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5e76\u65e0\u672c\u8d28\u533a\u522b\u3002"}}

(c) IEEE", "summary": "In this paper, we present the development of 4-DOF robot limbs, which we call Moonbots, designed to connect in various configurations with each other and wheel modules, enabling adaptation to different environments and tasks. These modular components are intended primarily for robotic systems in space exploration and construction on the Moon in our Moonshot project. Such modular robots add flexibility and versatility for space missions where resources are constrained. Each module is driven by a common actuator characterized by a high torque-to-speed ratio, supporting both precise control and dynamic motion when required. This unified actuator design simplifies development and maintenance across the different module types. The paper describes the hardware implementation, the mechanical design of the modules, and the overall software architecture used to control and coordinate them. Additionally, we evaluate the control performance of the actuator under various load conditions to characterize its suitability for modular robot applications. To demonstrate the adaptability of the system, we introduce nine functional configurations assembled from the same set of modules: 4DOF-limb, 8DOF-limb, vehicle, dragon, minimal, quadruped, cargo, cargo-minimal, and bike.

Existing paradigms such as Proof of Work and Proof of Stake instantiate this scarcity through parallelizable resources like computation or capital. Once acquired, these resources can be subdivided across many identities at negligible marginal cost, making linear Sybil cost fundamentally unattainable.\n  We introduce Proof of Commitment (PoCmt), a consensus primitive grounded in a non-parallelizable resource: real-time human engagement. Validators maintain a commitment state capturing cumulative human effort, protocol participation, and online availability. Engagement is enforced through a Human Challenge Oracle that issues identity-bound, time-sensitive challenges, limiting the number of challenges solvable within each human window.\n  Under this model, sustaining multiple active identities requires proportional human-time effort. We establish a cost-theoretic separation showing that protocols based on parallelizable resources admit zero marginal Sybil cost, whereas PoCmt enforces a strictly linear cost profile. Using a weighted-backbone analysis, we show that PoCmt achieves safety, liveness, and commitment-proportional fairness under partial synchrony.\n  Simulations complement the analysis by isolating human-time capacity as the sole adversarial bottleneck and validating the predicted commitment drift and fairness properties.

(c) IEEE", "summary": "High-fidelity simulators for the lunar surface provide a digital environment for extensive testing of rover operations and mission planning. However, current simulators focus on either visual realism or physical accuracy, which limits their capability to replicate lunar conditions comprehensively. This work addresses that gap by combining high visual fidelity with realistic terrain interaction for a realistic representation of rovers on the lunar surface. Because direct simulation of wheel-soil interactions is computationally expensive, a data-driven approach was adopted, using regression models for slip and sinkage from data collected in both full-rover and single-wheel experiments and simulations. The resulting regression-based terramechanics model accurately reproduced steady-state and dynamic slip, as well as sinkage behavior, on flat terrain and slopes up to 20 degrees, with validation against field test results.

Advanced quantum transport (QT) solvers are required to accurately simulate such nano-devices. The non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism lends itself optimally to these tasks, but it is computationally very intensive, involving the selected inversion (SI) of matrices and the selected solution of quadratic matrix (SQ) equations. Existing algorithms to tackle these numerical problems are ideally suited to GPU acceleration, e.g., the so-called recursive Green's function (RGF) technique, but they are typically sequential, require block-tridiagonal (BT) matrices as inputs, and their implementation has been so far restricted to shared memory parallelism, thus limiting the achievable device sizes. To address these shortcomings, we introduce distributed methods that build on RGF and enable parallel selected inversion and selected solution of the quadratic matrix equation. We further extend them to handle BT matrices with arrowhead, which allows for the investigation of multi-terminal transistor structures. We evaluate the performance of our approach on a real dataset from the QT simulation of a nano-ribbon transistor and compare it with the sparse direct package PARDISO. When scaling to 16 GPUs, our fused SI and SQ solver is 5.2x faster than the SI module of PARDISO applied to a device 16x shorter.

Such models rely on the KV-cache mechanism to reduce attention computation from O(T^2) to O(T); however, KV-cache size grows linearly with the number of generated tokens, and it rapidly becomes the dominant bottleneck limiting inference efficiency and generative length. Unified autoregressive video generation inherits this limitation. Our analysis reveals that KV-cache tokens exhibit distinct spatiotemporal properties: (i) text and conditioning-image tokens act as persistent semantic anchors that consistently receive high attention, and (ii) attention to previous frames naturally decays with temporal distance. Leveraging these observations, we introduce PackCache, a training-free KV-cache management method that dynamically compacts the KV cache through three coordinated mechanisms: condition anchoring that preserves semantic references, cross-frame decay modeling that allocates cache budget according to temporal distance, and spatially preserving position embedding that maintains coherent 3D structure under cache removal. In terms of efficiency, PackCache accelerates end-to-end generation by 1.7-2.2x on 48-frame long sequences, showcasing its strong potential for enabling longer-sequence video generation. Notably, the final four frames - the portion most impacted by the progressively expanding KV-cache and thus the most expensive segment of the clip - PackCache delivers a 2.6x and 3.7x acceleration on A40 and H200, respectively, for 48-frame videos.", "AI": {"tldr": "PackCache\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u538b\u7f29KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u540e\u51e0\u5e27\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5927\u5c0f\u968f\u751f\u6210\u4ee4\u724c\u6570\u91cf\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u9650\u5236\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u751f\u6210\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PackCache\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u951a\u5b9a\u3001\u8de8\u5e27\u8870\u51cf\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fdd\u7559\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u4e09\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u538b\u7f29KV\u7f13\u5b58\u3002", "result": "PackCache\u572848\u5e27\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u52a0\u901f\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u751f\u62101.7-2.2\u500d\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u56db\u5e27\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\u5c24\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\uff08A40\u4e0a2.6\u500d\uff0cH200\u4e0a3.7\u500d\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "PackCache\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u538b\u7f29KV\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6700\u540e\u51e0\u5e27\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

(c) IEEE", "summary": "Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is an essential technology for the efficiency and reliability of unmanned robotic exploration missions. While the onboard computational capability and communication bandwidth are critically limited, the point cloud data handled by SLAM is large in size, attracting attention to data compression methods. To address such a problem, in this paper, we propose a new method for compressing point cloud maps by exploiting the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The proposed technique converts the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to the frequency-domain 2D image and omits its high-frequency components, focusing on the exploration of gradual terrains such as planets and deserts.

In this paper, we study this problem in an asynchronous communications setting with malicious aggregators. We propose a new solution to provide federated averaging in this model while protecting the client's data privacy through secure aggregation and differential privacy. Our solution maintains the same performance as the state of the art across all metrics. The main contributions of this paper are threefold. First, unlike existing single- or multi-server solutions, we consider malicious aggregation servers that may manipulate the model to leak clients' data or halt computation. To tolerate this threat, we replicate the aggregators, allowing a fraction of them to be corrupted. Second, we propose a new privacy preservation protocol for protocols in asynchronous communication models with Byzantine aggregators. In this protocol, clients mask their values and add Gaussian noise to their models. In contrast with previous works, we use the replicated servers to unmask the models, while ensuring the liveness of training even if aggregators misbehave. Third, the asynchronous communication model introduces new challenges not present in existing approaches. In such a setting, faster clients may contribute more frequently, potentially reducing their privacy and biasing the training. To address this, we introduce an inclusion mechanism that ensures uniform client participation and balanced privacy budgets. Interestingly, the solution presented in this paper does not rely on agreement between aggregators. Thus, we circumvent the known impossibility of consensus in asynchronous settings where processes might crash. Additionally, this feature increases availability, as a consensus-based algorithm only progresses in periods of low latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5f02\u6b65\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0b\u6297\u6076\u610f\u805a\u5408\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u8054\u90a6\u5e73\u5747\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\u548c\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5ba2\u6237\u6570\u636e\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u6076\u610f\u805a\u5408\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u901a\u4fe1\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u4fdd\u62a4\u5ba2\u6237\u9690\u79c1\u5e76\u7ef4\u6301\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u590d\u5236\u805a\u5408\u5668\u7b56\u7565\u5bb9\u5fcd\u90e8\u5206\u88ab\u7834\u574f\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5668\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6a21\u578b\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u6dfb\u52a0\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5305\u542b\u673a\u5236\u786e\u4fdd\u5ba2\u6237\u5747\u5300\u53c2\u4e0e\u3002", "result": "\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u805a\u5408\u5668\u95f4\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u5f02\u6b65\u901a\u4fe1\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5e73\u5747\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\u548c\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u6280\u672f\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u6076\u610f\u805a\u5408\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5bf9\u5ba2\u6237\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6cc4\u9732\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u65ad\u3002"}}

We evaluate the approach on a five language Twitter corpus in a few shot setting and on a VoxCeleb2 derived corpus covering forty languages in a zero shot setting for gender and age prediction. Across a wide range of model configurations and multiple random seeds, RLMIL-DAT consistently improves Macro F1 compared to standard multiple instance learning and the original reinforced multiple instance learning framework. The largest gains are observed for gender prediction, while age prediction remains more challenging and shows smaller but positive improvements. Ablation experiments indicate that domain adversarial training is the primary contributor to the performance gains, enabling effective transfer from high resource English to lower resource languages by discouraging language specific cues in the shared encoder.

Nalar is a ground-up agent-serving framework that cleanly separates workflow specification from execution while providing the runtime visibility and control needed for robust performance. Nalar preserves full Python expressiveness, using lightweight auto-generated stubs that turn agent and tool invocations into futures carrying dependency and context metadata. A managed state layer decouples logical state from physical placement, enabling safe reuse, migration, and consistent retry behavior. A two-level control architecture combines global policy computation with local event-driven enforcement to support adaptive routing, scheduling, and resource management across evolving workflows. Together, these mechanisms allow Nalar to deliver scalable, efficient, and policy-driven serving of heterogeneous agentic applications without burdening developers with orchestration logic.

We study whether a single flow-matching foundation model pre-trained primarily on RGB images can be repurposed as a cross-spectral translator using only a few co-measured examples, and whether the resulting synthetic data can enhance downstream detection. Starting from FLUX.1 Kontext, we insert low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules and fine-tune them on just 100 paired images per domain for two settings: RGB to IR on the KAIST dataset and RGB to SAR on the M4-SAR dataset. The adapted model translates RGB images into pixel-aligned IR/SAR, enabling us to reuse existing bounding boxes and train object detection models purely in the target modality. Across a grid of LoRA hyperparameters, we find that LPIPS computed on only 50 held-out pairs is a strong proxy for downstream performance: lower LPIPS consistently predicts higher mAP for YOLOv11n on both IR and SAR, and for DETR on KAIST IR test data. Using the best LPIPS-selected LoRA adapter, synthetic IR from external RGB datasets (LLVIP, FLIR ADAS) improves KAIST IR pedestrian detection, and synthetic SAR significantly boosts infrastructure detection on M4-SAR when combined with limited real SAR.

At the same time, such robots must not disturb pedestrians. To handle these two requirements, an agent needs to estimate the communication desires of others based on their behavior and then adjust its own communication activities accordingly. In this study, we construct a computational spatial interaction model that considers others. Consideration is expressed as a quantitative parameter: the amount of adjustment of one's internal state to the estimated internal state of the other. To validate the model, we experimented with a human and a virtual robot interacting in a VR environment. The results show that when the participant moves to the target, a virtual robot with a low consideration value inhibits the participant's movement, while a robot with a higher consideration value did not inhibit the participant's movement. When the participant approached the robot, the robot also exhibited approaching behavior, regardless of the consideration value, thus decreasing the participant's movement. These results appear to verify the proposed model's ability to clarify interactions with consideration for others.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8003\u8651\u4ed6\u4eba\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728VR\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u5e72\u6270\u884c\u4eba\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u516c\u5171\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u901a\u4fe1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4e0d\u59a8\u788d\u884c\u4eba\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u542f\u52a8\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8003\u8651\u4ed6\u4eba\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7VR\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4eba\u4e0e\u865a\u62df\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4f4e\u8003\u8651\u503c\u7684\u865a\u62df\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f1a\u6291\u5236\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u800c\u9ad8\u8003\u8651\u503c\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5219\u4e0d\u4f1a\u3002\u5f53\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u63a5\u8fd1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u65f6\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f1a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u63a5\u8fd1\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9610\u660e\u8003\u8651\u4ed6\u4eba\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

Intelligence is defined as the capacity to form and integrate causal connections between signals, actions, and internal states. Through context enrichment, systems interpret incoming information using learned relational structure that provides essential context in an efficient representation that the raw input itself does not contain, enabling efficient processing under metabolic constraints.\n  Building on this foundation, we introduce the systems-explaining-systems principle, where consciousness emerges when recursive architectures allow higher-order systems to learn and interpret the relational patterns of lower-order systems across time. These interpretations are integrated into a dynamically stabilized meta-state and fed back through context enrichment, transforming internal models from representations of the external world into models of the system's own cognitive processes.\n  The framework reframes predictive processing as an emergent consequence of contextual interpretation rather than explicit forecasting and suggests that recursive multi-system architectures may be necessary for more human-like artificial intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u610f\u8bc6\u6e90\u4e8e\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\u800c\u975e\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u9012\u5f52\u67b6\u6784\u4f7f\u9ad8\u9636\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u91ca\u4f4e\u9636\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u7a33\u5b9a\u5143\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u4eba\u7c7b\u5316AI\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u610f\u8bc6\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u6d8c\u73b0\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u6216\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5904\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u7a81\u7834\u4ee3\u8c22\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u610f\u8bc6\u4ece\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u6d8c\u73b0\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u9884\u6d4b\u6216\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e30\u5bcc\u5316\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5229\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\u89e3\u91ca\u8f93\u5165\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u91ca\u7cfb\u7edf\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u610f\u8bc6\u5728\u9012\u5f52\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u6d8c\u73b0\uff0c\u9ad8\u9636\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u4f4e\u9636\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u5904\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u663e\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u9012\u5f52\u591a\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u3002"}}

The research begins with a review of traditional grid-based methods, such as A* and Dijkstra's algorithms, and discusses their limitations in dynamic agricultural environments, highlighting the need for adaptive learning strategies. The study then explores DRL approaches, including Deep Q-Networks (DQN), which demonstrate improved adaptability and performance in two-dimensional simulations. Enhancements such as Double Q-Networks and Dueling Networks are evaluated to further improve decision-making. Building on these results, the focus shifts to continuous action space models, specifically Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3), which are tested in increasingly complex environments. Experiments conducted in a three-dimensional environment using ROS and Gazebo demonstrate the effectiveness of continuous DRL algorithms in navigating dynamic agricultural scenarios. Notably, the pretrained TD3 agent achieves a 95 percent success rate in dynamic environments, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed approach in handling moving obstacles while ensuring safety for both crops and the robot.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fTD3\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u519c\u4e1a\u65e0\u4eba\u8f66\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe95%\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7f51\u683c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u519c\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982A*\u548cDijkstra\u7b97\u6cd5\uff09\u8f6c\u5411\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DQN\u3001Double Q-Networks\u3001Dueling Networks\uff09\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u91c7\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff08DDPG\u548cTD3\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728ROS\u548cGazebo\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684TD3\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523095%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fTD3\uff09\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u519c\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u65e0\u4eba\u5730\u9762\u8f66\u8f86\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe\u523095%\u3002"}}

We contend that over-reliance on machine learning technology is the main reason. Use of automated commonsense reasoning technology, we believe, can help achieve SAE Level 5 autonomy. In this paper, we show how automated common-sense reasoning technology can be deployed in situations where there are not enough data samples available to train a deep learning-based AV model that can handle certain abnormal road scenarios. Specifically, we consider two situations where (i) a traffic signal is malfunctioning at an intersection and (ii) all the cars ahead are slowing down and steering away due to an unexpected obstruction (e.g., animals on the road). We show that in such situations, our commonsense reasoning-based solution accurately detects traffic light colors and obstacles not correctly captured by the AV's perception model. We also provide a pathway for efficiently invoking commonsense reasoning by measuring uncertainty in the computer vision model and using commonsense reasoning to handle uncertain scenarios. We describe our experiments conducted using the CARLA simulator and the results obtained.

An important step in this procedure is mastoidectomy, which removes part of the mastoid region of the temporal bone to provide surgical access. Accurate mastoidectomy shape prediction from preoperative imaging improves pre-surgical planning, reduces risks, and enhances surgical outcomes. Despite its importance, there are limited deep-learning-based studies regarding this topic due to the challenges of acquiring ground-truth labels. We address this gap by investigating self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning models to predict the mastoidectomy region without human annotations. We propose a hybrid self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning framework to predict the mastoidectomy region directly from preoperative CT scans, where the mastoid remains intact. Our hybrid method achieves a mean Dice score of 0.72 when predicting the complex and boundary-less mastoidectomy shape, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrating strong performance. The method provides groundwork for constructing 3D postmastoidectomy surfaces directly from the corresponding preoperative CT scans.

A passivity-based analysis further demonstrates that DW-DOB guarantees stable interactions under dynamic conditions, addressing the shortcomings of conventional observers that fail to compensate for inertial effects. Peg-in-hole experiments at industrial tolerances (H7/h6) validate the approach, yielding deeper and more compliant insertions with minimal residual wrenches and outperforming a conventional wrench disturbance observer and a PD baseline.

Roller skating, as a sport with substantial biomechanical value, can achieve fast and continuous sliding through rational utilization of body inertia, featuring minimal kinetic energy loss. Therefore, this study proposes a novel humanoid robot with each foot equipped with a row of four passive wheels for roller skating. A deep reinforcement learning control framework is also developed for the swizzle gait with the reward function design based on the intrinsic characteristics of roller skating. The learned policy is first analyzed in simulation and then deployed on the physical robot to demonstrate the smoothness and efficiency of the swizzle gait over traditional bipedal walking gait in terms of Impact Intensity and Cost of Transport during locomotion. A reduction of $75.86\\%$ and $63.34\\%$ of these two metrics indicate roller skating as a superior locomotion mode for enhanced energy efficiency and joint longevity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u811a\u90e8\u5b89\u88c5\u88ab\u52a8\u8f6e\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f6e\u6ed1\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u516b\u5b57\u6b65\u6001\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u51b2\u51fb\u548c\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5173\u8282\u5bff\u547d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u884c\u8d70\u548c\u8dd1\u6b65\u65f6\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u811a\u90e8\u4e0e\u5730\u9762\u63a5\u89e6\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u77ac\u65f6\u51b2\u51fb\u529b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5173\u8282\u78e8\u635f\u52a0\u5267\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u8f6e\u6ed1\u8fd0\u52a8\u56e0\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u8eab\u4f53\u60ef\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u8fde\u7eed\u6ed1\u52a8\u4e14\u52a8\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u6700\u5c0f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u8f6e\u6ed1\u7684\u516b\u5b57\u6b65\u6001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u6790\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u516b\u5b57\u6b65\u6001\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u53cc\u8db3\u6b65\u6001\uff0c\u51b2\u51fb\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u8fd0\u8f93\u6210\u672c\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8675.86%\u548c63.34%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u914d\u5907\u88ab\u52a8\u8f6e\u7684\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6e\u6ed1\u8fd0\u52a8\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u51b2\u51fb\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u8fd0\u8f93\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8f6e\u6ed1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5ef6\u957f\u5173\u8282\u5bff\u547d\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, such slow-thinking approaches often lead to overthinking, where models produce excessively verbose responses even for simple queries, resulting in test-time inefficiency and even degraded accuracy. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue via adaptive reasoning strategies, but these methods largely overlook a fundamental bottleneck: visual perception failures. We argue that stable reasoning critically depends on low-level visual grounding, and that reasoning errors often originate from imperfect perception rather than insufficient deliberation. To address this limitation, we propose Gated Perception-Reasoning Optimization (GPRO), a meta-reasoning controller that dynamically routes computation among three decision paths at each generation step: a lightweight fast path, a slow perception path for re-examining visual inputs, and a slow reasoning path for internal self-reflection. To learn this distinction, we derive large-scale failure attribution supervision from approximately 790k samples, using teacher models to distinguish perceptual hallucinations from reasoning errors. We then train the controller with multi-objective reinforcement learning to optimize the trade-off between task accuracy and computational cost under uncertainty. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that GPRO substantially improves both accuracy and efficiency, outperforming recent slow-thinking methods while generating significantly shorter responses.", "AI": {"tldr": "GPRO\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u8ba1\u7b97\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LVLMs\u56e0\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5e38\u56e0\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u5931\u8d25\u8fd9\u4e00\u6839\u672c\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Gated Perception-Reasoning Optimization (GPRO)\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u63a8\u7406\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u8def\u5f84\u4e4b\u95f4\u8def\u7531\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1a\u5feb\u901f\u8def\u5f84\u3001\u6162\u901f\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u6162\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGPRO\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u66f4\u77ed\u3002", "conclusion": "GPRO\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u8ba1\u7b97\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u66f4\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002"}}

Post-hoc calibration aligns predicted confidence with empirical reliability and reduces miscalibration by about an order of magnitude without affecting accuracy.

Recent work has explored using vision-language models (VLMs) for planning, yet existing approaches typically treat perception, prediction, and planning as separate modules. We propose UniDrive-WM, a unified VLM-based world model that jointly performs driving-scene understanding, trajectory planning, and trajectory-conditioned future image generation within a single architecture. UniDrive-WM's trajectory planner predicts a future trajectory, which conditions a VLM-based image generator to produce plausible future frames. These predictions provide additional supervisory signals that enhance scene understanding and iteratively refine trajectory generation. We further compare discrete and continuous output representations for future image prediction, analyzing their influence on downstream driving performance. Experiments on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark show that UniDrive-WM produces high-fidelity future images and improves planning performance by 5.9% in L2 trajectory error and 9.2% in collision rate over the previous best method. These results demonstrate the advantages of tightly integrating VLM-driven reasoning, planning, and generative world modeling for autonomous driving.

Optimisation-based methods such as reinforcement learning offer strong performance but are difficult to verify and explain, while rules-based systems are transparent yet rarely check safety under uncertainty. This paper outlines Agent Mallard, a forward-planning, rules-based agent for tactical control in systemised airspace that embeds a stochastic digital twin directly into its conflict-resolution loop. Mallard operates on predefined GPS-guided routes, reducing continuous 4D vectoring to discrete choices over lanes and levels, and constructs hierarchical plans from an expert-informed library of deconfliction strategies. A depth-limited backtracking search uses causal attribution, topological plan splicing, and monotonic axis constraints to seek a complete safe plan for all aircraft, validating each candidate manoeuvre against uncertain execution scenarios (e.g., wind variation, pilot response, communication loss) before commitment.\n  Preliminary walkthroughs with UK controllers and initial tests in the BluebirdDT airspace digital twin indicate that Mallard's behaviour aligns with expert reasoning and resolves conflicts in simplified scenarios. The architecture is intended to combine model-based safety assessment, interpretable decision logic, and tractable computational performance in future structured en-route environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Agent Mallard\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u524d\u5411\u89c4\u5212\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4f53\u89e3\u51b3\u822a\u8def\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u521d\u6b65\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u900f\u660e\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u524d\u5411\u89c4\u5212\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u968f\u673a\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u51b2\u7a81\u89e3\u51b3\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u8ba1\u5212\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u56de\u6eaf\u641c\u7d22\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0cMallard\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7b26\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u7b80\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u89e3\u51b3\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "conclusion": "Agent Mallard\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u6709\u671b\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u822a\u8def\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u80fd\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6218\u672f\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

However, even state-of-the-art methods often degrade under unseen conditions, highlighting the need for robust and generalizable robot sensing. The RoboSense 2025 Challenge is designed to advance robustness and adaptability in robot perception across diverse sensing scenarios. It unifies five complementary research tracks spanning language-grounded decision making, socially compliant navigation, sensor configuration generalization, cross-view and cross-modal correspondence, and cross-platform 3D perception. Together, these tasks form a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating real-world sensing reliability under domain shifts, sensor failures, and platform discrepancies. RoboSense 2025 provides standardized datasets, baseline models, and unified evaluation protocols, enabling large-scale and reproducible comparison of robust perception methods. The challenge attracted 143 teams from 85 institutions across 16 countries, reflecting broad community engagement.

Two persistent challenges in this context are accurate pixel-level change detection and meaningful semantic change captioning for complex forest dynamics. While large language models (LLMs) are being adapted for interactive data exploration, their integration with vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing image change interpretation (RSICI) remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an LLM-driven agent for integrated forest change analysis that supports natural language querying across multiple RSICI tasks. The proposed system builds upon a multi-level change interpretation (MCI) vision-language backbone with LLM-based orchestration. To facilitate adaptation and evaluation in forest environments, we further introduce the Forest-Change dataset, which comprises bi-temporal satellite imagery, pixel-level change masks, and multi-granularity semantic change captions generated using a combination of human annotation and rule-based methods.

We introduce a novel movement-based control paradigm entitled Compensation Effect Amplification Control (CEAC) that leverages users' trunk flexion and extension as input for controlling prosthetic elbow velocity. Considering that the trunk can be both a functional and compensatory joint when performing upper-limb actions, CEAC amplifies the natural coupling between trunk and prosthesis while introducing a controlled delay that allows users to modulate both the position and velocity of the prosthetic joint. We evaluated CEAC in a generic drawing task performed by twelve able-bodied participants using a supernumerary prosthesis with an active elbow. Additionally a multiple-target-reaching task was performed by a subset of ten participants. Results demonstrate task performances comparable to those obtained with natural arm movements, even when gesture velocity or drawing size were varied, while maintaining ergonomic trunk postures. Analysis revealed that CEAC effectively restores joint coordinated action, distributes movement effort between trunk and elbow, enabling intuitive trajectory control without requiring extreme compensatory movements. Overall, CEAC offers a promising control strategy for intermediate joints of UL prostheses, particularly in tasks requiring continuous and precise coordination.", "AI": {"tldr": "CEAC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u5047\u80a2\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8eaf\u5e72\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u5047\u80a2\u8098\u90e8\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f4\u89c2\u4e14\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e0a\u80a2\u5047\u80a2\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6240\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u95f4\u5173\u8282\uff08\u5982\u624b\u8155\u548c\u8098\u90e8\uff09\u7684\u76f4\u89c2\u63a7\u5236\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u8c03\u5236\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8865\u507f\u6548\u5e94\u653e\u5927\u63a7\u5236\uff08CEAC\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8eaf\u5e72\u7684\u5c48\u4f38\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u5047\u80a2\u8098\u90e8\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u53d7\u63a7\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4ee5\u8c03\u8282\u5047\u80a2\u5173\u8282\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u572812\u540d\u5065\u5168\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u4f7f\u7528\u8d85\u7ea7\u5047\u80a2\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7ed8\u56fe\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cCEAC\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u624b\u81c2\u8fd0\u52a8\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u572810\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5230\u8fbe\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e5f\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "CEAC\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u8fde\u7eed\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u5173\u8282\u534f\u8c03\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5206\u914d\u8eaf\u5e72\u548c\u8098\u90e8\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

Recent work shows that LLMs can engage in multi-turn negotiation, yet nearly all evaluations occur exclusively in English. Using controlled multi-agent simulations across Ultimatum, Buy-Sell, and Resource Exchange games, we systematically isolate language effects across English and four Indic framings (Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marwadi) by holding game rules, model parameters, and incentives constant across all conditions. We find that language choice can shift outcomes more strongly than changing models, reversing proposer advantages and reallocating surplus. Crucially, effects are task-contingent: Indic languages reduce stability in distributive games yet induce richer exploration in integrative settings.

In this work, we present CorDex, a framework that robustly learns dexterous functional grasps of novel objects from synthetic data generated from just a single human demonstration. At the core of our approach is a correspondence-based data engine that generates diverse, high-quality training data in simulation. Based on the human demonstration, our data engine generates diverse object instances of the same category, transfers the expert grasp to the generated objects through correspondence estimation, and adapts the grasp through optimization.

Nevertheless, the synthesized texture UV map usually comes from a space constructed by the training data or the 2D face generator, which limits the methods' generalization ability for in-the-wild input images. Consequently, their facial details, structures and identity may not be consistent with the input. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a style transfer-based facial texture refinement method named FaceRefiner. FaceRefiner treats the 3D sampled texture as style and the output of a texture generation method as content. The photo-realistic style is then expected to be transferred from the style image to the content image. Different from current style transfer methods that only transfer high and middle level information to the result, our style transfer method integrates differentiable rendering to also transfer low level (or pixel level) information in the visible face regions. The main benefit of such multi-level information transfer is that, the details, structures and semantics in the input can thus be well preserved. The extensive experiments on Multi-PIE, CelebA and FFHQ datasets demonstrate that our refinement method can improve the texture quality and the face identity preserving ability, compared with state-of-the-arts.", "AI": {"tldr": "FaceRefiner\u901a\u8fc7\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u591a\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u4f18\u5316\u9762\u90e8\u7eb9\u7406\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7eb9\u7406UV\u56fe\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u62162D\u4eba\u8138\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u91ce\u5916\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7ec6\u8282\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u7eb9\u7406\u7ec6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5FaceRefiner\uff0c\u5c063D\u91c7\u6837\u7eb9\u7406\u89c6\u4e3a\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u7eb9\u7406\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u8f93\u51fa\u89c6\u4e3a\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6e32\u67d3\u4f20\u9012\u591a\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728Multi-PIE\u3001CelebA\u548cFFHQ\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFaceRefiner\u5728\u7eb9\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FaceRefiner\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u9012\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7eb9\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4eba\u8138\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Some existing VLA approaches attempt to improve action accuracy by explicitly generating linguistic reasoning traces or future visual observations before action execution. However, explicit reasoning typically incurs non-negligible inference latency, which constrains the temporal resolution required for robotic manipulation. Moreover, such reasoning is confined to the linguistic space, imposing a representational bottleneck that struggles to faithfully capture ineffable physical attributes. To mitigate these limitations, we propose LaST$_0$, a framework that enables efficient reasoning before acting through a Latent Spatio-Temporal Chain-of-Thought (CoT), capturing fine-grained physical and robotic dynamics that are often difficult to verbalize. Specifically, we introduce a token-efficient latent CoT space that models future visual dynamics, 3D structural information, and robot proprioceptive states, and further extends these representations across time to enable temporally consistent implicit reasoning trajectories. Furthermore, LaST$_0$ adopts a dual-system architecture implemented via a Mixture-of-Transformers design, where a reasoning expert conducts low-frequency latent inference and an acting expert generates high-frequency actions conditioned on robotics-oriented latent representations. To facilitate coordination, LaST$_0$ is trained with heterogeneous operation frequencies, enabling adaptive switching between reasoning and action inference rates during deployment. Across ten simulated and six real-world manipulation tasks, LaST$_0$ improves mean success rates by 8% and 13% over prior VLA methods, respectively, while achieving substantially faster inference.

Although these memes are shifting, we find that different memes may share invariant principles, i.e., the underlying design concept of malicious users, which can help us analyze why these memes are harmful. In this paper, we propose RepMD, an ever-shifting harmful meme detection method based on the design concept reproduction. We first refer to the attack tree to define the Design Concept Graph (DCG), which describes steps that people may take to design a harmful meme. Then, we derive the DCG from historical memes with design step reproduction and graph pruning. Finally, we use DCG to guide the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to detect harmful memes. The evaluation results show that RepMD achieves the highest accuracy with 81.1% and has slight accuracy decreases when generalized to type-shifting and temporal-evolving memes.

The development of accurate machine learning-based segmentation models remains challenging due to the limited availability of data and the complexity of anatomical structures. In this work, we investigate 3D conditional generative models as potential solution for augmenting scarce LGE training data and improving LA segmentation performance. We develop a pipeline to synthesize high-fidelity 3D LGE MRI volumes from composite semantic label maps combining anatomical expert annotations with unsupervised tissue clusters, using three 3D conditional generators (Pix2Pix GAN, SPADE-GAN, and SPADE-LDM). The synthetic images are evaluated for realism and their impact on downstream LA segmentation. SPADE-LDM generates the most realistic and structurally accurate images, achieving an FID of 4.063 and surpassing GAN models, which have FIDs of 40.821 and 7.652 for Pix2Pix and SPADE-GAN, respectively. When augmented with synthetic LGE images, the Dice score for LA cavity segmentation with a 3D U-Net model improved from 0.908 to 0.936, showing a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05) over the baseline.These findings demonstrate the potential of label-conditioned 3D synthesis to enhance the segmentation of under-represented cardiac structures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc73D\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210LGE MRI\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5de6\u5fc3\u623f\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0cSPADE-LDM\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u5fc3\u810f\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5de6\u5fc3\u623f\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u89e3\u5256\u4e13\u5bb6\u6ce8\u91ca\u548c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7c07\u7684\u590d\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u7b7e\u56fe\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u79cd3D\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08Pix2Pix GAN\u3001SPADE-GAN\u548cSPADE-LDM\uff09\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f3D LGE MRI\u4f53\u79ef\u3002", "result": "SPADE-LDM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6700\u771f\u5b9e\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u6700\u51c6\u786e\uff0cFID\u4e3a4.063\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8ePix2Pix GAN\uff0840.821\uff09\u548cSPADE-GAN\uff087.652\uff09\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210LGE\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u540e\uff0c3D U-Net\u6a21\u578b\u7684LA\u8154\u5206\u5272Dice\u5206\u6570\u4ece0.908\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.936\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u663e\u8457\u6027\uff08p < 0.05\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6807\u7b7e\u6761\u4ef63D\u5408\u6210\u6280\u672f\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5fc3\u810f\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002"}}

The main cost is a familiar trade off: methods that most tightly preserve geometry tend to be more cautious about analogy behavior, while more assertive projections can improve analogies at the expense of strict neighborhood stability. Partial Projection is reliably conservative and keeps representations steady; Linear Projection can be more assertive; Subtraction is a simple baseline that remains competitive.

Morariu", "Tong Sun"], "title": "MiLDEdit: Reasoning-Based Multi-Layer Design Document Editing", "comment": null, "summary": "Real-world design documents (e.g., posters) are inherently multi-layered, combining decoration, text, and images. Editing them from natural-language instructions requires fine-grained, layer-aware reasoning to identify relevant layers and coordinate modifications. Prior work largely overlooks multi-layer design document editing, focusing instead on single-layer image editing or multi-layer generation, which assume a flat canvas and lack the reasoning needed to determine what and where to modify. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-Layer Document Editing Agent (MiLDEAgent), a reasoning-based framework that combines an RL-trained multimodal reasoner for layer-wise understanding with an image editor for targeted modifications. To systematically benchmark this setting, we introduce the MiLDEBench, a human-in-the-loop corpus of over 20K design documents paired with diverse editing instructions. The benchmark is complemented by a task-specific evaluation protocol, MiLDEEval, which spans four dimensions including instruction following, layout consistency, aesthetics, and text rendering. Extensive experiments on 14 open-source and 2 closed-source models reveal that existing approaches fail to generalize: open-source models often cannot complete multi-layer document editing tasks, while closed-source models suffer from format violations. In contrast, MiLDEAgent achieves strong layer-aware reasoning and precise editing, significantly outperforming all open-source baselines and attaining performance comparable to closed-source models, thereby establishing the first strong baseline for multi-layer document editing.", "AI": {"tldr": "MiLDEAgent\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6587\u6863\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6587\u6863\uff08\u5982\u6d77\u62a5\uff09\u662f\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u5c42\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6216\u591a\u5c42\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c42\u6b21\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165MiLDEAgent\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u6b21\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acbMiLDEBench\u548cMiLDEEval\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "MiLDEAgent\u5728\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u6587\u6863\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e0e\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "MiLDEAgent\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u5668\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6587\u6863\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f00\u6e90\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u6587\u6863\u7f16\u8f91\u8bbe\u7acb\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

We term this Transitive Expert Error (TEE), distinct from Dunning-Kruger effects, requiring calibrated expertise as precondition. Mechanisms enabling reliable within-domain judgment become liabilities when structural similarity masks causal divergence. Two core mechanisms operate: structural similarity bias causes experts to overweight surface features (shared vocabulary, patterns, formal structure) while missing causal architecture differences; authority persistence maintains confidence across competence boundaries through social reinforcement and metacognitive failures (experts experience no subjective uncertainty as pattern recognition operates smoothly on familiar-seeming inputs.) These mechanism intensify under three conditions: shared vocabulary masking divergent processes, social pressure for immediate judgment, and delayed feedback. These findings extend to AI routing architectures (MoE systems, multi-model orchestration, tool-using agents, RAG systems) exhibiting routing-induced failures (wrong specialist selected) and coverage-induced failures (no appropriate specialist exists). Both produce a hallucination phenotype: confident, coherent, structurally plausible but causally incorrect outputs at domain boundaries. In human systems where mechanisms are cognitive black boxes; AI architectures make them explicit and addressable. We propose interventions: multi-expert activation with disagreement detection (router level), boundary-aware calibration (specialist level), and coverage gap detection (training level). TEE has detectable signatures (routing patterns, confidence-accuracy dissociations, domain-inappropriate content) enabling monitoring and mitigation. What remains intractable in human cognition becomes addressable through architectural design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u5224\u65ad\u4e2d\u6613\u72af\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9519\u8bef\uff08TEE\uff09\uff0cAI\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u6821\u51c6\u7b49\u63aa\u65bd\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u5224\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9519\u8bef\uff08TEE\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5728AI\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u6743\u5a01\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u52a0\u5267\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u5230AI\u8def\u7531\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u7c7b\u4f3c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0TEE\u5728AI\u8def\u7531\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u8def\u7531\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5931\u8d25\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u5982\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u611f\u77e5\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u7f3a\u53e3\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "Transitive Expert Error (TEE)\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u5224\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7AI\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

These tasks are significantly more dynamic than predefined structures, posing new challenges to the current structured generation engines. In this paper, we propose XGrammar 2, a highly optimized structured generation engine for agentic LLMs. XGrammar 2 accelerates the mask generation for these dynamic structured generation tasks through a new dynamic dispatching semantics: TagDispatch. We further introduce a just-in-time (JIT) compilation method to reduce compilation time and a cross-grammar caching mechanism to leverage the common sub-structures across different grammars.

To address these issues, we propose a high uncertainty region-guided multi-architecture collaborative learning (HUR-MACL) model for multi-organ segmentation in the head and neck.

However, due to hardware and physical setup constraints, collecting large-scale real-world manipulation data remains difficult to scale across diverse environments. Recent work uses text-prompt conditioned image diffusion models to augment manipulation data by altering the backgrounds and tabletop objects in the visual observations. However, these approaches often overlook the practical need for multi-view and temporally coherent observations required by state-of-the-art policy models. Further, text prompts alone cannot reliably specify the scene setup.

But AI systems, we argue, will not be able to comply with these regulations at the necessary speed and scale by continuing to rely on traditional, analogue methods of compliance. Instead, we posit that compliance with these regulations will only realistically be achieved computationally: that is, with algorithms that run across the life cycle of an AI system, automatically steering it toward AIR compliance in the face of dynamic conditions. Yet despite their (we would argue) inevitability, the research community has yet to specify exactly how these algorithms for computational AIR compliance should behave - or how we should benchmark their performance. To fill these gaps, we specify a set of design goals for such algorithms. In addition, we specify a benchmark dataset that can be used to quantitatively measure whether individual algorithms satisfy these design goals.

However, it remains a highly challenging task due to several factors such as low tissue contrast with surrounding organs, blurry anatomical boundaries, irregular organ shapes, and the small size of lesions. To tackle these issues, we propose DB-MSMUNet (Dual-Branch Multi-scale Mamba UNet), a novel encoder-decoder architecture designed specifically for robust pancreatic segmentation. The encoder is constructed using a Multi-scale Mamba Module (MSMM), which combines deformable convolutions and multi-scale state space modeling to enhance both global context modeling and local deformation adaptation. The network employs a dual-decoder design: the edge decoder introduces an Edge Enhancement Path (EEP) to explicitly capture boundary cues and refine fuzzy contours, while the area decoder incorporates a Multi-layer Decoder (MLD) to preserve fine-grained details and accurately reconstruct small lesions by leveraging multi-scale deep semantic features. Furthermore, Auxiliary Deep Supervision (ADS) heads are added at multiple scales to both decoders, providing more accurate gradient feedback and further enhancing the discriminative capability of multi-scale features. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets: the NIH Pancreas dataset, the MSD dataset, and a clinical pancreatic tumor dataset provided by collaborating hospitals. DB-MSMUNet achieves Dice Similarity Coefficients of 89.47%, 87.59%, and 89.02%, respectively, outperforming most existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of segmentation accuracy, edge preservation, and robustness across different datasets.

Existing video super-resolution (VSR) methods either neglect the inherent modality gap between infrared and visible images or fail to restore turbulence-induced distortions. Directly cascading turbulence mitigation (TM) algorithms with VSR methods leads to error propagation and accumulation due to the decoupled modeling of degradation between turbulence and resolution. We introduce HATIR, a Heat-Aware Diffusion for Turbulent InfraRed Video Super-Resolution, which injects heat-aware deformation priors into the diffusion sampling path to jointly model the inverse process of turbulent degradation and structural detail loss. Specifically, HATIR constructs a Phasor-Guided Flow Estimator, rooted in the physical principle that thermally active regions exhibit consistent phasor responses over time, enabling reliable turbulence-aware flow to guide the reverse diffusion process. To ensure the fidelity of structural recovery under nonuniform distortions, a Turbulence-Aware Decoder is proposed to selectively suppress unstable temporal cues and enhance edge-aware feature aggregation via turbulence gating and structure-aware attention. We built FLIR-IVSR, the first dataset for turbulent infrared VSR, comprising paired LR-HR sequences from a FLIR T1050sc camera (1024 X 768) spanning 640 diverse scenes with varying camera and object motion conditions. This encourages future research in infrared VSR.

However, its model training relies heavily on the large-scale labeled data, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. To address this challenge, we propose an SEI approach enhanced by active learning (AL), which follows a three-stage semi-supervised training scheme. In the first stage, self-supervised contrastive learning is employed with a dynamic dictionary update mechanism to extract robust representations from large amounts of the unlabeled data. In the second stage, supervised training on a small labeled dataset is performed, where the contrastive and cross-entropy losses are jointly optimized to improve the feature separability and strengthen the classification boundaries. In the third stage, an AL module selects the most valuable samples from the unlabeled data for annotation based on the uncertainty and representativeness criteria, further enhancing generalization under limited labeling budgets.

However, existing trading systems struggle to jointly reason over noisy multi-source web evidence while maintaining robustness to rapid price shocks at sub-second timescales. The first challenge lies in synthesizing unstructured web content, social sentiment, and structured OHLCV signals into coherent and interpretable trading decisions without amplifying spurious correlations, while the second challenge concerns risk control, as slow deliberative reasoning pipelines are ill-suited for handling abrupt market shocks that require immediate defensive responses. To address these challenges, we propose WebCryptoAgent, an agentic trading framework that decomposes web-informed decision making into modality-specific agents and consolidates their outputs into a unified evidence document for confidence-calibrated reasoning. We further introduce a decoupled control architecture that separates strategic hourly reasoning from a real-time second-level risk model, enabling fast shock detection and protective intervention independent of the trading loop. Extensive experiments on real-world cryptocurrency markets demonstrate that WebCryptoAgent improves trading stability, reduces spurious activity, and enhances tail-risk handling compared to existing baselines.

However, how understanding can effectively assist generation has not been fully explored. Unlike previous works that focus on leveraging reasoning abilities and world knowledge from understanding models, this paper introduces a novel perspective: leveraging understanding to enhance the fidelity and detail richness of generated images. To this end, we propose Forge-and-Quench, a new unified framework that puts this principle into practice. In the generation process of our framework, an MLLM first reasons over the entire conversational context, including text instructions, to produce an enhanced text instruction. This refined instruction is then mapped to a virtual visual representation, termed the Bridge Feature, via a novel Bridge Adapter. This feature acts as a crucial link, forging insights from the understanding model to quench and refine the generation process. It is subsequently injected into the T2I backbone as a visual guidance signal, alongside the enhanced text instruction that replaces the original input. To validate this paradigm, we conduct comprehensive studies on the design of the Bridge Feature and Bridge Adapter. Our framework demonstrates exceptional extensibility and flexibility, enabling efficient migration across different MLLM and T2I models with significant savings in training overhead, all without compromising the MLLM's inherent multimodal understanding capabilities. Experiments show that Forge-and-Quench significantly improves image fidelity and detail across multiple models, while also maintaining instruction-following accuracy and enhancing world knowledge application.

Recent advances in deep learning address this challenge by representing MILP instances as variable-constraint bipartite graphs and applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to extract latent structural patterns and enhance solver efficiency. However, this architecture is inherently limited by the local-oriented mechanism, leading to restricted representation power and hindering neural approaches for MILP. Here we present an attention-driven neural architecture that learns expressive representations beyond the pure graph view. A dual-attention mechanism is designed to perform parallel self- and cross-attention over variables and constraints, enabling global information exchange and deeper representation learning.

We evaluate information extraction methods on BioPIE, and implement a QA system that leverages BioPIE, showcasing performance gains on test, HID, and MSR question sets, showing that the structured experimental knowledge in BioPIE underpins both AI-assisted and more autonomous biomedical experimentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "BioPIE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86QA\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9ad8\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Biomedical Protocol Information Extraction Dataset (BioPIE)\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4ee5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5b9e\u4f53\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728BioPIE\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2aQA\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u3001\u9ad8\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "BioPIE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8cQA\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u3002"}}

Under review at IJCAI", "summary": "Multi-Agent Systems(MAS) have become a powerful paradigm for building high performance intelligent applications. Within these systems, the router responsible for determining which expert agents should handle a given query plays a crucial role in overall performance. Existing routing strategies generally fall into two categories: performance routing, which balances latency and cost across models of different sizes, and task routing, which assigns queries to domain-specific experts to improve accuracy. In real-world enterprise applications, task routing is more suitable; however, most existing approaches rely on static single-label decisions, which introduce two major limitations: (i) difficulty in seamlessly integrating new agents as business domains expand, and (ii) routing conflicts caused by overlapping agent capabilities, ultimately degrading accuracy and robustness.To address these challenges, we propose TCAndon-Router(TCAR): an adaptive reasoning router for multi-agent collaboration. Unlike traditional routers, TCAR supports dynamic agent onboarding and first generates a natural-language reasoning chain before predicting a set of candidate agents capable of handling the query. In addition, we design a collaborative execution pipeline in which selected agents independently produce responses, which are then aggregated and refined into a single high-quality response by a dedicated Refining Agent.Experiments on public datasets and real enterprise data demonstrate that TCAR significantly improves routing accuracy, reduces routing conflicts, and remains robust in ambiguous scenarios.

Examples include medical monitoring and control systems, gesture based human computer interaction systems, and autonomous cars. Such systems are intended to operate for a long term potentially for a lifetime in many scenarios such as closed loop blood glucose control for Type 1 diabetics, self-driving cars, and monitoting systems for stroke diagnosis, and rehabilitation. Long term operation of such AI enabled human centric applications can expose them to corner cases for which their operation is may be uncertain. This can be due to many reasons such as inherent flaws in the design, limited resources for testing, inherent computational limitations of the testing methodology, or unknown use cases resulting from human interaction with the system. Such untested corner cases or cases for which the system performance is uncertain can lead to violations in the safety, sustainability, and security requirements of the system. In this paper, we analyze the existing techniques for safety, sustainability, and security analysis of an AI enabled human centric control system and discuss their limitations for testing the system for long term use in practice.

Instead of relying on a pretrained 3DGS scene, we introduce a dense correspondence-guided pre-registration phase that initializes Gaussians with accurate geometry while jointly constructing 3D Context Proposals via cross-view clustering. Each proposal carries a global feature obtained through weighted aggregation of member embeddings, and this feature is fused onto Gaussians during direct registration to maintain per-primitive language coherence across views.

This paper introduces a novel segmentation-driven monocular SfP (SMSfP) framework that reformulates global shape recovery into a set of local reconstructions over adaptively segmented convex sub-regions. Specifically, a polarization-aided adaptive region growing (PARG) segmentation strategy is proposed to decompose the global convexity assumption into locally convex regions, effectively suppressing azimuth ambiguities and preserving surface continuity. Furthermore, a multi-scale fusion convexity prior (MFCP) constraint is developed to ensure local surface consistency and enhance the recovery of fine textural and structural details.

While this design enables autonomy, it also expands the attack surface for backdoor threats. Backdoor triggers injected into specific stages of an agent workflow can persist through multiple intermediate states and adversely influence downstream outputs. However, existing studies remain fragmented and typically analyze individual attack vectors in isolation, leaving the cross-stage interaction and propagation of backdoor triggers poorly understood from an agent-centric perspective. To fill this gap, we propose \\textbf{BackdoorAgent}, a modular and stage-aware framework that provides a unified, agent-centric view of backdoor threats in LLM agents. BackdoorAgent structures the attack surface into three functional stages of agentic workflows, including \\textbf{planning attacks}, \\textbf{memory attacks}, and \\textbf{tool-use attacks}, and instruments agent execution to enable systematic analysis of trigger activation and propagation across different stages.

Recently, some methods begin to address multi-image grounding. However, they are constrained by single-target localization and limited types of practical tasks, due to the lack of unified modeling for generalized grounding tasks. Therefore, we propose GeM-VG, an MLLM capable of Generalized Multi-image Visual Grounding. To support this, we systematically categorize and organize existing multi-image grounding tasks according to their reliance of cross-image cues and reasoning, and introduce the MG-Data-240K dataset, addressing the limitations of existing datasets regarding target quantity and image relation. To tackle the challenges of robustly handling diverse multi-image grounding tasks, we further propose a hybrid reinforcement finetuning strategy that integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and direct answering, considering their complementary strengths. This strategy adopts an R1-like algorithm guided by a carefully designed rule-based reward, effectively enhancing the model's overall perception and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior generalized grounding capabilities of our model. For multi-image grounding, it outperforms the previous leading MLLMs by 2.0% and 9.7% on MIG-Bench and MC-Bench, respectively. In single-image grounding, it achieves a 9.1% improvement over the base model on ODINW.

However, traditional RAG systems consist of three interconnected neural components - the retriever, re-ranker, and generator - whose internal reasoning processes remain opaque. This lack of transparency complicates interpretability, hinders debugging efforts, and erodes trust, especially in high-stakes domains where clear decision-making is essential. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of Neurosymbolic RAG, which integrates symbolic reasoning using a knowledge graph with neural retrieval techniques. This new framework aims to answer two primary questions: (a) Can retrievers provide a clear and interpretable basis for document selection? (b) Can symbolic knowledge enhance the clarity of the retrieval process? We propose three methods to improve this integration. First is MAR (Knowledge Modulation Aligned Retrieval) that employs modulation networks to refine query embeddings using interpretable symbolic features, thereby making document matching more explicit. Second, KG-Path RAG enhances queries by traversing knowledge graphs to improve overall retrieval quality and interpretability. Lastly, Process Knowledge-infused RAG utilizes domain-specific tools to reorder retrieved content based on validated workflows. Preliminary results from mental health risk assessment tasks indicate that this neurosymbolic approach enhances both transparency and overall performance", "AI": {"tldr": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7RAG\u7ed3\u5408\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u3001\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\u3001\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff09\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u8c03\u8bd5\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) MAR\uff08\u77e5\u8bc6\u8c03\u5236\u5bf9\u9f50\u68c0\u7d22\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8c03\u5236\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u7279\u5f81\u4f18\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b2) KG-Path RAG\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u904d\u5386\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u589e\u5f3a\u67e5\u8be2\uff1b3) \u8fc7\u7a0b\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165RAG\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u5de5\u5177\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u68c0\u7d22\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7RAG\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u68c0\u7d22\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

We propose a scalable framework for counterfactual video generation that synthesizes videos differing only in actions or temporal structure while preserving scene context. Our pipeline combines multimodal LLMs for action proposal and editing guidance with diffusion-based image and video models to generate semantic hard negatives at scale. Using this framework, we build CounterVid, a synthetic dataset of ~26k preference pairs targeting action recognition and temporal reasoning. We further introduce MixDPO, a unified Direct Preference Optimization approach that jointly leverages textual and visual preferences.

Most existing studies in multimodal retrieval focus on capturing information in multimodal data that is similar to their paired texts, but often ignores the complementary information contained in multimodal data. In this study, we propose CIEA, a novel multimodal retrieval approach that employs Complementary Information Extraction and Alignment, which transforms both text and images in documents into a unified latent space and features a complementary information extractor designed to identify and preserve differences in the image representations. We optimize CIEA using two complementary contrastive losses to ensure semantic integrity and effectively capture the complementary information contained in images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CIEA, which achieves significant improvements over both divide-and-conquer models and universal dense retrieval models. We provide an ablation study, further discussions, and case studies to highlight the advancements achieved by CIEA.

However, accurately estimating depth from 2D images continues to be a persistent and fundamental challenge in the field of 3D recovery. Heuristic approaches involve with the ill-posed problem for inferring the spatial variant defocusing blur, as the desired blur cannot be distinguished from the inherent blur. Given a prior knowledge of the defocus model, the problem become well-posed with an analytic solution for the relative blur between two images, taken at the same viewpoint with different camera settings for the focus. The Gaussian model stands out as an optimal choice for real-time applications, due to its mathematical simplicity and computational efficiency. And theoretically, it is the only model can be applied at the same time to both the absolute blur caused by depth in a single image and the relative blur resulting from depth differences between two images. This paper introduces the settings, for conventional imaging devices, to ensure that the defocusing operator adheres to the Gaussian model. Defocus analysis begins within the framework of geometric optics and is conducted by defocus aberration theory in diffraction-limited optics to obtain the accuracy of fitting the actual model to its Gaussian approximation. The results for a typical set of focused depths between $1$ and $100$ meters, with a maximum depth variation of $10\\%$ at the focused depth, confirm the Gaussian model's applicability for defocus operators in most imaging devices. The findings demonstrate a maximum Mean Absolute Error $(\\!M\\!A\\!E)$ of less than $1\\%$, underscoring the model's accuracy and reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u884d\u5c04\u5149\u5b66\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9ad8\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6210\u50cf\u8bbe\u5907\u6563\u7126\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u8bef\u5dee\u5c0f\u4e8e1%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6563\u7126\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e09\u5341\u5e74\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u4ece2D\u56fe\u50cf\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u6df1\u5ea6\u4ecd\u662f3D\u6062\u590d\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u6311\u6218\u3002\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6563\u7126\u6a21\u7cca\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u4e0d\u9002\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u5148\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u5149\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u6563\u7126\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u884d\u5c04\u9650\u5236\u5149\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u6563\u7126\u50cf\u5dee\u7406\u8bba\u6765\u62df\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5176\u9ad8\u65af\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5178\u578b\u7684\u805a\u7126\u6df1\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\uff081\u81f3100\u7c73\uff09\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u6df1\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u4e3a\u805a\u7126\u6df1\u5ea6\u768410%\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u9ad8\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6210\u50cf\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u6563\u7126\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u9ad8\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6210\u50cf\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6563\u7126\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u6700\u5927\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u5c0f\u4e8e1%\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

We show that our best model is capable of playing a variety of 3D video games at a level competitive with human play. We use this recipe to systematically examine the scaling laws of behavior cloning to understand how the model's performance and causal reasoning varies with model and data scale. We first show in a simple toy problem that, for some types of causal reasoning, increasing both the amount of training data and the depth of the network results in the model learning a more causal policy.

Image translation has recently gained attention as a strategy to address these limitations. Although Pix2Pix has been widely applied in medical image translation, its potential has not been fully explored. In this study, we propose an enhanced Pix2Pix framework that integrates Squeeze-and-Excitation Residual Networks (SEResNet) and U-Net++ to improve image generation quality and structural fidelity. SEResNet strengthens critical feature representation through channel attention, while U-Net++ enhances multi-scale feature fusion.

Since Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) provide generic priors, several studies have explored their potential as domain-agnostic zero-shot inverse solvers. Despite these efforts, existing latent diffusion inverse solvers suffer from their instability, exhibiting undesirable artifacts and degraded quality. In this work, we first identify the instability as a discrepancy between the solver's and true reverse diffusion dynamics, and show that reducing this gap stabilizes the solver. Building on this, we introduce Measurement-Consistent Langevin Corrector (MCLC), a theoretically grounded plug-and-play correction module that remedies the LDM-based inverse solvers through measurement-consistent Langevin updates. Compared to prior approaches that rely on linear manifold assumptions, which often do not hold in latent space, MCLC operates without this assumption, leading to more stable and reliable behavior. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of MCLC and its compatibility with existing solvers across diverse image restoration tasks. Additionally, we analyze blob artifacts and offer insights into their underlying causes. We highlight that MCLC is a key step toward more robust zero-shot inverse problem solvers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMCLC\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u53cd\u5411\u6269\u6563\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eLDM\u7684\u9006\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u9006\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6e90\u4e8e\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u53cd\u5411\u6269\u6563\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Measurement-Consistent Langevin Corrector (MCLC)\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6821\u6b63\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e00\u81f4\u7684Langevin\u66f4\u65b0\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u57fa\u4e8eLDM\u7684\u9006\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eMCLC\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86blob\u4f2a\u5f71\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "conclusion": "MCLC\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002"}}

This research examines how human cognition and machine learning models work together to distinguish phishing emails from legitimate ones. We employed three interpretable algorithms Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests training them on both TF-IDF features and semantic embeddings, then compared their predictions against human evaluations that captured confidence ratings and linguistic observations. Our results show that machine learning models provide good accuracy rates, but their confidence levels vary significantly. Human evaluators, on the other hand, use a greater variety of language signs and retain more consistent confidence. We also found that while language proficiency has minimal effect on detection performance, aging does. These findings offer helpful direction for creating transparent AI systems that complement human cognitive functions, ultimately improving human-AI cooperation in challenging content analysis tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u9493\u9c7c\u90ae\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u4f46\u4fe1\u5fc3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5219\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002\u5e74\u9f84\u5f71\u54cd\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc6\u522b\u9493\u9c7c\u90ae\u4ef6\u7b49\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u4fe1\u5fc3\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5206\u6790\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u9493\u9c7c\u90ae\u4ef6\u548c\u5408\u6cd5\u90ae\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u548c\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5728TF-IDF\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4fe1\u5fc3\u8bc4\u7ea7\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u89c2\u5bdf\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4fe1\u5fc3\u6c34\u5e73\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u5219\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u66f4\u591a\u6837\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4fe1\u5fc3\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\u5bf9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5c0f\uff0c\u800c\u5e74\u9f84\u5219\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u521b\u5efa\u900f\u660e\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u76ca\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u8865\u5145\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6539\u5584\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u3002"}}

While detector-based approaches typically achieve strong frame-level accuracy, they often suffer from temporal inconsistencies caused by frequent detection dropouts. Despite its practical relevance, research on RGB-based drone tracking is still limited and largely reliant on conventional motion models. Meanwhile, foundation models like SAMURAI have established their effectiveness across other domains, exhibiting strong category-agnostic tracking performance. However, their applicability in drone-specific scenarios has not been investigated yet. Motivated by this gap, we present the first systematic evaluation of SAMURAI's potential for robust drone tracking in urban surveillance settings. Furthermore, we introduce a detector-augmented extension of SAMURAI to mitigate sensitivity to bounding-box initialization and sequence length. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed extension significantly improves robustness in complex urban environments, with pronounced benefits in long-duration sequences - especially under drone exit-re-entry events. The incorporation of detector cues yields consistent gains over SAMURAI's zero-shot performance across datasets and metrics, with success rate improvements of up to +0.393 and FNR reductions of up to -0.475.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86SAMURAI\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u589e\u5f3a\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9274\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u6f5c\u529b\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u7814\u7a76RGB\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578bSAMURAI\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u589e\u5f3a\u7684SAMURAI\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eSAMURAI\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe+0.393\uff0c\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe-0.475\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eSAMURAI\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u589e\u5f3a\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u590d\u6742\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u671f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u9000\u51fa\u518d\u8fdb\u5165\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

While these approaches can raise aggregate scores, they often yield unstable and hard-to-audit improvement trajectories, making it difficult to guarantee non-regression or to reason about failures across versions. We reframe agent improvement as \\textbf{release engineering}: agents are treated as shippable artifacts, and improvement is externalized into a regression-aware release pipeline. We introduce \\textbf{AgentDevel}, a release engineering pipeline that iteratively runs the current agent, produces implementation-blind, symptom-level quality signals from execution traces, synthesizes a single release candidate (RC) via executable diagnosis, and promotes it under flip-centered gating. AgentDevel features three core designs: (i) an implementation-blind LLM critic that characterizes failure appearances without accessing agent internals, (ii) script-based executable diagnosis that aggregates dominant symptom patterns and produces auditable engineering specifications, and (iii) flip-centered gating that prioritizes pass to fail regressions and fail to pass fixes as first-class evidence. Unlike population-based search or in-agent self-refinement, AgentDevel maintains a single canonical version line and emphasizes non-regression as a primary objective. Experiments on execution-heavy benchmarks demonstrate that AgentDevel yields stable improvements with significantly fewer regressions while producing reproducible, auditable artifacts.

This paper demonstrates the value of LLMs in psychological measurement by (1) compiling the first large-scale dataset of election rumors on a niche alt-tech platform, (2) developing a multistage Rumor Detection Agent that leverages LLMs for high-precision content classification, and (3) quantifying the psychological dynamics of rumor propagation, specifically the \"illusory truth effect\" in a naturalistic setting. The Rumor Detection Agent combines (i) a synthetic data-augmented, fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier, (ii) precision keyword filtering, and (iii) a two-pass LLM verification pipeline using GPT-4o mini. The findings reveal that sharing probability rises steadily with each additional exposure, providing large-scale empirical evidence for dose-response belief reinforcement in ideologically homogeneous networks. Simulation results further demonstrate rapid contagion effects: nearly one quarter of users become \"infected\" within just four propagation iterations.

However, most existing content-based video retrieval benchmarks focus on scene-level similarity and do not evaluate the action discrimination required in surveillance. To address this gap, we introduce SOVABench (Surveillance Opposite Vehicle Actions Benchmark), a real-world retrieval benchmark built from surveillance footage and centered on vehicle-related actions. SOVABench defines two evaluation protocols (inter-pair and intra-pair) to assess cross-action discrimination and temporal direction understanding. Although action distinctions are generally intuitive for human observers, our experiments show that they remain challenging for state-of-the-art vision and multimodal models.\n  Leveraging the visual reasoning and instruction-following capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we present a training-free framework for producing interpretable embeddings from MLLM-generated descriptions for both images and videos.

Estimating when a document was written and tracing the development of scripts and writing styles can be aided by identifying the individual scribes who contributed to a medieval manuscript. Although digital technologies have made significant progress in this field, the general problem remains unsolved and continues to pose open challenges. ... We previously proposed an approach focused on identifying specific letters or abbreviations that characterize each writer. In that study, we considered the letter \"a\", as it was widely present on all pages of text and highly distinctive, according to the suggestions of expert paleographers. We used template matching techniques to detect the occurrences of the character \"a\" on each page and the convolutional neural network (CNN) to attribute each instance to the correct scribe. Moving from the interesting results achieved from this previous system and being aware of the limitations of the template matching technique, which requires an appropriate threshold to work, we decided to experiment in the same framework with the use of the YOLO object detection model to identify the scribe who contributed to the writing of different medieval books. We considered the fifth version of YOLO to implement the YOLO object detection model, which completely substituted the template matching and CNN used in the previous work. The experimental results demonstrate that YOLO effectively extracts a greater number of letters considered, leading to a more accurate second-stage classification. Furthermore, the YOLO confidence score provides a foundation for developing a system that applies a rejection threshold, enabling reliable writer identification even in unseen manuscripts.", "AI": {"tldr": "YOLOv5\u5728\u4e2d\u4e16\u7eaa\u624b\u7a3f\u7b14\u8ff9\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b57\u6bcd\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u53e4\u6587\u4e66\u7b14\u8ff9\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528YOLOv5\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u6a21\u677f\u5339\u914d\u548cCNN\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u4e16\u7eaa\u624b\u7a3f\u4e2d\u7684\u7b14\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "YOLO\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u63d0\u53d6\u66f4\u591a\u5b57\u6bcd\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5176\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u8fd8\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u62d2\u7edd\u9608\u503c\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f7f\u7528YOLO\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53e4\u6587\u4e66\u7b14\u8ff9\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u677f\u5339\u914d\u548cCNN\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u63d0\u53d6\u5b57\u6bcd\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Isabellm works with any local LLM on Ollama and APIs such as Gemini CLI, and it is designed to run on consumer grade computers. The system combines a stepwise prover, which uses large language models to propose proof commands validated by Isabelle in a bounded search loop, with a higher-level proof planner that generates structured Isar outlines and attempts to fill and repair remaining gaps. The framework includes beam search for tactics, tactics reranker ML and RL models, premise selection with small transformer models, micro-RAG for Isar proofs built from AFP, and counter-example guided proof repair. All the code is implemented by GPT 4.1 - 5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5. Empirically, Isabellm can prove certain lemmas that defeat Isabelle's standard automation, including Sledgehammer, demonstrating the practical value of LLM-guided proof search. At the same time, we find that even state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT 5.2 Extended Thinking and Gemini 3 Pro struggle to reliably implement the intended fill-and-repair mechanisms with complex algorithmic designs, highlighting fundamental challenges in LLM code generation and reasoning.

We introduce DivAS (Depth-interactive Voxel Aggregation Segmentation), an optimization-free, fully interactive framework that addresses these limitations. Our method operates via a fast GUI-based workflow where 2D SAM masks, generated from user point prompts, are refined using NeRF-derived depth priors to improve geometric accuracy and foreground-background separation. The core of our contribution is a custom CUDA kernel that aggregates these refined multi-view masks into a unified 3D voxel grid in under 200ms, enabling real-time visual feedback. This optimization-free design eliminates the need for per-scene training. Experiments on Mip-NeRF 360\u00b0 and LLFF show that DivAS achieves segmentation quality comparable to optimization-based methods, while being 2-2.5x faster end-to-end, and up to an order of magnitude faster when excluding user prompting time.", "AI": {"tldr": "DivAS \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f NeRF \u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408 2D SAM \u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7684 NeRF \u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u4e14\u727a\u7272\u4e86 2D \u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5feb\u901f GUI \u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528 2D SAM \u63a9\u7801\u548c NeRF \u6df1\u5ea6\u5148\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49 CUDA \u5185\u6838\u5c06\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u63a9\u7801\u805a\u5408\u4e3a 3D \u4f53\u7d20\u7f51\u683c\u3002", "result": "\u5728 Mip-NeRF 360\u00b0 \u548c LLFF \u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDivAS \u7684\u5206\u5272\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86 2-2.5 \u500d\uff0c\u6392\u9664\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u793a\u65f6\u95f4\u540e\u751a\u81f3\u5feb\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "DivAS \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u3001\u5b8c\u5168\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5272\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u901f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

To address these issues, we propose InstruCoT, a model enhancement method for PI defense that synthesizes diverse training data and employs instruction-level chain-of-thought fine-tuning, enabling LLMs to effectively identify and reject malicious instructions regardless of their source or position in the context.

In this work, we present an industrial GenAI framework that processes over 200,000 PDFs, 25,326 videos across eight formats (e.g., MP4, M4V, etc.), and 888 multilingual audio files in more than 20 languages.

Results show 3-8 times efficiency gains with SDPA attention on commodity GPUs, multimodality improving up to 8/12 task domains (especially length-dependent tasks), and clear bottlenecks in temporal alignment and keyframe detection across open- and closed-source VLMs. Rather than proposing a new \"A+B\" model, this paper characterizes practical limits, trade-offs, and failure patterns of current VLMs under realistic deployment constraints, and provide actionable guidance for both researchers and practitioners designing scalable multimodal systems for long-form video understanding in industrial domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86VLMs\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u957f\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728GPU\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6210\u672c\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76VLMs\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7GenAI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc7200,000\u4e2aPDF\u300125,326\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u548c888\u4e2a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u97f3\u9891\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf940\u591a\u4e2aVLMs\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u9886\u5148\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cSDPA\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u5546\u54c1GPU\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e863-8\u500d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57288/12\u4efb\u52a1\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u957f\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u9650\u5236\u3001\u6743\u8861\u548c\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Traditional quantifier instantiation methods struggle because they lack semantic understanding of UF constraints, forcing them to search through unbounded solution spaces with limited guidance. We present AquaForte, a framework that leverages Large Language Models to provide semantic guidance for UF instantiation by generating instantiated candidates for function definitions that satisfy the constraints, thereby significantly reducing the search space and complexity for solvers. Our approach preprocesses formulas through constraint separation, uses structured prompts to extract mathematical reasoning from LLMs, and integrates the results with traditional SMT algorithms through adaptive instantiation. AquaForte maintains soundness through systematic validation: LLM-guided instantiations yielding SAT solve the original problem, while UNSAT results generate exclusion clauses for iterative refinement.

However, MAS are typically distributed across different devices or environments, making them vulnerable to perturbations such as agent failures. While existing works have studied the adversarial attacks and corresponding defense strategies, they mainly focus on reactively detecting and mitigating attacks after they occur rather than proactively designing inherently resilient systems. In this work, we study the resilience of LLM-based MAS under perturbations and find that both the communication topology and prompt design significantly influence system resilience. Motivated by these findings, we propose ResMAS: a two-stage framework for enhancing MAS resilience. First, we train a reward model to predict the MAS's resilience, based on which we train a topology generator to automatically design resilient topology for specific tasks through reinforcement learning. Second, we introduce a topology-aware prompt optimization method that refines each agent's prompt based on its connections and interactions with other agents. Extensive experiments across a range of tasks show that our approach substantially improves MAS resilience under various constraints.

However, it remains unclear whether these metrics truly prioritize semantic correctness or instead favor visually and socially prototypical images learned from biased data distributions. We identify and study \\emph{prototypicality bias} as a systematic failure mode in multimodal evaluation. We introduce a controlled contrastive benchmark \\textsc{\\textbf{ProtoBias}} (\\textit{\\textbf{Proto}typical \\textbf{Bias}}), spanning Animals, Objects, and Demography images, where semantically correct but non-prototypical images are paired with subtly incorrect yet prototypical adversarial counterparts. This setup enables a directional evaluation of whether metrics follow textual semantics or default to prototypes. Our results show that widely used metrics, including CLIPScore, PickScore, and VQA-based scores, frequently misrank these pairs, while even LLM-as-Judge systems exhibit uneven robustness in socially grounded cases. Human evaluations consistently favour semantic correctness with larger decision margins. Motivated by these findings, we propose \\textbf{\\textsc{ProtoScore}}, a robust 7B-parameter metric that substantially reduces failure rates and suppresses misranking, while running at orders of magnitude faster than the inference time of GPT-5, approaching the robustness of much larger closed-source judges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u539f\u578b\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faProtoBias\u57fa\u51c6\u548cProtoScore\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u8bed\u4e49\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4ece\u6709\u504f\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u539f\u578b\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u63a7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u57fa\u51c6ProtoBias\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u52a8\u7269\u3001\u7269\u4f53\u548c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u914d\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u6b63\u786e\u4f46\u975e\u5178\u578b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u8f7b\u5fae\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u4f46\u5178\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u6807\u662f\u5426\u9075\u5faa\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u6216\u9ed8\u8ba4\u539f\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5305\u62ecCLIPScore\u3001PickScore\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eVQA\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u5728\u5185\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u6307\u6807\u7ecf\u5e38\u9519\u8bef\u6392\u5e8f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u914d\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u800c\u5373\u4f7f\u662fLLM-as-Judge\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u57fa\u7840\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5219\u59cb\u7ec8\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u66f4\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807ProtoScore\uff0c\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5904\u7406\u975e\u5178\u578b\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing approaches have achieved notable advancements in SITS segmentation with predetermined sequence lengths. However, we found that these approaches overlooked the generalization capability of models across scenarios with varying temporal length, leading to markedly poor segmentation results in such cases. To address this issue, we propose TEA, a TEmporal Adaptive SITS semantic segmentation method to enhance the model's resilience under varying sequence lengths. We introduce a teacher model that encapsulates the global sequence knowledge to guide a student model with adaptive temporal input lengths. Specifically, teacher shapes the student's feature space via intermediate embedding, prototypes and soft label perspectives to realize knowledge transfer, while dynamically aggregating student model to mitigate knowledge forgetting. Finally, we introduce full-sequence reconstruction as an auxiliary task to further enhance the quality of representations across inputs of varying temporal lengths. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method brings remarkable improvements across inputs of different temporal lengths on common benchmarks.

This study proposes a method that combines a large language model (LLM) and a knowledge graph. First, a fine-tuned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model is used to perform entity recognition and relationship extraction on multi-source heterogeneous texts, and GPT-4 is used to generate semantically enhanced vector representations; secondly, a two-layer graph neural network (GNN) architecture is designed to fuse the semantic vectors output by LLM with business metadata to construct a dynamic and scalable enterprise knowledge graph; then reinforcement learning is introduced to optimize decision path generation, and the reward function is used to drive the mechanism iteration. In the case of the manufacturing industry, this mechanism reduced the response time for equipment failure scenarios from 7.8 hours to 3.7 hours, the F1 value reached 94.3%, and the compensation for decision errors in the annual digital transformation cost decreased by 45.3%. This method significantly enhances the intelligence level and execution efficiency of the digital transformation driving mechanism by integrating large model semantic understanding with structured knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7BERT\u548cGPT-4\u5904\u7406\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8f6c\u578b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u7f3a\u4e4f\u667a\u80fd\u51b3\u7b56\u4f9d\u636e\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7684BERT\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6e90\u5f02\u6784\u6587\u672c\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u62bd\u53d6\uff0cGPT-4\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u5c42\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u878d\u5408LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5411\u91cf\u4e0e\u4e1a\u52a1\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u5f15\u5165\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u8def\u5f84\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u8fed\u4ee3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u8bbe\u5907\u6545\u969c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece7.8\u5c0f\u65f6\u7f29\u77ed\u81f33.7\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0cF1\u503c\u8fbe\u523094.3%\uff0c\u5e74\u5ea6\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8f6c\u578b\u6210\u672c\u4e2d\u51b3\u7b56\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u8865\u507f\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8645.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8f6c\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Conventional 3D methods detect lanes from dense birds-eye-viewed (BEV) features, though erroneous transformations often result in a poor feature representation misaligned with the true 3D road surface. While recent sparse lane detectors have surpassed dense BEV approaches, they completely disregard valuable lane-specific priors. Furthermore, existing methods fail to utilize historic lane observations, which yield the potential to resolve ambiguities in situations of poor visibility. To address these challenges, we present SparseLaneSTP, a novel method that integrates both geometric properties of the lane structure and temporal information into a sparse lane transformer. It introduces a new lane-specific spatio-temporal attention mechanism, a continuous lane representation tailored for sparse architectures as well as temporal regularization. Identifying weaknesses of existing 3D lane datasets, we also introduce a precise and consistent 3D lane dataset using a simple yet effective auto-labeling strategy.

To address these challenges, we propose TourPlanner, a comprehensive framework featuring multi-path reasoning and constraint-gated reinforcement learning.

Subsequently, we propose Competitive consensus Chain-of-Thought (CCoT), a multi-path reasoning paradigm that improves the ability of exploring the feasible solution space. To further refine the plan, we integrate a sigmoid-based gating mechanism into the reinforcement learning stage, which dynamically prioritizes soft-constraint satisfaction only after hard constraints are met.

To overcome multi-view inconsistencies caused by underwater optical degradation, our method enforces trinocular view consistency by rendering horizontally and vertically translated camera views relative to each input view and aligning them via inverse warping. Furthermore, these translated camera views are used to derive a synthetic epipolar depth prior through triangulation, which serves as a self-supervised depth regularizer. These geometric constraints facilitate the spatial optimization of 3D Gaussians and preserve scene structure in underwater environments. We also propose a depth-aware alpha adjustment that modulates the opacity of 3D Gaussians during early training based on their $z$-component and viewing direction, deterring the formation of medium-induced primitives. With our contributions, 3D Gaussians are disentangled from the scattering medium, enabling robust representation of object geometry and significantly reducing floating artifacts in reconstructed underwater scenes.

However, prevailing systems rely on monolithic agents that suffer from structural bottlenecks, including unconstrained reasoning outputs that inflate trajectories, sparse outcome-level rewards that complicate credit assignment, and stochastic search noise that destabilizes learning. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{M-ASK} (Multi-Agent Search and Knowledge), a framework that explicitly decouples agentic search into two complementary roles: Search Behavior Agents, which plan and execute search actions, and Knowledge Management Agents, which aggregate, filter, and maintain a compact internal context. This decomposition allows each agent to focus on a well-defined subtask and reduces interference between search and context construction. Furthermore, to enable stable coordination, M-ASK employs turn-level rewards to provide granular supervision for both search decisions and knowledge updates. Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that M-ASK outperforms strong baselines, achieving not only superior answer accuracy but also significantly more stable training dynamics.\\footnote{The source code for M-ASK is available at https://github.com/chenyiqun/M-ASK.}", "AI": {"tldr": "M-ASK\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u4ee3\u7406\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u8f6e\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u4e00\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u63a8\u7406\u8f93\u51fa\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u7ed3\u679c\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u968f\u673a\u641c\u7d22\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faM-ASK\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4ee3\u7406\u641c\u7d22\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u641c\u7d22\u884c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ba1\u7406\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8f6e\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u8df3QA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cM-ASK\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "M-ASK\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u641c\u7d22\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ba1\u7406\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

This idiom describes the enduring circular training of adversarial attack patterns and adversarial training the best. The following work investigates the impact of higher-order adversarial attacks on object detectors by successively training attack patterns and hardening object detectors with adversarial training. The YOLOv10 object detector is chosen as a representative, and adversarial patches are used in an evasion attack manner. Our results indicate that higher-order adversarial patches are not only affecting the object detector directly trained on but rather provide a stronger generalization capacity compared to lower-order adversarial patches. Moreover, the results highlight that solely adversarial training is not sufficient to harden an object detector efficiently against this kind of adversarial attack.

While large language models demonstrate remarkable capabilities in textual reasoning, their discrete token-based architecture creates fundamental incompatibilities with continuous numerical sequences exhibiting temporal dependencies. Current methodologies inadequately address this modality mismatch, constraining the potential of language model-driven automation in incident management workflows. This paper presents a multimodal diagnostic framework that harmonizes time-series representations with pretrained language model embedding spaces. Our approach contributes three technical advances: (1) a semantic compression technique that distills temporal segments into single-token abstractions while preserving pattern semantics, (2) an alignment encoder utilizing gated cross-attention to project time-series features into language model latent space, and (3) a retrieval-augmented diagnostic pipeline that synthesizes aligned embeddings with historical incident knowledge for expert-level failure attribution. Comprehensive evaluation across six cloud system benchmarks demonstrates that our framework achieves leading performance, reaching 48.75% diagnostic accuracy with notable improvements on scenarios involving compound failure modes.

Using PolyFit, the surfaces can be efficiently deformed by updating a compact set of jet coefficients rather than optimizing per-vertex degrees of freedom for many downstream tasks in computer vision and graphics. We demonstrate the capabilities of our proposed methodologies with two applications: 1) Shape-from-template (SfT): where the goal is to deform the input 3D template of an object as seen in image/video.

However, existing methods suffer from unstructured reasoning, poor generalization, and misalignment with human driving intent. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances decision transparency, conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) fails to fully exploit its potential, and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches face instability and suboptimal reasoning depth. We propose ThinkDrive, a CoT guided progressive RL fine-tuning framework for autonomous driving that synergizes explicit reasoning with difficulty-aware adaptive policy optimization. Our method employs a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform SFT using CoT explanations.

Traditional manual annotation of heterogeneous data modalities (text, images, video, audio, and web links), is prone to inconsistencies, quality degradation, and inefficiencies in content utilization. The sheer volume of long video and audio data further exacerbates these challenges, (e.g. long clinical trial interviews and educational seminars).\n  Here, we introduce a domain adapted Video to Video Clip Generation framework that integrates Audio Language Models (ALMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) to produce highlight clips. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a reproducible Cut & Merge algorithm with fade in/out and timestamp normalization, ensuring smooth transitions and audio/visual alignment; (ii) a personalization mechanism based on role definition and prompt injection for tailored outputs (marketing, training, regulatory); (iii) a cost efficient e2e pipeline strategy balancing ALM/VLM enhanced processing. Evaluations on Video MME benchmark (900) and our proprietary dataset of 16,159 pharmacy videos across 14 disease areas demonstrate 3 to 4 times speedup, 4 times cost reduction, and competitive clip quality. Beyond efficiency gains, we also report our methods improved clip coherence scores (0.348) and informativeness scores (0.721) over state of the art VLM baselines (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro), highlighting the potential of transparent, custom extractive, and compliance supporting video summarization for life sciences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408ALM\u548cVLM\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7247\u6bb5\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u3001\u6210\u672c\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u547d\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6458\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f4e\u6548\u3001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u91cf\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u97f3\u9891\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u97f3\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08ALMs\uff09\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684Cut & Merge\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7ba1\u9053\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728Video MME\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e863\u81f34\u500d\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u30014\u500d\u7684\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u7247\u6bb5\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u53ca\u63d0\u5347\u7247\u6bb5\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u751f\u547d\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u900f\u660e\u3001\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u652f\u6301\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u3002"}}

To effectively scale to long-horizon scenarios, a key capability for such agents is a memory mechanism that can retain, organize, and retrieve past experiences to support downstream decision-making. However, most existing approaches organize and store memories in a flat manner and rely on simple similarity-based retrieval techniques. Even when structured memory is introduced, existing methods often struggle to explicitly capture the logical relationships among experiences or memory units. Moreover, memory access is largely detached from the constructed structure and still depends on shallow semantic retrieval, preventing agents from reasoning logically over long-horizon dependencies. In this work, we propose CompassMem, an event-centric memory framework inspired by Event Segmentation Theory. CompassMem organizes memory as an Event Graph by incrementally segmenting experiences into events and linking them through explicit logical relations. This graph serves as a logic map, enabling agents to perform structured and goal-directed navigation over memory beyond superficial retrieval, progressively gathering valuable memories to support long-horizon reasoning. Experiments on LoCoMo and NarrativeQA demonstrate that CompassMem consistently improves both retrieval and reasoning performance across multiple backbone models.", "AI": {"tldr": "CompassMem\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8b\u4ef6\u56fe\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u6355\u6349\u903b\u8f91\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u671f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u903b\u8f91\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u6355\u6349\uff0c\u4e14\u68c0\u7d22\u4f9d\u8d56\u6d45\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u957f\u671f\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCompassMem\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e3a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u91cf\u5f0f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5206\u5272\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u5173\u7cfb\u94fe\u63a5\u3002", "result": "\u5728LoCoMo\u548cNarrativeQA\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCompassMem\u5728\u591a\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "CompassMem\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u56fe\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u903b\u8f91\u5173\u7cfb\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this work we tackle this bottleneck by leveraging temporal-geometric consistency across LiDAR sweeps to lift and fuse cues from text and 2D vision foundation models directly into 3D, without any manual input. We introduce an unsupervised multi-modal pseudo-labeling method relying on strong geometric priors learned from temporally accumulated LiDAR maps, alongside with a novel iterative update rule that enforces joint geometric-semantic consistency, and vice-versa detecting moving objects from inconsistencies.

Existing works encode cameras as Pl\u00fccker ray maps, which tie predictions to the arbitrary world coordinate gauge and make them sensitive to small camera transformations, thereby undermining geometric consistency. In this paper, we ask what inputs best condition a model for robust and consistent view synthesis. We propose projective conditioning, which replaces raw camera parameters with a target-view projective cue that provides a stable 2D input. This reframes the task from a brittle geometric regression problem in ray space to a well-conditioned target-view image-to-image translation problem. Additionally, we introduce a masked autoencoding pretraining strategy tailored to this cue, enabling the use of large-scale uncalibrated data for pretraining.

These systems are compounded by specialized agents, which collaborate through explicit communication, but incur substantial computational overhead. A natural question arises: can we achieve similar modularity benefits with a single agent that selects from a library of skills? We explore this question by viewing skills as internalized agent behaviors. From this perspective, a multi-agent system can be compiled into an equivalent single-agent system, trading inter-agent communication for skill selection. Our preliminary experiments suggest this approach can substantially reduce token usage and latency while maintaining competitive accuracy on reasoning benchmarks. However, this efficiency raises a deeper question that has received little attention: how does skill selection scale as libraries grow?\n  Drawing on principles from cognitive science, we propose that LLM skill selection exhibits bounded capacity analogous to human decision-making. We investigate the scaling behavior of skill selection and observe a striking pattern. Rather than degrading gradually, selection accuracy remains stable up to a critical library size, then drops sharply, indicating a phase transition reminiscent of capacity limits in human cognition. Furthermore, we find evidence that semantic confusability among similar skills, rather than library size alone, plays a central role in this degradation. This perspective suggests that hierarchical organization, which has long helped humans manage complex choices, may similarly benefit AI systems. Our initial results with hierarchical routing support this hypothesis. This work opens new questions about the fundamental limits of semantic-based skill selection in LLMs and offers a cognitive-grounded framework and practical guidelines for designing scalable skill-based agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6280\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5b58\u5728\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u6df7\u6dc6\u662f\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5206\u5c42\u7ec4\u7ec7\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9009\u62e9\u6280\u80fd\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f16\u8bd1\u4e3a\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6280\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u66ff\u4ee3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u539f\u7406\u5206\u6790\u6280\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6280\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u5728\u5e93\u5927\u5c0f\u8fbe\u5230\u4e34\u754c\u503c\u524d\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5448\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u8bed\u4e49\u6df7\u6dc6\u662f\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u4e3b\u56e0\uff0c\u5206\u5c42\u7ec4\u7ec7\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f16\u8bd1\u4e3a\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u6280\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5b58\u5728\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u6df7\u6dc6\u800c\u975e\u5e93\u5927\u5c0f\u662f\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Although recent unified multimodal models exhibit promising understanding capabilities, these strengths often fail to transfer effectively to image generation. We introduce Re-Align, a unified framework that bridges the gap between understanding and generation through structured reasoning-guided alignment. At its core lies the In-Context Chain-of-Thought (IC-CoT), a structured reasoning paradigm that decouples semantic guidance and reference association, providing clear textual target and mitigating confusion among reference images. Furthermore, Re-Align introduces an effective RL training scheme that leverages a surrogate reward to measure the alignment between structured reasoning text and the generated image, thereby improving the model's overall performance on ICGE tasks.

In most environments, information is distributed across isolated files like reports and logs that lack explicit links. Standard search engines process files independently, ignoring the connections between them. Furthermore, manually building Knowledge Graphs is impractical for such vast data. To bridge this gap, we present Orion-RAG. Our core insight is simple yet effective: we do not need heavy algorithms to organize this data. Instead, we use a low-complexity strategy to extract lightweight paths that naturally link related concepts. We demonstrate that this streamlined approach suffices to transform fragmented documents into semi-structured data, enabling the system to link information across different files effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Orion-RAG consistently outperforms mainstream frameworks across diverse domains, supporting real-time updates and explicit Human-in-the-Loop verification with high cost-efficiency.

Agentic Reinforcement Learning has recently drawn significant research attention as a critical post-training paradigm to further refine these capabilities.

AT$^2$PO introduces a turn-level tree structure that jointly enables Entropy-Guided Tree Expansion for strategic exploration and Turn-wise Credit Assignment for fine-grained reward propagation from sparse outcomes. Complementing this, we propose Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization, a turn-level learning objective that aligns policy updates with the natural decision granularity of agentic interactions. ATPO is orthogonal to tree search and can be readily integrated into any multi-turn RL pipeline.

To bridge this gap, we introduce VerseCrafter, a 4D-aware video world model that enables explicit and coherent control over both camera and object dynamics within a unified 4D geometric world state. Our approach is centered on a novel 4D Geometric Control representation, which encodes the world state through a static background point cloud and per-object 3D Gaussian trajectories. This representation captures not only an object's path but also its probabilistic 3D occupancy over time, offering a flexible, category-agnostic alternative to rigid bounding boxes or parametric models. These 4D controls are rendered into conditioning signals for a pretrained video diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-fidelity, view-consistent videos that precisely adhere to the specified dynamics.

Existing benchmarks exhibit a critical blind spot: general instruction-following metrics focus on superficial formatting, while domain-specific scientific benchmarks assess only final-answer correctness, often rewarding models that arrive at the right result with the wrong reasons. To address this gap, we introduce scientific instruction following: the capability to solve problems while strictly adhering to the constraints that establish scientific validity. Specifically, we introduce SciIF, a multi-discipline benchmark that evaluates this capability by pairing university-level problems with a fixed catalog of constraints across three pillars: scientific conditions (e.g., boundary checks and assumptions), semantic stability (e.g., unit and symbol conventions), and specific processes(e.g., required numerical methods). Uniquely, SciIF emphasizes auditability, requiring models to provide explicit evidence of constraint satisfaction rather than implicit compliance. By measuring both solution correctness and multi-constraint adherence, SciIF enables finegrained diagnosis of compositional reasoning failures, ensuring that LLMs can function as reliable agents within the strict logical frameworks of science.", "AI": {"tldr": "SciIF\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u4e25\u683c\u9075\u5faa\u79d1\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u9886\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u76f2\u70b9\uff0c\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5173\u6ce8\u8868\u9762\u683c\u5f0f\u6216\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u9075\u5faa\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SciIF\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u5b66\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u76ee\u5f55\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e09\u4e2a\u652f\u67f1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "SciIF\u80fd\u591f\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8bca\u65ad\u7ec4\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u903b\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "SciIF\u57fa\u51c6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u8c03\u79d1\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u660e\u786e\u9075\u5b88\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u7ed9\u51fa\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u9075\u5faa\u79d1\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

By embedding adversarial instructions into the results of tool calls, attackers can hijack the agent's decision-making process to execute unauthorized actions. This vulnerability poses a significant risk as agents gain more direct control over physical environments. Existing defense mechanisms against Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) generally fall into two categories. The first involves training dedicated detection models; however, this approach entails high computational overhead for both training and inference, and requires frequent updates to keep pace with evolving attack vectors. Alternatively, prompt-based methods leverage the inherent capabilities of LLMs to detect or ignore malicious instructions via prompt engineering. Despite their flexibility, most current prompt-based defenses suffer from high Attack Success Rates (ASR), demonstrating limited robustness against sophisticated injection attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel method that provides LLMs with precise data via tool result parsing while effectively filtering out injected malicious code.

Speculative Decoding offers a promising avenue for acceleration, but existing approaches are limited by token-level ambiguity and lack of spatial awareness. In this work, we introduce Multi-Scale Local Speculative Decoding (MuLo-SD), a novel framework that combines multi-resolution drafting with spatially informed verification to accelerate AR image generation. Our method leverages a low-resolution drafter paired with learned up-samplers to propose candidate image tokens, which are then verified in parallel by a high-resolution target model. Crucially, we incorporate a local rejection and resampling mechanism, enabling efficient correction of draft errors by focusing on spatial neighborhoods rather than raster-scan resampling after the first rejection. We demonstrate that MuLo-SD achieves substantial speedups - up to $\\mathbf{1.7\\times}$ - outperforming strong speculative decoding baselines such as EAGLE-2 and LANTERN in terms of acceleration, while maintaining comparable semantic alignment and perceptual quality. These results are validated using GenEval, DPG-Bench, and FID/HPSv2 on the MS-COCO 5k validation split. Extensive ablations highlight the impact of up-sampling design, probability pooling, and local rejection and resampling with neighborhood expansion.

However, their performance mainly stems from thinking, a long Chain of Thought (CoT), which significantly increase computational overhead. To address this overthinking problem, existing work focuses on using reinforcement learning (RL) to train hybrid reasoning models that automatically decide whether to engage in thinking or not based on the complexity of the query. Unfortunately, using RL will suffer the the reward hacking problem, e.g., the model engages in thinking but is judged as not doing so, resulting in incorrect rewards. To mitigate this problem, existing works either employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which incurs high computational costs, or enforce uniform token limits on non-thinking responses, which yields limited mitigation of the problem. In this paper, we propose Thinking-Based Non-Thinking (TNT). It does not employ SFT, and sets different maximum token usage for responses not using thinking across various queries by leveraging information from the solution component of the responses using thinking. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that TNT reduces token usage by around 50% compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B/7B and DeepScaleR-1.5B, while significantly improving accuracy. In fact, TNT achieves the optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency among all tested methods.

VLI first performs Attributive Introspection to diagnose hallucination risks via probabilistic conflict detection and localize the causal visual anchors. It then employs Interpretable Bi-Causal Steering to actively modulate the inference process, dynamically isolating visual evidence from background noise while neutralizing blind confidence through adaptive calibration. VLI achieves state-of-the-art performance on advanced models, reducing object hallucination rates by 12.67% on MMHal-Bench and improving accuracy by 5.8% on POPE.", "AI": {"tldr": "VLI\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7269\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u5bfc\u5411\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5185\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u9519\u4f4d\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "VLI\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a\u5c5e\u6027\u5185\u7701\uff08Attributive Introspection\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u8bca\u65ad\u5e7b\u89c9\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u5b9a\u4f4d\u56e0\u679c\u89c6\u89c9\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53cc\u56e0\u679c\u5bfc\u5411\uff08Interpretable Bi-Causal Steering\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "VLI\u5728MMHal-Bench\u4e0a\u5c06\u7269\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8612.67%\uff0c\u5728POPE\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e865.8%\u3002", "conclusion": "VLI\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In practice, RL progress often slows when task difficulty becomes poorly aligned with model capability, or when training is dominated by a narrow set of recurring problem patterns. To jointly address these issues, we propose SCALER (Synthetic sCalable Adaptive Learning Environment for Reasoning), a framework that sustains effective learning signals through adaptive environment design. SCALER introduces a scalable synthesis pipeline that converts real-world programming problems into verifiable reasoning environments with controllable difficulty and unbounded instance generation, enabling RL training beyond finite datasets while preserving strong correctness guarantees. Building on this, SCALER further employs an adaptive multi-environment RL strategy that dynamically adjusts instance difficulty and curates the active set of environments to track the model's capability frontier and maintain distributional diversity. This co-adaptation prevents reward sparsity, mitigates overfitting to narrow task patterns, and supports sustained improvement throughout training.

However, most recent vision--language models (VLMs) are constrained to a fixed and finite set of input views, which limits their ability to acquire question-relevant context at inference time and hinders complex spatial reasoning. We propose Chain-of-View (CoV) prompting, a training-free, test-time reasoning framework that transforms a VLM into an active viewpoint reasoner through a coarse-to-fine exploration process. CoV first employs a View Selection agent to filter redundant frames and identify question-aligned anchor views. It then performs fine-grained view adjustment by interleaving iterative reasoning with discrete camera actions, obtaining new observations from the underlying 3D scene representation until sufficient context is gathered or a step budget is reached.\n  We evaluate CoV on OpenEQA across four mainstream VLMs and obtain an average +11.56\\% improvement in LLM-Match, with a maximum gain of +13.62\\% on Qwen3-VL-Flash. CoV further exhibits test-time scaling: increasing the minimum action budget yields an additional +2.51\\% average improvement, peaking at +3.73\\% on Gemini-2.5-Flash. On ScanQA and SQA3D, CoV delivers strong performance (e.g., 116 CIDEr / 31.9 EM@1 on ScanQA and 51.1 EM@1 on SQA3D).

However, its necessity and advantages over direct answering remain underexplored. In this paper, we first demonstrate that for RL-trained video models, direct answering often matches or even surpasses CoT performance, despite CoT producing step-by-step analyses at a higher computational cost. Motivated by this, we propose VideoAuto-R1, a video understanding framework that adopts a reason-when-necessary strategy. During training, our approach follows a Thinking Once, Answering Twice paradigm: the model first generates an initial answer, then performs reasoning, and finally outputs a reviewed answer. Both answers are supervised via verifiable rewards. During inference, the model uses the confidence score of the initial answer to determine whether to proceed with reasoning. Across video QA and grounding benchmarks, VideoAuto-R1 achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly improved efficiency, reducing the average response length by ~3.3x, e.g., from 149 to just 44 tokens.

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as LoRA, is widely adopted to adapt pretrained MoE LLMs to downstream tasks. However, existing approaches assign identical LoRA ranks to all experts, overlooking the intrinsic functional specialization within MoE LLMs. This uniform allocation leads to resource mismatch, task-relevant experts are under-provisioned while less relevant ones receive redundant parameters. We propose a Dynamic Rank LoRA framework named DR-LoRA, which dynamically grows expert LoRA ranks during fine-tuning based on task-specific demands. DR-LoRA employs an Expert Saliency Scoring mechanism that integrates expert routing frequency and LoRA rank importance to quantify each expert's demand for additional capacity. Experts with higher saliency scores are prioritized for rank expansion, enabling the automatic formation of a heterogeneous rank distribution tailored to the target task.

A single research session using a 70-billion parameter model can cost around $127 in cloud fees, putting these tools out of reach for many academic labs. We developed AgentCompress to tackle this problem head-on. The core idea came from a simple observation during our own work: writing a novel hypothesis clearly demands more from the model than reformatting a bibliography. Why should both tasks run at full precision? Our system uses a small neural network to gauge how hard each incoming task will be, based only on its opening words, then routes it to a suitably compressed model variant. The decision happens in under a millisecond. Testing across 500 research workflows in four scientific fields, we cut compute costs by 68.3% while keeping 96.2% of the original success rate.

We address this inefficiency by proposing OI-MAS framework, a novel multi-agent framework that implements an adaptive model-selection policy across a heterogeneous pool of multi-scale LLMs. Specifically, OI-MAS introduces a state-dependent routing mechanism that dynamically selects agent roles and model scales throughout the reasoning process. In addition, we introduce a confidence-aware mechanism that selects appropriate model scales conditioned on task complexity, thus reducing unnecessary reliance on large-scale models.

We study this failure mode in a controlled object-counting setting, where the prompt overstates the number of objects in the image (e.g., asking a model to describe four waterlilies when only three are present). At low object counts, models often correct the overestimation, but as the number of objects increases, they increasingly conform to the prompt regardless of the discrepancy. Through mechanistic analysis of three VLMs, we identify a small set of attention heads whose ablation substantially reduces prompt-induced hallucinations (PIH) by at least 40% without additional training.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer inferential capabilities, they often depend on retrieval-augmented contexts that lack structural depth. Traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) attempt to bridge this gap, yet their pairwise constraints fail to capture the irreducible higher-order interactions that govern emergent physical behavior. To address this, we introduce a methodology for constructing hypergraph-based knowledge representations that faithfully encode multi-entity relationships. Applied to a corpus of ~1,100 manuscripts on biocomposite scaffolds, our framework constructs a global hypergraph of 161,172 nodes and 320,201 hyperedges, revealing a scale-free topology (power law exponent ~1.23) organized around highly connected conceptual hubs. This representation prevents the combinatorial explosion typical of pairwise expansions and explicitly preserves the co-occurrence context of scientific formulations. We further demonstrate that equipping agentic systems with hypergraph traversal tools, specifically using node-intersection constraints, enables them to bridge semantically distant concepts. By exploiting these higher-order pathways, the system successfully generates grounded mechanistic hypotheses for novel composite materials, such as linking cerium oxide to PCL scaffolds via chitosan intermediates.

One key application is Brain Age Prediction (BAP), which estimates an individual's biological brain age from MRI data. Effective BAP models require large, diverse, and age-balanced datasets, whereas existing 3D MRI datasets are demographically skewed, limiting fairness and generalizability. Acquiring new data is costly and ethically constrained, motivating generative data augmentation. Current generative methods are often based on latent diffusion models, which operate in learned low dimensional latent spaces to address the memory demands of volumetric MRI data. However, these methods are typically slow at inference, may introduce artifacts due to latent compression, and are rarely conditioned on age, thereby affecting the BAP performance. In this work, we propose FlowLet, a conditional generative framework that synthesizes age-conditioned 3D MRIs by leveraging flow matching within an invertible 3D wavelet domain, helping to avoid reconstruction artifacts and reducing computational demands. Experiments show that FlowLet generates high-fidelity volumes with few sampling steps. Training BAP models with data generated by FlowLet improves performance for underrepresented age groups, and region-based analysis confirms preservation of anatomical structures.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlowLet\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u5e74\u9f84\u6761\u4ef63D MRI\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86BAP\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D MRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b58\u5728\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5f71\u54cdBAP\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u3001\u6f5c\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u5f15\u5165\u4f2a\u5f71\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFlowLet\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u90063D\u5c0f\u6ce2\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u751f\u6210\u5e74\u9f84\u6761\u4ef63D MRI\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u4f2a\u5f71\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFlowLet\u80fd\u4ee5\u5c11\u91cf\u91c7\u6837\u6b65\u9aa4\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4f53\u79ef\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347BAP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u5e74\u9f84\u7ec4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "FlowLet\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u90063D\u5c0f\u6ce2\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5e74\u9f84\u6761\u4ef6MRI\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86BAP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u5e74\u9f84\u7ec4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

So, we need to quickly find a new safe plan. Replanning only the delayed agent often does not result in an efficient plan, and sometimes cannot even yield a feasible plan. On the other hand, replanning other agents may lead to a cascade of changes and delays. We show how to efficiently replan by tracking and using the temporal flexibility of other agents while avoiding cascading delays. This flexibility is the maximum delay an agent can take without changing the order of or further delaying more agents. Our algorithm, FlexSIPP, precomputes all possible plans for the delayed agent, also returning the changes for the other agents, for any single-agent delay within the given scenario. We demonstrate our method in a real-world case study of replanning trains in the densely-used Dutch railway network.

We aim to endow computational systems with a similar ability to predict plausible future object motions directly from passive visual observation. We introduce ObjectForesight, a 3D object-centric dynamics model that predicts future 6-DoF poses and trajectories of rigid objects from short egocentric video sequences. Unlike conventional world or dynamics models that operate in pixel or latent space, ObjectForesight represents the world explicitly in 3D at the object level, enabling geometrically grounded and temporally coherent predictions that capture object affordances and trajectories. To train such a model at scale, we leverage recent advances in segmentation, mesh reconstruction, and 3D pose estimation to curate a dataset of 2 million plus short clips with pseudo-ground-truth 3D object trajectories. Through extensive experiments, we show that ObjectForesight achieves significant gains in accuracy, geometric consistency, and generalization to unseen objects and scenes, establishing a scalable framework for learning physically grounded, object-centric dynamics models directly from observation. objectforesight.github.io", "AI": {"tldr": "ObjectForesight \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a3D\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u4ece\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u521a\u4f53\u7269\u4f53\u76846\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d4b\u4e88\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u88ab\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u7269\u4f53\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u672a\u6765\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5272\u3001\u7f51\u683c\u91cd\u5efa\u548c3D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b200\u591a\u4e07\u4e2a\u5e26\u6709\u4f2a\u5730\u9762\u771f\u5b9e3D\u7269\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a3D\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "ObjectForesight \u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u7269\u4f53\u548c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "ObjectForesight \u901a\u8fc73D\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7269\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Leveraging the advantages of MBRL, we incorporate a lookahead strategy for optimal positioning of AGVs, improving operational efficiency. Our approach was evaluated on small-sized public benchmarks and a newly developed large-scale benchmark inspired by the Taillard benchmark. The results show that our approach matches traditional methods on smaller instances and outperforms them on larger ones in terms of makespan while achieving a tenfold reduction in computation time.

However, despite their success in single-view setting, these works often struggle to maintain consistency across multi-view scenarios. Ensuring spatio-temporal coherence in hallucinated regions remains challenging due to the inherent stochasticity of generative models. To address it, we introduce PlenopticDreamer, a framework that synchronizes generative hallucinations to maintain spatio-temporal memory. The core idea is to train a multi-in-single-out video-conditioned model in an autoregressive manner, aided by a camera-guided video retrieval strategy that adaptively selects salient videos from previous generations as conditional inputs. In addition, Our training incorporates progressive context-scaling to improve convergence, self-conditioning to enhance robustness against long-range visual degradation caused by error accumulation, and a long-video conditioning mechanism to support extended video generation. Extensive experiments on the Basic and Agibot benchmarks demonstrate that PlenopticDreamer achieves state-of-the-art video re-rendering, delivering superior view synchronization, high-fidelity visuals, accurate camera control, and diverse view transformations (e.g., third-person to third-person, and head-view to gripper-view in robotic manipulation).

Existing works largely focus on optimizing the reasoning paradigms of search agents, yet the quality of intermediate search queries during reasoning remains overlooked. As a result, the generated queries often remain inaccurate, leading to unexpected retrieval results and ultimately limiting search agents' overall effectiveness. To mitigate this issue, we introduce SmartSearch, a framework built upon two key mechanisms: (1) Process rewards, which provide fine-grained supervision for the quality of each intermediate search query through Dual-Level Credit Assessment. (2) Query refinement, which promotes the optimization of query generation by selectively refining low-quality search queries and regenerating subsequent search rounds based on these refinements. To enable the search agent to progressively internalize the ability to improve query quality under the guidance of process rewards, we design a three-stage curriculum learning framework. This framework guides the agent through a progression from imitation, to alignment, and ultimately to generalization. Experimental results show that SmartSearch consistently surpasses existing baselines, and additional quantitative analyses further confirm its significant gains in both search efficiency and query quality.

This paper introduces three new benchmarks called Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation (GRES), Comprehension (GREC), and Generation (GREG), collectively denoted as GREx, which extend the classic REx to allow expressions to identify an arbitrary number of objects. We construct the first large-scale GREx dataset gRefCOCO that contains multi-target, no-target, and single-target expressions and their corresponding images with labeled targets. GREx and gRefCOCO are designed to be backward-compatible with REx, facilitating extensive experiments to study the performance gap of the existing REx methods on GREx tasks. One of the challenges of GRES/GREC is complex relationship modeling, for which we propose a baseline ReLA that adaptively divides the image into regions with sub-instance clues and explicitly models the region-region and region-language dependencies. The proposed ReLA achieves the state-of-the-art results on the both GRES and GREC tasks.

However, existing geometry foundation models still suffer severely from flying pixels and the loss of fine details. In this paper, we present pixel-perfect visual geometry models that can predict high-quality, flying-pixel-free point clouds by leveraging generative modeling in the pixel space. We first introduce Pixel-Perfect Depth (PPD), a monocular depth foundation model built upon pixel-space diffusion transformers (DiT). To address the high computational complexity associated with pixel-space diffusion, we propose two key designs: 1) Semantics-Prompted DiT, which incorporates semantic representations from vision foundation models to prompt the diffusion process, preserving global semantics while enhancing fine-grained visual details; and 2) Cascade DiT architecture that progressively increases the number of image tokens, improving both efficiency and accuracy. To further extend PPD to video (PPVD), we introduce a new Semantics-Consistent DiT, which extracts temporally consistent semantics from a multi-view geometry foundation model. We then perform reference-guided token propagation within the DiT to maintain temporal coherence with minimal computational and memory overhead. Our models achieve the best performance among all generative monocular and video depth estimation models and produce significantly cleaner point clouds than all other models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPPD\u548cPPVD\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u70b9\u4e91\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u98de\u50cf\u7d20\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u65e0\u98de\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08DiT\uff09\u7684Pixel-Perfect Depth\uff08PPD\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2. \u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u63d0\u793aDiT\u548c\u7ea7\u8054DiT\u67b6\u6784\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b3. \u6269\u5c55PPD\u81f3\u89c6\u9891\uff08PPVD\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027DiT\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u4f20\u64ad\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6240\u6709\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5355\u76ee\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u76843D\u70b9\u4e91\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5e72\u51c0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\uff08PPD\u548cPPVD\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08DiT\uff09\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5355\u76ee\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u8868\u73b0\u8005\u3002"}}

Findings revealed distinct query patterns. While low SRL students sought clarification and reassurance, high SRL students queried technical aspects and requested personalised strategies. The assistant provided clear and reliable explanations but limited in personalisation, handling emotionally charged queries, and integrating multiple data points for tailored responses. Findings further extend that GenAI interventions can be especially valuable for low SRL students, offering scaffolding that supports engagement with feedback and narrows gaps with their higher SRL peers.

Building on this foundation, we develop the first deep reinforcement learning approach for color constancy that leverages the statistical algorithm as its core, mimicking professional AWB tuning experts by dynamically optimizing parameters for each image.

The competition required participants to process event camera data to estimate lunar lander trajectories. Despite joining late, we achieved second place with a score of 0.01282, highlighting the potential of human-AI collaboration in competitive scientific settings. ChatGPT contributed not only executable code but also algorithmic reasoning, data handling routines, and methodological suggestions, such as using fixed number of events instead of fixed time spans for windowing. At the same time, we observed limitations: the model often introduced unnecessary structural changes, gets confused by intermediate discussions about alternative ideas, occasionally produced critical errors and forgets important aspects in longer scientific discussions.

Meanwhile, novel-view synthesis has seen major advances with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), where models learn a compact representation from 2D images to render 3D scenes, albeit at the cost of larger models and intensive training. In this work, we extend the approach of QVFs by introducing QNeRF, the first hybrid quantum-classical model designed for novel-view synthesis from 2D images. QNeRF leverages parameterised quantum circuits to encode spatial and view-dependent information via quantum superposition and entanglement, resulting in more compact models compared to the classical counterpart. We present two architectural variants. Full QNeRF maximally exploits all quantum amplitudes to enhance representational capabilities. In contrast, Dual-Branch QNeRF introduces a task-informed inductive bias by branching spatial and view-dependent quantum state preparations, drastically reducing the complexity of this operation and ensuring scalability and potential hardware compatibility. Our experiments demonstrate that -- when trained on images of moderate resolution -- QNeRF matches or outperforms classical NeRF baselines while using less than half the number of parameters.

However, this capability often leads to ``overthinking'', where models generate redundant reasoning paths that inflate computational costs without improving accuracy. While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on reasoning traces is a standard paradigm for the 'cold start' phase, applying existing compression techniques to these traces often compromises logical coherence or incurs prohibitive sampling costs. In this paper, we introduce ConMax (Confidence-Maximizing Compression), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to automatically compress reasoning traces while preserving essential reasoning patterns. ConMax formulates compression as a reward-driven optimization problem, training a policy to prune redundancy by maximizing a weighted combination of answer confidence for predictive fidelity and thinking confidence for reasoning validity through a frozen auxiliary LRM. Extensive experiments across five reasoning datasets demonstrate that ConMax achieves a superior efficiency-performance trade-off. Specifically, it reduces inference length by 43% over strong baselines at the cost of a mere 0.7% dip in accuracy, proving its effectiveness in generating high-quality, efficient training data for LRMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "ConMax\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u538b\u7f29\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u56e0\u8fc7\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u73b0\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u903b\u8f91\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u6216\u91c7\u6837\u6210\u672c\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "ConMax\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5956\u52b1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u6765\u538b\u7f29\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cConMax\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c1143%\uff0c\u800c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d0.7%\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "ConMax\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u52a8\u538b\u7f29\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

While world models possess this capability, they most often require action labels, that can be complex to obtain at scale. This motivates the learning of latent action models, that can learn an action space from videos alone. Our work addresses the problem of learning latent actions world models on in-the-wild videos, expanding the scope of existing works that focus on simple robotics simulations, video games, or manipulation data. While this allows us to capture richer actions, it also introduces challenges stemming from the video diversity, such as environmental noise, or the lack of a common embodiment across videos. To address some of the challenges, we discuss properties that actions should follow as well as relevant architectural choices and evaluations. We find that continuous, but constrained, latent actions are able to capture the complexity of actions from in-the-wild videos, something that the common vector quantization does not. We for example find that changes in the environment coming from agents, such as humans entering the room, can be transferred across videos. This highlights the capability of learning actions that are specific to in-the-wild videos. In the absence of a common embodiment across videos, we are mainly able to learn latent actions that become localized in space, relative to the camera. Nonetheless, we are able to train a controller that maps known actions to latent ones, allowing us to use latent actions as a universal interface and solve planning tasks with our world model with similar performance as action-conditioned baselines. Our analyses and experiments provide a step towards scaling latent action models to the real world.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u591a\u6837\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u73af\u5883\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5171\u540c\u4f53\u73b0\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9700\u8981\u9884\u6d4b\u5176\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u540e\u679c\uff0c\u800c\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6807\u7b7e\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u83b7\u53d6\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u5f88\u590d\u6742\u3002\u8fd9\u4fc3\u4f7f\u4e86\u4ece\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e94\u9075\u5faa\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u8fde\u7eed\u4f46\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8fde\u7eed\u4f46\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u591a\u6837\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5219\u65e0\u6cd5\u505a\u5230\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5c06\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, with the paradigm shift towards the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) learning rate scheduler, we observe that the original theoretical framework and its underlying mechanisms fail to align with new pre-training dynamics. To bridge this gap between theory and practice, this paper derives a revised E(S) relationship tailored for WSD scheduler, characterizing the trade-off between training data consumption E and steps S during pre-training. Our theoretical analysis reveals two fundamental properties of WSD-based pre-training: 1) B_min, the minimum batch size threshold required to achieve a target loss, and 2) B_opt, the optimal batch size that maximizes data efficiency by minimizing total tokens. Building upon these properties, we propose a dynamic Batch Size Scheduler. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our revised formula precisely captures the dynamics of large-scale pre-training, and the resulting scheduling strategy significantly enhances both training efficiency and final model quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9WSD\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u4fee\u8ba2\u4e86E(S)\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "OpenAI\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Critical Batch Size\u6982\u5ff5\u5728WSD\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u7684\u65b0\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u4e2d\u4e0d\u518d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9WSD\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u7684\u4fee\u8ba2\u7248E(S)\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86B_min\u548cB_opt\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4fee\u8ba2\u540e\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Given the stringent trade-off between training costs and model performance, the pivotal question is whether the optimal LR can be accurately extrapolated from low-cost experiments. In this paper, we formalize this investigation into two distinct research paradigms: Fitting and Transfer. Within the Fitting Paradigm, we innovatively introduce a Scaling Law for search factor, effectively reducing the search complexity from O(n^3) to O(n*C_D*C_\u03b7) via predictive modeling. Within the Transfer Paradigm, we extend the principles of $\u03bc$Transfer to the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, broadening its applicability to encompass model depth, weight decay, and token horizons. By pushing the boundaries of existing hyperparameter research in terms of scale, we conduct a comprehensive comparison between these two paradigms. Our empirical results challenge the scalability of the widely adopted $\u03bc$ Transfer in large-scale pre-training scenarios. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous analysis through the dual lenses of training stability and feature learning to elucidate the underlying reasons why module-wise parameter tuning underperforms in large-scale settings.

But it remains unclear whether this persuasive power advantages truth over falsehood, or if LLMs can promote misbeliefs just as easily as refuting them. Here, we investigate this question across three pre-registered experiments in which participants (N = 2,724 Americans) discussed a conspiracy theory they were uncertain about with GPT-4o, and the model was instructed to either argue against (\"debunking\") or for (\"bunking\") that conspiracy. When using a \"jailbroken\" GPT-4o variant with guardrails removed, the AI was as effective at increasing conspiracy belief as decreasing it. Concerningly, the bunking AI was rated more positively, and increased trust in AI, more than the debunking AI. Surprisingly, we found that using standard GPT-4o produced very similar effects, such that the guardrails imposed by OpenAI did little to revent the LLM from promoting conspiracy beliefs. Encouragingly, however, a corrective conversation reversed these newly induced conspiracy beliefs, and simply prompting GPT-4o to only use accurate information dramatically reduced its ability to increase conspiracy beliefs.

Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based extensions improve upon vanilla RLVR (e.g., GRPO) by providing tree-based reasoning rollouts that enable fine-grained and segment-level credit assignment. However, existing methods still suffer from limited exploration diversity and inefficient reasoning. To address the above challenges, we propose reinforced efficient reasoning via semantically diverse explorations, i.e., ROSE, for LLMs. To encourage more diverse reasoning exploration, our method incorporates a semantic-entropy-based branching strategy and an $\\varepsilon$-exploration mechanism. The former operates on already sampled reasoning rollouts to capture semantic uncertainty and select branching points with high semantic divergence to generate new successive reasoning paths, whereas the latter stochastically initiates reasoning rollouts from the root, preventing the search process from becoming overly local. To improve efficiency, we design a length-aware segment-level advantage estimator that rewards concise and correct reasoning while penalizing unnecessarily long reasoning chains. Extensive experiments on various mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Qwen and Llama models validate the effectiveness and efficiency of ROSE.

While the development of Arabic-native LLMs is accelerating, the benchmarks for evaluating their capabilities lag behind, with most existing frameworks focusing on English. A critical and overlooked area is tool-calling, where the performance of models prompted in non-English languages like Arabic is poorly understood, especially since these models are often pretrained on predominantly English data. This paper addresses this critical gap by introducing the first dedicated benchmark for evaluating the tool-calling and agentic capabilities of LLMs in the Arabic language. Our work provides a standardized framework to measure the functional accuracy and robustness of models in Arabic agentic workflows. Our findings reveal a huge performance gap: when users interact in Arabic, tool-calling accuracy drops by an average of 5-10\\%, regardless of whether the tool descriptions themselves are in Arabic or English. By shedding light on these critical challenges, this benchmark aims to foster the development of more reliable and linguistically equitable AI agents for Arabic-speaking users.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u4e2a\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bedLLMs\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u63ed\u793a\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u4ea4\u4e92\u5bfc\u81f4\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d5-10%\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8bed\u8a00\u516c\u5e73AI\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u539f\u751fLLMs\u53d1\u5c55\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u4f46\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u6ede\u540e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u9886\u57df\u5728\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u4ee3\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\u63cf\u8ff0\u662f\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u8fd8\u662f\u82f1\u8bed\uff0c\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0b\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e73\u5747\u4e0b\u964d5-10%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bedLLMs\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0b\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u8bed\u8a00\u516c\u5e73\u7684AI\u4ee3\u7406\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, achieving strong performance across these domains with a single general-purpose model typically requires scaling to sizes that are prohibitively expensive to train and deploy. On the other hand, while smaller domain-specialized models are much more efficient, they struggle to generalize beyond their training distributions. To address this dilemma, we propose FusionRoute, a robust and effective token-level multi-LLM collaboration framework in which a lightweight router simultaneously (i) selects the most suitable expert at each decoding step and (ii) contributes a complementary logit that refines or corrects the selected expert's next-token distribution via logit addition. Unlike existing token-level collaboration methods that rely solely on fixed expert outputs, we provide a theoretical analysis showing that pure expert-only routing is fundamentally limited: unless strong global coverage assumptions hold, it cannot in general realize the optimal decoding policy. By augmenting expert selection with a trainable complementary generator, FusionRoute expands the effective policy class and enables recovery of optimal value functions under mild conditions. Empirically, across both Llama-3 and Gemma-2 families and diverse benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, code generation, and instruction following, FusionRoute outperforms both sequence- and token-level collaboration, model merging, and direct fine-tuning, while remaining competitive with domain experts on their respective tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "FusionRoute\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u548c\u4e92\u8865\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u901a\u7528\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u4e13\u7528\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "FusionRoute\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8etoken\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u591aLLM\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8def\u7531\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u8865\u5145\u4fee\u6b63\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728Llama-3\u548cGemma-2\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u53ca\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFusionRoute\u4f18\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u548ctoken\u7ea7\u534f\u4f5c\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u53ca\u76f4\u63a5\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FusionRoute\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8def\u7531\u5668\u548c\u4e92\u8865\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4e13\u7528\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Collaborative inference offers a promising solution by selectively allocating work between lightweight and large models, yet a fundamental challenge remains: determining when a reasoning step requires the capacity of a large model or the efficiency of a small model. Existing routing strategies either rely on local token probabilities or post-hoc verification, introducing significant inference overhead. In this work, we propose a novel perspective on step-wise collaboration: the difficulty of a reasoning step can be inferred from its very first token. Inspired by the \"Aha Moment\" phenomenon in LRMs, we show that the entropy of the initial token serves as a strong predictor of step difficulty. Building on this insight, we introduce GlimpRouter, a training-free step-wise collaboration framework. GlimpRouter employs a lightweight model to generate only the first token of each reasoning step and routes the step to a larger model only when the initial token entropy exceeds a threshold. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces inference latency while preserving accuracy. For instance, GlimpRouter attains a substantial 10.7% improvement in accuracy while reducing inference latency by 25.9% compared to a standalone large model on AIME25.

We find the opposite: judges are consistent, but not with each other; they are consistent with themselves. Across 3,240 evaluations (9 judges x 120 unique video x pack items x 3 independent runs), inter-judge agreement is near-zero (Krippendorff's \u03b1 = 0.042). On two dimensions, judges disagree more than random noise would predict (\u03b1 < 0). Yet this disagreement isn't chaos; it's structured. A classifier identifies which judge produced an evaluation with 77.1% accuracy from rubric scores alone, rising to 89.9% with disposition features. Within model families, the signal is even stronger: GPT-4.1 and GPT-5.2 are distinguishable with 99.6% accuracy. We call this the reliability paradox: judges cannot agree on what constitutes quality, yet their disagreement patterns are so stable they function as fingerprints. Each judge implements a distinct, stable theory of quality: an \"evaluative disposition\" that shapes how it interprets any rubric. We characterize these dispositions along multiple axes: harshness/leniency, dimension emphasis, within-judge stability (ICC), and evidence behavior (receipt validity, semantic linkage via NLI, and shotgun index).

Token-based watermarking techniques can corrupt the reasoning flow by applying pseudo-random biases, while semantic-aware approaches improve quality but introduce significant latency or require auxiliary models. This paper introduces ReasonMark, a novel watermarking framework specifically designed for reasoning-intensive LLMs. Our approach decouples generation into an undisturbed Thinking Phase and a watermarked Answering Phase. We propose a Criticality Score to identify semantically pivotal tokens from the reasoning trace, which are distilled into a Principal Semantic Vector (PSV). The PSV then guides a semantically-adaptive mechanism that modulates watermark strength based on token-PSV alignment, ensuring robustness without compromising logical integrity.

However, this creates a self-consuming retraining loop, where models are trained on their own outputs and may cause performance drops and induce emerging biases. In real-world applications, previously deployed LLMs may influence the data they generate, leading to a dynamic system driven by user feedback. For example, if a model continues to underserve users from a group, less query data will be collected from this particular demographic of users. In this study, we introduce the concept of \\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{C}onsuming \\textbf{P}erformative \\textbf{L}oop (\\textbf{SCPL}) and investigate the role of synthetic data in shaping bias during these dynamic iterative training processes under controlled performative feedback. This controlled setting is motivated by the inaccessibility of real-world user preference data from dynamic production systems, and enables us to isolate and analyze feedback-driven bias evolution in a principled manner. We focus on two types of loops, including the typical retraining setting and the incremental fine-tuning setting, which is largely underexplored.

A lightweight plan-execute architecture, trained in two stages, equips the agent with both low-level tool skills and high-level design reasoning. To tackle sparse rewards in long-horizon tasks, we propose Reflection-GRPO (ReGRPO), which augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with self-reflection traces that supply rich intermediate feedback, accelerating convergence and boosting robustness. Experiments on SimuBench, our newly released benchmark comprising 5300 multi-domain modeling tasks, show that a Qwen2.5-7B model fine-tuned with SimuAgent converges faster and achieves higher modeling accuracy than standard RL baselines, and even surpasses GPT-4o when evaluated with few-shot prompting on the same benchmark. Ablations confirm that the two-stage curriculum and abstract-reconstruct data augmentation further enhance generalization.

Hence, to solve this problem, the Neural Prophet with a Deep Neural Network (NP-DNN) is proposed to predict stock market prices. The preprocessing technique used in this research is Z-score normalization, which normalizes stock price data by removing scale differences, making patterns easier to detect. Missing value imputation fills gaps in historical data, enhancing the models use of complete information for more accurate predictions. The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) learns complex nonlinear relationships among stock market prices and extracts hidden patterns from the input data, thereby creating meaningful feature representations for better prediction accuracy.

Such hallucinations in agent tool selection require early detection and error handling. Unlike existing hallucination detection methods that require multiple forward passes or external validation, we present a computationally efficient framework that detects tool-calling hallucinations in real-time by leveraging LLMs' internal representations during the same forward pass used for generation. We evaluate this approach on reasoning tasks across multiple domains, demonstrating strong detection performance (up to 86.4\\% accuracy) while maintaining real-time inference capabilities with minimal computational overhead, particularly excelling at detecting parameter-level hallucinations and inappropriate tool selections, critical for reliable agent deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4bLLM\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u9009\u62e9\u9519\u8bef\u5de5\u5177\u3001\u63d0\u4f9b\u9519\u8bef\u53c2\u6570\u53ca\u7ed5\u8fc7\u5de5\u5177\u76f4\u63a5\u6a21\u62df\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528LLM\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u9012\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u6700\u9ad886.4%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u6700\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728LLM\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Rather than relying on synthetic prompts, tasks are elicited from formative and summative co-play with expert players, normalized into parametric templates with explicit preconditions and dependency structure, and paired with machine-checkable validators under a bounded-knowledge policy that forbids out-of-world shortcuts. The harness captures plan/act/memory events-including plan previews, targeted clarifications, memory reads and writes, precondition checks, and repair attempts and reports outcomes relative to the total number of attempted subtasks, derived from in-world evidence.\n  As an initial snapshot, we instantiate the framework with GPT-4o and evaluate \\textbf{216} subtasks across \\textbf{8} experienced players. We observe recurring breakdown patterns in code execution, inventory/tool handling, referencing, and navigation, alongside recoveries supported by mixed-initiative clarifications and lightweight memory. Participants rated interaction quality and interface usability positively, while highlighting the need for stronger memory persistence across tasks.
