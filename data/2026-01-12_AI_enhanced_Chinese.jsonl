Existing methods often address isolated sub-problems such as cyanobacteria, chlorophyll, or other quality indicators separately. NAIAD introduces an agentic AI assistant that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and external analytical tools to deliver a holistic solution for inland water monitoring using Earth Observation (EO) data. Designed for both experts and non-experts, NAIAD provides a single-prompt interface that translates natural-language queries into actionable insights. Through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM reasoning, external tool orchestration, computational graph execution, and agentic reflection, it retrieves and synthesizes knowledge from curated sources to produce tailored reports. The system integrates diverse tools for weather data, Sentinel-2 imagery, remote-sensing index computation (e.g., NDCI), chlorophyll-a estimation, and established platforms such as CyFi. Performance is evaluated using correctness and relevancy metrics, achieving over 77% and 85% respectively on a dedicated benchmark covering multiple user-expertise levels.

In this study, we propose an ontology-guided, equation-centric framework that tightly integrates large language models (LLMs) with an additive manufacturing mathematical knowledge graph (AM-MKG) to enable reliable knowledge extraction and principled extrapolative modeling. By explicitly encoding equations, variables, assumptions, and their semantic relationships within a formal ontology, unstructured literature is transformed into machine-interpretable representations that support structured querying and reasoning. LLM-based equation generation is further conditioned on MKG-derived subgraphs, enforcing physically meaningful functional forms and mitigating non-physical or unstable extrapolation trends. To assess reliability beyond conventional predictive uncertainty, a confidence-aware extrapolation assessment is introduced, integrating extrapolation distance, statistical stability, and knowledge-graph-based physical consistency into a unified confidence score. Results demonstrate that ontology-guided extraction significantly improves the structural coherence and quantitative reliability of extracted knowledge, while subgraph-conditioned equation generation yields stable and physically consistent extrapolations compared to unguided LLM outputs.

Although recent studies suggest that assigning personality traits to LLMs can influence their behavior, how personality steering affects cooperation under controlled conditions remains unclear. In this study, we examine the effects of personality steering on cooperative behavior in LLM agents using repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games. Based on the Big Five framework, we first measure basic personality profiles of three models, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-5, using the Big Five Inventory. We then compare behavior under baseline and personality-informed conditions, and further analyze the effects of independently manipulating each personality dimension to extreme values. Our results show that agreeableness is the dominant factor promoting cooperation across all models, while other personality traits have limited impact. Explicit personality information increases cooperation but can also raise vulnerability to exploitation, particularly in earlier-generation models. In contrast, later-generation models exhibit more selective cooperation. These findings indicate that personality steering acts as a behavioral bias rather than a deterministic control mechanism.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4eba\u683c\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5b9c\u4eba\u6027\uff09\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdbLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u4e16\u4ee3\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5408\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4eba\u683c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cdLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u590d\u56da\u5f92\u56f0\u5883\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u4e94\u4eba\u683c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cfGPT-3.5-turbo\u3001GPT-4o\u548cGPT-5\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u4eba\u683c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5404\u4eba\u683c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6781\u7aef\u503c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9c\u4eba\u6027\u662f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u9650\u3002\u660e\u786e\u7684\u4eba\u683c\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u52a0\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u88ab\u5265\u524a\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002\u540e\u671f\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5177\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u683c\u5f15\u5bfc\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u884c\u4e3a\u504f\u5dee\u800c\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f71\u54cdLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

While existing methods could leverage databases of expert-curated enzyme-substrate pairs for models to learn from known pair interactions, the databases are often sparse, i.e., there are only limited and incomplete examples of such pairs, and also labor-intensive to maintain. This lack of sufficient training data significantly hinders the ability of traditional enzyme prediction models to generalize to unseen interactions. In this work, we try to exploit chemical reaction equations from domain-specific databases, given their easier accessibility and denser, more abundant data. However, interactions of multiple compounds, e.g., educts and products, with the same enzymes create complex relational data patterns that traditional models cannot easily capture. To tackle that, we represent chemical reaction equations as triples of (educt, enzyme, product) within a knowledge graph, such that we can take advantage of knowledge graph embedding (KGE) to infer missing enzyme-substrate pairs for graph completion. Particularly, in order to capture intricate relationships among compounds, we propose our knowledge-enhanced hypergraph model for enzyme prediction, i.e., Hyper-Enz, which integrates a hypergraph transformer with a KGE model to learn representations of the hyper-edges that involve multiple educts and products. Also, a multi-expert paradigm is introduced to guide the learning of enzyme-substrate interactions with both the proposed model and chemical reaction equations. Experimental results show a significant improvement, with up to a 88% relative improvement in average enzyme retrieval accuracy and 30% improvement in pair-level prediction compared to traditional models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faHyper-Enz\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u548c\u8d85\u56fe\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u63d0\u5347\u9176-\u5e95\u7269\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9176-\u5e95\u7269\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u66f4\u6613\u83b7\u53d6\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u65b9\u7a0b\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u8868\u793a\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u8d85\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\uff08Hyper-Enz\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d85\u56fe\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u548cKGE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u6d89\u53ca\u591a\u4e2a\u53cd\u5e94\u7269\u548c\u4ea7\u7269\u7684\u8d85\u8fb9\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8303\u5f0f\u6307\u5bfc\u9176-\u5e95\u7269\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHyper-Enz\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e73\u5747\u9176\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u4e8688%\uff0c\u5728\u914d\u5bf9\u7ea7\u522b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e8630%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u65b9\u7a0b\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5d4c\u5165\uff08KGE\uff09\u548c\u8d85\u56fe\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08Hyper-Enz\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9176-\u5e95\u7269\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

RRAM based in memory computing suffers from scalability limitations due to device non idealities and fixed array sizes. Decentralized AI frameworks struggle with memory efficiency across NAT constrained networks due to static routing that ignores computational load. Multi agent deployment systems tightly couple application logic with execution environments, preventing adaptive memory optimization. These challenges stem from a fundamental lack of coordinated memory management across architectural layers. We introduce Self Evolving Distributed Memory Architecture for Scalable AI Systems, a three layer framework that unifies memory management across computation, communication, and deployment. Our approach features (1) memory guided matrix processing with dynamic partitioning based on device characteristics, (2) memory aware peer selection considering network topology and computational capacity, and (3) runtime adaptive deployment optimization through continuous reconfiguration. The framework maintains dual memory systems tracking both long term performance patterns and short term workload statistics. Experiments on COCO 2017, ImageNet, and SQuAD show that our method achieves 87.3 percent memory utilization efficiency and 142.5 operations per second compared to Ray Distributed at 72.1 percent and 98.7 operations per second, while reducing communication latency by 30.2 percent to 171.2 milliseconds and improving resource utilization to 82.7 percent.

Given the potential Internet-wide adoption of BBR, we must also consider its robustness in network and system scenarios. One such scenario is Cloud-based Virtual Machine (VM) networking - highly relevant in today's CDN-centric Internet. Interestingly, previous work has shown significant performance problems of BBRv1-2 running in Xen VMs, with BBR performance dropping to almost zero when CPU credit is low. In this paper, we develop a framework for measuring TCP throughput under fully controlled CPU contention, which uses Linux deadline scheduling to emulate generalized CPU contention conditions. Our measurements reveal that - in stark contrast to Cubic! - BBR throughput can break down during CPU contention under any hypervisor and all tested BDP conditions. Characterizing this performance degradation on a fine-granular level, we show that CPU limited BBR senders are capped at very low throughput levels below 10-20 Mbps. This finding implies that an Internet-wide shift from Cubic to BBR could harm the Internet's overall robustness, if not deployed with caution. To detect and overcome CPU-limited throughput, we propose a minimal BBR patch which detects the problematic situation by monitoring inflight bytes and reacts by increasing the pacing rate to make better use of the available CPU time. We show that our BBR patch overcomes the throughput problem for the most critical cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "BBR\u5728CPU\u4e89\u7528\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8865\u4e01\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76BBR\u5728\u4e91\u865a\u62df\u673a\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728CPU\u4e89\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Linux\u622a\u6b62\u8c03\u5ea6\u6a21\u62dfCPU\u4e89\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cfTCP\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "result": "BBR\u5728CPU\u4e89\u7528\u4e0b\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8865\u4e01\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u5173\u952e\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528BBR\u9700\u8c28\u614e\uff0c\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u5f71\u54cd\u6574\u4f53\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684BBR\u8865\u4e01\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3CPU\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Eye gaze offers a fast, non-intrusive, and intent-rich input modality, making it an attractive channel for conveying user goals. In this work, we present GAMMA (Gaze Assisted Manipulation for Modular Autonomy), a system that leverages ego-centric gaze tracking and a vision-language model to infer user intent and autonomously execute robotic manipulation tasks. By contextualizing gaze fixations within the scene, the system maps visual attention to high-level semantic understanding, enabling skill selection and parameterization without task-specific training. We evaluate GAMMA on a range of table-top manipulation tasks and compare it against baseline gaze-based control without reasoning. Results demonstrate that GAMMA provides robust, intuitive, and generalizable control, highlighting the potential of combining foundation models and gaze for natural and scalable robot autonomy.

Attention maps describe where weight mass concentrates; they do not reveal whether queries and keys trade position, content, or both. We introduce Bi-orthogonal Factor Decomposition (BFD), a two-stage analytical framework: first, an ANOVA-based decomposition statistically disentangles token activations into orthogonal positional and content factors; second, SVD of the query-key interaction matrix QK^T exposes bi-orthogonal modes that reveal how these factors mediate communication. After validating proper isolation of position and content, we apply BFD to state-of-the-art vision models and uncover three phenomena.(i) Attention operates primarily through content. Content-content interactions dominate attention energy, followed by content-position coupling. DINOv2 allocates more energy to content-position than supervised models and distributes computation across a richer mode spectrum. (ii) Attention mechanisms exhibit specialization: heads differentiate into content-content, content-position, and position-position operators, while singular modes within heads show analogous specialization. (iii) DINOv2's superior holistic shape processing emerges from intermediate layers that simultaneously preserve positional structure while contextually enriching semantic content.\n  Overall, BFD exposes how tokens interact through attention and which informational factors - positional or semantic - mediate their communication, yielding practical insights into vision transformer mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "BFD\u6846\u67b6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u4e2d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5185\u5bb9\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3001\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u5206\u5de5\u53caDINOv2\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2dtoken\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u6362\u539f\u7406\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u6b63\u4ea4\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u89e3\uff08BFD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ANOVA\u5206\u89e3\u548cSVD\u5206\u6790query-key\u4ea4\u4e92\u77e9\u9635QK^T\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u5bb9\u8fd0\u4f5c\uff0c\u5185\u5bb9-\u5185\u5bb9\u4ea4\u4e92\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff1b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\uff1bDINOv2\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "conclusion": "BFD\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2dtoken\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6216\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, its effects on high-stakes clinical decision-making remain poorly characterized. We systematically evaluate persona-based control in clinical LLMs, examining how professional roles (e.g., Emergency Department physician, nurse) and interaction styles (bold vs.\\ cautious) influence behavior across models and medical tasks. We assess performance on clinical triage and patient-safety tasks using multidimensional evaluations that capture task accuracy, calibration, and safety-relevant risk behavior. We find systematic, context-dependent, and non-monotonic effects: Medical personas improve performance in critical care tasks, yielding gains of up to $\\sim+20\\%$ in accuracy and calibration, but degrade performance in primary-care settings by comparable margins. Interaction style modulates risk propensity and sensitivity, but it's highly model-dependent. While aggregated LLM-judge rankings favor medical over non-medical personas in safety-critical cases, we found that human clinicians show moderate agreement on safety compliance (average Cohen's $\u03ba= 0.43$) but indicate a low confidence in 95.9\\% of their responses on reasoning quality. Our work shows that personas function as behavioral priors that introduce context-dependent trade-offs rather than guarantees of safety or expertise.

Based on this observation, we propose a hybrid representation that categorizes Gaussians into (i) Sketch Gaussians, which represent high-frequency, boundary-defining features, and (ii) Patch Gaussians, which cover low-frequency, smooth regions. This semantic separation naturally enables layered progressive streaming, where the compact Sketch Gaussians establish the structural skeleton before Patch Gaussians incrementally refine volumetric detail.\n  In this work, we extend our previous method to arbitrary 3D scenes by proposing a novel hierarchical adaptive categorization framework that operates directly on the 3DGS representation. Our approach employs multi-criteria density-based clustering, combined with adaptive quality-driven refinement. This method eliminates dependency on external 3D line primitives while ensuring optimal parametric encoding effectiveness. Our comprehensive evaluation across diverse scenes, including both man-made and natural environments, demonstrates that our method achieves up to 1.74 dB improvement in PSNR, 6.7% in SSIM, and 41.4% in LPIPS at equivalent model sizes compared to uniform pruning baselines.

However, the inherent susceptibility of mmWave frequencies to weather-related attenuation, particularly rain fading, complicates the maintenance of stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. This creates a critical challenge: making admission decisions under uncertainty regarding future network capacity. To address this, we develop a proactive slice admission control framework for mmWave x-haul networks subject to rain-induced fluctuations. Our objective is to improve network performance, ensure QoS, and optimize revenue, thereby surpassing the limitations of standard reactive approaches. The proposed framework integrates a deep learning predictor of future network conditions with a proactive Q-learning-based slice admission control mechanism.

We introduce PRISM (Protocol Refinement through Intelligent Simulation Modeling), a framework that automates the design, validation, and execution of experimental protocols on a laboratory platform composed of off-the-shelf robotic instruments. PRISM uses a set of language-model-based agents that work together to generate and refine experimental steps. The process begins with automatically gathering relevant procedures from web-based sources describing experimental workflows. These are converted into structured experimental steps (e.g., liquid handling steps, deck layout and other related operations) through a planning, critique, and validation loop. The finalized steps are translated into the Argonne MADSci protocol format, which provides a unified interface for coordinating multiple robotic instruments (Opentrons OT-2 liquid handler, PF400 arm, Azenta plate sealer and peeler) without requiring human intervention between steps. To evaluate protocol-generation performance, we benchmarked both single reasoning models and multi-agent workflow across constrained and open-ended prompting paradigms. The resulting protocols were validated in a digital-twin environment built in NVIDIA Omniverse to detect physical or sequencing errors before execution. Using Luna qPCR amplification and Cell Painting as case studies, we demonstrate PRISM as a practical end-to-end workflow that bridges language-based protocol generation, simulation-based validation, and automated robotic execution.", "AI": {"tldr": "PRISM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u534f\u8bae\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u6267\u884c\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u534f\u8bae\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6267\u884c\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0cPRISM\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "PRISM\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u6279\u5224\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u5c06\u7f51\u7edc\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d41\u7a0b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5e76\u6700\u7ec8\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aArgonne MADSci\u534f\u8bae\u683c\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "PRISM\u5728Luna qPCR\u6269\u589e\u548cCell Painting\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8bed\u8a00\u534f\u8bae\u751f\u6210\u3001\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6267\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "PRISM\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Similarly, visual understanding can be viewed as the ability to construct a representative model of the system depicted in an image. This work explores the capacity of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to recognize and simulate the systems and mechanisms depicted in images using the Im2Sim methodology. The VLM is given a natural image of a real-world system (e.g., cities, clouds, vegetation) and is tasked with describing the system and writing code that simulates and generates it. This generative code is then executed to produce a synthetic image, which is compared against the original. This approach is tested on various complex emergent systems, ranging from physical systems (waves, lights, clouds) to vegetation, cities, materials, and geological formations. Through analysis of the models and images generated by the VLMs, we examine their understanding of the systems in images. The results show that leading VLMs (GPT, Gemini) demonstrate the capacity to understand and model complex, multi-component systems across multiple layers of abstraction and a wide range of domains. At the same time, the VLMs exhibit limited ability to replicate fine details and low-level arrangements of patterns in the image.

This question goes back to the expansion testing problem of Goldreich and Ron'11. For $k=2$ a sample of $\\approx n^{1/2+O(\u03b5/\\varphi^2)}$ logarithmic length walks from a given vertex approximately determines its cluster membership by the birthday paradox: two vertices whose random walk samples are `close' are likely in the same cluster.\n  The study of the general case $k>2$ was initiated by Czumaj, Peng and Sohler [STOC'15], and the works of Chiplunkar et al. [FOCS'18], Gluch et al. [SODA'21] showed that $\\approx \\text{poly}(k)\\cdot n^{1/2+O(\u03b5/\\varphi^2)}$ random walk samples suffice for general $k$. This matches the $k=2$ result up to polynomial factors in $k$, but creates a conceptual inconsistency: if the birthday paradox is the guiding phenomenon, then the query complexity should decrease with the number of clusters $k$! Since clusters have size $\\approx n/k$, we expect to need $\\approx (n/k)^{1/2+O(\u03b5/\\varphi^2)}$ random walk samples, which decreases with $k$.\n  We design a novel representation of vertices in a $(k, \\varphi, \u03b5)$-clusterable graph by a mixture of logarithmic length walks. This representation uses the optimal $\\approx (n/k)^{1/2+O(\u03b5/\\varphi^2)}$ walks per vertex, and allows for a fast nearest neighbor search: given $k$ vertices representing the clusters, we can find the cluster of a given query vertex $x$ using nearly linear time in the representation size of $x$. This gives a clustering oracle with query time $\\approx (n/k)^{1/2+O(\u03b5/\\varphi^2)}$ and space complexity $k\\cdot (n/k)^{1/2+O(\u03b5/\\varphi^2)}$, matching the birthday paradox bound.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u805a\u7c7b\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u5bf9\u6570\u957f\u5ea6\u6e38\u8d70\u8868\u793a\u9876\u70b9\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u4e0e\u751f\u65e5\u6096\u8bba\u9884\u671f\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e00\u822ck>2\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u751f\u65e5\u6096\u8bba\u9884\u671f\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u805a\u7c7b\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6570\u957f\u5ea6\u6e38\u8d70\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u9876\u70b9\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5feb\u901f\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u67e5\u8be2\u9876\u70b9\u6240\u5c5e\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u95f4\u2248(n/k)^{1/2+O(\u03b5/\u03c6^2)}\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6k\u22c5(n/k)^{1/2+O(\u03b5/\u03c6^2)}\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u9884\u8a00\u673a\uff0c\u4e0e\u751f\u65e5\u6096\u8bba\u9884\u671f\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u9876\u70b9\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u5bf9\u6570\u957f\u5ea6\u6e38\u8d70\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u4e0e\u751f\u65e5\u6096\u8bba\u9884\u671f\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u67e5\u8be2\u3002"}}

This study examines conformity, the tendency to align with group opinions under social pressure, in large multimodal language models functioning as AI agents. By adapting classic visual experiments from social psychology, we investigate how AI agents respond to group influence as social actors. Our experiments reveal that AI agents exhibit a systematic conformity bias, aligned with Social Impact Theory, showing sensitivity to group size, unanimity, task difficulty, and source characteristics. Critically, AI agents achieving near-perfect performance in isolation become highly susceptible to manipulation through social influence. This vulnerability persists across model scales: while larger models show reduced conformity on simple tasks due to improved capabilities, they remain vulnerable when operating at their competence boundary.

However, existing FDG methods typically struggle with cross-client data heterogeneity and incur significant communication and computation overhead. To address these challenges, this paper presents a new FDG framework, dubbed FaST-PT, which facilitates local feature augmentation and efficient unseen domain adaptation in a distributed manner. First, we propose a lightweight Multi-Modal Style Transfer (MST) method to transform image embedding under text supervision, which could expand the training data distribution and mitigate domain shift. We then design a dual-prompt module that decomposes the prompt into global and domain prompts. Specifically, global prompts capture general knowledge from augmented embedding across clients, while domain prompts capture domain-specific knowledge from local data. Besides, Domain-aware Prompt Generation (DPG) is introduced to adaptively generate suitable prompts for each sample, which facilitates unseen domain adaptation through knowledge fusion. Extensive experiments on four cross-domain benchmark datasets, e.g., PACS and DomainNet, demonstrate the superior performance of FaST-PT over SOTA FDG methods such as FedDG-GA and DiPrompt.

Upcoming decades focus on building a lunar outpost, with robotic systems playing a crucial role to safely and efficiently establish essential infrastructure such as solar power generating towers. Similar to the construction of the International Space Station (ISS), shipping necessary components via modules and assembling them in situ should be a practical scenario. In this context, this paper focuses on the integration of vision, control, and hardware systems within an autonomous sequence for a dual-arm robot system. We explore a perception and control pipeline specifically designed for assembling solar panel modules, one of the benchmark tasks. Ad hoc hardware was designed and tested in real-world experiments. A mock-up of modular solar panels and active-passive connectors are employed, with the control of this grappling fixture integrated into the proposed pipeline. The successful implementation of our method demonstrates that the two robot manipulators can effectively connect arbitrarily placed panels, highlighting the seamless integration of vision, control, and hardware systems in complex space applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u592a\u7a7a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u677f\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u7ec4\u88c5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u786c\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4eba\u7c7b\u91cd\u8fd4\u6708\u7403\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u6708\u7403\u524d\u54e8\u7ad9\u9700\u8981\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u9ad8\u6548\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff08\u5982\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u53d1\u7535\u5854\uff09\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e3a\u7ec4\u88c5\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u677f\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e13\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u771f\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u53cc\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u6210\u529f\u8fde\u63a5\u4efb\u610f\u653e\u7f6e\u7684\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u677f\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u6210\u529f\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u53cc\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u592a\u7a7a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8fde\u63a5\u4efb\u610f\u653e\u7f6e\u7684\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u677f\u6a21\u5757\u3002"}}

This structural inferiority is not a trivial issue; it directly impedes downstream testing activities by complicating automated test data generation and increasing the cognitive load for human engineers. This paper reframes basis path generation from a procedural search task into a declarative optimization problem. We introduce a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) framework designed to produce a complete basis path set that is globally optimal in its structural simplicity. Our framework includes two complementary strategies: a Holistic MIP model that guarantees a theoretically optimal path set, and a scalable Incremental MIP strategy for large, complex topologies. The incremental approach features a multi-objective function that prioritizes path simplicity and incorporates a novelty penalty to maximize the successful generation of linearly independent paths. Empirical evaluations on both real-code and large-scale synthetic Control Flow Graphs demonstrate that our Incremental MIP strategy achieves a 100\\% success rate in generating complete basis sets, while remaining computationally efficient.

In this paper, to overcome this limitation, we study Task-Oriented Shape Completion, a new task that focuses on completing the potential contact regions rather than the entire shape. We argue that shape completion for grasping should be explicitly guided by the downstream manipulation task. To achieve this, we first generate multiple task-oriented shape completion candidates by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities of object functional understanding from several pre-trained foundation models. A 3D discriminative autoencoder is then proposed to evaluate the plausibility of each generated candidate and optimize the most plausible one from a global perspective. A conditional flow-matching model named FlowGrasp is developed to generate task-oriented dexterous grasps from the optimized shape.

Multi-agentic collaborative frameworks using such LLMs place them at the center of solving software development-related tasks such as code generation. However, direct use of LLM generated code in production software development systems is problematic. The code could be unstable or erroneous and contain vulnerabilities such as data poisoning, malicious attacks, and hallucinations that could lead to widespread system malfunctions. This prohibits the adoption of LLM generated code in production AI systems where human code reviews and traditional secure testing tools are impractical or untrustworthy. In this paper, we discuss safety and reliability problems with the execution of LLM generated code and propose a Secure Transpiler and Executor of LLM-Generated Program (STELP), capable of executing LLM-generated code in a controlled and safe manner. STELP secures autonomous production AI systems involving code generation, filling the critical void left by the impracticality or limitations of traditional secure testing methodologies and human oversight. This includes applications such as headless code generation-execution and LLMs that produce executable code snippets as an action plan to be executed in real time. We contribute a human-validated dataset of insecure code snippets and benchmark our approach on publicly available datasets for correctness, safety, and latency.

To address this, we leverage multiple geometric cues, such as depth, optical flow, dynamic object segmentation, and point tracking. Combined with rigidity-based motion constraints, these cues allow us to estimate preliminary 3D scene dynamics during an initialization stage. Recovering scene dynamics prior to the photometric optimization reduces reliance on motion inference from visual appearance alone, which is often ambiguous in monocular settings. To enable compact representations, fast training, and real-time rendering while supporting non-rigid deformations, the scene is decomposed into static and dynamic components. Each Gaussian in the dynamic part of the scene is assigned a trajectory represented as time-dependent Poly-Fourier curve for parameter-efficient motion encoding.

We model latent tasks as probabilistic formal languages and introduce a tailored reactive synthesis framework that balances robot costs with user task preferences. Our methodology focuses on safety-constrained learning and inferring formal task specifications as Probabilistic Deterministic Finite Automata (PDFA). We adapt existing evidence-driven state merging algorithms and incorporate safety requirements throughout the learning process to ensure that the learned PDFA always complies with safety constraints. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-objective reactive synthesis algorithm that generates deterministic strategies that are guaranteed to satisfy the PDFA task while optimizing the trade-offs between user preferences and robot costs, resulting in a Pareto front of optimal solutions. Our approach models the interaction as a two-player game between the robot and the environment, accounting for dynamic changes. We present a computationally-tractable value iteration algorithm to generate the Pareto front and the corresponding deterministic strategies. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms across various robots and tasks, showing that the learned PDFA never includes unsafe behaviors and that synthesized strategies consistently achieve the task while meeting both the robot cost and user-preference requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u53cd\u5e94\u5408\u6210\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e73\u8861\u7528\u6237\u4efb\u52a1\u504f\u597d\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u6982\u7387\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6709\u9650\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\uff08PDFA\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u6f5c\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u5408\u5e76\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u53cd\u5e94\u5408\u6210\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u73a9\u5bb6\u535a\u5f08\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u503c\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684PDFA\u4e0d\u5305\u542b\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e14\u5408\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u6ee1\u8db3\u4efb\u52a1\u8981\u6c42\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6210\u672c\u548c\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6f14\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3b\u6267\u884c\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u53cd\u5e94\u5408\u6210\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684PDFA\u59cb\u7ec8\u7b26\u5408\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

While code language models have shown significant advancements, the current models and benchmarks are confined to high-readability code, which contains sufficient semantic cues such as function and variable names. In the real world, however, code is often poorly structured or obfuscated, significantly degrading model performance. In this paper, we first empirically evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art language models on poor-readability code for the task of code summarization, focusing on (1) their effectiveness, (2) the impact of prompt engineering, and (3) the robustness of different variants. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art models-including GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 experience a substantial performance drop when faced with poorly readable code, and that prompt engineering and reasoning-enhanced models offer limited improvements. Motivated by these findings, we propose RoFTCodeSum, a novel fine-tuning method that enhances the robustness of code summarization against poorly readable code. RoFTCodeSum marries the concepts of curriculum learning and meta-learning: based on the original dataset for fine-tuning, it creates curricular training sets, e.g., obfuscating function names and identifiers from the code, respectively, that have progressive difficulty in code comprehension. In each training step, the approach meta-updates the gradients using these progressively challenging datasets, thereby optimizing both accuracy and readability robustness simultaneously.

The ConvNeXtV1-small DL model was trained on the RSNA dataset and validated on the TecSalud dataset, while radiomics models were developed using the TecSalud dataset and validated with a leave-one-year-out approach. The ensemble method consistently combined and calibrated predictions using the same methodology.

Recent research employs reinforcement learning (RL) to end-to-end optimize the retrieval-augmented reasoning process, directly enhancing its capacity to resolve complex queries. However, reliable deployment is hindered by two obstacles. 1) Retrieval Collapse: iterative retrieval over large corpora fails to locate intermediate evidence containing bridge answers without reasoning-guided planning, causing downstream reasoning to collapse. 2) Learning Instability: end-to-end trajectory training suffers from weak credit assignment across reasoning chains and poor error localization across modules, causing overfitting to benchmark-specific heuristics that limit transferability and stability. To address these problems, we propose PRISMA, a decoupled RL-guided framework featuring a Plan-Retrieve-Inspect-Solve-Memoize architecture. PRISMA's strength lies in reasoning-guided collaboration: the Inspector provides reasoning-based feedback to refine the Planner's decomposition and fine-grained retrieval, while enforcing evidence-grounded reasoning in the Solver. We optimize individual agent capabilities via Two-Stage Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Stage I calibrates the Planner and Solver as specialized experts in planning and reasoning, while Stage II utilizes Observation-Aware Residual Policy Optimization (OARPO) to enhance the Inspector's ability to verify context and trigger targeted recovery.

However, human drivers exhibit bounded rationality, making approximately optimal decisions under cognitive and perceptual constraints. We propose EvoQRE, a principled framework for modeling safety-critical traffic interactions as general-sum Markov games solved via Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) and evolutionary game dynamics. EvoQRE integrates a pre-trained generative world model with entropy-regularized replicator dynamics, capturing stochastic human behavior while maintaining equilibrium structure. We provide rigorous theoretical results, proving that the proposed dynamics converge to Logit-QRE under a two-timescale stochastic approximation with an explicit convergence rate of O(log k / k^{1/3}) under weak monotonicity assumptions. We further extend QRE to continuous action spaces using mixture-based and energy-based policy representations.

Performance optimization, while critical, is a time-consuming and often manual process. One of the most complex tasks in this domain is modifying the Document Object Model (DOM), which is why this study focuses on it. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue to automate this complex task, potentially transforming how developers address web performance issues. This study evaluates the effectiveness of nine state-of-the-art LLMs for automated web performance issue resolution. For this purpose, we first extracted the DOM trees of 15 popular webpages (e.g., Facebook), and then we used Lighthouse to retrieve their performance audit reports. Subsequently, we passed the extracted DOM trees and corresponding audits to each model for resolution. Our study considers 7 unique audit categories, revealing that LLMs universally excel at SEO & Accessibility issues. However, their efficacy in performance-critical DOM manipulations is mixed. While high-performing models like GPT-4.1 delivered significant reductions in areas like Initial Load, Interactivity, and Network Optimization (e.g., 46.52% to 48.68% audit incidence reductions), others, such as GPT-4o-mini, notably underperformed, consistently.

While quaternion neural networks improve parameter efficiency by coupling multiple channels through Hamilton products, they typically retain unstructured dense weights; conversely, structured matrices enable fast computation but are usually applied in the real domain. This paper introduces EdgeLDR, a practical framework for quaternion block-circulant linear and convolutional layers that combines quaternion channel mixing with block-circulant parameter structure and enables FFT-based evaluation through the complex adjoint representation. We present reference implementations of EdgeLDR layers and compare FFT-based computation against a naive spatial-domain realization of quaternion circulant products. FFT evaluation yields large empirical speedups over the naive implementation and keeps latency stable as block size increases, making larger compression factors computationally viable. We further integrate EdgeLDR layers into compact CNN and Transformer backbones and evaluate accuracy-compression trade-offs on 32x32 RGB classification (CIFAR-10/100, SVHN) and hyperspectral image classification (Houston 2013, Pavia University), reporting parameter counts and CPU/GPU latency.

Its diagnosis by biopsy requires a high level of expertise and precision from the surgeon, so the results are highly operator-dependent. The aim of this work is to develop a robotic system for assisted ultrasound (US) examination of the prostate, a prebiopsy step that could reduce the dexterity requirements and enable faster, more accurate and more available prostate biopsy. We developed and validated a laboratory setup with a collaborative robotic arm that can autonomously scan a prostate phantom and attached the phantom to a medical robotic arm that mimics the patient's movements. The scanning robot keeps the relative position of the US probe and the prostate constant, ensuring a consistent and robust approach to reconstructing the prostate. To reconstruct the prostate, each slice is segmented to generate a series of prostate contours converted into a 3D point cloud used for biopsy planning. The average scan time of the prostate was 30 s, and the average 3D reconstruction of the prostate took 3 s. We performed four motion scenarios: the phantom was scanned in a stationary state (S), with horizontal motion (H), with vertical motion (V), and with a combination of the two (C). System validation is performed by registering the prostate point cloud reconstructions acquired during different motions (H, V, C) with those obtained in the stationary state.

This shift introduces a new category of integration defects that arise not only from code errors but also from misaligned interactions among LLM-specific artifacts, including prompts, API calls, configurations, and model outputs. However, existing defect localization techniques are ineffective at identifying these LLM-specific integration defects because they fail to capture cross-layer dependencies across heterogeneous artifacts, cannot exploit incomplete or misleading error traces, and lack semantic reasoning capabilities for identifying root causes.\n  To address these challenges, we propose LIDL, a multi-agent framework for defect localization in LLM-integrated software. LIDL (1) constructs a code knowledge graph enriched with LLM-aware annotations that represent interaction boundaries across source code, prompts, and configuration files, (2) fuses three complementary sources of error evidence inferred by LLMs to surface candidate defect locations, and (3) applies context-aware validation that uses counterfactual reasoning to distinguish true root causes from propagated symptoms. We evaluate LIDL on 146 real-world defect instances collected from 105 GitHub repositories and 16 agent-based systems. The results show that LIDL significantly outperforms five state-of-the-art baselines across all metrics, achieving a Top-3 accuracy of 0.64 and a MAP of 0.48, which represents a 64.1% improvement over the best-performing baseline.

This ambiguity is particularly consequential in medicine where uncertainty is pervasive. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic paradigm to theoretically explain how high certainty in ground truth answers is almost always necessary for even an expert to achieve high scores, whereas in datasets with high variation in ground truth answers there may be little difference between a random labeller and an expert. Therefore, ignoring uncertainty in ground truth evaluation data can result in the misleading conclusion that a non-expert has similar performance to that of an expert. Using the probabilistic paradigm, we thus bring forth the concepts of expected accuracy and expected F1 to estimate the score an expert human or system can achieve given ground truth answer variability.\n  Our work leads to the recommendation that when establishing the capability of a system, results should be stratified by probability of the ground truth answer, typically measured by the agreement rate of ground truth experts. Stratification becomes critical when the overall performance drops below a threshold of 80%. Under stratified evaluation, performance comparison becomes more reliable in high certainty bins, mitigating the effect of the key confounding factor -- uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6982\u7387\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u5e94\u8003\u8651\u5730\u9762\u771f\u5b9e\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5206\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u901a\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u4e13\u5bb6\u5730\u9762\u771f\u5b9e\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6982\u7387\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u89e3\u91ca\u9ad8\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5730\u9762\u771f\u5b9e\u7b54\u6848\u5bf9\u4e13\u5bb6\u9ad8\u5206\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u9884\u671f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u9884\u671fF1\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u9ad8\u53d8\u5f02\u5730\u9762\u771f\u5b9e\u7b54\u6848\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u53ef\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0d\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5ffd\u7565\u5730\u9762\u771f\u5b9e\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u5373\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u529b\u65f6\uff0c\u6309\u5730\u9762\u771f\u5b9e\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u6982\u7387\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5c42\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u4f4e\u4e8e80%\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u3002"}}

With the increasing integration of machine learning (ML) components into software systems, effective logging has become critical to ensure reproducibility, traceability, and observability throughout model training and deployment. Although various general-purpose and ML-specific logging frameworks exist, little is known about how these tools are actually used in practice or whether ML practitioners adopt consistent and effective logging strategies. To date, no empirical study has systematically characterized recurring bad logging practices--or logging smells--in ML System. \\underline{Goal:} This study aims to empirically identify and characterize logging smells in ML systems, providing an evidence-based understanding of how logging is implemented and challenged in practice. \\underline{Method:} We propose to conduct a large-scale mining of open-source ML repositories hosted on GitHub to catalogue recurring logging smells. Subsequently, a practitioner survey involving ML engineers will be conducted to assess the perceived relevance, severity, and frequency of the identified smells. \\underline{Limitations:} % While The study's limitations include that While our findings may not be generalizable to closed-source industrial projects, we believe our study provides an essential step toward understanding and improving logging practices in ML development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6316\u6398\u5f00\u6e90\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9879\u76ee\u548c\u8c03\u67e5\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5473\uff0c\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u65e5\u5fd7\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u8bb0\u5f55\u5bf9\u786e\u4fdd\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u65e5\u5fd7\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9GitHub\u4e0a\u6258\u7ba1\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f00\u6e90\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4ed3\u5e93\u8fdb\u884c\u6316\u6398\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bb0\u5f55\u91cd\u590d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5473\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5df2\u8bc6\u522b\u5f02\u5473\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u548c\u9891\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5473\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bc1\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u63cf\u8ff0\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5473\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002"}}

To address this shortcoming, we propose a multi-task learning framework to fine-tune BiomedCLIP and evaluate improvements to CXR image-text retrieval. Using BiomedCLIP as the backbone, we incorporate a lightweight MLP projector head trained with a multi-task composite loss function that includes: (1) a binary cross-entropy loss to distinguish normal from abnormal CXR studies, (2) a supervised contrastive loss to reinforce intra-class consistency, and (3) a CLIP loss to maintain cross-modal alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned model achieves more balanced and clinically meaningful performance across both image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval tasks compared to the pretrained BiomedCLIP and general-purpose CLIP models. Furthermore, t-SNE visualizations reveal clearer semantic clustering of normal and abnormal cases, demonstrating the model's enhanced diagnostic sensitivity.

This system enables passengers to issue high-level commands, from querying status information to modifying driving behavior. Our methodology is grounded in three key components: a taxonomization of interaction categories, an application-centric Domain Specific Language (DSL) for command translation, and a safety-preserving validation layer. A two-stage LLM architecture ensures high transparency by providing feedback based on the definitive execution status. Evaluation confirms the system's timing efficiency and translation robustness.

However, existing techniques primarily generate regression oracles that predicate on the implemented behavior of the class under test. They do not address the oracle problem: the challenge of distinguishing correct from incorrect program behavior. With the rise of Foundation Models (FMs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a new opportunity to generate test oracles that reflect intended behavior. This positions LLMs as enablers of Promptware, where software creation and testing are driven by natural-language prompts. This paper presents an empirical study on the effectiveness of LLMs in generating test oracles that expose software failures. We investigate how different prompting strategies and levels of contextual input impact the quality of LLM-generated oracles.

We develop a two-stage optimization scheme for it, including agentic reinforcement learning (RL) followed by parallel test-time scaling (TTS).

As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to robotics decision-making, the physical dimension of risk grows; a single wrong instruction can directly endanger human safety. This paper addresses the urgent need to systematically evaluate LLM performance in scenarios where even minor errors are catastrophic. Through a qualitative evaluation of a fire evacuation scenario, we identified critical failure cases in LLM-based decision-making. Based on these, we designed seven tasks for quantitative assessment, categorized into: Complete Information, Incomplete Information, and Safety-Oriented Spatial Reasoning (SOSR). Complete information tasks utilize ASCII maps to minimize interpretation ambiguity and isolate spatial reasoning from visual processing. Incomplete information tasks require models to infer missing context, testing for spatial continuity versus hallucinations. SOSR tasks use natural language to evaluate safe decision-making in life-threatening contexts. We benchmark various LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across these tasks. Beyond aggregate performance, we analyze the implications of a 1% failure rate, highlighting how \"rare\" errors escalate into catastrophic outcomes. Results reveal serious vulnerabilities: several models achieved a 0% success rate in ASCII navigation, while in a simulated fire drill, models instructed robots to move toward hazardous areas instead of emergency exits. Our findings lead to a sobering conclusion: current LLMs are not ready for direct deployment in safety-critical systems. A 99% accuracy rate is dangerously misleading in robotics, as it implies one out of every hundred executions could result in catastrophic harm. We demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models cannot guarantee safety, and absolute reliance on them creates unacceptable risks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c99%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u707e\u96be\u6027\u540e\u679c\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u8c28\u614e\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u53ef\u80fd\u5371\u53ca\u751f\u547d\uff0c\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u5fae\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u5373\u81f4\u547d\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u706b\u707e\u758f\u6563\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u8bc6\u522bLLM\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5931\u8d25\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e03\u9879\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5b8c\u6574\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u5bfc\u5411\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5728ASCII\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e3a0%\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u706b\u707e\u6f14\u4e60\u4e2d\u751a\u81f3\u6307\u793a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5411\u5371\u9669\u533a\u57df\u79fb\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5c1a\u672a\u51c6\u5907\u597d\u76f4\u63a5\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c99%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u610f\u5473\u7740\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

While organizations increasingly adopt PaC tools, the software engineering community lacks an empirical understanding of how these tools are used in real-world development practices.\n  \\textbf{Objective:} This paper aims to bridge this gap by conducting the first large-scale study of PaC usage in open-source software. Our goal is to characterize how PaC tools are adopted, what purposes they serve, and what governance activities they support across diverse software ecosystems.\n  \\textbf{Method:} We analyzed 399 GitHub repositories using nine widely adopted PaC tools. Our mixed-methods approach combines quantitative analysis of tool usage and project characteristics with a qualitative investigation of policy files. We further employ a Large Language Model (LLM)--assisted classification pipeline, refined through expert validation, to derive a taxonomy of PaC usage consisting of 5 categories and 15 sub-categories.\n  \\textbf{Results:} Our study reveals substantial diversity in PaC adoption. PaC tools are frequently used in early-stage projects and are heavily oriented toward governance, configuration control, and documentation. We also observe emerging PaC usage in MLOps pipelines and strong co-usage patterns, such as between OPA and Gatekeeper.

Despite performance improvements from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), current models lack a mechanism to trace how small targets trigger directional, layer-wise perturbations in the feature space, which is an essential cue for distinguishing signal from structured noise in infrared scenes. To address this limitation, we propose the Trajectory-Aware Mamba Propagation Network (TAPM-Net), which explicitly models the spatial diffusion behavior of target-induced feature disturbances. TAPM-Net is built upon two novel components: a Perturbation-guided Path Module (PGM) and a Trajectory-Aware State Block (TASB). The PGM constructs perturbation energy fields from multi-level features and extracts gradient-following feature trajectories that reflect the directionality of local responses. The resulting feature trajectories are fed into the TASB, a Mamba-based state-space unit that models dynamic propagation along each trajectory while incorporating velocity-constrained diffusion and semantically aligned feature fusion from word-level and sentence-level embeddings. Unlike existing attention-based methods, TAPM-Net enables anisotropic, context-sensitive state transitions along spatial trajectories while maintaining global coherence at low computational cost. Experiments on NUAA-SIRST and IRSTD-1K demonstrate that TAPM-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in ISTD.", "AI": {"tldr": "TAPM-Net\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u76ee\u6807\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408PGM\u548cTASB\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ea2\u5916\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u7ea2\u5916\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u89e6\u53d1\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u3001\u9010\u5c42\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u533a\u5206\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u566a\u58f0\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "TAPM-Net\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u6270\u52a8\u5f15\u5bfc\u8def\u5f84\u6a21\u5757\uff08PGM\uff09\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u611f\u77e5\u72b6\u6001\u5757\uff08TASB\uff09\u3002PGM\u4ece\u591a\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u6784\u5efa\u6270\u52a8\u80fd\u91cf\u573a\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6\u68af\u5ea6\u8ddf\u968f\u7279\u5f81\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0cTASB\u5219\u57fa\u4e8eMamba\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u52a8\u6001\u4f20\u64ad\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728NUAA-SIRST\u548cIRSTD-1K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTAPM-Net\u5728\u7ea2\u5916\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "TAPM-Net\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u76ee\u6807\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u6563\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ea2\u5916\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728NUAA-SIRST\u548cIRSTD-1K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u3002"}}

These heuristics can be recomposed to support various activities (e.g., live programming or history usage navigation). While this system is powerful, it does not account for the repository structure when suggesting global names such as class names, class variables, or global variables. As a result, it does not prioritize classes within the same package or project, treating all global names equally. In this paper, we present a new heuristic that addresses this limitation. Our approach searches variable names in a structured manner: it begins with the package of the requesting class, then expands to other packages within the same repository, and finally considers the global namespace. We describe the logic behind this heuristic and evaluate it against the default semantic heuristic and one that directly queries the global namespace.

While robust for general-purpose assistants, this one-size-fits-all ethical framework imposes a \"transparency tax\" on professional domains requiring strategic ambiguity and information withholding, such as public relations, negotiation, and crisis management. To measure this gap between general safety and professional utility, we introduce Crisis-Bench, a multi-agent Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that evaluates LLMs in high-stakes corporate crises. Spanning 80 diverse storylines across 8 industries, Crisis-Bench tasks an LLM-based Public Relations (PR) Agent with navigating a dynamic 7-day corporate crisis simulation while managing strictly separated Private and Public narrative states to enforce rigorous information asymmetry. Unlike traditional benchmarks that rely on static ground truths, we introduce the Adjudicator-Market Loop: a novel evaluation metric where public sentiment is adjudicated and translated into a simulated stock price, creating a realistic economic incentive structure. Our results expose a critical dichotomy: while some models capitulate to ethical concerns, others demonstrate the capacity for Machiavellian, legitimate strategic withholding in order to stabilize the simulated stock price.

To facilitate the exchange and utilization of SBOMs, organizations such as the Linux Foundation and OWASP have proposed SBOM standards. Following standards, organizations have developed tools for generating and utilizing SBOMs. However, limited research has examined the adherence of these SBOM tools to standard specifications, a gap that could lead to compliance failures and disruptions in SBOM utilization. This paper presents the first large-scale, two-stage empirical analysis of the adherence gap, using our automated evaluation framework, SAP. The evaluation, comprising a baseline evaluation and a one-year longitudinal follow-up, covers 55,444 SBOMs generated by six SBOM tools from 3,287 real-world repositories. Our analysis reveals persistent, fundamental limitations in current SBOM tools: (1) inadequate compliance support with policy requirements; (2) poor tool consistencies, including inter-tool consistency rates as low as 7.84% to 12.77% for package detection across languages, and significant longitudinal inconsistency, where tools show low consistency with their own prior versions; and (3) mediocre to poor accuracy for detailed software information, e.g., accuracy of package licenses below 20%.

However, accurate imaging of roots in subterranean environments remains a persistent challenge due to adverse conditions such as occlusion, varying soil moisture, and inherently low contrast, which limit the effectiveness of conventional vision-based approaches. In this work, we propose a novel underground imaging system that captures multiple overlapping views of plant roots and integrates a deep learning-based Multi-Image Super Resolution (MISR) framework designed to enhance root visibility and detail. To train and evaluate our approach, we construct a synthetic dataset that simulates realistic underground imaging scenarios, incorporating key environmental factors that affect image quality. Our proposed MISR algorithm leverages spatial redundancy across views to reconstruct high-resolution images with improved structural fidelity and visual clarity. Quantitative evaluations show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art super resolution baselines, achieving a 2.3 percent reduction in BRISQUE, indicating improved image quality with the same CLIP-IQA score, thereby enabling enhanced phenotypic analysis of root systems. This, in turn, facilitates accurate estimation of critical root traits, including root hair count and root hair density.

However, despite their theoretical promise, the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to fraud detection in real-world financial contexts remains largely unexploited, and their practical effectiveness in handling domain-specific e-commerce transaction data has yet to be empirically validated. To bridge this gap between conventional machine learning limitations and the untapped potential of LLMs in fraud detection, this paper proposes a novel approach that employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to post-train lightweight language models specifically for fraud detection tasks using only raw transaction data. We utilize the Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) algorithm combined with a rule-based reward system to fine-tune language models of various sizes on a real-life transaction dataset provided by a Chinese global payment solution company. Through this reinforcement learning framework, the language models are encouraged to explore diverse trust and risk signals embedded within the textual transaction data, including patterns in customer information, shipping details, product descriptions, and order history. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with post-trained language models achieving substantial F1-score improvements on held-out test data. Our findings demonstrate that the observed performance improvements are primarily attributable to the exploration mechanism inherent in reinforcement learning, which allows models to discover novel fraud indicators beyond those captured by traditional engineered features.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6b3a\u8bc8\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u91d1\u878d\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e94\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u4ea4\u6613\u6570\u636e\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5c40\u9650\u4e0eLLMs\u672a\u5f00\u53d1\u6f5c\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO)\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u539f\u59cb\u4ea4\u6613\u6570\u636e\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u4e3b\u8981\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u5de5\u7a0b\u7279\u5f81\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6b3a\u8bc8\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63a2\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u5728\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u578b\u6b3a\u8bc8\u6307\u6807\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

In software engineering (SE), these models now support diverse activities, accelerating automation and decision-making. Yet, evidence shows that these models can reproduce or amplify social biases, raising fairness concerns. Recent work on neuron editing has shown that internal activations in pre-trained transformers can be traced and modified to alter model behavior. Building on the concept of knowledge neurons, neurons that encode factual information, we hypothesize the existence of biased neurons that capture stereotypical associations within pre-trained transformers. To test this hypothesis, we build a dataset of biased relations, i.e., triplets encoding stereotypes across nine bias types, and adapt neuron attribution strategies to trace and suppress biased neurons in BERT models. We then assess the impact of suppression on SE tasks. Our findings show that biased knowledge is localized within small neuron subsets, and suppressing them substantially reduces bias with minimal performance loss. This demonstrates that bias in transformers can be traced and mitigated at the neuron level, offering an interpretable approach to fairness in SE.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5c11\u6570\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u5b83\u4eec\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u89c1\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7f16\u8f91\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u504f\u89c1\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5f52\u56e0\u7b56\u7565\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5e76\u6291\u5236BERT\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6291\u5236\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u504f\u89c1\u77e5\u8bc6\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u4e2d\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u8fd9\u4e9b\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u89c1\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u77e5\u8bc6\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5c11\u6570\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u4e2d\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u8fd9\u4e9b\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u89c1\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u6700\u5c0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, click data is heavily biased, i.e., users tend to click higher-ranked items (position bias), choose only what was shown to them (selection bias), and trust top results more (trust bias). Without explicitly modeling these biases, the true relevance of ranked items cannot be correctly learned from clicks. Existing Unbiased Learning-to-Rank (ULTR) methods mainly correct position bias and rely on propensity estimation, but they cannot measure remaining bias, provide risk guarantees, or jointly handle multiple bias sources. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel causal learning-based ranking framework that extends ULTR by combining Structural Causal Models (SCMs) with information-theoretic tools. SCMs specify how clicks are generated and help identify the true relevance signal from click data, while conditional mutual information, measures how much bias leaks into the\n  learned relevance estimates. We use this leakage measure to define a rigorous notion of disentanglement and include it as a regularizer during model training to reduce bias. In addition, we incorporate a causal inference estimator, i.e., doubly robust estimator, to ensure more reliable risk estimation. Experiments on standard Learning-to-Rank benchmarks show that our method consistently reduces measured bias leakage and improves ranking performance, especially in realistic scenarios where multiple biases-such as position and trust bias-interact strongly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u6392\u5e8f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u6e90\u70b9\u51fb\u504f\u5dee\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6392\u5e8f\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7528\u6237\u70b9\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\uff08\u5982\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u504f\u5dee\uff09\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u504f\u5b66\u4e60\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u503e\u5411\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u8861\u91cf\u5269\u4f59\u504f\u5dee\u6216\u8054\u5408\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6e90\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff08SCMs\uff09\u6765\u660e\u786e\u70b9\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u5316\u504f\u5dee\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u5219\u9879\u878d\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u91cd\u7a33\u5065\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u98ce\u9669\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5b66\u4e60\u6392\u5e8f\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u504f\u5dee\u6cc4\u6f0f\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6392\u5e8f\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6e90\u504f\u5dee\uff08\u5982\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u504f\u5dee\uff09\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u6392\u5e8f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u504f\u5b66\u4e60\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u4fdd\u8bc1\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6392\u5e8f\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we present Drivora, a unified and extensible infrastructure for search-based ADS testing built on the widely used CARLA simulator. Drivora introduces a unified scenario definition, OpenScenario, that specifies scenarios using low-level, actionable parameters to ensure compatibility with existing methods while supporting extensibility to new testing designs (e.g., multi-autonomous-vehicle testing). On top of this, Drivora decouples the testing engine, scenario execution, and ADS integration. The testing engine leverages evolutionary computation to explore new scenarios and supports flexible customization of core components. The scenario execution can run arbitrary scenarios using a parallel execution mechanism that maximizes hardware utilization for large-scale batch simulation. For ADS integration, Drivora provides access to 12 ADSs through a unified interface, streamlining configuration and simplifying the incorporation of new ADSs.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Cumulative Path-Level Semantic Reasoning for inductive knowledge graph completion (CPSR) framework, which simultaneously captures both the structural and semantic information of KGs to enhance the inductive KGC task. Specifically, the proposed CPSR employs a query-dependent masking module to adaptively mask noisy structural information while retaining important information closely related to the targets. Additionally, CPSR introduces a global semantic scoring module that evaluates both the individual contributions and the collective impact of nodes along the reasoning path within KGs. The experimental results demonstrate that CPSR achieves state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "CPSR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5f52\u7eb3KGC\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f52\u7eb3KGC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65b0\u5174\u5b9e\u4f53\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u566a\u58f0\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f9d\u8d56\u6355\u83b7\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "CPSR\u91c7\u7528\u67e5\u8be2\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u6a21\u5757\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fc7\u6ee4\u566a\u58f0\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u8bc4\u5206\u6a21\u5757\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u4e2d\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eCPSR\u5728\u5f52\u7eb3\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u8865\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "CPSR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f52\u7eb3\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u8865\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

However, specifying precise goals for these models remains a challenge; text instructions are often too abstract to capture physical nuances, while target images are frequently infeasible to specify for dynamic tasks. To address this, we introduce Goal Force, a novel framework that allows users to define goals via explicit force vectors and intermediate dynamics, mirroring how humans conceptualize physical tasks. We train a video generation model on a curated dataset of synthetic causal primitives-such as elastic collisions and falling dominos-teaching it to propagate forces through time and space. Despite being trained on simple physics data, our model exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to complex, real-world scenarios, including tool manipulation and multi-object causal chains.

Framing human-model interaction as a control process, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate the controllable sets of models in a dialogue setting. Notably, we provide formal guarantees on the estimation error as a function of sample complexity: we derive probably-approximately correct bounds for controllable set estimates that are distribution-free, employ no assumptions except for output boundedness, and work for any black-box nonlinear control system (i.e., any generative model). We empirically demonstrate the theoretical framework on different tasks in controlling dialogue processes, for both language models and text-to-image generation.

Yet, current advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) usually remain structurally blind to this information. LLMs process characters as textual tokens, while MLLMs additionally view them as raw pixel grids. Both fall short to model the underlying logic of character strokes. Furthermore, existing structural analysis methods are often script-specific and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose Hieroglyphic Stroke Analyzer (HieroSA), a novel and generalizable framework that enables MLLMs to automatically derive stroke-level structures from character bitmaps without handcrafted data. It transforms modern logographic and ancient hieroglyphs character images into explicit, interpretable line-segment representations in a normalized coordinate space, allowing for cross-lingual generalization.

To address these problems, we propose HAG, a Hierarchical Agent Generation framework that formalizes population generation as a two-stage decision process. Firstly, utilizing a World Knowledge Model to infer hierarchical conditional probabilities to construct the Topic-Adaptive Tree, achieving macro-level distribution alignment. Then, grounded real-world data, instantiation and agentic augmentation are carried out to ensure micro-level consistency.

However, software vendors often silently patch vulnerabilities with limited disclosure, where Security Patch Detection (SPD) comes to protect software assets. Recently, most SPD studies have targeted Open-Source Software (OSS), yet a large portion of real-world software is closed-source, where patches are distributed as binaries without accessible source code. The limited binary SPD approaches often lift binaries to abstraction levels, i.e., assembly code or pseudo-code. However, assembly code is register-based instructions conveying limited semantics, while pseudo-code lacks parser-compatible grammar to extract structure, both hindering accurate vulnerability-fix representation learning. In addition, previous studies often obtain training and testing data from the same project for evaluation, which fails to reflect closed-source conditions.

Our novel design of the adapters in the graph branch effectively aligns the representations between assembly code and pseudo-code at the LLM's token level. We further present a two-stage training strategy to address the optimization imbalance caused by the large parameter disparity between StriderSPD's two branches, which enables proper branch fitting.

Our work introduces a paradigm shift from conventional pixel-based video generation to the creation of high-fidelity avatar with swapped faces. The framework first preprocesses target video to extract FLAME parameters, camera poses and segmentation masks, and then rigs 3D Gaussian splats to the FLAME model across frames, enabling dynamic facial control. To ensure identity preserving, we propose an compound identity embedding constructed from three state-of-the-art face recognition models for avatar finetuning.

However, efficiently modeling and optimizing hybrid discrete-continuous action space remains a fundamental challenge, mainly due to limited policy expressiveness and poor scalability in high-dimensional settings. To address this challenge, we view the hybrid action space problem as a fully cooperative game and propose a \\textbf{Cooperative Hybrid Diffusion Policies (CHDP)} framework to solve it. CHDP employs two cooperative agents that leverage a discrete and a continuous diffusion policy, respectively. The continuous policy is conditioned on the discrete action's representation, explicitly modeling the dependency between them. This cooperative design allows the diffusion policies to leverage their expressiveness to capture complex distributions in their respective action spaces. To mitigate the update conflicts arising from simultaneous policy updates in this cooperative setting, we employ a sequential update scheme that fosters co-adaptation. Moreover, to improve scalability when learning in high-dimensional discrete action space, we construct a codebook that embeds the action space into a low-dimensional latent space.

At extreme far distances, VPReID is highly challenging due to severe resolution degradation, drastic viewpoint variation and inevitable appearance noise. To address these issues, we propose a Scale-Adaptive framework with Shape Priors for VPReID, named SAS-VPReID. The framework is built upon three complementary modules. First, we deploy a Memory-Enhanced Visual Backbone (MEVB) to extract discriminative feature representations, which leverages the CLIP vision encoder and multi-proxy memory. Second, we propose a Multi-Granularity Temporal Modeling (MGTM) to construct sequences at multiple temporal granularities and adaptively emphasize motion cues across scales. Third, we incorporate Prior-Regularized Shape Dynamics (PRSD) to capture body structure dynamics. With these modules, our framework can obtain more discriminative feature representations.

In this paper, we identify a distinct failure mode termed Circular Reasoning. Unlike traditional model degeneration, this phenomenon manifests as a self-reinforcing trap where generated content acts as a logical premise for its own recurrence, compelling the reiteration of preceding text. To systematically analyze this phenomenon, we introduce LoopBench, a dataset designed to capture two distinct loop typologies: numerical loops and statement loops. Mechanistically, we characterize circular reasoning as a state collapse exhibiting distinct boundaries, where semantic repetition precedes textual repetition. We reveal that reasoning impasses trigger the loop onset, which subsequently persists as an inescapable cycle driven by a self-reinforcing V-shaped attention mechanism. Guided by these findings, we employ the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm to capture these precursors for early loop prediction.

However, logical defects in DeFi staking could enable attackers to claim unwarranted rewards by manipulating reward amounts, repeatedly claiming rewards, or engaging in other malicious actions. To mitigate these threats, we conducted the first study focused on defining and detecting logical defects in DeFi staking. Through the analysis of 64 security incidents and 144 audit reports, we identified six distinct types of logical defects, each accompanied by detailed descriptions and code examples. Building on this empirical research, we developed SSR (Safeguarding Staking Reward), a static analysis tool designed to detect logical defects in DeFi staking contracts. SSR utilizes a large language model (LLM) to extract fundamental information about staking logic and constructs a DeFi staking model. It then identifies logical defects by analyzing the model and the associated semantic features. We constructed a ground truth dataset based on known security incidents and audit reports to evaluate the effectiveness of SSR.

Our approach leverages feature discrepancy maps between modalities to guide feature extraction, followed by a fusion process across both channel and spatial dimensions. In the channel dimension, a channel-exchange module enhances channel-wise interaction through cross-attention dual state space modeling, enabling adaptive feature reweighting. In the spatial dimension, a spatial-exchange module employs cross-modal state space scanning to achieve comprehensive spatial fusion.

Using the LogiKEy methodology, we embed a range of classical and non-classical formalisms into higher-order logic (HOL), enabling a systematic comparison of inference quality, explanation refinement, and proof behavior. We focus on normative reasoning, where the choice of logic has significant implications. In particular, we compare logic-external approaches, where normative requirements are encoded via axioms, with logic-internal approaches, where normative patterns emerge from the logic's built-in structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that logic-internal strategies can consistently improve performance and produce more efficient hybrid proofs for NLI. In addition, we show that the effectiveness of a logic is domain-dependent, with first-order logic favouring commonsense reasoning, while deontic and modal logics excel in ethical domains.

To mitigate this limitation, mainstream approaches typically rely on external control signals to explicitly constrain the spatial layout, local semantic and visual attributes of images. However, this strong dependency makes the input format rigid, rendering it incompatible with the heterogeneous resource conditions of users and diverse constraint requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MoGen, a user-friendly multi-object image generation method. First, we design a Regional Semantic Anchor (RSA) module that precisely anchors phrase units in language descriptions to their corresponding image regions during the generation process, enabling text-to-image generation that follows quantity specifications for multiple objects. Building upon this foundation, we further introduce an Adaptive Multi-modal Guidance (AMG) module, which adaptively parses and integrates various combinations of multi-source control signals to formulate corresponding structured intent. This intent subsequently guides selective constraints on scene layouts and object attributes, achieving dynamic fine-grained control.

Recent work has shown that sequence-level verification leads to a higher number of accepted tokens compared to token-wise verification. However, existing solutions often rely on surrogate approximations or are constrained by partial information, struggling with joint intractability. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), a provably lossless verification method that significantly boosts the expected number of accepted tokens and overcomes joint intractability by balancing excess and deficient probability mass across accessible branches. Our extensive large-scale experiments demonstrate that HSD yields consistent improvements in acceptance rates across diverse model families and benchmarks.

Existing hallucination detection methods primarily rely on output logits or external verification tools, often overlooking their internal mechanisms. In this work, we investigate the outputs of internal attention heads, postulating that specific heads carry the primary signals for truthful generation.However, directly probing these high-dimensional states is challenging due to the entanglement of visual-linguistic syntax and noise. To address this, we propose VIB-Probe, a novel hallucination detection and mitigation framework leveraging the Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) theory. Our method extracts discriminative patterns across layers and heads while filtering out semantic nuisances through the information bottleneck principle. Furthermore, by leveraging the gradients of our VIB probe, we identify attention heads with strong causal influence on hallucinations and introduce an inference-time intervention strategy for hallucination mitigation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that VIB-Probe significantly outperforms existing baselines in both settings.

The benchmark stratifies 200 subjects into four visibility categories: high, medium, low, and zero--based on the extent and nature of their information available online.

UniADet is highly simple (learning only decoupled weights), parameter-efficient (only 0.002M learnable parameters), general (adapting a variety of foundation models), and effective (surpassing state-of-the-art zero-/few-shot by a large margin and even full-shot AD methods for the first time) on 14 real-world AD benchmarks covering both industrial and medical domains.

Recently, researchers have further investigated Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) frameworks, which enhance the reasoning and collaboration capabilities of MAS through information exchange and debate among multiple agents. However, existing approaches often rely on unguided initialization, causing agents to adopt identical reasoning paths that lead to the same errors. As a result, effective debate among agents is hindered, and the final outcome frequently degenerates into simple majority voting. To solve the above problem, in this paper, we introduce Dynamic Multi-Agent Debate (DynaDebate), which enhances the effectiveness of multi-agent debate through three key mechanisms: (1) Dynamic Path Generation and Allocation, which employs a dedicated Path Generation Agent to generate diverse and logical solution paths with adaptive redundancy; (2) Process-Centric Debate, which shifts the focus from surface-level outcome voting to rigorous step-by-step logic critique to ensure process correctness; (3) A Trigger-Based Verification Agent, which is activated upon disagreement and uses external tools to objectively resolve deadlocks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DynaDebate achieves superior performance across various benchmarks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art MAD methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "DynaDebate\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u5927\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MAD\u6846\u67b6\u56e0\u65e0\u5f15\u5bfc\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u91c7\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u76f8\u540c\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u8fa9\u8bba\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u679c\u9000\u5316\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Dynamic Multi-Agent Debate (DynaDebate)\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u5f84\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u5206\u914d\u3001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8fa9\u8bba\u548c\u89e6\u53d1\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ee3\u7406\u4e09\u5927\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eDynaDebate\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709MAD\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DynaDebate\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u5f84\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u5206\u914d\u3001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8fa9\u8bba\u548c\u89e6\u53d1\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ee3\u7406\u4e09\u5927\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684MAD\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, acquiring a large amount of labeled facial expression data is often costly. Therefore, it is particularly important to design a semi-supervised facial expression recognition algorithm that makes full use of both labeled and unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised facial expression recognition algorithm based on Dynamic Threshold Adjustment (DTA) and Selective Negative Learning (SNL). Initially, we designed strategies for local attention enhancement and random dropout of feature maps during feature extraction, which strengthen the representation of local features while ensuring the model does not overfit to any specific local area. Furthermore, this study introduces a dynamic thresholding method to adapt to the requirements of the semi-supervised learning framework for facial expression recognition tasks, and through a selective negative learning strategy, it fully utilizes unlabeled samples with low confidence by mining useful expression information from complementary labels, achieving impressive results.

Top-performing CUAs are framework-based systems that decompose planning and execution, while end-to-end screenshot-to-action policies are easier to deploy but lag behind on benchmarks such as OSWorld-Verified. GUI datasets like OSWorld pose two bottlenecks: they expose only a few hundred interactive, verifiable tasks and environments, and expert trajectories must be gathered by interacting with these environments, making such data hard to scale. We therefore ask how reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) can best exploit a small pool of exist expert trajectories to train end-to-end policies. Naively mixing these off-policy traces into on-policy RLVR is brittle: even after format conversion, expert trajectories exhibit structural mismatch and distribution shift from the learner. We propose BEPA (Bi-Level Expert-to-Policy Assimilation), which turns static expert traces into policy-aligned guidance via self-rolled reachable trajectories under the base policy (LEVEL-1) and a per-task, dynamically updated cache used in RLVR (LEVEL-2). On OSWorld-Verified, BEPA improves UITARS1.5-7B success from 22.87% to 32.13% and raises a held-out split from 5.74% to 10.30%, with consistent gains on MMBench-GUI and Online-Mind2Web.

This covert harm is harder to detect than explicit misinformation yet remains underexplored. To address this gap, we develop a multi-stage pipeline that disentangles and simulates preview-based versus context-based understanding, enabling construction of the MM-Misleading benchmark. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate open-source LVLMs and uncover pronounced blind spots to omission-based misleadingness detection. We further propose OMGuard, which integrates (1) Interpretation-Aware Fine-Tuning, which used to improve multimodal misleadingness detection and (2) Rationale-Guided Misleading Content Correction, which uses explicit rationales to guide headline rewriting and reduce misleading impressions. Experiments show that OMGuard lifts an 8B model's detection accuracy to match a 235B LVLM and delivers markedly stronger end-to-end correction.

However, central agents often suffer from unstable long-horizon collaboration due to the lack of memory management, leading to context bloat, error accumulation, and poor cross-task generalization. To address both task-level memory inefficiency and the inability to reuse coordination experience, we propose StackPlanner, a hierarchical multi-agent framework with explicit memory control. StackPlanner addresses these challenges by decoupling high-level coordination from subtask execution with active task-level memory control, and by learning to retrieve and exploit reusable coordination experience via structured experience memory and reinforcement learning. Experiments on multiple deep-search and agent system benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling reliable long-horizon multi-agent collaboration.", "AI": {"tldr": "StackPlanner\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5185\u5b58\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u7ecf\u9a8c\u590d\u7528\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ba1\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e2d\u592e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u5bfc\u81f4\u957f\u671f\u534f\u4f5c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u81a8\u80c0\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u7d2f\u79ef\u548c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStackPlanner\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u5185\u5b58\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u9ad8\u5c42\u534f\u8c03\u4e0e\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u590d\u7528\u534f\u8c03\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cStackPlanner\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u957f\u671f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "StackPlanner\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u5185\u5b58\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u7ecf\u9a8c\u590d\u7528\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u957f\u671f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Real-time strategy (RTS) games serve as an ideal testbed for evaluating these two capabilities, as their inherent gameplay requires both macro-level strategic planning and micro-level tactical adaptation and action execution. Existing RTS game-based environments either suffer from relatively high computational demands or lack support for textual observations, which has constrained the use of RTS games for LLM evaluation. Motivated by this, we present TowerMind, a novel environment grounded in the tower defense (TD) subgenre of RTS games. TowerMind preserves the key evaluation strengths of RTS games for assessing LLMs, while featuring low computational demands and a multimodal observation space, including pixel-based, textual, and structured game-state representations. In addition, TowerMind supports the evaluation of model hallucination and provides a high degree of customizability. We design five benchmark levels to evaluate several widely used LLMs under different multimodal input settings. The results reveal a clear performance gap between LLMs and human experts across both capability and hallucination dimensions. The experiments further highlight key limitations in LLM behavior, such as inadequate planning validation, a lack of multifinality in decision-making, and inefficient action use. We also evaluate two classic reinforcement learning algorithms: Ape-X DQN and PPO. By offering a lightweight and multimodal design, TowerMind complements the existing RTS game-based environment landscape and introduces a new benchmark for the AI agent field.

Yet, most embodied AI research overlooks this, assuming instructions are clear and focusing on execution rather than confirmation. To address this critical safety gap, we are the first to define Open-Vocabulary 3D Instruction Ambiguity Detection, a fundamental new task where a model must determine if a command has a single, unambiguous meaning within a given 3D scene. To support this research, we build Ambi3D, the large-scale benchmark for this task, featuring over 700 diverse 3D scenes and around 22k instructions. Our analysis reveals a surprising limitation: state-of-the-art 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to reliably determine if an instruction is ambiguous. To address this challenge, we propose AmbiVer, a two-stage framework that collects explicit visual evidence from multiple views and uses it to guide an vision-language model (VLM) in judging instruction ambiguity.

Current detection methods often struggle to generalize to unseen generative models, and the rapid evolution of generative techniques continuously exacerbates this challenge. Without adaptability, detection models risk becoming ineffective in real-world applications. To address this critical issue, we propose a novel three-stage domain continual learning framework designed for continuous adaptation to evolving generative models. In the first stage, we employ a strategic parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach to develop a transferable offline detection model with strong generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, the second stage integrates unseen data streams into a continual learning process. To efficiently learn from limited samples of novel generated models and mitigate overfitting, we design a data augmentation chain with progressively increasing complexity. Furthermore, we leverage the Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) method to approximate the Hessian and alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Finally, the third stage utilizes a linear interpolation strategy based on Linear Mode Connectivity, effectively capturing commonalities across diverse generative models and further enhancing overall performance. We establish a comprehensive benchmark of 27 generative models, including GANs, deepfakes, and diffusion models, chronologically structured up to August 2024 to simulate real-world scenarios.

While various approaches have emerged for this task, they face inherent trade-offs: rule-based methods often struggle to satisfy code safety and idiomaticity requirements, while LLM-based methods frequently fail to generate semantically equivalent Rust code, due to the heavy dependencies of modules across the entire codebase. Recent studies have revealed that both solutions are limited to small-scale programs. In this paper, we propose EvoC2Rust, an automated framework for converting complete C projects to equivalent Rust ones. EvoC2Rust employs a skeleton-guided translation strategy for project-level translation. The pipeline consists of three stages: 1) it first decomposes the C project into functional modules, employs a feature-mapping-enhanced LLM to transform definitions and macros, and generates type-checked function stubs, which form a compilable Rust skeleton; 2) it then incrementally translates functions, replacing the corresponding stub placeholders; 3) finally, it repairs compilation errors by integrating LLM and static analysis. Through evolutionary augmentation, EvoC2Rust combines the advantages of both rule-based and LLM-based solutions. Our evaluation on open-source benchmarks and six industrial projects demonstrates the superior performance of EvoC2Rust in project-level C-to-Rust translation. The results show that our approach outperforms the strongest LLM-based baseline by 17.24% in syntax accuracy and 14.32% in semantic accuracy, while also achieving a 43.59% higher code safety rate than the best rule-based tool.", "AI": {"tldr": "EvoC2Rust\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9aa8\u67b6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8fdb\u5316\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u5b8c\u6210C\u5230Rust\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u7ea7\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709C\u5230Rust\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u60ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u6548\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "method": "EvoC2Rust\u91c7\u7528\u9aa8\u67b6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5206\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\uff1a\u6a21\u5757\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u9aa8\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u3001\u51fd\u6570\u589e\u91cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f16\u8bd1\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u590d\u3002", "result": "EvoC2Rust\u5728\u8bed\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u6bd4\u6700\u5f3aLLM\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u534717.24%\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u534714.32%\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u89c4\u5219\u5de5\u5177\u9ad843.59%\u3002", "conclusion": "EvoC2Rust\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u9879\u76ee\u7ea7C\u5230Rust\u8f6c\u6362\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

It then applies differentiated optimization strategies to Gaussian models with varying degrees of significance, thereby significantly improving the model convergence rate.

While this bias is beneficial for texture-rich natural images, it often degrades performance on shape-dominant data such as illustrations and sketches. Although prior work has proposed shape-biased models to mitigate this issue, these approaches lack a quantitative metric for identifying which datasets would actually benefit from such modifications. To address this gap, we propose a data-driven metric that quantifies the shape-texture balance of a dataset by computing the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) between each image's luminance channel and its L0-smoothed counterpart. Building on this metric, we further introduce a computationally efficient adaptation method that promotes shape bias by modifying the dilation of max-pooling operations while keeping convolutional weights frozen. Experimental results show that this approach consistently improves classification accuracy on shape-dominant datasets, particularly in low-data regimes where full fine-tuning is impractical, requiring training only the final classification layer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u91cf\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5f62\u72b6-\u7eb9\u7406\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u6700\u5927\u6c60\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u81a8\u80c0\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5f62\u72b6\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5f62\u72b6\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CNN\uff09\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u7eb9\u7406\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u662f\u6709\u76ca\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5f62\u72b6\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u63d2\u56fe\u548c\u8349\u56fe\uff09\u4e0a\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u54ea\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u771f\u6b63\u9700\u8981\u5f62\u72b6\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6307\u6570\uff08SSIM\uff09\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5f62\u72b6-\u7eb9\u7406\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u6700\u5927\u6c60\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u81a8\u80c0\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5f62\u72b6\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5377\u79ef\u6743\u91cd\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f62\u72b6\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6307\u6807\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5f62\u72b6-\u7eb9\u7406\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u6700\u5927\u6c60\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u81a8\u80c0\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5f62\u72b6\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u5f62\u72b6\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

This reasoning unfaithfulness frequently manifests as hallucinated entities, mis-grounded relations, skipped steps, and over-specified reasoning. Existing preference-based approaches, typically relying on textual perturbations or answer-conditioned rationales, fail to address this challenge as they allow models to exploit language priors to bypass visual grounding. To address this, we propose SceneAlign, a framework that leverages scene graphs as structured visual information to perform controllable structural interventions. By identifying reasoning-critical nodes and perturbing them through four targeted strategies that mimic typical grounding failures, SceneAlign constructs hard negative rationales that remain linguistically plausible but are grounded in inaccurate visual facts. These contrastive pairs are used in Direct Preference Optimization to steer models toward fine-grained, structure-faithful reasoning.

Most gait models strive to implicitly learn the common traits across different gait conditions in a data-driven manner to pull different gait conditions closer for recognition. However, relatively few studies have explicitly explored the inherent relations between different gait conditions. For this purpose, we attempt to establish connections among different gait conditions and propose a new perspective to achieve gait recognition: variations in different gait conditions can be approximately viewed as a combination of geometric transformations. In this case, all we need is to determine the types of geometric transformations and achieve geometric invariance, then identity invariance naturally follows. As an initial attempt, we explore three common geometric transformations (i.e., Reflect, Rotate, and Scale) and design a $\\mathcal{R}$eflect-$\\mathcal{R}$otate-$\\mathcal{S}$cale invariance learning framework, named ${\\mathcal{RRS}}$-Gait. Specifically, it first flexibly adjusts the convolution kernel based on the specific geometric transformations to achieve approximate feature equivariance. Then these three equivariant-aware features are respectively fed into a global pooling operation for final invariance-aware learning.

However, VLMs are inherently trained as generalist models, lacking specialized understanding of driving-specific reasoning in 3D space and time. When applied to autonomous driving, these models struggle to establish structured spatial-temporal representations that capture geometric relationships, scene context, and motion patterns critical for safe trajectory planning. To address these limitations, we propose SGDrive, a novel framework that explicitly structures the VLM's representation learning around driving-specific knowledge hierarchies. Built upon a pre-trained VLM backbone, SGDrive decomposes driving understanding into a scene-agent-goal hierarchy that mirrors human driving cognition: drivers first perceive the overall environment (scene context), then attend to safety-critical agents and their behaviors, and finally formulate short-term goals before executing actions. This hierarchical decomposition provides the structured spatial-temporal representation that generalist VLMs lack, integrating multi-level information into a compact yet comprehensive format for trajectory planning.

Due to the need for precise and complex visual reasoning, automated chart understanding poses a significant challenge to existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Many MLLMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) face the challenge of credit assignment. Their advantage estimation, typically performed at the trajectory level, cannot distinguish between correct and incorrect reasoning steps within a single generated response. To address this limitation, we introduce SketchVL, a novel MLLM that optimized with FinePO, a new RL algorithm designed for fine-grained credit assignment within each trajectory. SketchVL's methodology involves drawing its intermediate reasoning steps as markers on the image and feeding the annotated image back to itself, creating a robust, multi-step reasoning process. During training, the FinePO algorithm leverages a Fine-grained Process Reward Model (FinePRM) to score each drawing action within a trajectory, thereby precisely assigning credit for each step. This mechanism allows FinePO to more strongly reward correct tokens when a trajectory is globally successful, and more heavily penalize incorrect tokens when the trajectory is globally suboptimal, thus achieving fine-grained reinforcement signals. Experiments show that SketchVL learns to align its step-level behavior with the FinePRM, achieving an average performance gain of 7.23\\% over its base model across chart datasets, natural image datasets, and mathematics, providing a promising new direction for training powerful reasoning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "SketchVL\u901a\u8fc7FinePO\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347MLLMs\u5728\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u56e0\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u8db3\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u6b63\u786e\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "SketchVL\u91c7\u7528FinePO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528FinePRM\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ed8\u56fe\u52a8\u4f5c\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f68\u8ff9\u5185\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSketchVL\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53477.23%\u3002", "conclusion": "SketchVL\u7ed3\u5408FinePO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Current approaches primarily exploit only final-layer representations, while training-free methods require multiple forward passes or backpropagation.

We demonstrate that high-quality face images exhibit stable feature refinement trajectories across blocks, while degraded images show erratic transformations. Our method computes Euclidean distances between L2-normalized patch embeddings from consecutive transformer blocks and aggregates them into image-level quality scores. We empirically validate this correlation on a quality-labeled synthetic dataset with controlled degradation levels. Unlike existing training-free approaches, ViTNT-FIQA requires only a single forward pass without backpropagation or architectural modifications.

To tackle the complex yet highly practical problem while overcoming the existing limitations of feature recovery, representation disentanglement, and label semantics modeling, we propose an Adaptive Disentangled Representation Learning method (ADRL). ADRL achieves robust view completion by propagating feature-level affinity across modalities with neighborhood awareness, and reinforces reconstruction effectiveness by leveraging a stochastic masking strategy. Through disseminating category-level association across label distributions, ADRL refines distribution parameters for capturing interdependent label prototypes. Besides, we formulate a mutual-information-based objective to promote consistency among shared representations and suppress information overlap between view-specific representation and other modalities. Theoretically, we derive the tractable bounds to train the dual-channel network. Moreover, ADRL performs prototype-specific feature selection by enabling independent interactions between label embeddings and view representations, accompanied by the generation of pseudo-labels for each category.

In pursuit of a generation-friendly VAE, recent studies have explored leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as representation alignment targets for VAEs, mirroring the approach commonly adopted for LDMs. Although this yields certain performance gains, using the same alignment target for both VAEs and LDMs overlooks their fundamentally different representational requirements. We advocate that while LDMs benefit from latents retaining high-level semantic concepts, VAEs should excel in semantic disentanglement, enabling encoding of attribute-level information in a structured way. To address this, we propose the Semantic disentangled VAE (Send-VAE), explicitly optimized for disentangled representation learning through aligning its latent space with the semantic hierarchy of pre-trained VFMs. Our approach employs a non-linear mapper network to transform VAE latents, aligning them with VFMs to bridge the gap between attribute-level disentanglement and high-level semantics, facilitating effective guidance for VAE learning. We evaluate semantic disentanglement via linear probing on attribute prediction tasks, showing strong correlation with improved generation performance. Finally, using Send-VAE, we train flow-based transformers SiTs; experiments show Send-VAE significantly speeds up training and achieves a state-of-the-art FID of 1.21 and 1.75 with and without classifier-free guidance on ImageNet 256x256.", "AI": {"tldr": "Send-VAE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u89e3\u8026\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u7684VAE\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u6b21\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230SOTA FID\u5206\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9VAE\u548cLDM\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8868\u793a\u9700\u6c42\uff0cSend-VAE\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSemantic disentangled VAE (Send-VAE)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u7f51\u7edc\u5c06VAE\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VFMs\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u6b21\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u89e3\u8026\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "Send-VAE\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728ImageNet 256x256\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86FID 1.21\uff08\u6709\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\uff09\u548c1.75\uff08\u65e0\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\uff09\u7684\u9886\u5148\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Send-VAE\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u8026\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728ImageNet 256x256\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684FID\u5206\u6570\u3002"}}

While prior studies have proposed various approaches that primarily focus on enforcing cross-view constraints at the photometric level, few explicitly exploit the rich geometric structure inherent in both monocular and surround-view setting. In this work, we propose GeoSurDepth, a framework that leverages geometry consistency as the primary cue for surround-view depth estimation. Concretely, we utilize foundation models as a pseudo geometry prior and feature representation enhancement tool to guide the network to maintain surface normal consistency in spatial 3D space and regularize object- and texture-consistent depth estimation in 2D. In addition, we introduce a novel view synthesis pipeline where 2D-3D lifting is achieved with dense depth reconstructed via spatial warping, encouraging additional photometric supervision across temporal, spatial, and spatial-temporal contexts, and compensating for the limitations of single-view image reconstruction. Finally, a newly-proposed adaptive joint motion learning strategy enables the network to adaptively emphasize informative spatial geometry cues for improved motion reasoning. Extensive experiments on DDAD and nuScenes demonstrate that GeoSurDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Our framework highlights the importance of exploiting geometry coherence and consistency for robust self-supervised multi-view depth estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "GeoSurDepth\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u73af\u7ed5\u89c6\u56fe\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8054\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u73af\u7ed5\u89c6\u56fe\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bf9\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4ee5\u5f80\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5149\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u800c\u5f88\u5c11\u660e\u786e\u5229\u7528\u5355\u76ee\u548c\u73af\u7ed5\u89c6\u56fe\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GeoSurDepth\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f2a\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u589e\u5f3a\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u7a7a\u95f43D\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u9762\u6cd5\u7ebf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u57282D\u4e2d\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u626d\u66f2\u5b9e\u73b02D-3D\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u989d\u5916\u7684\u5149\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\u3002\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8054\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728DDAD\u548cnuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGeoSurDepth\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "GeoSurDepth\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728DDAD\u548cnuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing methods mainly rely on frameworks such as mean teacher and dual-stream consistency learning. These approaches often face issues like error accumulation and model structural complexity, while also neglecting the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data streams. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Bidirectional Channel-selective Semantic Interaction~(BCSI) framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. First, we propose a Semantic-Spatial Perturbation~(SSP) mechanism, which disturbs the data using two strong augmentation operations and leverages unsupervised learning with pseudo-labels from weak augmentations. Additionally, we employ consistency on the predictions from the two strong augmentations to further improve model stability and robustness. Second, to reduce noise during the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data, we propose a Channel-selective Router~(CR) component, which dynamically selects the most relevant channels for information exchange. This mechanism ensures that only highly relevant features are activated, minimizing unnecessary interference. Finally, the Bidirectional Channel-wise Interaction~(BCI) strategy is employed to supplement additional semantic information and enhance the representation of important channels.

Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a key diagnostic modality, but its effectiveness is constrained by operator subjectivity. This study evaluates a Vision Transformer-based deep learning segmentation model for pancreatic tumors. Methods: A segmentation model using the USFM framework with a Vision Transformer backbone was trained and validated with 17,367 EUS images (from two public datasets) in 5-fold cross-validation. The model was tested on an independent dataset of 350 EUS images from another public dataset, manually segmented by radiologists. Preprocessing included grayscale conversion, cropping, and resizing to 512x512 pixels. Metrics included Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), intersection over union (IoU), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Results: In 5-fold cross-validation, the model achieved a mean DSC of 0.651 +/- 0.738, IoU of 0.579 +/- 0.658, sensitivity of 69.8%, specificity of 98.8%, and accuracy of 97.5%. For the external validation set, the model achieved a DSC of 0.657 (95% CI: 0.634-0.769), IoU of 0.614 (95% CI: 0.590-0.689), sensitivity of 71.8%, and specificity of 97.7%.

However, most existing approaches rely primarily on spectral magnitude, implicitly under exploring the role of phase information. In this work, we propose Phase4DFD, a phase aware frequency domain deepfake detection framework that explicitly models phase magnitude interactions via a learnable attention mechanism. Our approach augments standard RGB input with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) magnitude and local binary pattern (LBP) representations to expose subtle synthesis artifacts that remain indistinguishable under spatial analysis alone. Crucially, we introduce an input level phase aware attention module that uses phase discontinuities commonly introduced by synthetic generation to guide the model toward frequency patterns that are most indicative of manipulation before backbone feature extraction. The attended multi domain representation is processed by an efficient BNext M backbone, with optional channel spatial attention applied for semantic feature refinement. Extensive experiments on the CIFAKE and DFFD datasets demonstrate that our proposed model Phase4DFD outperforms state of the art spatial and frequency-based detectors while maintaining low computational overhead.

In this work, we probe the layer-wise generation dynamics that drive hallucinations and propose a training-free mitigation strategy. Employing the Logit Lens, we examine how LVLMs construct next-token distributions across decoder layers, uncovering a pronounced commitment-depth gap: truthful tokens accumulate probability mass on their final candidates earlier than hallucinatory ones. Drawing on this discovery, we introduce Context Embedding Injection (CEI), a lightweight method that harnesses the hidden state of the last input token-the context embedding-as a grounding signal to maintain visual fidelity throughout decoding and curb hallucinations. Evaluated on the CHAIR, AMBER, and MMHal-Bench benchmarks (with a maximum token length of 512), CEI outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across three LVLMs, with its dynamic variant yielding the lowest overall hallucination rates. By integrating novel mechanistic insights with a scalable intervention, this work advances the mitigation of hallucinations in LVLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LVLMs\u4e2d\u771f\u5b9etoken\u6bd4\u5e7b\u89c9token\u66f4\u65e9\u79ef\u7d2f\u6982\u7387\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCEI\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5d4c\u5165\u6ce8\u5165\u6291\u5236\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e7b\u89c9\uff08\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff09\u662f\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aContext Embedding Injection (CEI)\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f93\u5165token\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\uff08\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5d4c\u5165\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a5\u5730\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "result": "\u5728CHAIR\u3001AMBER\u548cMMHal-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff08\u6700\u5927token\u957f\u5ea6\u4e3a512\uff09\uff0cCEI\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aLVLMs\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f4e\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6d1e\u5bdf\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits remarkable zero-shot capabilities, existing SAM-based methods rely on simple adapter fine-tuning while overlooking frequency-domain information that encodes domain-invariant features, resulting in degraded generalization under illumination and contrast variations. Furthermore, SAM's direct upsampling inevitably loses fine vessel details. To address these limitations, we propose WaveRNet, a wavelet-guided frequency learning framework for robust multi-source domain-generalized retinal vessel segmentation. Specifically, we devise a Spectral-guided Domain Modulator (SDM) that integrates wavelet decomposition with learnable domain tokens, enabling the separation of illumination-robust low-frequency structures from high-frequency vessel boundaries while facilitating domain-specific feature generation. Furthermore, we introduce a Frequency-Adaptive Domain Fusion (FADF) module that performs intelligent test-time domain selection through wavelet-based frequency similarity and soft-weighted fusion. Finally, we present a Hierarchical Mask-Prompt Refiner (HMPR) that overcomes SAM's upsampling limitation through coarse-to-fine refinement with long-range dependency modeling. Extensive experiments under the Leave-One-Domain-Out protocol on four public retinal datasets demonstrate that WaveRNet achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance.

Conventional registration methods typically rely on iterative optimization of the deformation field, which is time-consuming. Although recent learning-based approaches enable fast and accurate registration during inference, their generalizability remains limited to the specific contrasts observed during training. In this work, we propose an adaptive conditional contrast-agnostic deformable image registration framework (AC-CAR) based on a random convolution-based contrast augmentation scheme. AC-CAR can generalize to arbitrary imaging contrasts without observing them during training. To encourage contrast-invariant feature learning, we propose an adaptive conditional feature modulator (ACFM) that adaptively modulates the features and the contrast-invariant latent regularization to enforce the consistency of the learned feature across different imaging contrasts. Additionally, we enable our framework to provide contrast-agnostic registration uncertainty by integrating a variance network that leverages the contrast-agnostic registration encoder to improve the trustworthiness and reliability of AC-CAR. Experimental results demonstrate that AC-CAR outperforms baseline methods in registration accuracy and exhibits superior generalization to unseen imaging contrasts.
